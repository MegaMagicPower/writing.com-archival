            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night was cold and dark. The wind blew in ways that made the tree's rustle. It was one of those rarely cold nights in the spring, when a person would o outside and get scared at nothing. The type of night usually seen in the beginning of a horror movie before the introduction of the character who the watcher knows will b in for a rough night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rocky street in the middle of nowhere. An abandoned road in the middle of some trees in the abandoned edge of town. It was a quite night until the car screeched to a stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do Cody?\" Eric asked his friend as the four college students got out of the car to see what the noise was. Eric was 20 years old and the head quarterback on the college's football team. He was getting ready to lead the team to states and didn't want any trouble before the big game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I hit someone!\" Cody Taylors said, looking scared. He went around to the back of the car and looked in horror at the body he had hit. At 19 years old, Cody was a freshman in the towns community college. He had already been on probation for drunk driving the last time he went out partying. The last thing he needed was a hit and run on his record too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh...Is he dead?\" Kelly asked, moving her long blonde hair from her eyes to get a better look. Kelly was the captain of the cheer leading squad and had a body to show for it with her long toned legs, slender frame and perfectly curved body. She had a body most college girls would die for and was glad to be using it to make extra money as a swim suit model for local magazines. Kelly knew way better than to be out with them, but she had always had a crush on Eric and was planning on asking him to a movie right when they were done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not... Oh gosh this is terrible...\" Lauren said. Lauren was a smart girl with long brunette hair and glasses. She had a cute face and a nice body. She should never have agreed to come with Cody, but she wanted to make sure he was okay. After all he was her twin brother, and she had always felt responsible when he got into trouble. Still, she felt that she didn't belong in this group and never should have come with them. She had studying to do, and wanted to get in another chapter of a romance novel before bed. Aside from her brother she didn't like anyone else int he group. Eric was an idiot who always used her to cheat on his exams and Kelly had always been making her life miserable with teases and mocks about being a nerd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...What happened here?\" A voice asked from behind, scaring the four. The voice came from an old man who was dressed in a black suit. He had chin length grey hair that appeared to give off a glow in the dark. He also had bright blue eyes and spoke in a calm, grandfatherly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I think this man is injured. We were just passing by and found him on the road.\" Kelly said quickly. She may be a dumb blonde, but she was smart enough to come up with a convincing story. \"Umm.. Do you live near here? We don't have our phones with us.\" She said. It was true, none of the four had been smart enough to bring their cell phones on their joyride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I live in the big house just down the road. Please feel free to use my phone. I'll stay here and watch the body. The phone is right behind the large black door.\" The old man said.  The four all thanked him and began walking towards his house. Neither of them put thought into why they just decided to go without first asking who the man was or how they could trust him. It was as if the man had been controlling them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four moved towards the house the old man knelt by the body and placed his hand on the back. Instantly the body disappeared into thin air. The old man smiled. It was finally time to see what his newest demons were going to do with the world....everything was working perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, the sounds of faint screams could be heard by the demons, each of them wanting freedom from their curse...As they heard the doors to the house open, they fell silent. Maybe that time would finally come...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess this is the door,\" Cody said. The four had gotten into the house and immediately noticed the huge black door in front of them. It was easily the height of the entire house. It liked like it was made of obsidian or something and it was covered in weird markings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just open it, use the phone, and leave. This place is giving me the creeps!\" Kelly exclaimed, wrapping her arm around Eric. Eric smiled down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kelly. There's nothing to be scared of.\" He said and held her hand. Apparently he returned her feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a bad feeling too. Just open the door, Cody.\" Lauren said. Cody placed his hand on the large door, which immediately slid open. a gust of wind escaped from the door, which gave all four of them the chills. They entered the room, but found that it was empty... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the kids, completely unseen and unheard, a conversation was being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like, we've got ourselves some ticket's out of here.\" Kal said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that, baby? We can finally go back to having bodies again! Oh it's been way too long since we had fun. This is great!\" Billy exclaimed. Lizzie gave him a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait!\" she said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so there are bodies down there. Great. But what do we do when we actually have them?\" Jonny asked, not sharing the others enthusiasm. Then again, he had no reason too. After all the years of looking for a way back to his family, he realized that they didn't even care that he was gone. Now that he had the power to make himself a new family, he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the fuck you want, cop boy. Once we're in bodies we can all go our separate ways.\" Kal said. Not that he didn't enjoy the company the others gave him, but once he was out, he wanted to go his own way. With his new abilities he'd be able to get all of the money power and bitches he could hope for, and the last thing he wanted was for them to be around for it. If they wanted to stick around then fine, he didn't care as long as they didn't get in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're always gonna stay together, right babe?\" Lizzie asked. Billy responded by kissing her passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say we stick together. I mean, we've already been through this much together. I'd only be fair to stay with each other. We just won't get in each others way.\" Jonny said. the four of them had been through alot all of those years, and had developed a family like relationship with each other. they just wouldn't last without each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me, cop boy. Now let's go get us some bodies...\" Kal said. He flew down until he was right in front of the four kids who entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, some kind of Joke?\" The first one asked. He was a tall muscular guy with shaggy blonde hair, who looked like a football type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just find the phone all ready.\" a girls voice said from behind him. <i>Damn, what a bitch,</i> Kal thought. She had long blonde hair and a body that put all of the bitches her age he'd ever seen to shame. Kal saw two others behind them, but he didn't care so much about them. All he wanted was his freedom as fast as possible. He wanted, no NEEDED, a real body of his own. With little thought he decided to possess...</span></div></div>",

He grinned at his three fellow demons and then rocketed down towards Eric's body...phasing into him effortlessly. Eric's muscular body hardly convulsed at all, and when his eyes re-opened they were glowing red...and it was now Kal who was looking through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...this feels good!\" he said, as he clenched his fists and flexed his arms, looking down at his new body. It felt good to be wearing flesh again...even if it wasn't his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What feels good honey?\" Kelly asked \"Eric\" as she grabbed onto his arm. She was pretending to be a little afraid, but really it was an excuse for her to feel his muscles. \"Are you feeling okay?\" she then asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal looked down into Kelly's pretty face and grinned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm fine baby!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's easy!\" Lizzie suddenly blurted out, as she tried to decide which body she wanted to make her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, piece of cake, sugarplum!\" Billy responded, as Jonny just hovered, watching the scene play out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...who's going next?\" Billy then asked, looking at the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it customary to let the ladies go first?\" Jonny mumbled in his echoey voice, gesturing to Lizzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie just laughed. \"Usually it is yeah, but try telling that to Kal down there\" she said, her strong southern accent showing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an asshole!\" Jonny just shrugged, a fact Kal himself was already aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look,\" Lizzie then said, \"I don't care who goes next, I just want to get me a body again and I ain't too fussy neither\" she explained.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She might have heard him as she hovered quirkily from individuals to individuals, taking her time before she decided who she should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal smirked as he glanced at the blond girl clinging to his arm, it was very apparent that this girl, whoever she may be, is completely infatuated with his new muscular body. 'Eric' moved his arm around Kelly, brushed against her long blond hair and wrapped around her arm. 'Eric's' fingers then intentionally traced Kelly's ample bosom without any objection from the girl. Kal smirked, it looked like his lucky night, the night he got a new body and getting laid as well, he might not even need to use his powers to 'convince' this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked up to see 'Eric's' face suddenly lit up and he looked as if he had nothing to be wary of, the emotion in his face was just pure glee. 'Let's go somewhere with less... distractions.'', 'Eric' whispered to Kelly, as he tried to separate Kelly from Lauren and Cody who were together not far from them. Kelly looked up again at 'Eric', this time, with eyes lit up as she understood what 'Eric' wanted, however, before she can say anything, suddenly her vision blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry baby, no sex for you tonight.'', 'Kelly' whispered to the already enthusiastic Kal teasingly as she pushed away from the muscular quarterback. Kal muttered a curse as he realized that Lizzie had taken over his prey, but he kept silent nonetheless. 'Kelly' happily bounced back towards Cody and Lauren, she stared above where Billy and Jonny hovered, giving them the thumbs up, much to Cody and Lauren's puzzlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Umm... what are you doing, may I ask?'', Lauren asked, while Cody just frowned at the behaviour of their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nothing much.'', Lizzie answered as she let the siblings walk in front of her, so that she could check out her new body. Lizzie noted that her Southern accent had gone and the pitch of her voice seems slightly chirpier as well. ''Billy's going to love these.'', she grinned as she cupped her ample bosom. ''Hey wait up.'', she smiled at her darling Billy, motioning him to quickly possess either Cody to resume their fun or Lauren for a new experience of pleasure, before she skipped happily to follow the group.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jonny wanted to complain but then decided against it. It would be pretty hard to stop Billy now, and even if he did get the guys body, he would feel bad about not giving Billy and Lizzie a way of being properly reunited after all those years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly flew down to where the kids were and looked over the two un-possessed bodies. One of them was an average looking guy with shaggy brown hair and a plain face. He was on the skinny side, and it looked like he had contacts. It wasn't the best body in the world, but it would do for what he and Lizzie would have in mind once they were with each other in the flesh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 'vacant' flesh was a girl with long brunette hair and glasses. She had some very pretty green eyes, and had a good figure. She was by no means gorgeous, but she was very pretty. Definitely a good catch for any guy who would want her as a girlfriend. While Billy was curious how things would feel if he took that body, he wanted his reunion with Lizzie, to be a bit more...normal. He wanted them to have fun just like they used to in Texas and for that he needed to be a guy. Besides, it's not like Jonny would really mind that much. He's still get quite a nice body. And who knew? Maybe he'd end up liking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly slew in front of Lizzie's smokin' hot new form and pointed towards the kid he had decided on. Cody or whatever his name was. Lizzie smiled and nodded. She walked over to Cody and put her arms around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cody, why don't you come with me somewhere nice and quiet?\" Lizzie, inside of Kelly, asked seductively. Cody blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..I thought you didn't like me, Kelly...\" He said, stuttering. Kelly kissed him on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth would give you that idea. I really like you Cody. Now why don't you and I go upstairs, find a room, and have the night of our lives?\" Kelly asked, this time kissing Cody on the lips. As 'Kelly' held him in place, Billy came in from behind and phased inside his new body. Cody began to shake and spasm as Billy overrid control of his body. 'Kelly' backed away and watched as Cody shook violently, trying with little avail to fight the invader taking hold of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, his body stopped shaking and Cody smiled at 'Kelly' eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be a great idea, baby!\" He said embracing Kelly and kissing her on the lips passionately.  'Kelly' returned the favor and soon enough they were linked in a passionate embrace that drew the attention of Kal, who was disappointed he couldn't be getting the action Billy now was, and Lauren, who looked at her brother in complete disgust. She didn't realize Jonny, lowering behind her, getting ready to steal her body the same way the other three had stolen her friends'</span></div></div>",

The process happened so smooth, that Lauren's body did not shook at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sigh...'', 'Lauren' walked to the nearest seat, dusted the weather beaten leather seat before she sat, crossing her arms under her boobs. ''Now that we each got a body, what shall we do?'', 'Lauren's' voice sounded slightly hollow and detached, obviously although Jonny had gotten a female vessel, he did not mind much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the four could confer with each other, they were startled by the sound of the door creaking as it opened and moments later the old man walked in. ''Well... congratulations my 'friends', I see that you have chosen the bodies that you feel will aid you to whatever your heart so desires.'', the sentence ended so abruptly as the old man broke into a croaking laughter. The laughter was filled with malevolence, even the four of them instantly felt a slight chill down the spine of their new flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Old man, this is for you.'', Kal walked closer, to the old man, quickly clenching his fist and swung it to the old man's head. However, the fist which would have sent an ordinary old man flying, passed through the old man's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You still want to try that?'', Jonny smirked. ''He's probably more powerful than all of us combined together.'', he was not too amused with Kal's action, knowing that it would be a futile effect. The old man had been there since the beginning of their capture, although occassionally disappearing somewhere. The old man had always looking at them in a mocking amusement whenever he was in the house. The old man seemed to have a different power than the rest of them as well, much higher perhaps, as Kal just bounced back when he tried to possess him once, the humiliation did not stop him to keep trying though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heh... Never knew until you try cop boy.'', Kal grinned as he retracted his arm. The old man's head immediately returned to a solid state again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't care, as long as I have my love here with me.'', Lizzie grinned happily as she continued to stare at the unimpressive new physique of her darling, Billy. ''And so am I my love.'', Billy smiled back as they caressed each other, glad to finally be in flesh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As I said, whatever your heart so desires.'', the old man's dry and raspy voice came again. ''I have bestowed upon all of you unique powers... heh... heh... From here on, it's up to you.'', the voice was gone as the four of them noticed that the old man's figure began to grow more and more translucent before fading into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He lies...'', Jonny said unamused. ''He'd still be there somewhere, watching us...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't need you to tell me that cop boy, but if you would so kindly get off that body, my clones need an empty body.'', Kal walked towards Jonny, his muscular body of a footballer towered over the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Make me.'', 'Lauren' smirked, looking up at the muscular 'Eric' with a taunting expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, come on guys, the world is big enough for all of us.'', 'Cody' suddenly said, with 'Kelly' still holding unto his arm tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them then came to conclusion that they should know more about their current vessel, and to do this, with guidance from Lizzie who can alter and read the mind of Kelly, they reached the site of the car site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They're still so young, so unfortunate.'', Jonny sighed audibly as he rummaged through Lauren's files and IDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Would you like to stay in that damned house then cop boy?'', Kal mocked his friend's hypocrisy. Unlike his 'friends' Kal did not bother to read more details about his new vessel, intending to ditch the footballer as soon as he found a better vessel that he could use to gain more power, money and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look love, if I take over Lauren's body over there, we can be together 24/7'', Lizzie chirped. Although she contended by being inside Kelly's mouth watering body, her love is more important, altering too many minds would be too troublesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ooh... incestuous relationship?'', Billy laughed. ''New experience.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny ignored Kal's remarks, instead he pointed at a nearby sign post. ''There's a popular campsite not far from here according to that sign. We should try going there.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How far?'', Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''About 30 minutes drive.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kal cut their conversation,'' I say we....</span></div></div>",

Without argument, they got in the car and Kal got behind the wheel. \"So, I take it we're going to the camp site?\" he asked as he started the ignition and looked over at Lauren's possessed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good a place as any to start\" Jonny mumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lets go to the camp site, I'm hungry!\" Lizzie chimed up from the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal just looked into the rearview mirror and grinned. \"We'll be there soon enough, why don't you suck your lover's new dick while you're waiting\" he suggested. And Lizzie didn't actually think that was a bad idea. Much to Billy's delight, Lizzie unzipped Cody's jeans and got his cock out before leaning over and slipping it into Kelly's mouth.

Even if he couldn't touch the old man, he could still get rid of his frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably do something about that temper, young man,\" the old man said, smiling at Kal. \"I'm simply here to tell you something you may find important. Your bodies will not last you forever. Most demons have a few days at most in their forms before they start to burn up. I see you are heading to a campsite near here. I've taken the liberty of manipulating a few innocent civilians to going their for you to feed on. You will need to eat their souls to stay alive. Their soulless bodies will become your slaves and do whatever you tell them without question. It will also make them easier to possess should you require a transfer.\" The old man said, fading out again. Apparently he wasn't the type who liked conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we need to eat souls now? I'm not sure I like the sound of that.\" 'Lauren' said, putting her slender hands on her hips. 'Eric just laughed'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I like the sound of making any bitch I want into my eternal slave. Not to mention there'd be more room for my clones.\" He said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. As if we'd need more of you around.\" 'Kelly' said. 'Cody' just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just stop arguing and get to the camp site. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty hungry for a soul or two.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry too, and as much as I'd hate to admit it, a souls sounds pretty tasty.\" 'Lauren' said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get to the camp site and have our first feast.\" 'Eric' said laughing evilly. The demons got back in the car and started driving away once more. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man struggled but couldn't free himself from the vice-like grip of the demon, and his pleas were ignored by Kal and the others. Suddenly a faint glow began emanating from his host's hand...and Kal grinned. He could feel energy pulsating into him...and like a cork popping from a champagne bottle...the man's soul left his body and passed into Eric's, where Kal took great delight in devouring it. Pushing the soulless young man away from him, Kal then let out a quiet 'roar' and turned to face the others. \"God that felt good, you've got to try it\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was then interrupted when a Park Ranger's vehicle pulled up nearby, and out stepped the person driving it, a 40-something woman with her long blonde hair in a ponytail. She was showing her age, but she was still quite attractive, and had a body that was still in good shape for a woman her age. \"\"Evening folks, I trust you're not hear to cause any trouble\" she addressed the four demons, unwittingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us...trouble? Nah!\" Kal laughed, as he looked the woman over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Park Ranger looked over at the young man in the glasses, and noticed the 'dead' look on his face. She then glanced back to the four 'students. Before she could do anything else however, her body started convulsing...and her eyes rolled up into her head. Moments later, her eyes returned to normal and a broad grin appeared on her face as she looked down and started groping her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh fuck yeah!\" the woman exclaimed. \"A little saggy, but not bad. I bet she's got kids\" she then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends, allow me to introduce you to...ME!\" Kal joked, revealing that he'd sent a copy of himself into the Park Ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's pretty cool!\" \"Cody\" smirked, as the others all watched Kal's clone feeling up his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal then turned to Jonny and the others, and shrugged. \"Well, go find youselves a meal, I promise you'll enjoy it\" he winked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Me and the park ranger here are off for some night fun!\" Kal exclaimed proudly in Eric's voice, slapping the rangers arse firmly in command as she continued to grope herself. Jonny just rolled his eyes at Kal's antics. Being a demon allowed him to be even more of a lose cannon than he was in life. \"Remember to eat too!\" he shouted from the window of the car as the ranger spead them off elsewhere. With the dust settled, the three remaining demons just stood there, Billy and Lizzie still hand in hand of course. \"Well, where to begin?\" Jonny asked as he surveyed the dark suroundings of the campsite at night around him. \"I think this might be a good place to start\" Billy said after a moment. His attention was drawn to another car, which was pulling into the campsite and closing in on them. As it pulled up, the three noticed the passengers on board. Three sisters, two of them twins. All of them sported bright blonde hair and slim figures. The two twins looked to be around the age of 20 whilst the eldest sister was a few years older. They all had a family resemblence however, as well as trim, gorgeous bodys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, we're looking for camp site C. We're a bit lost and looking for some friends\" one of the twins began, speaking to Lizzie, who was closest. \"Oh my stars, twins Billy! I haven't seen any in years!\" Lizzie exclaimed, clearly amused by the sight of them. Billy echoed her sentiment as Jonny just watched the eldest one in the back. \"Erm...yea, we're twins. Look if you don't know where is it we'll just go\" the driver said, preparing to start up her car again. \"Oh no, you ain't going anywhere ladies\" Lizzie informed them, focusing her mind altering powers. The girls expressions just went blank for a moment as they all stepped out of the car and lined up in front of the demons. \"Wait...what? Why are we our here now?\" the eldest sister asked as they suddenly came to their senses again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jonny, shall we eat first or do you wanna go?\" Billy asked his demonic friend.</span></div></div>",

The Calhouns were much more aware of the situation however and knew that Lizzie couldn't hold the three girls there forever. \"Don't be scared Jonny, I'm sure it's pretty easy\" Billy noted as he reasured his friend of the task ahead. Lizzie just held Billy closer for his compassion, loving her man even more during his moments of compassion. \"Erm, excuse me but what are you talking about? This isn't exactly helping us out\" one of the twins suddenly said snappily, losing patience with the two lovebirds whilst they remained lost. Billy could see that her words offended Lizzie somewhat...and decided that now was the time to strike. \"Excuse me little lady, but I don't think it's nice to interupt a tender moment\" he told her, moving forwards the twin. Before she could make enough snappy remark, Billy grabbed hold of her arm. Startled, the girl brought her other arm up in self defence. Billy old grabbed that too, holding her tight in a vice like grip. Her twin sister was startled and reached out to help, only to be knocked back by the force of the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls could only watch on with Jonny and Lizzie as their sister began convulsing under Billy's touch. The three demons could see much clearer however as the witnessed the young girls soul being ripped from her body. Billy looked like her was enjoying himself as he absorbed the lifeforce of the girl in front of him. Eventually, she stopped shaking and Billy retracted his hands from her own, finishing up with a triumphant sound very similar to Kal's. It must have been customary. \"Well hot dang! That is just the great thing ever! Kal wasn't lying\" Billy exclaimed, taken back by the new sensation. \"Glad you enjoyed it my love\" Lizzie said, greeting him with an embracing kiss. The two sisters meanwhile rushed out of hiding to check on Billy's victim. \"Sarah, are you okay?! Say something please?\" the other twin asked, frantically trying to help. 'Sarah' just stood there however, devoid of any feeling and with a lifeless look in her eyes. \"What did you do to her?!\" the eldest sister pleaded. Billy and Lizzie had no time for sympathy at the moment. They were already putting stage two into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sarah is it?\" Billy asked his slave. \"Yes master\" she bluntly replied. \"Sarah, what are you doing?\" her twin asked, tears forming in her eyes. \"Billyyy, I want a twin slave! It will be like bonding\" Lizzie nagged to her lover. \"Sarah dear, could y'all please restrain your twin sister there?\" Billy asked. Without hesitation, Sarah grabbed her twin sister and held her tight. She began to scream, but with the nearest two park rangers 'incapacitated', no one could help her. The eldest sister, shaken in fear, tried to make a run for it. Jonny made sure to swiftly grab her however, using his demonic strength to hold her in place. \"No so fast\" he warned her as he pointed her towards the spectacle unfolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie bounced forward in glee and reached out her hand onto the other twins face. She, like Sarah, began convulsing as her soul was sucked clean from her body and into Lizzie's new one. The process was quick and soon she too was nourished. \"Yipee! Now I feel better and I have a twin slave with my lover!\" she exclaimed in delight. The other twin just gave a blank stare back as her sister released her. \"Holly no!\" the eldest sister sobbed, as she witness what happened. \"You might as well finish up Jonny boy. Besides, she's kinda bringin' own the whole party feeling\" Billy noted. Jonny took a deep breath and focussed. He too began to feel the sensation his two demonic counterparts had experienced, the soul being ripped from the older girls body and nourishing his own. \"Damn, that really is something\" he gasped as he let the girl go. She too, just stared back at him now with lifeless eyes. His slave for eternity.</span></div></div>",

So this is what having boobs feels like.'', 'Lauren' grinned as she grabbed her boobs, feeling them up. ''Love, if you do this, it'll feel much better...'', Lizzie leant forward as she slipped in her arms inside 'Lauren's' clothing. Jonny just shook his head and went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his extraordinary strength, Jonny strained all his muscle to lift the car, there seemed to be a limit to his strength. However, he did the job and soon found himself sitting at the front seat again as Billy and Lizzie took the back seat for themselves, to explore Billy's new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You missed lots of things just now cop boy. Pity they didn't let me join, they sure could use a cock.'', Kal grinned as Jonny started up the car again. This time, without anymore hindrances, they managed to reach the camping site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camping site was quite packed, with parents taking their children, teenagers, trekkers and even a group of students from a well known girls only college and their teacher came. The campsite was big, with a main multipurpose building, a building for accommodation, a decent sized indoor pool, spacious cleared field and a parking lot. A wide river also ran along the west of the campsite where various activity such as kayaking were taking place. Aside from the guests, there were also few volunteers and staff running the place. It was bustling with activity and everyone seemed to have their own activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hahahaha...'', 'Eric' roared with laughter as he took in the sight of the view ahead of him. ''The revival of my empire is at hand.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Probably I'll bust you before that could happen.'', Jonny went out from the car and opened the rear door.

With the group, there were also a couple of teachers which guided the group in whatever activity they were engaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly and Lizzie however were rather more focused on the sight of two lovebirds under a particularly gigantic tree by the river side. ''That's sweet..'', Lizzie said as she worked her powers to the couple and within the blink of an eye, they were making love in broad daylight, completely without a care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Should we join them my love?'', Lizzie asked Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Soon, soon enough...'', Billy responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Come on...'', Jonny sighed as he lead the group faster to the accommodation building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You lead us here cop boy... What now?'', Kal raised his voice impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We book ourselves some room.'', Jonny responded cooly.

''Remember cop boy, you're a demon now. No matter how much you try, you can never become human again.'', and with that, Kal's demon form whizzed through the wall and went outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny gritted his teeth as he acknowledged Kal's words to be true. Countless times he had also thought of revenge and destruction, especially towards his family who had been so easily forgotten about him, but his conscience never allowed him to harm anyone intentionally, not after he accidentally shot an old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What about you two?'', Jonny muttered silently without turning his gaze to face Billy and Lizzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We... are... I mean, I'm sure we can use a room... Right my love?'', Lizzie stuttered, although Jonny and Kal are always at odds with each other, confrontation like this never happened during the years of their imprisonment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why not?'', Billy gave a comforting squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny exhaled as he sat down on a bunk bed. The room was pretty decent, with wooden floor and minimalist furniture and decoration, after all, it is designed to encourage people to spend more time outside. As Jonny calmed down, he began to contemplate his life but two sharp knocks interrupted him before he could start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You like your room yeah?'', Jonny said to Billy and Lizzie after he had opened the door for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's okay.'', Billy said. He and Lizzie had swapped their vassal. Billy was now in Kelly and Lizzie in Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We're just going to go out.. do you want to come with us?'', Lizzie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No... no thanks.'', Jonny gave a faint smile as he shook his head and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''From all of us, his fate is the most unfortunate.'', Billy said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's true, we have each other.'', Lizzie responded and the two embraced for a kiss.</span></div></div>",

The four of them were fucking DEMONS, the least they could do was show off their power to the world. They should be looking down on humans and having fun ruining their miserable little lives rather than trying to act like them and only feed when they had to. Kal wasn't gonna just wait around while cop boy figured that out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal had ditched his host body with the others and didn't plan on going back to them any time soon. Those losers could do whatever the hell they wanted to. Kal enjoyed the feeling of flying through the air in his 'demonic' form. He couldn't be seen by anyone and was having the time of his life. He felt more free now than he'd ever bean when he was a meatbag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before the old man had entrapped them, Kal had spent most of his life moved around from prison to prison. When he was fifteen a group of his friends had been shoplifting and he had done it with them. All five of them were arrested immediately, and Kal could never get the rush out of his head. All the prison time in the world wasn't enough to pave over the feeling of a well executed crime. And with his new existence, Kal could commit crimes without even having to do the time for them. He'd just let his unfortunate hosts take all the blame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal didn't feel at all bad about leaving his little group at the camp site. Cop body would be free from the constant arguing, and Lizzie and Billy would be happy as long as it wasn't one of them who was leaving. Kal was sure they'd miss him for awhile, but they'd move on. Besides, maybe he'd pay them a visit one day to see how they were doing. It wasn't likely, but maybe Kal would start to miss them in a few centuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal stopped his flying and started to just hover over a small town he was flying over. It was one of those places that basically had a 'KEEP OUT' sign for anyone not from their. It looked like one of those small and contained towns, that peopled lived and died in without any notice. It was big enough to support itself with a post office, some bakeries, a supermarket and a few schools. It was the type of town that Kal himself had grew up in as a kid. It was the type of small, innocent town that was just waiting for a demon like him to come in and corrupt it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal floated himself down until he was hovering just above the street. It was very late now, almost pitch black, but Kal could see perfectly. Most of the houses had their lights off, so Kal could easily hijack someone's body while they were sleeping, and it looked like a bar had a few people in it he could go have some fun with. Kal wanted a rest though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like one of those rich people type houses, where the rich owners would throw a huge party and invite everyone in town to rub in their faces how rich they are.  It was one of the types of houses that Kal always dreamed of living in. Well now he finally COULD live in one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew up long spiral staircase and entered a large hallway with several doors. three of the doors were wide open. One of the doors had two people laying in bed together. From what Kal could see, they were a married couple in their early forties. The man was tall and muscular, while the woman was thinner with some nice curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room across from him had a girl sleeping in bed alone. She looked like she was fifteen of so and her room was covered in pictures of different bands. She was one of those innocent bitches that Kal would love to corrupt and take over, but at the same time, she was younger than Kal would have liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third room had another girl, only she was awake. The light was on and Kal saw her clearer than the others. She was about 5 ft eight and had a great body. She was wearing a tight fitting, white nightgown that was coming off her shoulder, partially revealing one of her large breasts, and her nightgown was short enough to give Kal a great view of well toned legs and perfect ass. She had long black hair, dyed blonde a little to give contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It looked like she was around nineteen or so. She was laying on her stomach, texting a friend with her phone, which Kal recognized as one that had just come out and was incredibly expensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was too good to lose. Kal hadn't seen a bitch like that fora VERY long time, and he wanted to do all sorts of stuff in her body.

It was not long before the girl's nightgown and panties fell on the floor and she admired her naked self, aroused at the sight that she should have seen over a million times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So Clarissa's the name huh?'', the girl smirked as she tinkered with her mobile phone. Kal was actually surprised that prior to being taken over Clarissa was discussing a complex calculus equation, which of course was gibberish to Kal. ''What the fuck?'', Clarissa muttered uncharacteristically, before she broke into a laughter at the sound of her own voice. ''With a body like this... hmmm...'', Clarissa said as she squeezed her bosom. ''Shaved pussy huh?'', Clarissa said as her fingers dipped inside her genital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal guided Clarissa's body to close the door, he hoped that no one heard his brief moans of pleasure earlier on. As Kal searched through Clarissa's ID, trying to find more about his current host, he began to miss Billy and Lizzie again, although this time was strictly for business. Lizzie was the only demon gifted with the power of altering minds and with it came the power to read mind as well. Sure he could ask cop boy, but he would have lesser chance than winning the national lottery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa rummaged through her bag, purse and drawers as Kal's quest for more information started, before Kal realized that Clarissa might have left her Facebook Mobile logged on. It was not long before Kal fidget with the page to glean all that he can, including the name of Clarissa's parents (Kenneth and Marcy) and the little sister (Anne). Kal also learned about Clarissa's friends. It seemed that Clarissa was on her 1st year in a well known and famous university, the Kingston University although she was on a break. Clarissa spent a sleepless night as Kal had fun getting information about his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bye honey.'', Marcy gave her husband and affectionate kiss as they stood on the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bye, take care.'', Kenneth smiled as he turned away, it just happened that he need to go for a business trip for an unknown length of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa, dressed back in her nightgown and panties grinned wickedly as Kal realized that he would be able to have so much fun with the females. Marcy showed no sign of working at all, while Anne was also in summer break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcy closed the door behind her, she beckoned Clarissa and Anne to have breakfast together, unaware that her daughter had been taken over by a demon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So how's college, honey?\" Marcy asked. The three family members all sitting around the table for a breakfast of pancakes, freshly made. Marcy was over by the stove making a fresh batch while Anne was happily texting her boyfriend. Unlike Clarissa, Anne had long blonde hair and crystal blue eyes. She had a slim figure with pretty good features. She was by no means as hot as Clarissa, but Kal could definitely have some fun with Anne's body if he ever got tired of Clarissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ma. Just worried about some essays I need to write.\" 'Clarissa' said. Kal had spent most of last night looking into anything that he could use to play Clarissa's life well enough not to arouse suspicion. One of the things he found was her planner so he knew exactly how much work she had due. Too bad for her, that Kal wouldn't be letting her have time for homework this week. Kal had better idea's for Clarissa's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm going to go get dressed. Remember, Tom's picking me up soon.\" Anne said, probably referring to her boyfriend. She got up from her seat, put her plate in the sink and quickly climbed the steps heading for her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get dressed to. I wanted to walk around town a little.\" Kal said, going to the sink and kissing Marcy on the cheek before going back to Clarissa's room. She locked her door and stood in front of Clarissa's full body mirror. He took off Clarissa's nightgown and underwear and looked at Clarissa's naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh yeah, I can stay in this bitch forever...\" Kal moaned in Clarissa's musical voice as he squeezed her breasts and ran her hands across her bodies many fantastic curves. Kal opened up one of her drawers and dressed Clarissa's sexy body in a tight black tank top, which was cut to give anyone interested a good view of her cleavage, a tight leather jacket, black leggings, and black 3 inch heeled boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal smiled at Clarissa's sexy reflection in the mirror, before walking outside of Clarissa's room and seeing Anne waiting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" 'Clarissa' said. Anne looked at her a bit oddly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you hated black.\" She said, confused. Kal smiled at his 'younger sister'. Even if Anne wasn't as hot as Clarissa, she was definitely very good looking. Her long blonde hair was hanging down past her shoulders and she was wearing a white tube top and an extremely low denim skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say I had a little change of heart last night.\" Kal said, smiling evilly at the inside joke. Anne just gave him a weird look. Kal looked at her with lust in his eyes. It would probably take not even two minutes to place a clone in her and let it hijack her body. The two could have all kinds of fun together, but Kal didn''t know how much time he had before her boyfriend got there. Sure, he could just handle him too, but Kal didnt want the extra work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kal was about to risk it, a red car stopped in front of the two. A guy walked out who looked like he was about Clarissa's age. He had shaggy black hair, a small beard and sun glasses that covered his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anne. You ready for our date?\" He asked. Anne looked at him, a look of fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" She asked, looking like she was about to run. \"Where's Tom?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tommy decided to dump you and let me go out with you instead. I'm Jack, his older brother. Nice to meat you, sexy.\" Jack said, looking over Anne's body, but surprisingly not paying much attention to Clarissa. He placed his arm on Anne's shoulder and took off his glasses, to look her in the eye. Kal noticed his eye was shining yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't you remember? We've known each other for years and you'd always had a huge crush on me. You've been madly in love with me since the day you first saw me, but never had the guts to say. The only reason you ever even went out with Tom was to make me jealous, and once you finally asked me out, Tom left you. But it's okay. You don't miss him because now you have me.\" Jack said. For a moment, Anne's eyes glowed the same yellow as Jack's before turning back to their original blue. Anne smiled and hugged Jack tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be great, I can't wait for our date Jack!\" Anne chirped happily, putting one of her arms around Jack. Kal looked at him suspiciously and felt a strange energy when their eyes met. Surrounding Jack's body was a different form, highlighting him with the grey body of a boy who looked about Anne's age. 'Jack' smiled at Kal, who just nodded, understanding. It looked like Kal wasn't the only demon in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it your Anne's sister.\" The other demon said, extending his hand to shake Kal's. \"It's nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal reluctantly shook his hand and felt 'Jack' slide a piece of paper into Clarissa's palm. Jack and Anne walked to his car, arm in arm before driving away. KAl unfolded the peice of paper and read the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Before we have a battle for power, why don't we become friends? Meet me behind the high school in two hours. We'll talk there...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Kal an hour before he found the town's high school. He wished he had Clarissa's memories, but unlike Lizzie, he didn't have the luxury of seeing into his beautiful hosts memories. He waited at the back of the school, and was in the middle of fondling Clarissa's breasts when the car pulled up in front of her. Jack got out of the car and opened the back door for Anne to walk out. Kal briefly saw the boys grey outline flash over Anne's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, meat bag, now why don't you wait quietly?\" Anne asked, evilly. Jack nodded and got back to the drivers seat, waiting. Anne began fondling her own breasts with a smile. \"I guess all demons prefer the babes.\" She said looking at Kal who nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right. So who are you, and how'd you know I'm not actually Clarissa here?\" Kal asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily. Other demons can sometimes see the outlines of their true forms around their hosts. I just happened to see yours as I was pulling up earlier. I gotta say, Clarissa is a fucking jackpot. I've had a little crush on Anne here for awhile though, so she was my target.\" 'Anne' said. \"My name's Kevin, by the way. I've been a demon for the past few weeks, but I already know my way around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kal.\" 'Clarissa' said. \"So how'd you do that thing before? Where you had made Anne think she had a crush on Jack.\" Kal asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my ability. Every demon has a special ability all to themselves, and that's one of mine.\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of yours? You have more than one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Every demon starts out with one unique ability, but the more souls you eat, the more power you get. I can also alter people's bodies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then how about a little demonstration, kid?\" Kal asked. Kevin thought for a moment. Before tapping on the car window for Jack to come out. He stood at attention, waiting for orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this,\" Kevin said, concentrating on Jack. All of a sudden, his body began to change. It morphed until it was now an exact copy of Clarissa's. Anne's eye's glowed yellow. \"Your name is now Clarissa Doyle. You have always been Clarissa Doyle and do not remember ever living as Jack. You will from now on act like her, talk like her, and think like her.\" Anne said before her eyes became blue again. The new Clarissa looked around and screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, why do you look like me?\" She asked, freaked out. Even though her body was souless, it would still act completely normal around others, so the act was flawless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop your screaming bitch.\" Anne said, uncharacteristically. The new 'Clarissa' stood completely at attention. Heer body began to change back into Jack. \"Now go drive your car off a bridge, I'm done with you.\" 'Anne' said cruelly, as her slave got back in his car and drove away to fulfill his command. KAl had to admit, he liked this kid's style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now sis?\" 'Anne' asked, eagerly. </span></div></div>",

Scanning the area nearby, he saw an man pulling into a parking space. The man looked far to old and sharply dressed to be one of the teachers. Kevin saw him eyeing his target. \"Oh, thats my old history teacher Mr.Campbell! I think you'd be doing a few people a favour removing him\" he noted. \"I'm not here to give favours! Might even come back for the class later\" Kal noted, trying to display dominance. This kid might know his way around the Demon handbook a bit, but Kal maintained the thought of being greater. He had always done so, in life and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hold up a minute!\" Kal shouted, moving towards the teacher in a very un-ladylike fashion. \"Excuse me Ms. Doyle, but on campus you address me as sir please\" Mr. Campbell snobishly pointed out. \"Whatever fucker, why don't I teach you something instead?\" Kal told him. As he was about to reply in shock, Kal shot out a clone towards the man. He stoped in his tracks, his eyes clouding over with while mist for a moment before he blinked and colour returned. \"And that kid is the bosses fucking power!\" 'Mr. Campbell' exclaimed, taking a look at himself before mimicking Kal's evil grin. \"Nice one, what did you do?\" Kevin asked, now curious. \"I put a clone of myself inside of the guy. He does everything I do, but of course, is my lackey\" Kal replied, informing the kid. \"Now, take us where we need to go\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, hop in guys...oops, I mean, ladies\" the clone joked. \"Fuck off!\" Kal cursed back once more with Clarissa's sweet voice. He and Kevin jumped in the back, taking a moment to fondle their new tits as they comforted themselves. \"So where we headed kid? I think you know this town better than me\" Kal asked. Kevin pondered for a moment before deciding on a location.</span></div></div>",

There was a soft thud as the boots collided against the wall. Thoughts raced in Kal's mind. The last thing he wanted would be to share power with anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I see you have gotten yourself a new vessel there.'', suddenly a raspy voice that Kal knew too well sounded. Kal jolted, quickly turning around to see the origin of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And what are you doing in here?'', Kal, still in control of Clarissa, questioned the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I do hope you remembered what I have ordered you to.'', the old man's voice suddenly became as sharp as needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I ain't takin orders from no shit.'', Clarissa growled as she jumped over the bed to reach the old man. Kal fisted his vessel's hand and swung the fist to the old man. However this time, unlike last time, Kal found that his fist stopped in mid-air. No matter how much he forced his delicate vessel's arm to swing forward and hit the old man, there was almost like an invisible barrier that prevented the fist to meet the old man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Foolish!'', the old man raised his raspy voice, Kal began to feel the chill on his host's nape. Suddenly Kal felt an enormous pressure originating from the old man's body and before he knew it, he was ejected from Clarissa's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal gasped in shock as he felt himself thrown backwards, flying through the air with his ethereal arms flapping. The shock did not last long as he felt a pair of hand grabbing his ethereal form, only to realize that the hands belonged to Clarissa and the old man was nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do.. what... I... say...'', Clarissa's pretty complexion turned sinister as she gazed right into Kal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The fuck man?'', Kal was never afraid of anyone ever since he entered the mafia, but this time, he felt fear again after so many years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why you haven't enslaved anyone?'', Clarissa glowered. In his demonic form, the old man may not be expressing much emotion, but it might be different for him when he is inside a vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, Marcy walked in and the old man threw Kal's ethereal form at her, which was absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wha...?'', Marcy spluttered. Kal was surprised to be solid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, eat the soul of this girl.'', Clarissa pointed at herself, before she slumped unconcious on the bed. The old man reappeared beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ho- how.'', Kal looked at the old man, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Use your brain. Doesn't matter what you do. Just will it.'', the old man's voice lingered for a second before the old man disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mom?'', the dazed Clarissa looked up only to see her mother grinned uncharacteristically over her body. Kal smiled, he would take this opportunity to keep his mind away from the old man's terror. He was still a little bit shaken from the previous encounter but the sight of a naked Clarissa laying on her bed somehow was successfully able to keep that matter away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heh... heh.'', Marcy grinned before she pushed her body against Clarissa's and began to kiss her. As they kissed Kal willed Clarissa's soul to move into him although he was a bit unsure but in the end, he managed to get it, as proved by the sudden submissiveness of his victim and her blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now tell all about yourself.'', Marcy cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal nodded as Clarissa began to tell everything about herself, but soon realized that it would be better to keep her as a slave so that he would not need to remember all the crap. At the beginning, Clarissa spoke monotonously, but as soon as Kal wished her to be a little more lively, she began talking like a normal Clarissa would, much to Kal's delight. She seemed also to be less submissive as she continued to play with Marcy's snatch inbetween her stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, a soulless Marcy also unveiled everything about herself as Clarissa played with herself. Inside Clarissa, Kal felt that his powers are getting stronger. A wave of pleasure went through his vessel's body before she orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal began to think on what he should do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at Anne who did not seem to mind her sister coming into her room. Kal grinned as he sent a clone of himself inside Anne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry boss, I can't do it either.'', the clone spoke as it twirled around the chair that Anne was sitting on to face Clarissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dammit...'', Kal cursed.

Anne grinned widely. ''No response here.'', she said chirpily, before helping herself another spoonful of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Name?

''Awesome rack...'mom'!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal fed on the view.

''Being a demon... now doesn't seem so bad.'', Anne spoke again. Kal eyed the clone suspicously. ''Don't be so alarmed.'', Anne spoke again, this time in a more playful tone. Anne rummaged through a richly decorated wardrobe in Marcy and Kenneth's bedroom, her eyes glinted as she saw what appeared to be a record of a bank statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look at this.'', Anne threw the piece of paper to Clarissa.

''It's really getting on my nerves.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcy nodded as she made her way to the bathroom, along the way picking up her bra and panties that was scattered on the floor, before whisking out a white colored towel and a matching bathrobe.

Chelsea Black was a step sister to Marcy and the result of the re-marriage of Marcy's dad to a woman far younger than him. Despite 15 years age difference Marcy and Chelsea got along well. Apparently she lived in a much more lively city as a volunteer in the local hospice while she studied. Not that she needed to try hard to land herself in a job as their parents are quite wealthy and had connection to offices and industries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are we waiting for?!'', Anne squaled with glee at the prospect of getting a better body to inhabit. Clarissa rubbed her hands, something that Kal always did when things are going his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes..'', Marcy said timidly as she excused herself. However, Anne stopped her from closing the bathroom door. ''I want more.'', Anne smirked as she stripped off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueals of pleasure muffled by the sound rapid water droplets hitting the floor sounded throughout the bathroom as Kal spent the time contemplating his next move. The demonic power would give him more than enough help for his conquest of power, money and women and lots of them, maybe perhaps a new masculine body for him. Kal shook the idea off, as a demon, physical does not matter much, he could have a more permanent female host as well. With the seductive charm of a female, Kal reckoned he would be able to achieve his goals faster as he remembered about the dispute of his underlings over a common whore. If it failed, Kal would still be able to use sex as an incentive. Kal briefly de-possessed Clarissa and hovered above her, admiring her features, she and countless others would serve his purpose very well. Kal smirked as he enjoyed his time slipping inside Clarissa's well endowed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's go fellas.'', Clarissa beckoned to Marcy and Anne as they walked out from the bathroom. Marcy looked tired while Anne, refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, it had been a VERY long time since his last drink and he needed to let loose after all of the shit he had gone through in that damned house. The bar was one of those small places that was a lot nicer looking on the inside than it looked like on the outside. It was relatively upscale, with a stage for live bands or other kinds of entertainment. The setup was one main bar in the corner with a lot of smaller tables spread out in front of the main stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was very early in the morning (or late at night. Kal wasn't entirely sure) there were very few people present in the bar. One table had what looked like a couple sitting at it. The man was relatively attractive and looked like he was in his late twenties or early thirties.  He had a thin mustache and worse a very fancy suit and golden watch, telling Kal that he was quite wealthy. The woman that was sitting with him was drop dead gorgeous. She looked like she was in her early twenties or maybe even late teens. She had one of those bodies that came right off the pages of one of Kal's favorite magazines (he had died a little before internet porn had become popular). she had long, flowing blond hair, deep blue eyes, huge breasts, a round ass, and a body that was perfectly sculpted. She was wearing a pink dress that was low cut and showed off as much skin as it could while still being considered clothing. Even without a physical body, Kal felt aroused just looking at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other people in the bar were an older man sweeping the floor and the barista. Now she was also a site to see. She had shoulder length black hair, brown eyes, was wearing a tank top and black leggings. She looked like she was in her early thirties. Kal could tell that she looked like she knew exactly what she was doing. Now it was time for Kal to take a body. There were three main options that presented themselves as viable since Kal had no interest whatsoever int he sweeper. The barista was attractive and Kal made the assumption that she owned the bar. Posessing her would give Kal access to all of this town's gossip which Kal knew from his own life was a very good thing to have.  Alternatively, that bitch sitting at the table was a total ten. He wanted her badly. If he possessed the wealthy guy she was with, he could put a clone into her and fuck her all he wanted, or he could just take over her and ditch the guy. Kal looked around one more time and made his decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kal moved his way throw the near-empty bar before arriving next to the pencil-stached man. He drifted onto the man's body, his body overlapping in and out of his outline, despite the man's apparent wealth he didn't have the mental fortitude to resist him as his consciousness was pushed into the deeper recesses of his mind, allowing Kal to take the reigns. Kal made a dry smile as looked lovely lady next to him and moved in to kiss her, moving his hands under her chin and behind her neck. The woman was eager, easily coaxed as Kal figured, and followed his lead, giving him a long, deep kiss. From an outsiders' perspective, it looked to be a sensual kiss of passion, however for Kal, it was far more cold and calculated. Under the guise of the kiss, Kal had been pushing his clone into the woman's body, the elation she was feeling clouded the control she was losing of her mind and body to Kal. Soon, the woman's posture and technique changed becoming more aggressive and playful with the kiss and body, Kal certainly knew what he liked from a woman and his clone could certainly deliver. The two met each other's gaze, assured everything had gone perfectly, \"Well Hun, what do you say we take this somewhere else. I'm feeling a bit selfish and I want you all to myself.\" He cooed with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back coyly, \"Oh alright, but I'm going to need you to do me a little favor when we get back.\" She said as she tapped his nose and got up from her seat. Kal soon followed, pulling out the man's wallet and throwing down a sizable tip to the bartender on his way out, it felt good to be able to throw cash around again. It take them long to find the man's car, it was the only one with a wood-trim finish after all, the car felt strange to control at first, moving the wheel and changing gears felt smoother and easier but Kal figured it was due to his power combined with the man's muscle memory. While he was driving back to the house, his clone was feeling up the woman's body in the passenger seat. Lulling the car to a stop at the entrance to the house, Kal got out of the car and held the door open to his now fairer half, out of instinct, and showing her in. He let out a giddy chuckle as he began to remove the man's tie only for his clone to hold out her hand to stop him from going any further. \"Now, now, you owe me a little.\" She said with a faux pout and cocked hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where have my manners gone after all these years?\" Kal teased in turn. \"And what would my lovely lady of the evening want of me tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know very well what I want, Kal. Neither of us are interested in doing the beast with two backs with a dude. I may be in a woman's body but I'm not a queer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal brushed his hand through her hair, \"I'm more than happy to oblige, though my host may find the end result less then ideal when we are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe playfully batted his hand away with a bemused chuckle, \"Like you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Kal said with a smile and a shrug as he moved to give himself some room. Kal began to focus demonic energy, like a pocket water in his body, energy began to spread outward, following the pathways along his host's nervous system and brain until every individual cell was permeated by his power. His body's temperature began to rise rapidly and his host's instincts began to sound alarm bells to try and correct this problem but they were quietly suppressed by Kal's will. What came next sent those instincts into overdrive, but yet again they were quickly silenced. With complete control of his host complete, Kal took the body and created focal points to bend and shape it. The muscles and and fat began to to compress down on his body as his bones snapped apart and reshaped countless times, the hips flared outward as the bones opened apart and curved, some of the compressed fat and muscle swirled around his nether regions as his dick and balls sunk back into his body. The flesh pulled and manipulated them until they became their feminine equivalent, with the remaining muscle and fat reforming to become a new womb and uterus. As his or rather her body hair began to pull in and vanish, her waist quickly shrunk and toned itself as her chest began to generate to orbs of flesh for breasts, so to did her butt begin to gain a bit of a cushion. Kal made the breasts jiggle a little as he finished them up, bemused and enticed by how her appearance was coming along. With the her muscle mass and fat gone, it was easy to tone her legs and arms, mending the imperfections on her hands and feet before applying a purple lacquer to the nails. Finally came the face, which softened briefly as Kal got to work bringing out the look in her eyes, confident, sensual and a little cold, the careful additions of eyeliner, eye shadow and mascara further accentuated them. Throughout all of this, his host felt a great amount of pain but even those thoughts were silenced. Soon, her brown hair began to pop, becoming redder and more voluminous as it trailed down to the middle of her back and put in a ponytail. Kal could feel that he had made this woman quite a bit younger, just slightly younger than her partner, tickled by this fact made in give her a few freckles, like mischievous painter admiring his masterpiece. With the body done, it left the now lumpy and ill-fitting suit hanging off her body. An easier to task yet, Kal pulsed his energy from his body, tearing his clothes apart before they began to swirl around his new form. The gold watch, shattered into pieces, flew to different parts of her body: one becoming a gold bracelet, two becoming a gold and ruby brooches, two becoming ruby earrings and the last becoming a gold and ruby circlet on her head. The remains of the suit hugged and tied itself around her body, bound by the two brooches, it formed a beautiful purple dress with a gold trim. Finally, her leather shoes became gold heels that kicked up the balls of her feet a couple inches. With his host's new form complete, Kal looked at his partner with a faux pout before lustful, dominating smile worked it's way over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone returned the gaze right back at Kal, \"I really do have fine taste. But why the crown and gold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but perfection. And only the perfect woman can pull this look off.\" Kal replied, in the now woman's commanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, how about we take this chat to the bedroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course.\" The two then sauntered the bedroom before locked the door and sat on the nearby chair, crossing his legs and sitting like a monarch about to pass judgement. \"Now then, strip for me.\" Kal commanded with a confident snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me make this clear: Not even my own clone is worthy to see my perfection in undress. Don't worry, we both know how well I can pleasure a woman.\" Kal said with a wink as he moved his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone only gave a seductive smile as she began the show, taking each article of clothing off slowly as she took every step towards her queen. Kal bit lower lip as he watched, when the last piece dropped, Kal took charge pleasuring with both his hand and tongue as the clone likewise reciprocated. Kal took a more forceful, dominating role in their pleasure session as was his want until their two hosts collapsed from a mix of exhaustion and pleasure.</span></div></div>",

Though he wouldn't have admitted it to the others, he actually preferred wearing the body of the female sibling, Lauren. Nonetheless, he continued on into the main room of the accomodation building and looked around. \"Lauren\" and \"Kelly\" were holding hands and kissing, getting some peculiar stares from the few staff and guests inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you people, never seen a loving couple before?\" Jonny asked the 'observers' in Cody's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal for his part just remained silent, glaring at the surrounding humans with distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be back in a minute!\" Jonny mumbled, then he went and approached a young staff member who was cleaning a table nearby. She was about 22 years old, and her name badge said <i>Naomi</i>, she had cropped, blonde hair (mid-neck length) and was wearing a grey t-shirt with the campsite logo on the back, jeans and a pair of brown hiking boots. \"Excuse me Miss, can you show me where the restroom is?\" Jonny asked the woman, who smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, right this way!\" the woman chirped, eager to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were out of sight, Jonny span the woman around by her arm and startled her, only to exit Cody's body...and phase into hers. The woman's eyes momentarily rolled up into her head and her body spasmed until Jonny had taken control. \"Hmm, definite improvement!\" Jonny chuckled in his new voice, as he reached up and grabbed his host's breasts, giving them a gentle squeeze. With Cody's body now slumped in front of him, Jonny put one of his now dainty hands on his head and expertly extracted his soul, feeding on it. The fire inside the possessed woman's eyes increased for a moment...then faded to her normal, emerald-green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go in the bathroom and stick your head down the toilet\" Jonny told his new 'Cody slave', just to get rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jonny re-joined the others, they all turned and smiled at him. \"Nice flesh you got there cop boy!\" Kal nodded approvingly from inside Eric's muscular body. \"Does this mean we gotta got us some new skins too?\" he then asked, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and be quick about it\" Jonny nodded, as he kept feeling the curves of his new host body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went up to a Latino guy in glasses standing by a wall alone. \"Hey buddy you know anything about smart phones?\" Kal asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually I majored in computer science.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal smirked on the inside <i>No shit, a nerd's a nerd no matter where he goes.</i> Kal thought as he handed a phone to the, while he was focused on that, Kal pulled out his soul while leaving a copy of himself inside Eric's body as Kal himself went inside the body of the man holding the phone as he returned to the others which were grouping under the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah good choice Kal.\" Johnny snarked before getting a handful of his own shapely bottom in the woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's definitely a downgrade. I think this guy's got an ulcer.\" Kal remarked before furrowing his brow, as he did he clenched his hands and shut his eyes, in doing so Kal's body began to change, he got shorter just slightly, his shoulders narrowed and his nose turned from a knuckle shape to a slender point. His wide chin narrowed and his cheekbones rose while his waist shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kal, what are you doing?\" Johnny asked in confusion. As that happened Kal's hips widened and his dark blue jeans turned pink and expanded, meeting in the middle the legs turned to a skirt riding up till the hem sat over his shins. Kal brushed his hair out of his face drawing attention to the black hair on his head turn brown and lengthen to bellow his shoulders, poofing just slightly curling over the left side of Kal's new face. His shirt shrank until it wrapped around his slender frame perfectly and turned a light pink. His chest grew and curved into a pair of noticeable breasts. After that Kal's dress shoes turned into high heels. After that Kal put his hands on the girl's waist as a pink sash with a big bow tied along her back rested on her perky behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This more your taste?\" Kal asked smirking at Johnny strutting around Naomi's body confidently with clicking heels announcing Kal's dominance in femininity over Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how are you even walking like that?\" Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal spun around on one heel before smirking \"I can mold a body. Even into a woman that's mastered heels, little boy.\" She said getting up in Johnny's face before blowing a kiss from her cutely rounded lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind getting me so of that.\" Johnny said reaching for Kal's body, before Kall slapped his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands off the merch, Johnny.\" Kal said sternly before going back to a smirk and fixed her earrings \"Wanna see just how good I am? Treat my like a real lady and I'll show you. The keyword there's lady. Not those tramps I know you've eyed in passing.\" Kal snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay than. How bout a dance?\" Johnny asked but Kal laughed good heartedly \"A dance? We just met.\" she remarked. Johnny rubbed the woman's arm in thought trying to make a recovery \"Alright, why don't we get a drink?\" Johnny asked and Kal giggled taking the danty hand Johnny possessed. Johnny looked at the hand Kal crafted <i>This hand's perfect.</i> Johnny thought rubbing his thumb along her palm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal giggled \"What are you doing?\" She asked sweetly with just a little suspicious in her voice. Johnny forgot what he was even doing \"Oh uh fe-feeling your hand.\" Johnny hastily replied Kal hugged up to Naomi's body, Johnny feeling Kal's chest press against Naomi's arm \"Do you like it?\" She asked softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's nice.\" Johnny answered nervously. Kal smiled at Naomi, and smiled. Letting a silence hang in the air Kal quietly relishing Johnny's timidness \"Anything else you like?\" Kal asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I uh your earrings?\" Johnny asked before Kal responded turning Johnny to her and planting a kiss on Naomi's lips.

Despite Johnny's completely incorporeal form, he still found himself shouting in surprise (and maybe a little fear, though he'd never admit that) as he hurtled toward the floor.  Remembering his powers just before he hit the floor, or, more accurately, just before he passed through it, Johnny stopped his descent hovering just above the hardwood.  Doing his best to ignore Lizzie and Billy's cackling laughter, Johnny floated himself back into a 'standing' position and observed the group before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he wanted one of the women.  Kal had already taken the bigger guy, Cody looked like a bit of a slouch, and Johnny had never possessed a woman before.  If nothing else, it would be a change of pace for him, and after all he'd been through he could really use such a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Johnny couldn't decide on which of the two women he actually wanted.  Not only were they both fit and pretty, Kelly in a more conventional sense while Lauren had a more cute and nerdy thing going on, but they were both clearly scared and on edge.  They new something bad was going to happen to them, they couldn't see Johnny or any of the other demons but they could sense all of the evil in the air.  Johnny wasn't sure whether or not it was supernatural or just natural selection, but it seemed like most humans beings had a sixth sense, the ability to detect impending trouble even in the absence of sight, sound, smell, touch, or taste warning them of it.  Right now, all three of the unpossessed youngsters were shaking in their boots as the demons' auras hung in the air around them.  Looking at them cowering at the unknown, seeing the indescribable panic just behind their eyes as they struggled to ignore their sixth sense, Johnny felt... guilty.  The other demons might have lost all sense of right and wrong a long time ago, and Johnny himself had certainly done some terrible deeds in his new form, but deep down in his gut he still had some scruples, and he knew that what he wanted was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal struggled to contain a giggle as he watched Johnny through Eric's eyes.  He knew the cop was a softie, but this was just ridiculous.  These kids had literally offered themselves up on a silver platter, they'd blindly walked right into the world's most obvious trap and were too stupid to just turn around and run out the door before it was too late.  This gaggle of dodos were making the teens in <b>Friday the 13th</b> look like rocket surgeons by comparison, they were practically asking to get possessed!  Looking at the broads Johnny was eyeing, but was too timid to make a move on, Kal decided to give him a little encouragement.  Show him just how little these lasses valued their autonomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly was easily the best at transforming people.  He was able to modify the people he currently possessed but anyone he'd ever possessed even after he'd left their body,could alter people's perception so that anyone who looked at the victim of his transformation would think the victim always looked like that and it was nothing out of the ordinary, and he could actually alter the mass of his victims.  That said, all of the other 3 demons (4 if you counted the old man's runt whom Kal had never bothered to learn the name of) had a more limited ability to alter their host's body.  They could change whatever body they were occupying into a body of equal weight and the change would be noticed by anyone who watched it or knew the victim.  That said, being noticed wasn't really a downside for what Kal had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGH!\"  Eric shouted, Kal forcing his host to stumble forward a few paces and double over as though in great pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" Kelly said, stepping forward and placing a hand on his shoulder.  Before she could ask what was wrong, a wing shot straight out of Eric's back, tearing clean through his letterman jacket and sending all three of Eric's friends stumbling back in panic and confusion.  Before any of them could react, another wing shot from Eric's back, its soft white feathers somehow reflecting the dim light of the cabin more brightly than it shown.  Eric's body trembled, its muscles and and bones morphing and shifting and changing color as his clothes took on a new shape around him.  When all was said and done, Eric was utterly unrecognizable.  In his place stood an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\"  Kelly murmured, her concerns for what the hell had just happened to her Eric temporarily repressed as the sheer absurdity of the situation sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal forced the beautiful face he had crafted into a cute little pout, tears welling up in the corners of its violet tinted eyes \"I agree on the holy part, but shit?  I don't think I'm that ugly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!  No, that's not what I meant!  You're beautiful!\"  Kelly quickly corrected, jumping to her feet.  \"It's just... you know... wow!  An angel!... uh... you are an angel, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the wings not enough of a clue?\"  Kal asked, playfully avoiding the question as he motioned to his long and fluffy wings.  \"The clothes?\" He asked, pointing to the thin, sky blue strips of barely concealing cloth and solid gold jewelry adorning his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The skin...\"  Lauren said, chiming in and approaching Kal like a moth drawn to flame.  Lauren gingerly placed a hand on Kal's forearm, her own fingers instinctively flinching back as soon as they made contact, as though they knew they were unworthy of laying themselves upon such a creature.  Trying again, Lauren touched the angel's skin.  It was completely smooth, devoid of any human imperfection.  No moles, no long hairs, all one color and with every pore lined up in perfect formation.  Even the angel's joints seemed devoid of any wrinkles, every inch of her seemed to be smooth.  \"God, you have perfect skin... literally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll tell him you said so.\"  Kal said, blushing the angel's cheeks and dyeing them a beautiful rosy pink.  He looked just over Lauren's shoulder at Johnny, winking at the flustered demon as Kal continued his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy sh-\" Kelly stopped, catching her mistake just before she could make it again.  \"You're an angel, Eric?  A woman angel...\" her eyes ventured south \"a busty angel.\"  She slapped her hands against her mouth as though trying to catch the errant remark.  \"Shit I didn't mean that!...  I mean they are... but not... I...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal was barely able to keep his laughter to a dignified chuckle, his mind wanting nothing more than to slap his knee and howl at Kelly's complete lack of an internal censor in the face of such bizarre circumstances.  Recovering, Kal answered \"Well, I admit that God has been generous with my proportions.\"  He looked down, pridefully smiling at the plump and perky rack he'd fashioned for himself.  He was glad he'd picked Eric for his host, the big guy had a lot of mass for Kal to move around.  \"As he has with yours.  Are you a model, by chance?\"  He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly as Kal expected, Kelly blushed and crossed her arms over her chest, feeling suddenly less confident in spite of the compliment.  \"I mean, I did some swimsuit modelling for college money, but compared to you... like, how is your back not all jacked up?  I don't see any bra under those cloth strips, I just see the perkiest pair of boobs I've ever seen outside of a porno!\"  She blurted, envy and admiration overtaking all reason in her.  \"Uh... I'm not going to hell for that, am I?... or for the porn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal shook his head, giggling.  \"No, you aren't going to hell... not if I can help it, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you're all being tested.  The man you hit, the old man in the road, this creepy house, God is testing you as we speak.  I've been watching over you all, disguised as Eric, and I believe that you are ready for this test.  If you follow my lead, and do as I say, you will all pass.\"  Kal lied, inventing his story by the seat of his pants as he tried to brush all of the kids' questions under the rug before they could stop to think about them.  Looking over at Johnny, Kal waited for  a moment to see if his troubled partner in demonic crime had been convinced that these suckers were literally too dumb to live.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snapping out of their apparent trance, Eric, Kelly, Cody and Lauren all suddenly decided against entering the house. They ventured back to their car and saw that the mysterious old man had left, and the body in the road was also gone. \"Lets get out of here, this is whacked out!\" Eric exclaimed, and everyone bundled back into the car and drove off. The old man emerged from the nearby woods moments later, letting out a sigh of disappointment. \"Oh what a shame\" he muttered, as his warm breath mixed with the cold night air. \"They would have made such wonderful hosts\" he lamented, as he saw the car's rear lights disappearing from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he turned at the sound of another approaching car engine. \"Ahh, reinforcements!\" he chuckled, as he stepped to the side of the road to avoid getting struck. The old man watched as a rented silver sedan came into view and slowly pulled over near him. The driver's window was wound down a woman popped her head out. \"Excuse me,\" she said in a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...foreign guests!\" the old man said to himself, before approaching the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to bother you sir, but we're lost, can you direct us the way to the nearest hotel please?\" the woman asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver of the car was called Liz, she was 30 years old and married, 5' 4\" tall and was 'well-endowed' with 30H breasts. She was wearing a teal-colored tank top. a beige, fur-lined jacket, a pair of low-rise jeans and a pair of black, chunky-heeled ankle boots. She wasn't the most attractive woman ever but she was quite pretty, as well as being well mannered and polite. She also had a positive attitude towards most things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the car with her were three of her friends, who had accompanied her on holiday to the States. In the passenger seat was David, an 'average-built 32-year old, he was a shade under 6' tall, had short, chesnut-colored hair in a crew cut style. He was dressed in a short black coat, a olive-green t-shirt, a pair of navy blue jeans and some brown hiking boots. If David hadn't have accepted Liz's holiday invitation at the last minute, it would have been an 'all girl's vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back seat, feeling a little giddy after downing a few alcohol beverages, were two more of Liz's friends, 27-year old Natalie and 30-year old Carly. Both were what could be defined as 'party girls', never one to turn down a good time, and they loved their drink, but they were far from being alcoholics. Carly was a petite (and very cute) blonde, 5' 2\" and with short stylish hair, C-cup breasts and nice curves. Needless to say she was flaunting her body in a very short black dress and a short-sleeved white cardigan. And on her pedicured feet she had on a pair of black and white striped, open-toe, stiletto pumps with a bow embroidered on the front of each. Natalie, some 4 inches taller than Carly at 5' 6\" was more modestly dressed in a black, long-sleeved top that hung off one shoulder, exposing a white bra strap, a denim, knee-length skirt and a pair of black, knee-high stiletto boots. Her shoulder-length brown hair was well kept, and her B-cup breasts were smaller than her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you young lady?\" the weird old man asked, smiling at Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...a hotel?\" Liz repeated herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm afraid the nearest hotel is miles from here,\" the man llied, \"and it is a bitterly cold night, why don't you stay at my house until morning, there's plenty of room\" he gestured down the road at some distant lights. Liz sighed, and then asked the opinion of her friends. Needless to say, Carly and Natalie were anxious to get out of the confines of the car and stretch their shapely legs. \"We'd appreciate that luv, thank you!\" a tipsy Carly shouted from the back seat, her accent even more 'British' than Liz's. Her and Natalie then resumed chatting and sharing drunken giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm for it!\" David muttered, and Natalie too nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Please, just continue down the road and you'll come to my house, make yourselves at home. Oh...and if you go through the large black door you'll find all the conveniences of home I promise\" the old man smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" Liz smiled in gratitude, before winding up her window and driving towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine my dear, all mine!\" the man chuckled, happy to know that his demonic friends would shortly be loose to create chaos in the world. And that...was the sole thing he lived for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I don't come back just assume the place is haunted.\" David said, laughing to himself at the joke as he took his keys out of the ignition and slid them into his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to make sure everything's okay.\" Liz said, giving David a kiss on the cheek. \"Just go check.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll be back in a minute.\" David said as he got out of the car and closed the door behind him. He walked up the large stone staircase that lead to the double doors at the front of the house. It reminded him of those old mansions he was always seeing in movies. He pushed the front door open and walked into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main room of the house was huge, with several doors attaching it to different rooms, and two spiral staircases on either side. David briefly opened every door until he had checked all but one to make sure everything was all safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only door left was larger than the rest by a good five feel. It was made of some kind of shiny black metal and engraved with symbols that David didn't recognize. He was getting a weird feeling from the door, but decided that he may as well check to be safe. He placed his hand on the metal door knob and pushed the door open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man smiled when he felt the door being opened for the first time in over 20 years. His new demons would soon be in bodies once again and his plans would be able to move forward. Over the years, he was preparing his demons for this day. They all knew that once they got their freedom, they would be helping him to achieve his plans, and they were looking forward to it. If it meant they could have their fun, as well as eternal lives of freedom, it was a small price to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man's smile became bigger as he felt the surge of power that came from one of his demons claiming a host. The old man laughed evilly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So it begins...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz waited in the car with Carly and Natalie for a good ten minutes before she finally saw the door open again and David walk out of the house. He walked to the car and leaned his head through the open window next to Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The house is all safe, Luv. No ghosts in sight.\" He said with a laugh. But it wasn't the kind of laugh David normally had at one of his own jokes. It was the type of chuckle that usually meant something along the lines of <i>I know something that you don't.</i> That wasn't the only thing that was off though. It could have been just Liz, but David's voice sounded a bit different too. It sounded like his accent was off. It sounded like there was a minor drawl on some of his words, but it could have just been from the tiny bit of beer Liz had borrowed from Carly while waiting for David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Let's get inside then. I need to stretch my legs!\" Carly said, getting out of the car and going onto the ground to do a split. Boy, when she was drunk, she really didn't care what people thought of her. Natalie came out of the car too. It looked like she had at least sobered up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for? Let's get inside.\" She said, heading up the stairs. Carly followed her lazily, while Liz stayed behind with David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong luv?\" David asked. Instead of being polite when he looked at her, now he was just looking at her chest, which was something David had never done before. Once he saw that she noticed, he stopped and looked at her eyes instead. There was something weird about the way he looked at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You're acting strange all of a sudden.\" Liz said. David just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\" He said. That nailed it. there was definitely some kind of accent in his words, but for all Liz knew it could just be one of David's jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lizzie...Let's just go inside with the others.\" David said, putting his arm around Liz's shoulders. Liz moved away from him and looked at him questioningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never called me 'Lizzie' before.\" She said. It wasn't that she didn't like nicknames, but the way he said it made it sound like he was trying to talk to someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I thought you'd like the new name. Maybe you'll like it by the end of the night. Come on, let's get out of the cold.\" David said, holding the door open for her. As she walked past him, Liz saw that there was a look in his eyes that she had never noticed before. A look that made it seem like he wasn't even David. For that moment, Liz could have sworn he was someone else entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz and David walked into the house, the three other demons watched from above as the tourists made themselves comfortable in the house. When the door had first been opened earlier, Billy had gotten so startled he had jumped right inside of the guy who entered the room. Before anyone could protest he was the first one to get a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Billy was also a demon he could still see and hear the others so they formulated a plan on what to do next. Billy had all of \"David's\" memories and immediately got the hang of talking in his body's accent. More or less. He still has his southern drawl on some words, but that wasn't a very big deal. The main problem was that some of the one's he was with had been drinking and the demons didn't want their first taste of life in over twenty years to be a hangover. Then again, life was still life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 'David' brought the others into the house, the demons decided how to move forward. </span></div></div>",

The alcohol would somewhat 'stifle' their first experience of wearing flesh in years, however, Lizzie could tell that one of them wasn't all that drunk, the one who happened to have the same name as her...more or less. Billy purposely wandered away from the three female tourists and got to talk to the still disembodied Lizzie in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whad'ya think sweet thing? She your type?\" Billy asked, contorting David's face into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you staring at her titties Billy, I ain't stupid!\" Lizzie told him, pouting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so what sweetheart, those fine titties can be yours once you're inside her\" Billy chuckled quietly, making no effort to hide his accent while he was talking to his beloved. \"It'd be a damn waste if Kal or Jonny were to get her instead\" he then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...okay, but she ain't even American, she's a dumbass Brit!\" Lizzie said, in a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all are babycakes, but what does that matter?\" Billy shrugged, glancing around him to make sure he wasn't being overheard. \"Just think what it'll be like having a body again, we can then leave this damn house and never look back\" he said, trying to persuade Lizzie to take a host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay honey, as long as its what you want too!\" Lizzie gushed, just as Liz came looking for David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, why did you wander off?\" Liz asked, as the atmosphere of the house began getting to her, putting her on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry luv, just checking a few things out!\" Billy responded in David's voice, his southern accent now gone again. \"Say, I've found something over here, you want a look?\" Billy then said, and Liz slowly walked over to him, her arms folded and the chunky heels of her ankle boots clonking on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Liz asked, looking at David. No sooner had she said that...a ghostly apparition appeared behind the unsuspecting Liz...and shot into her body from behind. Liz's arms dropped down by her side and her eyes rolled up into her head as he body started convulsing a little. Then a few second later...her eyes returned to normal...except for a red glow in her iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm alive again!!\" Liz suddenly exclaimed loudly in a strong, southern accent, as she used Liz's own hands to grope and caress her large breasts. \"I always did want boobs this big but could never afford them\" Lizzie then said from inside her host body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look great on you sweetness!\" Billy exclaimed in David's now accented voice as the two started kissing and feeling each other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the house, Carly and Natalie were tottering around on their heels in a drunk stupor, checking out every room in the house more or less, laughing and giggling along the way, and being stalked by the two remaining demons.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a few hours they'd be awake and sober, which would make them perfect for possessing. As the two slept, Jonny just looked at Kal and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we'll finally be alive again.\" Jonny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It sucks that we need to be two foreign bitches for awhile, but it definitely beats being like this forever.\" Kal said in his thick Brooklyn accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish we didn't have to rob those two of their lives, even only for a little.\" Jonny said, looking down at the two women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cop boy, what happened to being pissed at the world?\" Kal asked. Jonny just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand what my family did, but that doesn't reflect on these two. Besides, you know what the old man said. I don't even know if you can call being forced to eat souls and turn their bodies into eternal slaves a life.\" Jonny said sympathetically. This time Kal laughed at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I always liked that conscience of yours, cop boy. It reminds me of someone I used to know.\" Kal said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What happened to him?\" Jonny asked, interested where this story was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I killed him.\" Kal said. Jonny just continued watching the women. \"It looks like those bitches will be asleep for awhile...Let's go see how the Calhouns are doing.\" Kal said, phasing through the closed door. Jonny took one more look at the two sleeping women and followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled at the irony of his friendship with the former mobster. If they had met while they were still alive, it would have ended in bloodshed and hatred. Now it seemed the two were inseparable. Thee four of them had spent nearly three decades locked up together, and because of that they were all close now. It was hard to believe they might go their separate ways once they got their new bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man could feel the energy flowing as his demons got stronger. they were his weapons, his new toys. But one of them had gone wrong. He had given one too much power. He would have to watch that one carefully. His entire plan would depend on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny and Kal found the two lovebirds on a couch kissing each other passionately. Kal cleared his throat and the two immediately stopped and looked up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good Lizzie.\" Jonny said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like it? I'm thinkin' ah maybe makin' a few changes to it. Wanna do the honors baby?\" She asked Billy, who nodded and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this,\" he said concentrating on Lizzie. All of a sudden her host body began to change. Her figure slimmed down until it became the type of body any model would want and her blond hair became long and wavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work honey!\" Lizzie exclaimed feeling over her altered form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we all have new powers. I don't know how, but all of a sudden I just knew I could do that.\" Billy said. Kal thought to and realized he had an ability himself. He smiled at the realization. Jonny just frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have one. Who know though? Maybe It'll pop up eventually.\" Jonny said, shrugging. The four continued to talk until they heard to pairs of feel coming down the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz? David?\" A voice said. It looked like the other two were finally awake. And they sounded pretty much sobered up. Jonny and Kal looked at each other and smiled. </span></div></div>",

'Carly' stopped and looked at him angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're never any fun, cop boy.\" she said, now with a Brooklyn accent and slightly deeper voice, that sounded odd coming from her petite body. She just placed her hands on her curvaceous his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you two made it out in one piece.\"  Billy said with a smile, slapping Jonny on the back and laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for a second there, I reckoned you wouldn't get through, but now we've all got bodies again.\" Lizzie said. The lights began to flicker as a figure appeared the the middle of the four. They all immediately recognized the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you are all enjoying your new bodies.\" He said with a smile, slowly looking at each of his demons. To any normal human, they would appear just like their hosts, but the old man could see them for what they really were. To him, their eyes shined red and their was a faint aura around their bodies that revealed to him who each of them really was. Any other demon would be able to see them as that as well. And so would hunters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want old man?\" The human who used to be 'Carly' asked, staring at him angrily. the faint apparition of Kal around her looking like he was about to jump the man. All of his demons had the right to be angry at him. After all, the old man had locked them away for years, and even manipulated them into becoming what they now were. But for his plan to work out, they had to forget the past and focus on the present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you're help. After all these years, you have completed your transition from mortal human to immortal demons. IT is now time for my plan to begin.\" The old man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why on earth should we help you?\" Jonny asked, from Natalie's body. Unlike the rest, he did not look angry at the old man. He stayed calm and collected, realizing the tremendous power they had been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you all owe me for your existence. I created you, and you will serve me. Or I can simply send you into oblivion forever.\" The old man said. It wasn't a threat, it was a fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea. How about we kill you right now, and go on with our new lives!\" Kal said, getting ready to punch the old man. The old man just sighed and concentrated on the demon, who froze in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you didn't understand. I am your MASTER now. You do what I tell you to.\" He said. He placed his hand on Carly's head and her eyes glowed white. Carly's body stood at attention,  Kal's ghostly body doing the same. His apparition no longer glowed as brightly as before. There was a dead look in his ghostly eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course master.\" Carly's voice said, unquestioningly. Jonny realized the other Demon's said the same thing. All of them but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to them?\" Jonny asked. The old man smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all serve me now forever. They did not want to, so I took away their free will on the matter. they are still themselves, but they will unquestioningly serve me for eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you let me keep my will?\" Jonny asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you understand me more than the others, don't you?\" The old man asked. Jonny just nodded Natalie's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to create something big, and you are going to play a big part in this. Now make a choice. Stay with the other three here and work with them, or come to work directly for me. The others will still be demons and be doing what they wish with occasional missions from me, but I want to give you a better option.\" The old man said. Jonny thought about it for a moment....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, I'll go with you.\" Jonny said in Natalie's voice. The others could definitely take care of themselves, and Jonny had to admit, after being trapped with them for so many years, he had gotten highly annoyed with the others and needed some other people to see and other things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice. Now then, there is just one last thing to do.\" The old man said, making an odd gesture with his hand that Jonny didn't understand. After the gesture, something felt...<i>different.</i> Jonny wished he could place what the difference was, but he couldn't think of anything that ad changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you'll need to leave your host body here.\" The old man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I haven't even had a chance to check her out.\" Jonny complained, feeling his hosts breasts and running his hands over her hips. the old man chuckled a little. Jonny may not have realized what the old man did to him, but the old man knew that the Jonny he was talking to now was far different than the one who had made up his mind to come with him. The old Jonny had far too many morals for a demon so the old man simply got rid of some. Where the old Jonny may have taken good care of his host bodies and not want to violate them, this new Jonny wouldn't have any problem using his hosts up and then simply moving on to the next. The new Jonny also will have no problems feeding on souls, something all demons should do much more than only when necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woman you are now in is simply a temporary vessel for you. She was necessary in freeing you, but there is no reason for you to stay in such a woman. You can have anyone you want, far more attractive and wealthy females than the one you now inhabit. We'll simply leave her body here for the other demons to find and have their fun with her.\" The old man said. He had wiped their memories of Jonny and made them think it had only ever been those three trapped in the house. They knew there was another human still here and would easily have their fun with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. But just to let you know, I want you to tell me exactly why you want me as your right hand man.\" Jonny said, leaving his host and allowing her to fall limply to the ground. The old man snapped his fingers, and both he and Jonny found themselves in an abandoned warehouse. There was a large crater in the middle of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are like me, Jonny. Each demon I create has special powers unique to them. Your power is the strongest I have ever seen in a new demon. You can copy the powers of any demon you come into contact with. You already have Kal's power to create clones of yourself and send them into other humans, as well as the Calhoun's abilities of body and mind alterations. Not only that, but you can turn humans into demons. You're powers are beaten only by mine. You're the alpha demon Jonny. My greatest creation.\" Jonny was shocked. So he could do ALL of that? Jonny couldn't wait to try out his powers on unsuspecting humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be going,\" the old man said, \"There is a city not far from here. There are many different things you can do there to have fun.\" The old man said, fading out of existence and Leaving Jonny alone, still without a body. Jonny sighed and floated out of the warehouse, towards the city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny flew into the city and looked around at his surroundings. The city was definitely big enough to keep Jonny busy for quite sometime. The main part of the city had large apartment buildings and high end condos. There were several bars clubs and restaurants for Jonny to have some fun at. The other half of the city were small houses and a few mansions. It wasn't a a real city given the small and privet nature of it, but with all the big buildings Jonny could see how it got the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny phased himself through the door into a luxurious nightclub. Strobe lights were flashing and Jonny could see several strippers, both young men and women walking through the tables. The center dance floor was packed with girls in short tight dresses, and guys who looked like young business men out for some Friday night fun before the weekend. Everyone in the club looked wealthy and the wads of cash the strippers and bouncers were collecting only proved him right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slowly looked around at the leather chairs and tables. It was definitely high end club. The club was also very crowded, due to it being a Friday night and most people wanting a brake from their stress filled weeks. With the huge crowd, Jonny would have a hard time possessing anybody unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Jonny noticed someone sitting alone at a back table. He was completely out of view from the rest of the bar. \"I guess this is my lucky day,\" Jonny said, moving towards the table and getting a better look at the kid. He had short black hair and green eyes with some glasses. He looked pretty young, maybe nineteen or so and was staring nervously at some good looking girls on the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to stay any longer without a body, Jonny flowed into the boy, whose eyes started glowing red. The kid's body spasmed as he tried to fight off Jonny's possession. Soon Jonny felt himself gain control of the boys body, the feeling of the boys soul fading away inside of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny closed the boys eyes and began to gain information on the body he now inhabited. His name was Jack and he was a student at the city college. He was from a small town in the country side and had just gotten to the city to get a degree in law. The girls he was staring at were also from the college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His memories told Jonny that the center girl, an incredibly attractive red head named Laurie, was considered the hottest girl on campus, and Jack had a huge crush on her. If it weren't for the fact that she had a boyfriends, and his shyness, Jack would have tried asking her out. Jonny assumed that the tall muscular guy she was dancing with was her boyfriend, but Jack had never seen him, so his memories didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wh...who are you???Why can't I move my body?</i> a voice asked from inside Jonny's head. The sudden noise almost made Jonny jump up. That hadn't happened before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Jonny asked, in a near whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm Jack. What have you done to me?</i> The voice asked again. It sounded scared and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen kid, My names Jonny. I had to hijack your body for a little bit. Don't worry though, I'll be out of here soon enough. I don't know how your minds still active and able to talk to me like this, but I don't really care either. How would you like me to get you a sexy little girlfriend to pass some time?\" Jonny asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't have much of a choice do I?</i>Jack asked, apparently coming to terms with his situation and realizing arguing about it would be a waste of time. His memories told Jonny that his life had always been full of crap and that he had always secretly wanted something exciting like this  to happen to him. Jonny sort of liked this kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Now shut up and enjoy the show.\" Jonny whispered, getting up from Jack's seat and stretching his arms. The kid wasn't the strongest guy in the world, but he was definitely in good shape. If he weren't so shy and awkward he'd definitely be able to get plenty of babes. Jonny walked over to a lonely looking girl sitting at the table across from him and smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" The girl said, not sounding very interested. She had long black hair and blue eyes, and a knockout body that was accented with her tight black dress that was just barely long enough to contain her incredible ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You look lonely.\" Jonny said, putting his hand on the girls shoulder. She immediately moved away and gave Jonny an angry look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing, touching me like that?!\" She asked, getting up from her seat and looking like she was about to smack Jonny. Jonny thought he had lost his chance with the girl when he remembered something the old man had told him. He had the powers of the other demons in him. Jonny smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you just looked so lonely sitting here. It looked like you needed someone to make you feel better.\" Jonny said apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I guess. Just leave me alone.\" The girl said, looking at Jonny as if he were a freak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. What can I do to make it up to you?\" Jonny asked, innocently. The girl continued to look angrily at Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone.\" The girl said, sounding angry. Jonny smiled. If she continued to dislike him, it just made what he was going to do seem even more fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm really sorry about what happened. I honestly didn't want you to get scared like that. How about we start over? My name's Jack.\" Jonny said. The girl didn't respond. \"Hey, I know how to prove to you that I'm sorry. How about I buy you something to drink?\" Jonny asked. The girl frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not old enough to drink, and I don't think you are either. Please just leave me alone.\" The girl said, practically begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think I'm more hungry than I am thirsty. What do you want to eat?\" Jonny asked, ignoring her constant begging for him to leave. The girl sighed and began to stand up, patting down her dress, so it wouldn't give Jonny a view of her amazing ass as she stood.  \"I think I know what I want to eat,\" Jonny said, grabbing her hand as she began to walk away, \" YOU.\" Jonny said sinister, as he concentrated on pulling the girls soul out of her body. Jonny could feel the power flowing through him as her soul was pulled up his arm, and throughout his entire body. The girl had stopped moving altogether as her soul was being sucked out of her body. The rush filled Jonny with tremendous power and his heart began to race. It felt amazing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the feeling was gone and Jonny was breathing heavily. He felt like he could do anything now. He removed his hand from the girl, but she still was not moving. Jonny looked at her eyes and saw that they looked devoid of any life or consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down.\" Jonny demanded. The girl did as she was told and sat down next to him. Jonny put his arm around her bare shoulders and she did not fight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind me touching you anymore?\" Jonny asked. The girl shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, master. Please touch me as much as you like. I exist only to serve you for my entire life.\" The girl said, monotonously. Jonny got a rush from being called 'master.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about yourself.\" Jonny commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Katie. I'm 19 years old and I go to college here. I'm trying to get a career as a model and I'm currently waiting for a call back from a magazine that specializes in swimsuits. I have a boyfriend, but I can dump him at any time if you want me to. Anything else, master?\" She asked, her personality returning, but her eyes still blank. It only seemed like she was normal on the outside. On the inside, she forever belonged to Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell are you? How did you do this?</i> Jack asked. After being silent for so long, Jonny had assumed he'd just given up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a demon kid! And this city's my plaything.\" Jonny said, laughing. He patted his new slaves fantastic ass. \"Let's go have some fun, Katie.\" He said. His new toy smiled at him, revealing her flawless white teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, master.\" She said, wrapping her arms around Jonny's shoulders. This was going to be fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny woke up the next morning with Katie's sleeping form resting against his stolen body. Last night, he had his new slave take him back to her dorm room so that he could fuck her all night long, and that was exactly what happened thanks to Jonny's demonic inability to be tired. Unfortunately, his stolen body didn't share that ability and the mind of the kid inside of him was out cold from the fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie snuggled with him, Jonny looked up at the ceiling and used this opportunity to look into Jack's mind, find out stuff about him. The kid was a real loner. e had a really shitty family and grew up working for himself to raise money so he could pay for his own college education far away from his home. He attended a small private college a few towns away, but didn't socialize all that much with anyone. He wasn't exactly the type of person that made an impression on people, and he didn't even know very many people n this side of the country. As far as Jonny was concerned, that made Jack here the perfect home for him. After all, no one would question if a guy like Jack went completely off the map. The only issue was that Jack's mind seemed to still be functioning, unlike other victims of his possession. that could lead to potential problems and annoyances, and on top of that, Jonny didn't want to turn the kid into a demon. That would just make an unnecessary mess that couldn't be cleaned up. But then again, chaos was always a good thing, and Jonny could train the boy to follow him however he wanted before leaving him on his own. Maybe that was a better idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny then looked at his sleeping slave that was cuddling with him. Katie was certainly a nice catch. She was young, gorgeous, and it seemed like she had quite a bit of family money. Having her around would be useful, but she didn't necessarily need to be a slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of bed and stand in front of me\" Jonny said firmly, knowing that Katie would hear him. She immediately opened her eyes and got out of bed, stretching as she stood naked in front of Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what you see, master?\" she asked, striking a sexy pose and giving her best smile. Her personality was returning to her body more every minute, though nothing would change the fact that her mind, body and soul belonged to Jonny forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but I have more use for your body right now than just a show. Lock the door so your roommate can't come in here and then put on some clothes\" he says as he gets out of the bed. Rather than putting back on Jack's clothes from yesterday, Jonny decided to tap into Billy Calhoun's ability that he had copied. Suddenly, a black T-shirt, black jeans and a leather jacket appeared over Jack's stolen body. Jonny grinned. \"Looks like I'll never have to buy clothes again\" he said as he heard the door to the room lock and watched Katie put on jean shorts and a pink T-shirt. She then stood, awaiting her next command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny closed his eyes and concentrated on te sleeping mind of Jack, who started to freak out as soon as he felt what Jonny was doing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please...stop hurting me....ow!!!!</i> the kid yells internally as Jonny converts his soul into demonic energy before shooting it out of himself and into Katies body, which doesnt react since there's no soul inside of her to fight for control. After a brief spasm of Jack's soul connecting to the body, her eyes become tinted red and she starts to move. \"What the hell did you do, you...demon!\" she yells and then jumps as if surprised by the voice coming out of her mouth. She looked down and jumped again, startled. \"Holy...shit...\" she said, as she put her hands on her chest and then ran them over her body. \"This....this is that girl from yesterday....why...how...\" she was clearly confused, so Jonny interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and listen to me if you want answers, kid\" he said firmly, morphing Jack's body into his original one. \"First off, don't address me as 'you demon' I find it insulting. My name is Jonny, so you can either call me that, or call me your master. Second, I saw your past and I see that you don't enjoy your current life all that much, so I've made you a demon like me. You devour souls to make people your slaves and possess whoever you want. At some point you'll also develop a power unique to yourself. I don't know what that will be though. Got it so far?\" The currently possessed Katie nods before Jonny continues, \"Good. I'm going to be making your former body my physical home for awhile. It'll make it very easy for me to blend in with humans since I can use my powers to my advantage and no one will question your disappearance since you didn't know many people anyway and its not like your family will run looking. I know that's unfair, so you have Katie's body now to do with as you wish. I'm sure you have access to her memories in there for you to use. If you don't want her body, I can make you look like anyone you want. Just tell me. Sound like a good deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Katie turns to a mirror in her room and looks herself over. \"So you take my body and have your fun while I get to live as a super hot babe until I choose to possess someone else instead? Plus I have the ability to make people my eternal slaves? I think we definitely have a deal, master\" she says happily as someone knocks on the door to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Katie! Are you home?\" Asks a voice from the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot! That must be Elizabeth! She's Katie's...I mean MY roommate!\" Katie exclaims as an evil smile appears on her face. Jonny smiles as he uses his changing ability to make himself a bird and fly out Katie's window. Things would certainly be interesting for the new Katie, and now Jonny had a physical body that he could do whatever he wanted with. Boy, there were a lot of possibilities. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie stood in amazement, the little red dress Jonny had conjured up hugging her every taut curve.  Shiny dark hair cascaded down from her head, and her conjured-up dress accented her beautiful ass and her large, bouncing chest.  She stared at the gigantic, heavy-set black man from whom Jonny had extracted a soul.  She snapped her fingers in front of his face a couple times as she towered a good foot above her.  Nothing.  She whistled a couple times, and still the man just stood there, his body and mind a vacant shell.  \u201cHey!\u201d Katie yelled.  Suddenly, the man came to attention and looked down at Katie\u2019s tiny but beautiful body.  \u201cYes mistress,\u201d came his deep bass voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you get their attention,\u201d Katie mused.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she demanded.  \u201cDimbe, Mistress,\u201d came his baritone reply.  \u201cDimbe, Go assemble the kitchen staff and all the servers.  Describe this meat suit I\u2019m wearing, and then make sure that they know I\u2019m the one in charge around here.  They\u2019ve got to follow my orders.  Got it?\u201d the possessed woman barked.  She lamented the fact that she couldn\u2019t just entrance everybody into doing what she wanted, but mind control was not her forte.  The pacified giant lumbered off, his heavy footsteps clunking through the room as he departed.  Katie glanced around the stately office, filled, as it was, with glittering gold and silver antiques lining the shelves.  She strutted her sexy exterior about the place.  \u201cAll mine,\u201d she said as she plopped her generous rear into a comfy leather chair behind the big man\u2019s former desk.  She noticed a bunch of financial papers strewn about the place, including payments from mob bosses and even some dirty cops, often from waitresses who, it seemed, doubled as prostitutes for the right price.  \u201cI\u2019ll have to give a bunch of this to Jonny, but I bet he\u2019ll make sure I do just fine,\u201d Katie mused with a smile as her eyes passed over the numbers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere on the desk, security camera monitors showed different parts of the restaurant\u2014the main guest area, the patio, the rooftop bar and eating area where the best customers ate, and many other places.  At the moment, the place seemed well-tended.  Katie glanced in the mirror that sat on the desk.  It was still strange for Jack to look into a mirror and see a reflection like this one looking back at him.  He brought his dainty hands up and mushed his face together in strange expressions a couple times, getting a kick out of the spectacle he was making in Katie\u2019s body.  \u201cA woman like you once told me I\u2019d never get into her pants . . . who\u2019s laughing now?\u201d he said to his buxom reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Katie said as she leaned closer to the mirror.  She thought she could see something odd.  As she leaned in closer, she looked very closely and spied a few lines forming around her eyes\u2014crow\u2019s feet.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she said, trying to smooth out the imperfections in her skin to no avail.  She stood quickly from the leather chair, her heart suddenly racing and her body heating up.  Sweat began to roll down her chest.    She burst through the door and ran out of the office.  She furiously pushed the button to open an empty elevator that would take her to one of the lower floors of the restaurant\u2014the basement, in fact.  She thought she knew why this was happening, but wasn\u2019t sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator descended with heart-pounding agony as Katie watched her reflection age and decay mirror that was the back wall of the elevator.  This entire body was foreign to Jack, and he\u2019d tried to ignore the hunger much of the day, but he could no longer.  He had never felt a ravishing starvation like this before.  Katie watched in the mirror as the wrinkles upon her face became more pronounced.  There was also a certain swelling throughout what had been a beautiful female body.  Jack had the option of just leaving it, but he did not want to.  After all, Katie had been his first body after his transformation into a demon.  He watched in the mirror as her belly inflated into a kind of sloppy, gelatinous mess that pushed ungracefully against the dress.  Breasts that once bounced resiliently now simply flopped about in such a way that they almost fell from the dress.  Flab filled Katie\u2019s arms slowly.  And the drain, oh the drain.  Katie felt as though the energy were being sucked out of her.  She was so tired.  \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with me?\u201d the aged woman demanded of her own disheveled reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing!\u201d went the elevator, and the doors opened into the darkened room of the basement.  Katie emerged slowly and gingerly from the elevator, her body wracked with pain and age.  She now looked well past 70\u2014bloated and old.  \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d she said, trying to sound distressed, which wasn\u2019t hard.  \u201cI need help . . . \u201c she said weakly as she leaned against a set of wooden crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMam?  Hello?\u201d came the voice of what sounded like a young man.  Katie looked through older eyes in the direction of the sound.  A young man in a work uniform stepped out of the wine cooler, having apparently come down to move some crates of the good stuff into storage.  \u201cBoy, come here,\u201d she demanded, her voice weak.  The boy stepped into the light and saw her\u2014the frazzled, fat old woman Katie\u2019s beautiful body had devolved into.  The boy was Michael Winston, a young and very respectful fellow of sixteen years who insisted that he take on his present job as a way to repay his parents for the car that they had bought for him.  Michael was a freckle-faced, overweight boy whose belly stuck out before him wherever he went despite his efforts to slim down.  His smile was welcoming, and his rolls of fat let forth a mighty jiggle whenever he laughed which he tried to do often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMam, there\u2019s a first aid kit right down the hall!  I\u2019ll grab it and be right back!\u201d Michael said, ever the many ot leap into action.  \u201cNO!\u201d Katie yelled.  Michael stopped, confused.  \u201cJust need someone to help me sit down,\u201d Katie said, trying to lure in the young boy.  \u201cMam, I think you\u2019d find if I\u2019d just get the first aid kit, it\u2019ll probably solve your problem,\u201d Michael said as he came close to Katie and took the elderly old woman by the hand.  \u201cNo,\u201d she said, weak.  \u201cNo?\u201d he said, puzzled.  \u201cSo . . . HUNGRY!\u201d Katie screamed, and with that she summoned up all the energy she could, pulling the rotund young man as closely as her diminished strength would allow and kissing him passionately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled, and she held on to him for dear life.  Almost immediately, Katie began to feel the magic kicking in as Michael\u2019s soul was yanked from his body and forced into Katie\u2019s.  Huge puffs of red smoke forced wither way inside the old woman.  Her body jerked and spasms proliferated while this happened.  As more of Michael\u2019s soul was absorbed, Katie again grew younger.  Her skin smoothed and became young again as the wrinkles were washed away.  Her hair turned jet black as it once had been.  Her floppy breasts surged forth, once again filled with the wonderful bounce of youth and vigor.  Her legs, ass, and belly firmed up in the blink of an eye, pleasure shooting through every inch of her body as she made her way back to the elevator, Michael\u2019s now-empty body standing dumbly awaiting an order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie tried to control the rush she was feeling as she made her way back into the elevator and sought a return to her office.  As the elevator reached the appropriate floor, Katie was still breathing heavily.  The door opened to reveal a middle-aged, overweight cleaning lady with a mop, who entered the elevator as Katie exited.  \u201cWhat\u2019s got into you?\u201d the older woman said with a slight smile.  Katie smiled back.  \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she replied as she walked off.  She took out a cell phone and called for Dimbe as she made her way back to the office.  \u201cDimbe,\u201d she said, \u201cfind the fat kid Michael in the basement and give him something to do.  He\u2019s a life-saver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie walked back into her office and sat down at her big desk, her youth and beauty now restored.  \u201cSo that\u2019s what happens when I don\u2019t eat, I guess,\u201d she mused, as she looked at the next item on her to-do list.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie must have been sitting at her new desk for several hours, reading through as many files as she could. It seemed that Dimbe was extremely well connected within the underworld and this club was a very useful cover operation for one of the largest crime families in the area. Dimbe was one of their highest ranked employees and almost everything that happened in this club had routes with the family. Dimbe was one of their officers, most of the waitresses were prostitutes on their payroll and the bartenders doubled as thugs for hire. Since Dimbe was so well liked, it didn't seem like the place got checked up on often, which made things easier for Katie. She'd be sure to keep Dimbe around as the face for whenever needed, but besides that, he was essentially useless. Maybe she'd make him a bouncer. If anything, his size was intimidating....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Katie was about to call Jonny and report how everything went when there was a knock on the door. \"Come in!\" Katie exclaimed, loud enough o be heard through he heavy office door. One of the younger waitresses stepped into the room and walked towards her desk. The girl sat down on the chair across from Katie and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, mistress\" she said as Katie noticed that the girl had the same deadened eyes that Dimbe and that fat kid she ate earlier had. Katie sighed, knowing this was probably Jonny's work as the waitress continued, \"My name is Julia. Master Jonny told me that I am to treat you as I do him, so you're my mistress. what shall I do for you?\" she asked, crossing her legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie frowned. At this point, Jonny would have more souls in this club than she would. Not like that really meant anything. After all, Jonny was the one that gave her this club AND gave her the sexy meat suit she wore AND made her a demon in the first place. She had no reason at all to complain. Jonny would always be welcome to do what he wanted here. It was the least she could do to even begin paying him back. \"Look, Julia, I don't have anything planned for you right now...just act like you normally would and keep doing what you normally do. I'll tell you if I ever need anything special, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia nodded. \"That sounds great, mistress. Please let me know when you will be needing anything\" the soulless young woman said before standing up and walking out of Katie's new office. Finally, Katie picked up the phone to call Jonny. She frowned, when she realized the line was dead for some reason. The lights above her began to flicker. Katie's body shivered as the temperature int he room dropped considerably. Demons usually couldn't get cold, but she was still very young, still had enough humanity to feel certain things. Little did she know, that would end very soon. When she looked back up, Katie nearly jumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there\" a voice said. It was a stern, powerful voice, demanding of respect. Yet it was also an aged voice that gave of an air of infinite knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...who are you?\" Katie asked, looking over the mysterious old man that had appeared in front of her. She stood up and walked around her best so that she could be face to face with this stranger. Despite his age, Katie was still considerably shorter than him, even in the heels she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not surprised that Jonny neglected to mention me. My name is unimportant, but rest assured it is one that you have heard many times\" the man said. \"I am the father and master of all demons. All except for you. In your case, I suppose I am more of a grandfather figure\" he said, looking Katie over rather curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Katie asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I am the first demon. I am nearly as old as this world is. I have been biding my time for centuries and have remained in the shadow, creating demons to do my dirty work. Finally, after so much effort, my alpha demon was created in the form of Jonny. Jonny is the only demon I have ever made with the ability to replicate the powers of all demons he comes into contact with. Including my own ability to create demons. You are the first demon I have ever seen that is not directly linked to me. Until Jonny makes you brothers and sisters, you are as unique as he his. However, Jonny may have my ability, but he is nowhere near as strong as I am. He made you a demon, but despite what he may think, you are not fully one of us. You do not have a unique ability to call your own like all other demons have. I am here to change that for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change that? How?\" Katie asked, a bit confused. She didn't quite understand what it was that this man was saying, but the sense of power that he was giving off couldn't be ignored. Katie also felt a compulsion from deep within her to answer all of his questions honestly and show him as much respect as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man ignored her question and responded with his own. \"Tell me something. You're name is Jackson Rothstien. You were a 19 year old human male of average appearance when you became a demon. Why do you remain in the body of the 22 year old beauty, Kaitlyn Donaldson? Despite the sexuality given off by your current appearance, you are not a homosexual. You have no interest in having sex with males, so why enjoy the dress you wear? These are rhetorical questions, of course. The reasoning is because you enjoy showing off your body. You take great pride in looking as gorgeous as you do, knowing that all men who see you lust after you, and all women are envious. I have a very special ability for you, if you accept it\" the old man says, extending his hand. Katie thinks for a moment before extending hers as well. Suddenly, the old man wraps his hand around Katie's and she feels an electrical shock throughout her body. She lets out quite the yelp as her eyes glow a deep crimson. The old man successfully burns out the last of Katie's humanity, finally making her a full demon. Katie pulled herself away from the old man and nearly fell to the ground. She had to catch her breath as the old man explained to her what had happened. \"All residual humanity inside of you has now been eliminated. You will no longer be a child, learning the ropes of the game you have been brought into. I have given you your own personal ability as well as the knowledge of how to use it. Being the new owner of this establishment, it is fitting that you be able to control all sin that is within it. You now control the 7 great sins. you can bring any of them out in anyone you want in whatever extent that you want. You will be the...queen of sin. From this moment on, you will be as much of a player in my cosmic game as any of the others I have made with the exception of Jonny. I expect you to be heartless and to make the best of your position. And of course, you are to continue being loyal to Jonny. He needs a strong right hand, and something tells me that those humans he keeps manipulating will not quite cut it. Do you understand all of this, Katie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie heard everything that the old man said. Slowly, she stood up and stretched herself out before striking a very sexy pose for the old man, showing off quite a bit of her body's legs. Her eyes were still burning red from the power she was given and her smile was considerably more evil than any expression she had since becoming a demon. She licked her lips seductively and responded in a sultry voice, \"Of course I understand, sir. I'll keep running this nice little club, having my fun bringing out the sin in my patrons and causing all sorts of havoc, while at the same time, assisting daddy dearest with everything that he wants.  Did, I get all of that, sir?\" she asked, making an innocent looking face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man chuckled. \"Oh yes, that sounds absolutely perfect, dear. Just remember, the most important rule is to have fun...\" he said as his body turned into smoke and exited the office. As soon as he was completely out of the room, the lights stopped flickering and the temperature returned to normal. Katie grinned as she watched the last of the smoke disappear from the room. On that note, she picked up her phone and finally called Jonny, eager to tell him what she had experienced her first day on the job. </span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t wait to tell her maker about all that had happened\u2014her recent feeding, her continued enjoyment of her feminine body, and, most of all, of course, the fact that she now had power that, just a few days ago, was beyond her comprehension.  Suddenly, the phone stops ringing and someone picks up.  \u201cHello?\u201d came a female voice on the other end.  Katie was surprised having expected Jonny to pick up.  Katie wasn\u2019t sure what body Jonny was in, but he had been a man just the night before, albeit a fairly tiny and unmanly version of a man.  \u201cUm, hello, who is this please?\u201d Katie asked.  \u201cThis is Lisa.  I\u2019m Jonny\u2019s . . . ah . . . well . . . personal assistant.  How may I help you?\u201d came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, my name is Katie, and I was really hoping to talk to Jonny if that\u2019s all right,\u201d Katie said.  \u201cWell,\u201d Lisa began, \u201cat the moment Jonny is preparing for a meeting with the Chief of Police about some possible mayhem and destruction later this week, and he just got back from dining out, so he has to get right to the meeting.  I\u2019ll tell you what you\u2019re more than welcome to leave a message, and I can pass it on to him in a jiffy,\u201d said Lisa.  Katie was getting annoyed.  This woman seemed to think that she and she alone could decide who got to talk to Jonny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d came Jonny\u2019s voice on the other end of the phone.  \u201cSomeone named Katie?\u201d Lisa answered, as if unsure why the name should ring a bell.  \u201cOh,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d  \u201cOkay, remember the Sheriff should be here any minute,\u201d Lisa cautioned.  \u201cShe\u2019s paralyzed by a fundamental break in her sense of justice and of her own identity.  I\u2019m sure she can find something to ponder while I chat.\u201d  Katie chuckled.  \u201cHello?\u201d Johnny said, now on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who\u2019s Lisa?\u201d Katie immediately asked.  \u201cShe\u2019s my secretary kinda,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d  Katie could have probed that area more but chose not to.  \u201cWell, I got a visit from the old man today, and apparently I\u2019m the Queen of Sin, so I have that going for me, which is nice,\u201d Katie said with a slight laugh.  \u201cAnd you\u2019ve probably eaten by now,\u201d Jonny surmised, \u201chow was that.\u201d  \u201cOh it was a photo finish.  This body was about to give out on me, but I was lucky to find this fat fuck in the basement with a sense of chivalry, or at least he did have one until I sucked his soul out of him . . . probably not so much now . . . \u201c  \u201cYou do have to be careful about getting enough to eat, especially when you\u2019re new to this.  If you don\u2019t eat enough, you won\u2019t die, but the body you\u2019re in will.  You\u2019ll be weak and you\u2019ll have to find a new body.  Most demons don\u2019t like to be without bodies long, so you might get stuck in a spot where you don\u2019t have a ton of options.\u201d  \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Katie said, \u201canyway, you\u2019ve used a lot of different bodies over time, do you find you like one kind more tha\u2014\u201c Katie began, but was cut off when Lisa informed Jonny that the sheriff had arrived and took the phone from him.  \u201cJonny said it was nice talking to you; bye now!\u201d came Lisa\u2019s voice on the other end of the phone, followed by a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan any other kind?\u201d Katie pointlessly finished her sentence before hanging up the phone on her desk in irritation.  She turned and looked at the security feed as it showed the various spots that the cameras happened to cover.  Katie stood up, straightened her dress, and walked sexily out of her office to look first-hand upon her customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDimbe!\u201d Katie yelled as she exited her office.  The man came over, \u201cYes, Mistress,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s getting a bit late in the day, and the dinner guests are starting to arrive, and I would like to get to know some of our patrons, and I\u2019m told we have a fundraiser going on upstairs.  I\u2019d like to meet those involved.\u201d  \u201cYes, Mistress,\u201d Dimbe replied as he led you into a grand room in the upper part of the building.  The doors opened to reveal a large space with ornate carpet and furnishings and restaurant staff bustled about the place, moving to and fro and carrying trays of various things.  In the center of this grand room was a table in the shape of a circle, and around it sat several men in suits.  There was the head of the local rotary club, the head of the Red Cross, the Superintendent of the local schools, and many other fairly well-paid individuals who could afford to attend a function at the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing you and Dimbe enter, one of the men stood up and came over to you while you were still just in the room and over by the wall.  \u201cHello,\u201d said the pleasant-faced man of probably about 64, \u201cI\u2019m Father Connors.\u201d  He had white hair and a beard plus a reasonably fit figure.  Katie could tell from his clothes that he was a priest, as he had the usual dark suit punctuated by a simple white color.  \u201cHello, Miss,\u201d he said as he warmly extended his hand, \u201cI\u2019m told you\u2019re the new owner, and my sincere congratulations on that, and I want to thank you for continuing the wonderful tradition that this restaurant has so kindly helped us with for many years,\u201d he said nicely as he looked down at Katie, who was much shorter.  \u201cOh, well it\u2019s an honor having you, but I\u2019m not sure what, um . . . \u201c Katie began, not entirely sure what it was that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d the good preacher said, \u201cyou see, this is a charitable dinner.  Folks pay five hundred dollars a plate to come and eat here, and the money goes to the church\u2019s efforts to help the homeless.  Your restaurant has provided the food free of charge.\u201d  Katie smiled.  \u201cWell it\u2019s a wonderful cause,\u201d she said, \u201cso your waitresses are treating you well?\u201d  \u201cOh yes,\u201d Father Connors said, \u201cthey\u2019re just being little angels.  There\u2019s one now, in fact,\u201d he said motioning to one of the women off in the distance as she poured a drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at her, and she had an idea.  The waitress in question was Mina Ramirez, a 25-year-old immigrant from Mexico who had worked at the restaurant a couple years now.  She had skin of a dark complection, as well as dark hair.  Today, since this was a charity function for a church, she wore a somewhat conservative uniform\u2014a completely buttoned-up white shirt with a name tag and dark pants instead of a skirt, both of which were an effort to hide her physical, shall we say, assets, but assets they were nonetheless.  Katie could see her chest jiggle as she walked, and her hips swayed back and forth, punctuated by a wonderfully full backside her pants struggled to contain.  She had just starting selling her wonderful body a few months ago for extra money, and this would be a great chance to give her some practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather,\u201d Katie said, \u201cthere\u2019s really not enough lust in your life is there?\u201d she said as she placed her hand firmly on the man\u2019s back.  His eyes took on the red glow common of the entranced as his aged body relaxed.  \u201cNot enough . . . \u201c he mumbled as his mind swam with feelings a man of his profession ought not have.  \u201cFather,\u201d Katie said with a smile, \u201cthat waitress over there\u2014Mina\u2014she really is something, isn\u2019t she?  The way her boobs bounce around under that shirt, not to mention an ass to die for,\u201d she said, looking up to see the father\u2019s eyes focused like a laser on the waitress.  \u201cI bet you\u2019d like to give her a good fuck,\u201d she said.  All that came from the good father was a nod and a slight grunt.  \u201cSo tonight when you leave, I want you to take her with you and pay her well, and do her so hard she\u2019ll walk weird for a whole week after she comes back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie removed her hand from Conners, and the red glow left his eyes and hers.  \u201cThank you again for coming, Father,\u201d Katie said as he meandered back in the direction of his table still in a small daze.  As he walked back, he did seem to be taking the time to look at Mina more than he had before.  Katie motioned for Dimbe, who leaned over.  \u201cMake sure that the cost of their transaction is negotiated here before they leave, and make sure the restaurant gets a cut,\u201d she commanded simply as the two headed off to meet the next guests.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey bartender, get me another shot!\" A musical voice exclaimed from the corner area of the room. Katie looked over in that direction to see a woman enjoying herself and laughing, talking with the bartender like they were old friends as she was getting herself drunk. This guest was much different from the ones in the main part of the room. This one was considerably younger, probably about the same age of Katie's body. She had long golden blonde hair and icy blue eyes. On top of that, she was wearing a black short skirt, tight white V-neck top and heels that gave her an extra few inches of height. She was dressed far less conservatively than everyone else which told Katie that she probably was not here for the fundraiser. But if that was the case, then why was she allowed to be here in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimbe, who is that young woman at the bar?\" Katie asks, leaning towards the large black man so that they could speak quietly. He looked in the girl's direction before responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Vanessa Marcone. She's the eldest daughter of the boss that I work for, who technically is in charge of all of the goings on in the club and gets a cut from all of our 'extracurricular' activities. Boss Marcone requires a member of his family is at all of our events to supervise, and usually sends Vanessa. She's very friendly with most of our workers. Sweet girl, unlike the rest of her family. She's usually quite bored when she's here and just sits at the bar, having her fun\" Katie smiles as she looked Vanessa over. Definitely a good looking girl, though she liked her current meat suit a bit too much to think about transferring out, especially when 'Katie' was at such a high point in her life. Still, this was an opportunity that was too good to let slip. When he was growing up as a little boy, Jack would always dream of being a gangster. He loved the Godfather immensely, but knew that he would never be able to live out that fantasy. Or maybe he only thought that. Vanessa was a way in to that dream life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie smiled and walked over to the bar, sitting down next to Vanessa. \"Hi there\" she said, sending the bartender off on a random errand. \"My name's Katie. I'm the new owner of The Warehouse\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned to look at Katie, smiling back. These events were always so boring for her so it was nice having someone new to talk to. She took a sip from her glass. \"Nice to meet you. I'm Vanessa\" she said. Her words were a little slurred, but there was something that wasn't right. \"So....why're you running this joint now?\" she asked curiously as Katie realized what was up. This girl wasn't nearly as drunk as she was pretending. Katie grinned knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone has a high alcohol tolerance. Why pretend to be drunker than you are?\" she asked, dodging the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled, clearly surprised to have been found out. \"When you're drunk, you don't need to take responsibility for your actions. And trust me, I don't want any responsibility...\" she said. \"But in all seriousness, how did you end up owning this place? Daddy didn't inform me that he gave Dimbe's position away to a girl my age.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grinned. Did she sense jealously in that statement? Now this would certainly be a good test run of the extent of her powers. \"Let's go talk in my office\" she says with a grin, taking Vanessa by the hand and bringing her down to the office that she had made her own only recently. Katie sat at her new desk and crossed her legs as Vanessa sat across from her and did the same. \"You know, Vanessa....I read a little bit about you earlier today, but I'm just remembering it now. You're not involved with your family's business much. You just don't have an interest in crime like your dad or brother. You're content to be the good girl in the family. You don't even spend the money that they try to give you that you know comes from the crimes they do, yet you come to supervise our fundraisers and enjoy our food. Isn't that a bit of a double standard. honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me honey please....You're right, I don't particularly like the...dirtier things that my family does. But I like to come to support these events, even if I just end up talking to the workers and not actually interacting with the charities. It's an excuse to get out of the fortress that daddy calls a mansion....I answered your question, now you answer mine. I know that daddy didn't give away Dimbe's job, and Dimbe would never just give his job to someone like you. How'd you get this office, umm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie\" she says, reminding Vanessa her name. \"And I got this job because it was given to me by a power higher than Dimbe and much higher than your father. In fact, I'm going to take over your father's position before you know it\" she says with a grin, causing Vanessa to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good one. But how exactly would you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now that's the fun part. I'm not going to do it at all\" Katie said as she stood up and walked around so she was standing behind Vanessa. She placed her hands on Vanessa's shoulders. \"You see, Vanessa, you're going to kill your father as soon as you have the chance. You'll take over his business, be the new crime boss in town, and work explicitly for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck would I do that? You're crazy\" Vanessa said as she tried to stand up, but was pushed back down my Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's not quite right. But You're crazy. For me\" Katie says as her eyes glow crimson. Vanessa's body stiffens up as her eyes glow the same. \"You asked why you would do this for me, Vanessa, and the reasons are really very simple. Firstly, you have such an incredible amount of LUST for me. You want me sooooo badly, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....I want you.....so much\" Vanessa says softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie giggles. \"You want me so much, that you're willing to do absolutely anything that I ask you to do, no matter what it is, isn't that right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do...anything....for you...\" she says, the crimson glow in her eyes still burning strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are other reasons as well. You're a very GREEDY girl, Vanessa. There is very little in life that you do not want. You want as much money as you ca get your dainty little hands on. You want the nicest clothes, the most expensive jewelry and as much power as you can get. Just not as much as me, since you want me too much to be more powerful than me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nods as Katie continues speaking. Every word Katie spoke was becoming embedded into Vanessa's woul, bringing out her inner sins and creating new sinful thoughts to replace whatever original thoughts and drives would be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of your greed for things, you're incredibly ENVIOUS of your family. I can tell that you're a very smart girl, so you're going to use those smarts to work out the best plan possible for overthrowing your father. And then, you're going to kill him and anyone else left in your family that will possibly get in your way. You will have a WRATH in you that you have never had before, and that will empower you to do all of this. After all, hate and anger is the best fuel, and you feel so much of it towards your family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yess....envious of them....and wrathful...I hate my family...\" Vanessa says, clenching her fists in anger. Katie smiled, this was working perfectly. Now for the finishing touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we don't want you feeling any regret for your actions as things move forward, so you're also going to be very PRIDEFUL. You will have no qualms at all in any of this. You will love and take pride in your sins. You will embrace them all. Got it?\" Katie asks, looking into Vanessa's fiery eyes. Vanessa nods tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssssss.....I will do everything for you....I am yours...\" she said in her lust filled voice as the glowing in her eyes faded away. They returned to their icy blue color before Vanessa passed out in her chair. Katie grinned. Using her powers to this extent was absolutely thrilling. Katie really was the queen of sin. And now Vanessa was her sinful little knight. Or maybe just a pawn. Her usefulness remained to be seen, but Katie knew she would not be disappointed with her creation. She'd be surprised if Vanessa had any non sinful thoughts in her head after this experience. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDimbe, please take Vanessa home, and I\u2019ll be willing to bet you a night with any female patron you desire that her fat fuck of a daddy doesn\u2019t last a week,\u201d Katie offered.  \u201cDeal,\u201d Dimbe said, shaking her hand and moving to remove the unconscious Vanessa from her spot sprawled out on the office chair.  Katie turned around and headed back down the hallway into a main dining area that teamed with patrons.  Katie walked about for a few minutes shaking hands with the proverbial high rollers\u2014people who had a lot of money and came to the restaurant often.  Every time she greeted a wealthy man, Katie made sure to bend over to shake his hand, giving the male patrons plenty of time to view her dangling breasts, and thus ensuring that they\u2019d return at some point, probably quite soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked with pleasure upon the room.  In one corner was a busty bar tender separating men from their money as she occasionally poured expensive wine all over her gorgeous chest.  More tips and more sales that way.  In another corner was a waitress a man who looked like a man of the cloth exiting the restaurant with a well-endowed waitress.  \u201cFather Connors, you ol\u2019 dog you,\u201d Katie said with a smile.  She glanced down a dark hall, at the end of which she spied what was probably Dimbe dragging the beautiful Vanessa by her arms out of the restaurant and into the car that he would use to take her home.  In the middle of all this sat the cream of the crop of fat, corrupt, and rich men opening their wallets, their own mouths, and often the legs of the women they wooed.  It was splendid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Katie said, cocking an eyebrow.  In the midst of all the men guzzling their beers and scarfing down their steaks, there sat a woman alone eating something Katie couldn\u2019t quite make herself believe she saw.  She moved in a little closer, as one does when hoping not to scare away a rare animal.  \u201cDammit,\u201d Katie said, \u201cI can\u2019t fucking see,\u201d so she moved closer again and squinted again.  \u201cIs that a\u2014,\u201d she started.  It was.  It was indeed.  \u201c\u2014a motherfucking salad!\u201d Katie exclaimed.  There upon the plate of this lone vegetarian warrior, this iconoclast, this calorie-counting rebel in a land where rolls of fat popped as often as rolls of bubble paper, sat an understated, elegant mass of green that, if the rumors about produce were true, had been neatly and painlessly picked from the ground rather than throttled into submission by the bare hands of some carnivorous conqueror clad in overalls and flannel (no doubt with \u201cStrangle Hold\u201d blasting in the background).  \u201cWhat.  The.  Hell.!?\u201d Katie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grabbed a nearby waiter.  \u201cWho is that woman?\u201d she demanded of the pimple-faced busboy.  \u201cUh, that\u2019s Milyenka Rusenkov,\u201d the boy said.  \u201cThat name\u2019s a bit of a mouthful,\u201d Katie commented.  \u201cYeah,\u201d the waiter replied, \u201cshe\u2019s a ballerina from some place in Eastern Europe.  Started coming in a couple weeks ago, and I guess she just likes the salads, \u2018cause that\u2019s all she ever buys,\u201d and the boy was off to his next table.  \u201cWell that won\u2019t do,\u201d Katie said as she approached the woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilyenka was a woman of about 28 with long dark hair cascading down her back.  She had high cheekbones and a firm, toned body all over.  Her arms were thin and muscular; her boobs were pert.  Her abs were flat as a board, and her legs were toned and fit, with a nice tight rump and thighs that, from the looks of her, touched pretty much never.  \u201cHello,\u201d Katie said, walking up to this lone woman, \u201cI\u2019m Katie, and I\u2019m the new owner.\u201d Milyenka looked up pleasantly as she shook Katie\u2019s hand, \u201cMy name Milyenka Rusenkov,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with a very heavy and very rough (if that is the right word) Eastern European accent, \u201cI like food here very much salad is very great thank you,\u201d she said, clearly knowing English but not quite being really comfortable speaking it around native speakers.  \u201cWell, you know we do have some other things too, if you\u2019d like.  We\u2019ve got puddings and cakes and brownies and things, and they taste very good,\u201d she said, looking down at the awkward but friendly woman with a smile.  Milyenka paused for a minute, as if trying to make sure she knew in her head what all those English words meant before she answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo very thank you though,\u201d she said, \u201cmust stay small as I must competition soon in ballet so must no be big,\u201d she said, always keeping the pleasant smile but using predictably broken English.  Bless her blockage-free little heart for giving English her best shot though.  \u201cAll right, well do find me if you need anything,\u201d Katie said as she walked away.  Milyenka waved kindly and went back to her salad in silence.  \u201cThe nerve of that bitch,\u201d Katie said to herself as she walked off into a corner to watch events unfold some more, \u201cI\u2019m all for a healthy meat suit, if for no other reason than to make sure I don\u2019t keel over when I jump into my next one, but dammit, this is a restaurant where people are supposed to enjoy eating.  Greenery is a food of the weak, and anyone who consumes only greenery and takes pride in a fucking thigh gap of all things deserves to be strapped to a gurney and fed pure fat via IV,\u201d Katie seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie paced about in the back of the restaurant for a few minutes, making sure the bar was running along smoothly and that the waitresses had enough buttons undone on their tops to keep the men around.  She happened to glance over and see the beautiful, fit Rusenkov wipe her mouth politely with a napkin, stand from her table, and head to the bathroom.  \u201cWrongs must be righted,\u201d she said with great determination, as she quickly clicked her high heels in the direction of the restroom.  She stepped gingerly through the door and found Rusenkov standing at the mirror in the midst of fixing her hair or something.  A lacey white top covered her breasts and torso.  She turned around when she heard the door close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of surprise crossed her face when she saw Katie, the woman who had addressed her before.  \u201cUm, still I want only salad because it is very good thank you,\u201d she said, seemingly automatically since the proper English response would have been closer to \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in here?\u201d  Katie grabbed the woman roughly by the shoulders and spun her around so that she was again looking in the mirror.  Her face betrayed a look of extreme confusion and fear, and she tensed up, ready to scream.  Suddenly, Katie placed her hand firmly on the woman\u2019s lower back.  A red glow enveloped Katie\u2019s eyes, as it did Rusenkov\u2019s.  The ballerina\u2019s taut body relaxed.  Her mouth hung open, and she seemed to have her eyes about half closed.  \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d Katie began, \u201cyou\u2019re in my fucking restaurant, so what I say goes,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cand I say that you are so very hungry that no salad will ever fill you,\u201d she sad as she leaned is close and whispered into the woman\u2019s ear.  \u201cNo salad,\u201d she replied.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Katie affirmed, \u201cyou want brownies and chocolate and cakes and sweets,\u201d Katie declared.  The entranced woman pushed back, \u201cMust stay small, must competition soon.\u201d  Katie just laughed.  \u201cYes, you want to stay small, but the food is so undeniably good.  The chocolate fudge as it tumbles down your throat is some warm and wonderful, the cake icing tastes so good as you move it around inside your mouth.  You\u2019ve denied yourself all these things for years while training for all your precious competitions, but no longer,\u201d Katie said, a delightful smile crossing her face as she beheld her enthralled, gluttonous prey, resting her head on the woman\u2019s shoulder like a little devil who urges people to forget their inhibitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie reached her free hand around to Rusenkov\u2019s front and massaged her stomach delightfully.  \u201cYou\u2019ll eat all of these things when you get back to your table until you can physically eat no more for the night.  Only then will you stop, my little glutton.  You\u2019ll gaze down in confusion at yourself.  You didn\u2019t want to eat so much, but you just couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d  \u201cCould not stop,\u201d the woman said, slowly nodding her head.  \u201cBut you love it so very much that you will come back here tomorrow to do the very same thing all over again, and you\u2019ll look down at your plump little body, your pudgy little belly,\u201d she said as she massaged it some more, \u201cand you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re losing control, but that it feels so good.\u201d  \u201cPudgy belly feels good,\u201d the woman echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and let\u2019s throw in some sloth while we\u2019re at it,\u201d Katie said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t want my little Pillsbury Dough Ballerina to be getting an ideas about physical fitness, so you\u2019ll be slow, lethargic, and tired, but nearly always hungry!\u201d  \u201cPudgy belly, plump . . . hungry,\u201d the woman replied.  And finally Katie let the woman go, as red disappeared from both of their eyes.  In the few seconds it took her to regain her senses, Katie calmly walked out of the bathroom and beckoned for one of the kitchen staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssign a couple more waiters to Rusenkov\u2019s table, and tell the pastry chef to get his ass in gear.  Our beautiful ballerina is about to have a massive attack of the munchies,\u201d Katie declared.  Milyenka soon burst from the restroom, her belly growling loudly as she jetted by, and she headed back to her table, shoving the uneaten salad away from her as she sat.          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie was walking back to her office, when she heard the sound of hands clapping behind her. \"Nicely done, Oh Queen of Sin\" a voice said. Katie turned around to see Michael, the kid who's soul she first ate, smiling at her. She looked at him confused, unsure how his body was able to think on its own. That caused him to frown. \"Wow, you're clearly not too observant....you don't recognize me?\" he asked as suddenly, the image of the Old Man flickered over Michael's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie jumped. \"Oh! I'm sorry sir, I couldn't tell that was you! Why are you wearing that meat suit?\" she asked, wrapping her arms around the boy's body. \"Let's go talk to in my office\" she said as she opened the door and brought him inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man, who was not so old right now, looked at Katie with a serious look in his face. \"did you hear about what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Katie asked, confused. The possessed young man chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really haven't heard yet? I thought this place was supposed to get all of the connections. I see that someone needs to learn how to use this place better\" he said with a know it all grin before continuing. \"Your former body was killed last night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Katie asked, confused. 'Michael' just nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Jonny had this whole big plan at a gala event that went a bit wrong. Your original human body was fatally wounded and I just felt it burning away in the demonic flames that always consume bodies that were completely used up. Jack is gone forever now. And that means that you should be completely free from being a human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked down, not quite knowing how she felt. She never really felt connected to her old body, even when she was a human. In fact, she always hated her life, so part of her was relieved about this. The other part, though, was quite upset. This was a whole chapter of her life that was now over. \"So...is that all I owe this please for? You coming here to tell me that I'm dead?\" she asked. \"Also, does this mean that Jonny is gone?\" Katie asked, genuinely concerned. She really hoped that Jonny was still alive. She saw him as being like a father to her and really wanted him around to help her. Not that the Old Man wasn't a nice treat, but he was certainly no Jonny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonny is fine. The last time I saw of him, he went with his new assistant to find a new body for himself. I do not know who he selected, but he will have a very interesting part of his story ahead of him. As will you\" the Old Man said with a grin. \"I saw your little playing around with the mob boss' daughter. You will win the bet you made with Dimbe. Judging from the way that the gears of her mind were turning, she will be taking over her family business before you know it. I want you to use that. If Jonny plays his cards right, he will be in control of the entire police force. And you will be in charge of the whole underworld. The two of you will  be int he perfect positions to cause exactly the kind of chaos that feeds me the most.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed you? You mean all of the chaos that demons causes is used to feed you and make you more powerful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I mean. Contrary to popular belief, I am not all powerful. I feed off of the chaos and evil int his world. My demon's help to sustain my power indefinitely. I would be incredibly weak if it were not for all of you keeping my powers at what they are. You've been doing an excellent job so far....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie frowned. So all she was was a pawn to keep this being powerful? That didn't feel right. If she spread chaos in the world, she wanted it to be for her own enjoyment, not just because some other demon wanted to keep himself in control. Her and Jonny were pretty powerful...maybe the two of them could team up and weaken the Old Man enough to take his role for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the possessed boy put his hand on Katie's shoulder. His eyes glowed red, followed by Katie's doing the same. \"Now now, my dear, I can;t have you thinking thoughts like those\" he said, his voice now the demonic voice of the old man. \"You will never again think about plotting against me. Yes, your chaos feeds me, but you enjoy keeping me happy because I own you. You will make sure that Jonny understands this as well, got it, girl?\" he asked, removing his hand as Katie's eyes returned to her body'd normal colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at the other possessed person. \"Of course, sir. Jonny and I will make sure you stay nice and well fed for a looong time. Now is there anything else, or can I start my plans for chaos?\" She asked, sitting down at her desk and going onto her computer, seeing headlines of the attack at the gala that had killed her old body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there is nothing else. I'll just leave this body where I found him\" the Old Man said, disappearing in a puff of smoke. </span></div></div>",

It certainly looked like Jonny was busy with his plans. There were several people wounded as well as a few people dead. Katie noticed a quote or two from the police chief and couldn't help but wonder if she was also a part of Jonny's plan. She imagined that was likely since the Old Man had mentioned that Jonny planned on taking over the whole police force at some point. It seemed like even the author of the article had a fear in the way that they wrote. Boy, was Jonny good at this. Katie hoped that she would be able to be as effective as Jonny was, but that would mean having her plan going the way she wanted it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Katie heard the phone stop ringing as that musical voice answered. \"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyyy girl. It's me, Katie. You remember who I am, don't you babe?\" she asked with a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget?\" Vanessa asked, sounding quite lustful. Katie giggled a bit, knowing that was her programming at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me for being worried that your drinking too much may have given you head trauma...Anyway, I just wanted to check how things were going with your family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, things are going great. Their empire will be all mine by midnight. And when I say all mine, I mean all yours of course\" Vanessa said, and Katie could easily imagine the evil smirk on the girls face. Katie knew that she now hated her family and would do everything it took to give her newest object of desire all of their power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight? Wow, you work fast. Once it's done, make sure you come straight to my office and we can work out the rest of our arrangement. Plus, I'll give you a little bit of fun as a thank you for everything. You would want to have fun with me, wouldn't you, Vanessa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, you know I would. I'll be over once daddy is sleeping with the fishes. I just need to finish explaining the plan to a few more goons and promise them rewards. See you soon, love\" she said before hanging up on her end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie licked her lips. It was like talking to a brand new girl. She looked at the golden and wooden grandfather clock in the corner of her office. It was hard to believe that within 3 hours, Katie would be the new crime lord of the area. That idea was so strange, but sooooo tempting. She'd be controlling the gangs while Jonny controlled the cops. That would make her quite useful to Jonny, which she wanted to be, while at the same time it would feed the old man. What could possibly go wrong? </span></div></div>",

Katie grinned as she opened the body, revealing a blood stained golden necklace that was known to have always been worn by Vanessa's father. He was never known to have taken the necklace off. Katie smiled happily as she picked up the necklace and put it around her own neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it look on me?\" she asked Vanessa, who laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better on you than it did on the old man. I paid off my goons well. They helped me to kill my father and brother and now I'm the only one in the family left so the reigns fall to me. And now...\" she said, taking Katie's hand in hers and kissing it gently. \"I officially transfer that power to you. Congratulations, lover. you're the newest crime lord of the city. What's the plan from here?\" she asked, eager to serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we need to make this official. go back to your home and get the word across to all of your men that I'm now in charge. Make sure they all know what I look like and how to contact me. From there, I'll find a few of your enforcers that I REALLY like and give them some extra sinful incentive to work closely with me. If there's anyone you think might be planning to take advantage of this situation for their own benefit, send them my way also and I'll kill all those fantasies. Then I'll move forward on my plans. Within a few weeks I want to have all of the crime in this city under my strict control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'll go get the word out that you're the new boss. See you soon\" Vanessa said before leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie smiled, looking at the necklace she now wore. It had been a symbol of control and power for so long and now it belonged to her. This would be fun. The only question was whether she should inform Jonny of this new development now or wait a little. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny used his bird form to glide effortlessly and gracefully down from the high-rise window over the darkened city streets.  The windows of the buildings gave a bit of light here and there as a janitor worked the night shift or somebody stayed late at the office, but it was nearly 10 PM, and much of the city had begun to slumber, or at least left work.  Johnny floated about as he fluttered his wings in search of a place to stop and, looking around, he saw an upscale restaurant or bar of some kind.  The restaurant was next to a big office building filled with accounting firms and law practices.  Those were high-stress jobs that bred many sleepless nights and broken relationships, and this restaurant, called \u201cThe Warehouse\u201d according to the big but tasteful neon sign out front, was the place many who worked in that office building went to blow off steam.  Johnny glided down to street level and, as he landed, he shifted back into the form of Jack, the unlucky (or perhaps really lucky) lad whose body he had stolen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stood on the street in Jack\u2019s body and looked around as he heard a bit of noise coming from inside.  Suddenly, he herd glass shatter and looked in the direction of the noise.  An older, disheveled homeless man lay sprawled out in an alley looking at Johnny with his eyes widened with terror.  He\u2019d apparently seen Johnny shape-shift and, of course, was in shock over it.  He had dropped his whiskey bottle, hence the sound of breaking glass.  \u201cWhat the fuck are you looking at?\u201d Johnny said, his voice dripping with annoyance as though he barely tolerated this mortal\u2019s existence.  The man wobbled his way to his feet and ran off as quickly as his drunken body could manage.  \u201cThe nerve of some people,\u201d Johnny mused as the man fled in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny slowly walked up to one of the shop windows and beheld his reflection.  There he beheld Jack\u2019s body.  Jack was a fit young man but not very big.  He had toned arms and a flat stomach but a height of only perhaps five foot seven or so, and he had pretty green eyes with glasses, and also short dark hair.  His fit and handsome but somewhat boyish and meek appearance probably contributed to his being shy.  Johnny looked down at his body as he took it in, and he rubbed his hand over Jack\u2019s chin and noted that the young man\u2019s face was smooth.  Despite being eighteen, Jack wasn\u2019t able to grow a particularly impressive amount of facial hair; Johnny wondered if he even had to shave often at all.  \u201cKid must be a pretty late bloomer,\u201d Johnny mused as he looked upon a body that seemed subject to a certain measure of arrested development.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny concentrated for a moment, and black smoke engulfed his borrowed boy, swirling about all over him.  When the smoke dissipated, the body\u2019s college bar clothes were replaced with a nice black suit and a white dress shirt plus a nice tie.  Shining black shoes adorned Johnny\u2019s feet.  \u201cLooking good kid,\u201d the demon said to his reflection, the one he had at least for now.  \u201cI should fit right in at this fancy joint,\u201d he said as he turned and walked toward the door of the restaurant and into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Johnny was assaulted by a plethora of obvious class and elegance.  Looking about, he saw that the room was filled with men in expensive suits and women in wonderful evening gowns, often dripping with jewelry.  A man played piano quietly off in the corner but somehow didn\u2019t overwhelm the whole room with his music.  Even the waiters wore nice suits, and the waitresses, without fail, wore thin white blouses that had a few buttons undone at the top.  Rich, fat, older men held up their hands, and the young well-endowed waitresses would come running.  This place had class, but the suits and fancy jewelry masked other less noble, shall we say, arrangements between the wealthy men and their waitresses that would be consummated later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy kind of place,\u201d Johnny mused as he made his way through the room.  The room itself had walls of exposed brick and a very high ceiling; the room gave off a certain feeling of industries and a time gone by.  This upscale building had an apt name, as it seemed it had actually been a warehouse at some point, probably housing various industrial goods when the economy still needed them instead of laptops and iPhones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny walked through the dimly lit room and took in the clientele.  Overweight older men with money to burn and middle-aged women starved of time and companionship by their careers filled the expensive leather seats as pseudo-romantic things were uttered across dimly lit candles.  \u201cHoly shit a demon could make his retirement in a place like this . . . so many souls ripe for the taking, love-starved divorcees and men who want nothing more than to make partner or sleep with their hot secretaries,\u201d Johnny pondered as his eyes canvassed the place.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny sat down at a nice booth in the back corner of the restaurant, which gave him an excellent view of all of the patrons. this really was the perfect place for a demon to have their hunting ground. There were people that were old, young, rich and indulging in every sin imaginable. Jonny was getting excited just by looking around at all of the powerful people that could become his playthings with the snap of his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but are you planning on ordering anything?\" Jonny's thoughts were interrupted by the lovely voice speaking to him. He snapped out of his daydream and looked up from his seat, looking straight into the face of a beautiful young woman. Jonny looked her over with a grin growing on his face. She was definitely no older than 25, and had incredibly smooth skin that didn't have any visible defects. Jet black hair was tied in a pony tail that fell just in front of her right shoulder. In front of her hazel eyes were a pair of glasses that served to make her a cute innocent look rather than making her appear nerdy. She wore the typical Warehouse waitress' uniform, consisting of a very short black skirt and red tube top. Her breasts, which were some of the biggest in the whole establishment, were barely contained by her top. Her skin was a light brown color, showing Jonny that she was Latina, or at least had lots of it in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled, looking straight into her eyes. \"Why would you even ask that question? I'm sitting down at a table, aren't I?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman blushed a little, looking down at her feet. \"Sorry. It's just...you look a bit young to be here. I'm new working here....I don't really know what I'm doing just yet...\" she said, putting her hands behind her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed. \"Oh, it's no problem at all. I'm Jonny. What's your name?\" he asked, extending his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute waitress took his hand in hers and smiled at him. \"Nice to meet you, Jonny. I'm Jennifer\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny grinned as his eyes glowed bright red. \"Nice to meet you too, Jennifer. Why don't you take a seat? I have some questions that you're going to very happily answer for me\" he said as the red glow was reflected in Jennifer's own eyes.After a second, the glow disappeared and the smile returned to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, ask me anything you want!\" she said happily, sitting down next to Jonny and crossing her slender legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...why don't you tell me a bit about yourself? I wanna know all the important things there is to know about you\" he said, genuinely curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer laughed a bit. \"Wow, you're sure specific aren't you, Jonny?\" She asked jokingly before giving her answer as ordered. \"Well, my name is Jennifer Alessandra Martinez, but my friends just call me Jen or Jenny. I'm 23 years old and I'm an only child. I just dropped out of college and took this job because it's been my dream of becoming a model and I really want one of the agents who frequent the restaurant to notice me and make me famous\" she said, blushing a bit from her story. Jonny grinned as a devious idea started forming in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's so convenient!\" he exclaimed with a huge smile on his young face. \"My dad is actually one of the top modelling agents! I could totally get you a job!\" he said as Jennifer became wide eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really??? You'd be able to do that?\" she asked, her voice filled with hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"Oh yeah, I definitely would. But it'd come at a price....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? Trust me, nothing you ask for can be worse than the stuff I've already had to do working here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Here's the deal...I'll make you exactly what you dream of being...but in exchange for it, you need to give me that sexy body of yours\" he said, looking over her body once again. She really was beautiful, having an incredibly curvaceous and mature body. With some slight adjustments courtesy of Jonny's abilities, he could turn her into something of not only model, but supermodel quality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer responded by giving a nervous laugh. \"What do you mean by that...? Y-you want me to pretend to be your girlfriend at prom or s-sleep with you or something?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed at those ideas. \"Oh, no. I don't mean anything like that, babe. I mean it literally\" he said, eyes glowing bright red. \"I want your body and soul to belong to me forever....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer saw the glowing eyes and immediately stood up, backing away from Jonny, who just sighed. \"I'm disappointed in you, Jenny baby. I really thought you'd be mature about this, but I guess not. Too bad for you, I'm not leaving this restaurant without having you\" he said with a grin. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny looked over Jenny another time, licking his lips as he saw how truly stunning the 23 year old was. She was millions of miles out of Jack's league and even Jonny would never have been able to get with someone like her when he was alive. Not only that, but Jonny was starting to form a devious plan in his mind. Jenny was clearly the type of waitress that often got looks from the clientele here, and they were all rich and powerful. With her body, Jonny could get access to them and gain more power for himself. That settled that. Jonny wanted her body, but he also knew he couldn't do it here, where there were so many witnesses. He looked right into Jenny's eyes, his own starting to glow brightly as the glow came to hers. Her body stopped it's trembling and instead stood calmly at attention. \"Okay Jenny, here's the deal. You've been underestimating how much you care about becoming a famous model. You REALLY want it. So you're going to head into the kitchen to get me a nice cold beer. When you get back, you're going to tell me how sorry you are about flipping out, and that you'd be willing to give up everything for being a famous supermodel. We'll keep talking from there\" he said as his eyes stopped their glow. Jenny held her head and frowned before turning around and heading to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny watched the young latina's lovely ass sway with each step she took as she walked through the door into the kitchen and disappeared from his sight. While she was gone, Jonny smiled as he looked around the restaurant. Sure enough, they attracted only the richest of the rich, which would be perfect for Jonny to make use of once he had his new body. With Jenny's looks and his planning, he'd have all the power he could ever wish for and would be able to make a much chaos as he wanted. But right now, he had to focus on one step at a time. his thoughts were interrupted as a glass was put down in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your beer\" Jenny said, looking down with an embarrassed blush on her face. \"I still think you're underage, but I decided to get it for you anyway to say sorry\" she said with a smile as Jonny took a sip from the cold beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you sorry for?\" He asked, as if he didn't know why she was apologizing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking and I'd like to take you up on your offer. I'm willing to give you anything and everything so that I can make my dreams come true and be a famous model. Just tell me what you want\" she says as Jonny takes another sip from his beer, before putting it down on the table in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic\" he said, finishing his beer quickly. \"You have a car here, right?\" he asked. Jenny nodded. \"Go to your boss and tell him you're feeling a bit under the weather and will need to leave work early. Maybe flaunt your assets a bit so he's not too mad at you for it. Then bring your car out front and pick me up. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded. \"Yeah, I'll do that. See you soon\" she said, heading in the direction of a large black man in a very nice suit who Jonny assumed was the owner of the Warehouse. Jonny then got up and headed outside. After a few minutes of standing around, a car pulled up in front of him. It wasn't the nicest car on earth, but it was good enough for a middle class girl to have. Jonny opened the door and got in, seeing Jenny smiling at him, clearly excited about the possibility of having her dream finally come true. \"Drive us to your house\" he said to her. After a few minutes, they got to one of the nicer apartment complexes in the city. Jenny took Jonny up the stairs and into her top floor apartment. \"Nice place\" Jonny said as he looked around. To be honest, it really wasn't half bad. The apartment was relatively fancy, having two bedrooms, a large dining room and lounge area with a flat screen TV. Though the people who lived here clearly weren't rich, they weren't poor either. \"Who lives here with you?\" He asked, taking a seat on the couch and laying down, his hands behind his head in a relaxed manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live here with my roommate, Christine\" Jenny said, sitting down next to Jonny, who moved so his feet were resting on her lap. \"She's a nice girl. She's also 23 and is still in school, trying to get a degree in psychology. She's also one of the cheerleaders for our school and brings home guys pretty often\" she said. Jonny nodded as he listened. So there was another beautiful girl living here who he could also potentially use. Interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she now?\" he asked, wanting to make sure that the two of them were alone in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny thought for a second. \"I think she's in class. She should be back in about an hour\" she said with confidence. Jonny nodded. That meant he had more than enough time for what he wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Then let's get down to our business\" Jonny said as he got up from the couch and stood up, looking down at Jenny, who seemed eager to hear what he was going to say.  \"I know you'll find this hard to believe, but I'm not actually human. I'm a demon. Because of that I have a lot of powers which include, but aren't limited to, mind control, shape shifting and possession. I don't have a physical body, so I need to hop into the bodies of others and use them for whatever I need\" he says, pointing to his own body. \"right now, I'm just wearing this kid's body. I'm getting a bit tired of it though. He's nice, but he's a bit too young and a bit too scrawny. I have some very big things planned and I'll need to step up my game to make those things happen. that's where you come in\" he said, placing a hand firmly on Jenny's shoulder. \"I want your body, Jenny. I need a better home for myself and your sexy skin seems like the perfect place for me to lay low and let my plans unfold. As far as your concerned it'll be like taking a nice long nap. When you wake up again, I give you my word that you will be incredibly well known\" he said with a grin, leaving his statements vague. In reality, Jonny couldn't care less what happened to Jenny, but making her a famous model may actually help his plans a bit. He also didn't tell her that she may just never wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked like she was thinking for a few seconds, weighing her options. Jonny could tell she was facing a tough decision, but he knew his commands would pull through. \"Okay...\" Jenny said, sounding a bit unsure. \"I'll do it. Take my body\" she said, causing Jonny to smile. This was easier than he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic\" Jonny said, leaning down and kissing Jenny passionately on the lips. The beautiful Latina closed her eyes, returning the kiss deeply. Suddenly, Jonny made his move. Black smoke flowed from his mouth into hers as Jonny felt his former host body fall to the ground. Jenny started freaking out as the smoke forced it's way down her throat. She gagged and coughed and shook as she tried to fight, but it was pointless. Jonny felt as her body jiggled and spasmed as he felt her toned legs becoming his toned legs, her long hair becoming his long hair, and her huge boobs, becoming his huge boobs. Soon, the shaking stopped, and Jenny's hands came up to her chest, cupping her fine breasts in her hands as she gave them a playful squeeze. An evil smile formed on her face as she looked at her reflection in the closest mirror. \"Thanks for being so cooperative, babe\" Jenny said to her reflection with a wink as she took her hair out from the pony tail, letting it fall freely down her shoulders. She also took off her glasses, giving her a whole different look. \"Wow, I sure am sexy, aren't I?\" she asked as black flames burned away her waitress uniform, replacing it with a sexy black thong and corset, showing off her cleavage in the best way. \"Don't worry, Jenny. I don't think I'll have any trouble at all making you famous\" she said with a laugh before the flames returned, re-clothing to possessed beauty as she heard a knock on her door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The newly-possessed Jenny looked at the apartment door and cursed under her breath. \"Shit...who the fuck could that be?\" she wondered aloud in her sexy voice as she looked through her memories, seeing if the real Jenny would have had any idea who would be knocking at this hour. Upon not finding any helpful information, the former aspiring model exhaled and opened the door, revealing a young dark skinned man who looked to be around Jenny's age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe. I heard you weren't feeling good, so I figured I would stop by and see how you were doing\" he said with a smile on his handsome face. Memories flashed through Jenny's mind as she realized who this guy was. suddenly a smile appeared on her beautiful face as she sprung towards the man, hugging him tightly and feeling her large breasts squeezing against his hard abs. While he was distracted by the hug, Jenny snapped her fingers, causing her former meatsuit to disintigrate in black flames, leaving no trace of ever being there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, you shouldn't have come, Robbie\" she said, pecking him on the cheek. Roberto \"Robbie\" Cortez was 28 years old and came from one of the most well respected families in the city. His father owned the largest bank in the city, while his mother worked as a successful real estate agent, and owned quite a bit of luxurious properties within the city limits. Robbie was tall, at almost 6 feet, with a shaved head, dark complexion and tinted glasses that he wore more for show than to improve his vision. From what Jenny's memories were telling him, the two of them had been dating for the past several months. Robbie had found his way into the Warehouse on one of Jenny's first days working there and it seemed to be love at first sight. Robbie seemed to be very into her, but Jenny's memories showed her that besides initiating the relationship, she had been the one that seemed to be making all of the moves. though Jenny didn't seem to care about that, or know why that was, Jonny had some very good ideas for this young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me, for being worried about you\" he said with a chuckle, letting himself into the house and putting down his backpack. Even though Rabbie's family was filthy rich, he still attended a normal school and wanted to get a job as an engineer, despite having enough money and connections to live his whole life without working. \"So what's wrong? You don't seem sick to me\" he said, flashing a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggled. \"Oh, I just wasn't really feeling like myself, is all\" she said, plopping her luscious ass down on the couch that Jack's young body used to be sprawled on. \"Sit down and I'll explain it\" she said with a wink, patting on the empty part of couch next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie shrugged and sat down next to her. \"What's up, babe?\" He asked, putting one of his hands on Jenny's thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smirked and put her own slender hand on top of his much larger one. \"Well....let's just say that I'm not your babe anymore\" she said as her eye's glowed bright red. Robbie's body stiffened up as his eyes mirrored his former girlfriend's. \"Robbie....do you love me?\" Jenny asked with a mischievous grin on her gorgeous face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the possessed waitress' surprise, Robbie shook his head. \"No, I'm not\" he said frankly, completely under her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why is that?\" She asked, genuinely curious. Everything that her memories were telling her seemed to say that the two of them had a very successful relationship going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gay\" he said casually. \"The day that I met you, I had gotten into a huge fight with my parents. They were starting to suspect my sexuality. They're very traditional and would have disowned me if they found out. So I went out and tried to find the most beautiful girl that I could and bring her home. I found you and made my move to keep myself in good standing. Now that my parent's aren't worrying so much, I can go back to being myself, but can't get myself to dump you since I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded, understanding the situation. Back when Jonny was a cop, one of his partners was gay and had been in a similar situation. The two would always chat about it and Jonny would give his partner advice every morning over donuts and coffee. \"Poor Robbie... I feel so terrible....if only I can make you feel better....oh, wait...I think I can\" she said with a grin, removing her hand from his. Her eyes stopped glowing and Robbie snapped back to wakefulness, holding his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just...\" he was cut off by Jenny's laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Robbie, I have to say that Jenny here never knew you had such a colorful past\" she said as her body and clothing suddenly shifted, changing into the human form that Jonny remembered owning once upon a time. \"To make a long story short, your sexy little girlfriend no longer owns her body. My name is Jonny, and I'll be in her driver's seat for the foreseeable future\" he said, extending a hand to Robbie, who looked scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I must be dreaming...\" he said in what might have been shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's eyes then glowed red, followed by Robbie's. \"Trust me, kid. You are most certainly not dreaming. Believe and take in everything I tell you. It'll make things much easier for you\" Jonny said, as the glowing in both eyes stopped. Robbie held his head again and looked Jonny over nervously, before giving Jonny his hand and shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" He asked with a frown on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled at him as he removed his hand. \"Well, I want to enter a partnership with you. Your family is filthy rich and my current meatsuit may be smoking hot, but she's by no means affluent. I want you to marry her as soon as possible. When you do, make sure that your folks give you and her enough money to live for quite awhile, and have your mom get you both one of her finest houses free of charge. Normally, I would take away your free will and just make you do that for me, but I feel for your suffering and think I have something that I can offer you\" he said with a grin, before shifting back into Jenny's form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could you offer me?\" Robbie asked with a confused look on his face. His jaw dropped as he watched the man's body shifting and changing back into the form of the girl that he didn't have the heart to dump and now may very well have to marry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny chuckled, her voice now back to normal along with the rest of her curvaceous body. \"Well, for starters, I can offer you an escape from your parents and access to any guy that you could ever want\" she said. \"Are you interested in that, Robbie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie looked down for a little and then back up. He had never been one to get intimidated easily, but the...thing that was possessing Jenny was certainly enough to do that. \"I...I'm interested....Jonny\" he said, not sounding sure what to call this being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just call me Jenny!\" she said with a girlish giggle. \"Like I said, I'll be wearing her for awhile, so you may as well get used to it\" she said. \"Anyway, as you know I have a very attractive roommate. When Jenny described her to me, I thought she'd just be cute, but now that I can see her in my memories, I see that she's stunning. Clearly not as attractive as sexy little me, but she's no pushover. Plus she's a cheerleader, and I hear they get all of those hot guys\" she said, licking her lips. The new Jenny could tell from Robbie's face that he was imagining having access to that. \"All you have to do is do those things that I asked you to. Then I'll get you into that sexy body and you can screw as many guys as you want whenever you want to. If for some reason you don't want her body, or you want me to just change your current body so you dont actually have to leave or something, we can always work something out. The only catch is that you move into my new house as Christina and help me out with achieving my goals. Do we have a deal, Robbie?\" Jenny asked, knowing that she had him right where she wanted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie nodded fairly quickly. \"Alright. I'll help you get what you want, Jonny\" he said. Suddenly, Jenny kissed him deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we're on the same team, Robbie\" she said, eyes glowing bright red. \"Now that we're in agreement, don't call me Jonny anymore. Like I told you before, call me Jenny. Or you can call me your mistress. Whichever you prefer...babe\" she said with a grin, glow fading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Robbie actually grinned back, clearly wanting to move into his new body as soon as possible. \"Whatever you say, Mistress Jenny\" he said with a wink. \"I'll go let my parents know that I'll be a husband soon\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go do that, dear. See you later\" Jenny said, kissing him on the lips gently before he got up and headed out the door. Jenny smiled as she watched her new asset leaving her soon to be former apartment. She put her legs up on the couch and laid down, looking up at the ceiling. Whatever should she do now? </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny maneuvered his host body through the isles that separated the tables.  Eventually, someone caught his eye.  Toward the back of the restaurant at a seat basically by herself sat a woman.  She seemed to be in her early forties with long red hair.  She sipped a drink by herself, and Johnny moved in closer.  She had a curvy and voluptuous figure.  Her age had begun to show a little bit with a couple small lines around her eyes and a slight pouch that had formed in her belly, plus breasts that sagged just ever so slightly but probably did not five years ago.  This wonderfully curvy figure was encased in a form-fitting green dress that showed off a blessed bounty of cleavage and left little to the imagination elsewhere.  The woman glanced about the restaurant seeming bored with the place.  \u201cTarget acquired,\u201d Johnny said as he grabbed a drink off the tray of some random waiter (a drink probably destined for someone else) and made his way to the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d Johnny said to the woman pleasantly, \u201cmay I sit?\u201d  The woman looked surprised.  \u201cI suppose,\u201d she said with a slight chuckle as she sipped her wine.  \u201cYou look stunning,\u201d Johnny said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d  The woman seemed surprised by the encounter.  \u201cLisa,\u201d she said, \u201cbut, since I\u2019m old enough to be your mother, I suppose the respectful thing would be for you to call me Mrs. Warner.\u201d  \u201cWell, Lisa,\u201d Johnny began, \u201cmy mother has been gone a very long time, and I assure you that you look nothing like her.\u201d  Lisa chuckled again, \u201cKid,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen folks like you, but I\u2019ve never heard a line quite like that before\u2014trying the \u2018my mom\u2019s gone\u2019 thing when you\u2019re . . . what?  Eighteen?  Just to get into my pants and say you\u2019ve been with a cougar?\u201d  Lisa said, dismissing Johnny\u2019s efforts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Johnny said, holding his hand to his chest in mock pain, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t think of you as a cougar; I just happen to prefer older, more mature women.  I bet you could show me a few things,\u201d Johnny said with a smile.  \u201cLike what?\u201d Lisa replied, \u201chow to do your taxes?\u201d She got up from the table, standing in such a way that put her wonderful boobs just about at Johnny\u2019s eye-level.  \u201cIt was a valiant effort kid,\u201d she said as she patted him on the shoulder, \u201cmaybe if my looks stay around for another ten years and you age enough that you can shave and your balls drop, then you can come and see me,\u201d she said as she sexily strutted off toward the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Johnny mused to himself, \u201cshe can do that while still having a soul . . . well-played, Lisa, well-played.\u201d  Johnny sat at the table for a moment before deciding he wasn\u2019t done trying yet, that it was time to step up his efforts.  Johnny concentrated for a moment and disappeared in a puff of black smoke, an even that went unnoticed by the drunken, self-absorbed guests.  In a blink, he reappeared in the women\u2019s restroom to which Lisa had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny appeared in the restroom and beheld a beautiful sight.  There in front of him was Lisa, her beautiful, round, motherly ass in full view and barely contained by her form-fitting dress as she bent over to wash her face.  \u201cIf it were not for your boobs, you would look better from this angle,\u201d Johnny opined.  Lisa jumped.  \u201cAaahh!\u201d she screamed, her eyes wide with surprise.  \u201cHow in the hell did you get in here you little shit?!\u201d  \u201cIs that language appropriate for a classy woman like you?\u201d Johnny asked nonchalantly, not the least bit unnerved by her obvious fear.  \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer, and I\u2019ll sue your for assault you little bastard!\u201d  she yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa,\u201d Johnny began, a hint of irritation now in his voice, \u201cI don\u2019t like your tone,\u201d he said as he held up his hand.  Tiny wisps of swirling red smoke emanated from his hand and made their way quickly toward Lisa as she sat wide-eyed.  They forced their way inside her nose and mouth, and she began to convulse and spasm.  Her voluptuous body jiggled and shook as the magic overpowered her.  Her full, middle-aged body fell roughly to the bathroom floor, unable to move as she lay awkwardly with her back to a wall.  Johnny looked down at her and saw that her breathing had quickened, and her eyes were wide with terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny walked Jack\u2019s body over to the paralyzed woman as fear gripped her.  He knelt down next to her and cleared his throat.  \u201cLisa, I think we got off on the wrong foot,\u201d he calmly began.  \u201cI think you now know that I\u2019m not a normal eighteen year old, despite my appearance.  In fact, I\u2019m not an 18-year-old at all; this meat suit, this body, this . . . Jack\u2014he\u2019s eighteen, but I\u2019m much older, and I am just riding around inside him because at the moment I find his skin to my liking.  I\u2019m a demon, you see,\u201d he started as he looked at Lisa, whose labored breathing continued and whose eyes were fixed on him.  She\u2019d turned white as a sheet as her captor had explained himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got many powers, Lisa, and you\u2019re under one of them right now,\u201d Johnny explained kindly.  \u201cSee, I can alter the bodies and minds of other people.  In your case, what I\u2019ve just done is stopped your brain from sending real signals to the rest of your body.  That\u2019s why you are still alive and conscious, but you have no motor function and so cannot move.  I\u2019ve never tried that trick before, but it seems to have worked well on you,\u201d he said with a little chuckle, patting Lisa\u2019s hand.  \u201cSpeaking of your body,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou really are very pretty, Lisa.  You may not be a 20-something swimsuit model, but a tiny bit of extra weight in the right places can make a woman jiggle just perfectly,\u201d he said as he motioned to her breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny stood, rubbing his chin as if to contemplate something.  \u201cLisa,\u201d he said, \u201cI need a base of operations.  This borrowed body of mine is a good start, but I need a house, a place to bring people, a place to call home.  As a demon, I need a place to consume human souls and make more slaves, and my meat suit will need food too if it is to survive.  I was hoping you could provide those things.  You seem to have money, you probably have friends, a job, all things that would help me,\u201d he said as he looked at her, her eyes still locked in terror upon him.  \u201cNow, I could just crawl my way inside that lovely body of yours myself, but I do so like this one for now,\u201d he said as he looked down at himself, \u201cso what I am probably going to do is a bit of mind control to just force you to do what I want you to do anyway,\u201d he declared.  \u201cBut, first, I\u2019d like to do the gentlemanly thing and get to know you a bit,\u201d he sad as he waved his hand, removing just enough of his spell that Lisa could now talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, what is your age?\u201d Johnny asked.  The woman lay still on the floor, her breathing still indicating obvious distress.  \u201cFo\u2026.For\u2026.Forty-one,\u201d she stammered.  \u201cAre you married, and do you have children?\u201d Johnny asked.  Lisa gulped, \u201c . . . . Boy\u2014Kyle\u2014he\u2019s 7 . . . li . . . lives with his father in New York.\u201d  \u201cAh, I see,\u201d Johnny said pleasantly.  \u201cDo you have any questions for me?\u201d he said to her.  She paused.  \u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d  \u201cWell,\u201d Johnny began, \u201cagain, your resources and your body are of use to me, so I\u2019m likely to just overpower your mind, but it is not necessarily essential that your soul remain inside your body, so I may decide to remove it at some point . . . still working that one out, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny glanced down at his watch.  \u201cOh my,\u201d he said, \u201clook at the time!  I\u2019ve enjoyed our chat, Lisa, really, but there\u2019s mayhem to reap, and we must be going.\u201d  Johnny brought his hand up, and Lisa\u2019s body magically followed, being magically lifted off the floor to a standing position right in front of the demon.  \u201cPlease no . . . \u201c Lisa said meekly as tears began to stream down her face.  Johnny shook his head slightly as he brought his hand up.  \u201cIt\u2019s necessary, my dear.  You\u2019re about to see the birth of a new world disorder,\u201d he said as he laid his hand firmly on the woman\u2019s shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her crying stopped, and her eyes shot wide open, glowing bright red like hot embers in a fire.  Her body jerked and shook a little bit as the magic fought its way inside her, and then it all stopped.  She closed her eyes and, when she opened them, she was not the same woman she had been.  She seemed tired, overcome.  She was not soulless, but certainly her mind was no longer her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack beheld his new creation, as the woman stood staring straight ahead in front of him.  \u201cYou look wonderful, my dear,\u201d he said.  \u201cTank you,\u201d she said.  \u201cIsn\u2019t it so much easier letting the magic take over than trying to all of that thinking for yourself?\u201d  \u201cIt is,\u201d she said, a slight smile creeping across her face.  \u201cBe a dear and bring the car around,\u201d Jonny instructed, \u201cI\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d  Lisa walked unquestioningly out of the restroom and toward the parking lot, while Jonny\u2019s mind swam with possibility.            <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny couldn't help but smile as he watched his newest acquisition walk out of the bathroom to go get her car. As his eyes followed the swaying of Lisa's sexy ass, he thought about how much easier his life would be now that he had  this gorgeous women to serve his every whim and make sure his current body remained alive as long as he needed it too. Things were going very well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the smug smile of conquest still on his young looking face, Jonny walked out of the bathroom and back into the Warehouse. Everyone in the club was too busy in their own personal world to notice the apparent teen leaving the Women's restroom. As Jonny slowly walked through the club towards the door, he looked around. He could practically smell the sin in the air. Old business men cheating on their wives with waitresses, cougars much like Lisa that were out looking for a fun break in their dull lives, sexy waitresses in tight, revealing uniforms that were making more money in this nightclub than others their age would be making in their entire lives. The amount of greed and temptation in this was simply too much to stop Jonny from smiling. Something told him that he would find himself a regular here before he knew it. It would be the perfect place for some feeding if he ever needed a spot. But in order to be assured of that, he would have to mark his territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny closed his eyes, and concentrated mentally on the demon that he had turned the old Jack into. When he opened the eyes again, He was looking at the possessed Katie, who looked confused before she noticed Jonny in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, man? I was enjoying myself!\" she exclaimed, clearly upset. Jonny realized she was wearing very little clothing and smirked. He snapped his fingers, making a short, tight dress appear on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but I have a job for you\" Jonny said, grinning. \"Trust me, you'll like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Katie asked, crossing her arms. \"I'm listening....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This club is a place that attracts only the richest of the rich. There's enough sin in here to feed a whole horde of demons. But I want it for myself.....So you're going to run it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie immediately smiled at the idea. Jonny remembered from Jack's memories that he had always wanted to run a fancy place like this, but never had any means to do it. She looked around the place, a new look of interest in her eyes. \"I reallllllyyyyyy like that idea, Jonny. But how exactly, do I take over this place?\" she asked, a clear look of desire in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out, shall we?\" Jonny asked, wrapping his arms around the apparent girl before as he walked with her over to one of the waitresses. \"Take us to the owner of this fine establishment\" he told her, his eyes glowing red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red glow was echoed in the waitresses eyes before she even had a chance to respond with her own will. \"Right this way, sir\" she said, leading the two possessed teenagers to a back room that was practically hidden by curtains in the corner. Jonny opened the door and walked in with Katie seeing a large black man with a beard and gold rimmed glasses. He was clearly very wealthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are you two?\" he asked, in a strong, confident voice. It was the type of voice that was used to getting things his way. Jonny assumed that he was even a mobster of some kind and had probably killed several people before finding this nice gig as owner here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Jonny and this sexy young woman is Katie. Two things are going to happen before the two of us leave. The first thing is that you are going to write up and sign a legally binding contract that sells this building, and all assets associated with it to me. You'll still be the face here, keeping things in line, but I will own this establishment and have complete say on what you do with it. After that, you're going to hire Katie here to be your head waitress. She's going to be my eyes and ears. You treat her as if she's me and do everything she tells you to. Got it?\" Jonny asked, not wasting any time with his demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea, friend,\" the man said, getting up and reaching into his jacket pocket, pulling out a golden revolver. \"How about I shoot you through the head right now, and then have my fun with your little girlfriend\" he says, pulling the trigger and shooting at you. The last thing he expected was for Jonny's entire body to  disappear and reappear behind him with your hand on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I have to make a meal out of you after all\" Jonny said, pulling the man's soul out of his body and devouring it within seconds. Then he walks around to face the man. \"Now put your gun in your pocket and type out that contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Jonny proudly exited the club, holding his new deed in his hand. As the automatic doors closed behind him, Jonny saw the car waiting. It was a very nice foreign model that he knew was one of the most expensive on the market currently. He opened the door and got in the passenger seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have very nice tastes, Lisa\" he said with a smile as he put the deed for the club into his pocket and then rested his hand on Lisa's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Lisa said in her marvelous voice as she started to drive away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you curious what took me so long, Lisa?\" Jonny asked, moving his hand up and down her leg as she drove. He noticed a smile on Lisa's face from the contact as she shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. It's my job to take care of you, and that's it. You'll have to ask if you also want me to be interested in your personal life, Master\" she said with a slight smile. That caused Jonny to laugh. He was glad that he only fiddled with her mind and didn't take her soul. This way, she still had her attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that you called me your master just now, Lisa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would, Master\" she said, this time adding more of a flavour when she said it, causing Jonny to smile again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you worked as a Lawyer. How much money do you have saved from that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought for a second before responding. \"I have enough money saved up for myself that I can retire at any time. The only reason that I don't is because I give a large portion of that money to my ex husband so that he can raise my son properly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not going to have that anymore. If you're going to be mine, you can't also be yourself. Tomorrow morning you are going to retire from work and stop sending that money to your ex. He can get off of his lazy ass and support the kid himself instead of relying on you. All of the money you have saved from now on will be used for whatever I want it used for. You won't be spending anything on yourself. After retiring, you will immediately start your new life as my personal maid, making sure that I remain healthy and happy. Understand all that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nods. \"Yes master. tomorrow I'll retire from my law firm and become your maid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" Jonny said as a smile grew on his face. Lisa had pulled her car into a huge estate. It was easily the largest house that Jonny had ever seen, complete with several acres of land around it. This was going to be even more fun than he thought....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny exited the car as Lisa pulled it into the garage, one filled with several sports cars probably worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  As he walked around to her side of the car, Lisa was punching something into her phone.  \u201cJust made the change so that the automatic child support payments stop,\u201d she said.  \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d said Johnny as the two entered the house.  \u201cNow the money\u2019s all yours, just like I am,\u201d she said.  Johnny beheld a grand entry area, complete with an ornate chandelier and shining marble floors.  The room glittered with expensive antiques and china and, as Johnny walked through, he beheld a couple pictures on the mantle of a grand fireplace.  \u201cIs this one you with the mayor?\u201d he asked.  \u201cThe Governor, actually,\u201d she answered, \u201che gave me an award for helping raise a bunch of money for homeless children.\u201d  Johnny chuckled a bit.  \u201cIronic,\u201d he thought, given the whole reason for his being in the house at all.  Johnny next saw a beautiful picture of Lisa, red hair flowing down from her head, next to a small boy seeming to be about four.  He had blonde hair with curls, and he wore a Batman shirt out for what looked like a day at the beach.  \u201cIs this one your son?\u201d he asked Lisa, who had gone into the other room for something.  \u201cYup,\u201d she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t get to see him much.\u201d  \u201cYou have me now anyway,\u201d Johnny answered.  \u201cI do, Master,\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked around the impressive living room and looked at various pictures of Lisa with a wide assortment of people\u2014city officials, state officials, even a couple Senators.  He could hear Lisa in her bedroom doing something as he shoed himself around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air changed.  It quickly dropped a few degrees, and John looked quickly up to see that the lights in the room had dimmed for a couple seconds only to quickly return to their brightness.  \u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d Jonny said to himself, a hint of panic in his voice.  Jonny knew what this meant.  \u201cFucking right it\u2019s not,\u201d Jonny heard from behind him.  He quickly spun around to see the beautiful and voluptuous Lisa.  She walked sexily toward him, her wide, child-bearing hips swaying from side to side and her breasts jiggling as she walked.  She had put on a silk robe, a black one that had a neckline that plunged so much her boobs nearly fell out of the top.  The robe only went down to her mid-thighs, so the whole image was one that left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that the voice Jonny had heard was not Lisa\u2019s; it was decidedly more masculine.  It belonged to the old man!  \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d Jonny demanded, angry that the old man had presumed to force his crusty old essence inside Lisa\u2019s wonderful body.  \u201cWell, I just came to check up on my star player, Jonny,\u201d the old man said, still using his voice as he came to a stop and crossed Lisa\u2019s arms across her wonderful chest, \u201cSee, I felt a surge of energy when you used all that power recently, so I came to have a look at your handiwork.  I came to find, not bedlam, not mayhem, not horror, or fear, or anything like that.  Instead, I found a restaurant complete with a former manager whose big fat body you neglected to get rid of, not to mention a new manager who is really a demon you\u2019ve got riding around inside the meat suit of a college student whose boobs he likes to play with!\u201d  The old man paused again.  Jonny gulped.  He went on, \u201cSo of course I thought I should come and see you directly, and of course I find, yet again, a resounding absence of chaos and death and destruction and, in the place of those wonderful thing which I specifically instructed you to reap, I find you having jumped inside this barely pubescent meat sack of a twerp, which I suppose is fine enough by itself, but you have also seen fit make a love slave out of this cougar I\u2019m currently inside just so you can tell her to quit her job and wait on you hand and foot and immerse you in a vast sea of estrogen and mom jeans, so . . . \u201c the man paused again, seeming to want to collect his thoughts.  Jonny was sweating somewhat profusely by this point.  The old man raised Lisa\u2019s hand and brought it toward himself.  With that, Jonny, still inside Jack\u2019s body, levitated a good four feet off the floor and floated toward the possessed Lisa, stopping a few feet from her.  \u201c . . . I\u2019m wondering how all of these decisions of yours, fine as each may be by itself, fits into the mission I gave you,\u201d the man concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused, still floating there in front of the woman who used to be his slave.  \u201cI have a plan too,\u201d Jonny began, eliciting a quizzical look on Lisa\u2019s face that suggested the man wanted to hear more.  \u201cThis body I\u2019m in . . . this, Jack . . . I need this body alive if I\u2019m going to use it, and I need a base of operations for which to do everything else.  I need a place to acquire new souls, hence the restaurant filled with greedy old men and slutty women of all ages.  I need a place my minions can come to see me, hence the house we\u2019re in now.  Lisa has money, friends, and all the stuff I need to insert myself into the fabric of this town, and I can grow from there.  Plus, have you bothered to take a look at Lisa\u2019s ass; it\u2019s really quite wonderful.\u201d The old man paused, seeming to ponder everything Jonny had told him.  Suddenly, Jonny was no longer levitated, and he fell roughly and quickly to he ground.  He lay there for a moment before slowly picking himself up.  \u201cFair points all,\u201d the man said, \u201cusing Lisa\u2019s hands to feel around her body a bit, \u201cand, no, I had not noticed her ass, but now that you mention it,\u201d he said with a lecherous smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny straightened his tie.  \u201cOk, Jonny,\u201d the man said, resting Lisa\u2019s hands on her hips.  H walked up to Jonny inside Lisa\u2019s body and looked down upon Jonny, as Lisa was bigger than Jonny\u2019s meat suit was.  \u201cI see now that you had a reason for all this, but the time for action approaches.  So do get to the mayhem.  Sooooooon,\u201d and as he said that final word, black smoke began to emerge from Lisa\u2019s mouth.  The smoke swirled and slithered and forced its way out of her voluptuous body, causing the delightful bit of jiggling in all the right places.  Jonny stood quietly, not having felt that level of fear in a long time.  Lisa\u2019s body collapsed roughly face-down to the floor.  After a couple seconds, she stirred.  She slowly got up, her breasts bouncing wonderfully as she stood.  \u201cWha\u2014what happened?\u201d she said as she held her hand to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cI was in the bathroom and my robe was on, and I saw this old man suddenly appear in front of me.  I don\u2019t know how he got there.  I said \u2018Who are you?\u2019  He just said \u2018For now, I am you,\u2019 and then he walked toward me, and I blacked out.\u201d  Lisa looked around as if expecting something to jump out at her.  She then looked to Jonny, \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d she said, obvious worry in her voice and on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were possessed,\u201d Jonny said matter-of-factly.  She paused, \u201cYou mean someone was inside my body other than me?\u201d she said.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Jonny answered, \u201cjust like I\u2019m inside Jack\u2019s body.\u201d  Lisa was obviously perturbed.  Her breathing quickened.  \u201cSom\u2014someone tried to take me from you, Master?!\u201d she said, her emotions rising.  \u201cNo, someone just wanted to send me a message, and he did.  I\u2019m sorry he used your body to do it,\u201d Jonny said as he stepped forward and placed his hand on her shoulder.  Within a couple seconds, her eyes took on a familiar red glow and her body went limp as Jonny crawled around inside her mind and removed the unpleasant memories and emotions.  Within a couple seconds after that, the woman looked back up, alert again.  \u201cThank you, Master,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved seductively toward Jack\u2019s possessed body.  Jonny reached his hand around and grabbed the woman\u2019s wonderful ass firmly, lifting her clean off the ground as she wrapped her legs clear around his waist.  \u201cNow we\u2019re cooking,\u201d she said, as the two hastened off into bliss for the evening.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the morning, Jonny opened his eyes to the lovely smell of pancakes. He sat up in bed and smiled, seeing Lisa standing in front of the bed, holding a plate of freshly made food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Master\" she said with a smile, bringing Jonny his food. Jonny grinned as he took it from her and took a big bite. It had been forever since Jonny had a home cooked meal. In fact, the last time he remembered one was back when he was still a human, long before the incident that lead to him becoming what he was now. \"How did you sleep, Master?\" Lisa asked, sitting down on the bed and crossing slender legs. She was dressed in a form fitting dress that was short enough to show quite a bit of her legs, but still long enough for it not to be considered too slutty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept well, for the small amount of time that were were actually sleeping\" Jonny said with a grin. Lisa chuckled at that remark. \"You were very good in bed, Lisa. I'm impressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master. I have lots of experience\" she said with a proud smile on her face as she got up and took your now empty plate. \"I see that someone was hungry this morning. Shall I get you some more food, Master?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I've had enough. Don't want to make Jack's body too fat, now do I? By the way....why are you dressed for work? I thought you would have quit like I told you to before I got up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked nervous to answer, as if she was scared of Jonny's response. \"Well....you see.....\" she twiddled her fingers nervously a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Lisa....\" Jonny said, looking right at her as he attempted to sound reassuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Master\" Lisa said, taking a deep breath in. \"I decided not to quit. I called in and said that I would be late to work instead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny raised an eyebrow at that. \"So, you disobeyed me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down in shame and nodded. \"Yes, Master. I'm sorry...It's just that I had an idea that I think you will approve of....if you still want me to quit after you hear that idea, then I'll do so immediately for you\" she said, clearly not liking that she had disobeyed her master. Jonny smiled at that. It meant he did an excellent job when he made her into his slave. Lisa truly loved him and would do anything to help him, but she still had enough of her own free will and personality to make decisions like this. Even when she disobeyed, she knew where her loyalty lied and felt bad about it. Jonny really had to give himself credit for his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Tell me your idea, Lisa. I'm all ears\" Jonny said, jokingly making several extra pairs of ears appear on his stolen head before making them disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laughed at the joke, and her smile was enough to brighten up the whole room. \"Well Master, I'm one of the executives in charge of the law firm that I work at. I'm very highly paid, very successful, and very well liked by everyone else. I always have meetings with very important people and today I have a meeting with the chief of police for the town. I thought you wouldn't mind having an easy way to go in and get her on our side.\"  Jonny looked at Lisa for a few seconds with a very stern look on his face. Lisa looked down, sadly, thinking that she had disappointed her master. \"I'm sorry, Master. I'll call the office and quit...\" she said but was interrupted by a kiss on the lips from Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be ashamed about Lisa\" Jonny said with a smile on his face. \"In fact, you did the right thing. I have a very big idea with this town, and having the police force on my side will absolutely help me with that. So here's what you're going to do. Call the police chief and tell her that something has come up and unfortunately you'll have to meet at your house instead of at the office. Have her come over as soon as possible and then I'll get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master\" Lisa said with a smile as she left the room. Jonny smiled as he laid back down in bed and listened to his slave dialing the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours of plotting later, Lisa opened the door and greeted her guest. Selina McCarthy was the police chief of the town for the past 5 years, and despite being a shockingly beautiful woman in her mid 40s, she had done a better job than almost all of the people in her position before her. Lisa, who was a close friend of Selina's since the two had grown up together, explained to Jonny that she was so good at her job because she wanted to prove to everyone int he town that a woman who was relatively young could do just as good of a job, if not a better job than any man could. Not only that, but Selina was described to Jonny by Lisa as being \"dangerously idealistic.\" She had a very black and white view of justice and was always the one to do the right thing in any situation. She wouldn't let anything bad, or even overly immoral happen under her watch. She even had her sights on The Warehouse and had wanted to close it and get its owner behind bars for quite awhile. She was supposedly close to getting a warrant for the now former owner's arrest. That was yet another reason that Jonny would have to step in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Selina, its been too long\" Lisa said with a smile as she hugged her friend. Selina, wearing a fashionable business suit with her police badge on the jacket, hugged back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really has. Who's the kid?\" Selina asked, noticing Jonny sitting in a chair, supposedly reading a novel. Jonny looked up and waived as Lisa came up with an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's Jonnny Ross. I'm watching him for the day while his mother is away. They're family friends from out of town. Can I get you some coffee?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds great\" Selina said with a smile as her and Lisa walked into the kitchen, which was connected to Lisa's home office. Jonny watched them go as he planned what to do next. There were several options in front of him. He knew that he wanted this to be fun. He didn't want just another slave like Lisa. He wanted something really creative done with the chief, like removing all those pesky morals from her before making her serve him. That or maybe he'd just take her over and be done with it. Sure, he wouldn't get to be as lazy, but this police chief had a great body. Then again, he'd gone through such an effort to secure this base of operations and make sure his Jack body would stay alive and in good health. Then again, Jonny remembered he had Cals power of possessing people with clones of himself... Hmmm, that to do....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa and Selina walked back in to the living room and sat down across the table from each other, Lisa on the same side a Jonny, and Selina across from them both.  The police chief aged 44, sat pleasantly and politely at the table.  Where Lisa\u2019s hair was as red as a fresh flame, Selina\u2019s was jet black.  It was pulled back in a very business-like and utilitarian pony tail to keep it from flopping around very much.  The officer was about five foot six, with a frame that was still fairly muscular.  Her breasts, though, had begun to sag as she aged a bit, and her belly was not quite as toned as, say, her arms.  She wore a black suit-jacket sort of top with a simple, button-down white shirt buttoned all the way up, as any true professional would have done, despite a chest very much worth showing off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo about the gathering, Selina,\u201d Lisa began, \u201csince it\u2019s on the roof of the office building where my firm is, the senior partner in charge would like me to take a particular interest in making sure that the Mayor and the various state-level dignitaries are safe, as task that falls mostly to you, of course.\u201d  Selina smiled back, \u201cWell yes of course we take security very seriously, Lisa, and so we plan to be out in full force, with uniformed officers at the entrance to the building, by the elevators, and of course many on the roof of the building itself where the gathering will be.  Most will be in their full, formal officers\u2019 uniforms, while some will be in tuxes and evening gowns mingling with the crowd to pop up should there be any trouble.\u201d  \u201cHow many officers in total are scheduled for the event?\u201d Lisa said.  \u201cIn all, about one hundred in various capacities,\u201d Selina replied.  \u201cOkay,\u201d Lisa said as she scribbled on a piece of paper, \u201cand who will be responsible for guarding the Mayor specifically?\u201d  Selina thought for a moment.  \u201cThat would be Officers Brown and Sletkov, two of our best,\u201d she replied.  Lisa scribbled again and sipped her coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are you guys handling getting ready for this and testifying at the Martinez trial at the same time?\u201d Lisa asked, and Selina relaxed a little bit as the conversation had moved to a different topic.  She took another gulp of her tea.  \u201cWell of course it\u2019s a struggle,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cthe prosecutors and defense guys are in and out all the time prepping the witnesses who work for the police department, so we have to make sure everyone has time to do that.  But it\u2019s all part of the a day\u2019s work for a cop sworn to put drug dealers like Martinez away, and it\u2019s a huge bust for us.  We actually have the bills with traces of drugs on them, so we feel good about where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet that\u2019s\u2014\u201c Lisa began, but you cut her off.  \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Jonny chimed in.  Selina looked surprised at the question and at the interruption.  \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got the evidence in the lock-up, fingerprints on it and all, so I think we\u2019re good,\u201d Selina responded again.  Jonny leaned forward in the chair.  \u201cBut what if the evidence came up missing?\u201d he said with a smile.  Selina scoffed, \u201cYoung man,\u201d she said, sitting up straight, \u201cthat would impugn the credibility of my officers and me, and we run a very tight ship.  I would never allow that to happen.\u201d  Jonny laughed audibly.  Selina seemed to be getting irritated at the indignant nature of the young man.  \u201cYou mean to tell me you\u2019ve never considered boosting the cash yourself, jetting off to Miami, and getting a nice tan on those wonderful jugs of yours?\u201d Jonny said as a look of shock came across Selina\u2019s face.  \u201cLisa are you going to let this boy talk\u2014\u201c she began, but Jonny cut her off too.  \u201cLisa will do whatever I tell her to do, and she\u2019ll like it,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa sat looking across the table at Selina in silence and with a slight smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny reached across the table and grabbed Selina firmly by the hand.  His eyes began to grow a bright red, and hers followed suit immediately.  The uptight, middle-aged officer just seemed to relax suddenly, sinking into her chair like a tired person falls to a bed in a heap.  Jonny stood up and walked calmly to the other side of the table, this time putting his hand on Selina\u2019s shoulders.  \u201cSee, I think you actually would allow that to happen,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI think that beautiful big-breasted body of yours is overworked and underpaid.  I think under the state retirement system your pension won\u2019t be any good to your for another 13 years,\u201d he said as he bent down, whispering these things now into Selina\u2019s ear.  \u201cThirteen years,\u201d she said, seeming half asleep.  \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Jonny said, \u201cand what do you care if one drug dealer gets off \u2018cause you took a little money.  What are the cops going to do with that money anyway?  Probably use it to put food in Martinez\u2019s mouth when he\u2019s in jail.  Wouldn\u2019t you rather take the money yourself and use it for something good?  Isn\u2019t it your time to enjoy yourself?\u201d Jonny said, as his eyes and those of this enthralled companion still glowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s . . . bad \u2018an . . . \u2018an . . . \u2018an I\u2019m . . . cop,\u201d she said groggily.  \u201cOh I admire your devotion to purpose officer, I really do,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cbut here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d  Jonny came around to the front of the officer and physically sat himself upon her lap.  He was mere inches from her eyes as they glowed red like embers, and Jonny pushed her with all his psychic might.  \u201cLater today, you\u2019re going to go to work.  When you get there and walk by the evidence room, you\u2019re going to stop what you\u2019re doing and unlock the door and go in.  You won\u2019t be sure why you\u2019re doing it, but just know that part of you thinks you deserve it after all these years.  And you\u2019ll be right.  When you go into the evidence room, you\u2019re going to take the money that is the evidence in the Martinez drug case, and you\u2019re going to put it in your work bag.  Leave the police station.  Take the money, and, on the way home from work, stop at the most expensive clothing store in town.  Take the drug money, and buy yourself the most beautiful gown you can find.  Make sure that it hugs your every luscious, full, voluptuous curve.  Make sure that it puts to rest once and for all any notion that curvy women in their forties cannot be absolute knock-outs.  Then drive to this very home, and knock on the door.  I will have more work for you.  Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer sat silently for a moment, her entire body lax.  \u201cI understand,\u201d she said, just before passing out.  Jonny took a very deep breath.  He realized he\u2019d been shaking.  When he tried to climb off the officer, his balance was a little bit off.  He went to scratch his nose only to realize that it was bleeding.  \u201cMaster!\u201d Lisa yelled with worry as Jonny fell weakly into her arms, having tried to stand too quickly, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong, Master?\u201d she asked, scared.  \u201cI usually don\u2019t try to maintain a psychic link for that long, and she really fought me, but I beat her.  She\u2019ll do as she was told,\u201d Jonny said as he gingerly stood.  He took a few deep breaths to compose himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny reached down and grabbed the keys from the belt of the unconscious Selina, and he threw them to Lisa.  \u201cTake our dangerously idealistic friend home.  I fucked with her mind pretty good, but she\u2019ll wake before long.  When she does, make sure you see that she will be all right.  Tell her that, especially as a public official on duty, she really should be careful about drinking so much by an early hour like 9 AM, and tell her that the Mayor will probably want to see her for having missed a chunk of work today.  She\u2019ll want to make sure she composes herself properly before she goes for that meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny began to slowly walk up to the bedroom.  \u201cAre you all right, Master?\u201d Lisa says, still concerned.  Jonny pauses, \u201cI will be, now do as I told you.\u201d  With that, up he went.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny found a comfortable chair and sat down as he watched Lisa taking her friend to her car. Lisa's little errand would probably take a little while, which suited Jonny fine. Right now, he just wanted to rest. His stolen body was sweating terribly, and his nose was still bleeding, though not as much as before. His head was hurting him too. Jonny didn't remember being in this much physical distress since he himself was human a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny breathed long, deep breathes, and closed his eyes, trying to relax and get the wind back in him. If nothing else, this experience showed him that his body was  fragile, human. Demon or not, Jonny's powers were not unlimited yet, like the old man's appeared to be. The way he understood it, his demonic powers were like a muscle that had to be trained and stretched over time. He overexerted himself to compensate for Selina's strong will. Even though he succeeded in the long run, he was weak now. He'd have to get his strength back somehow....humans would get energy by eating, so then perhaps the best thing for him to do now would be to go out and find a soul to devour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood up from the chair. He was balanced now, but still felt weak. As if he hadn't eaten in days. He walked slowly across the room, looking around the empty house that might as well belong to him. It really was huge and very nice. Still, that didn't help him much. He heard footsteps behind him and nearly jumped. Lisa was standing there, smiling at him, but a look of concern was clearly in her eyes. \"Master, you're awake!\" she exclaimed happily.\"I was so worried about you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake?\" Jonny asked, frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"Yes, Master. I came back about half an hour ago and found you fast asleep on the chair. You looked so tired and peaceful that I didn't want to disturb you by trying to move you to the bed\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I probably really needed the time to rest up. How is the police chief? And what are you doing right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selina is doing fine. I gave her a nice talking to about drinking at such an early hour and helped her back to her feet. She was complaining about her pension not being enough so I think your fiddling worked wonders for her. I was just in the middle of preparing a little something for you to eat for lunch...\" she said but was interrupted by Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that. Get your car keys and drive me to my club. I know exactly what kind of nutritious mean I need.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jonny was dropped off outside of The Warehouse. It was strange seeing the club in the day time, but Jonny knew it would still be populated enough to feed him the way he wanted. \"Wait for me in the car. I won't be too long\" Jonny said as he got out and went into the club. To say it was empty compared to how it was the last time he was there would be the ultimate understatement, but it wasn't too bad. There was a handful of customers and lots of waitresses. Jonny didn;t even care who he ate right now, all he had to do was feed. He pulled the first waitress he saw to the side. She was young and in her mid twenties with a good looking body. Not that that mattered right now. He put his hand on the girl's shoulder and held her against the corner wall, out of sight from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great speed, he pulled the girl's soul from her body and devoured it. Jonny's eyes glowed brightly and he took a nice deep breathe as his strength returned to him.  \"Mmmmm, I knew keeping this club around was a good idea!\" he exclaimed as he felt his strength returning as the waitresses soul was absorbed into his demonic essence, recharging his energy. In fact, he felt stronger than ever now than he did before using his powers to that huge extent. It was such a rush! Jonny pulled the waitress into a kiss that she returned, but not with much passion, probably due to being newly soulless. \"What's your name?\" Jonny asked with a cocky grin on his young looking face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress smiled at him, looking at him with her empty, soulless eyes as her body's personality came back out. \"My name is Julia, Master\" she said, fixing her ruffled skirt as Jonny backed away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Julia. When you have a chance, make sure you tell Katie that you're one of mine now. You'll do everything that she tells you to as if she were me. Besides that, act normal and continue your life as it was. Feel free to stop by this address if you get bored\" he says, writing down Lisa's address and slipping it into the waitresses breast pocket. Jonny smiled as he walked out of the club, a new confidence in his steps. </span></div></div>",

Jonny then walked in to the great room and turned on the TV, removing his shoes and plopping Jack\u2019s body on to the couch.  Lisa followed.  \u201cAnd the police chief assured us today that her finest officers would be in attendance, and the rooftop gala tomorrow night would go off without a hitch,\u201d said the newscaster just as the broadcast came to a close.  Jonny chuckled, \u201cNope,\u201d he said with a laugh, knowing what he had planned.  Jonny flipped through a few more channels as the minutes passed.  \u201cMaster?\u201d came Lisa\u2019s voice next to him, \u201cmay I ask you something?\u201d  \u201cYes,\u201d Jonny said pleasantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused and looked down, seeming unsure how to say what she wished to say.  After a minute or two, she began, \u201cUm, you could have any woman you wanted.  You could have a woman with a perfect ten body at the age of 24, complete with a belly and an ass you could bounce a quarter off of all day, and without the inconvenience of any personality trait you didn\u2019t like.  Just a perfectly willing sex-bot with exactly the personality you wanted.\u201d  \u201cYeah, I could . . . \u201c Jonny said.  \u201cBut you pick me,\u201d she said flatly.  \u201cWhat do you mea\u2014\u201c Jonny began.  Lisa explained, \u201cWell, as you may have noticed, I\u2019m in my forties, and I could really be your mother, or at least the mother of the body you\u2019re in.  When Selina came earlier, the most convenient story was that I was watching you while your parents were away.  I\u2019m, well, I\u2019m not a perfect ten, as my husband made sure to loudly and drunkenly inform me as he groped his pregnant secretary in front of me and then left the state with her and my son,\u201d she said, her voice quivering.  \u201cMy\u2014my belly has a tiny bit of extra bounce to it because there\u2019s this little bit of extra weight that I haven\u2019t been able to shake since I had my son.  I just can\u2019t lose those last ten or fifteen pounds.  And my boobs are basically the same way.  I\u2019ve got a couple small lines around my eyes,\u201d she said as she played for a moment with her face, \u201cand my hips and my ass fill out a set of mom jeans perfectly\u2014mom jeans!\u201d she said.  \u201cThe thing is, Jonny, I\u2019m okay with that stuff about me and about my body, but I don\u2019t understand why you are, \u2018cause you don\u2019t have to be,\u201d she said, looking expectantly at you.  \u201cAnd, I\u2019m not complaining at all,\u201d she hastened to say, \u201cI love that you found me in the restaurant that night and made me yours, but why?\u201d she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused.  He wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to handle those questions, but he felt he should.  \u201cI\u2019ve never thought that the perfect ten bodies were the best ones,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI mean, they\u2019re good for a fuck on occasion, but I have a tough time being attracted to a woman whose arms, legs, and stomach are so firm and toned that she just looks like she could kick my ass,\u201d Jonny explained with a slight chuck.  \u201c\u2019Course, as long as I\u2019m in this body, little Suzie down the street with the lemonade stand could probably kick my ass, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d  Lisa laughed.  \u201cBut younger women don\u2019t always know what they want,\u201d he said seriously, \u201ctheir lives are masses of make-up and whatever it is that makes spray tans, with an abundance of drama about boys thrown in.\u201d  Jonny paused to collect his next set of thoughts, \u201cBut women your age know what they want.  You bound out into the world, tits jiggling about, and attack the world with a confidence and sexiness that go beyond a physical beauty that eventually passes anyway.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused, trying to understand what she had just been told.  \u201cMaster, are you trying to say that you lo\u2014\u201c and then suddenly three loud knocks at the door intrude on their intimacy.  \u201cThat\u2019ll be the chief,\u201d Jonny said as he immediately jumped up, \u201cgame time!\u201d he said as he sprinted to the door.  Lisa slowly stood up and followed.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should answer it; you\u2019re her friend,\u201d Jonny said, and Lisa threw open the door, revealing Selina in an absolutely stunning gown.  \u201cHow\u2019s it going girl!\u201d Lisa said as she welcomed the buxom cop into her home.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUm, it\u2019s been an interesting day,\u201d Selina responded somewhat unenthusiastically.  As she stepped into the house, Jonny got a look at her.  There she stood, her professional police garb gone and replaced by a beautiful black gown.  The gown hugged her every beautiful curve and had a neckline so low it seemed as though her own boobs were fighting to get out of the dress.  Thin spaghetti straps reached over her shoulder and seemed that they might snap is the mounds on her chest bounced around too much.  The gown flowed gracefully over her belly and hugged her hips, showing off her cushy rear end.  The lower part of the dress included a large slit that traveled much of the way up the dress, thus exposing a great deal of Selina\u2019s toned, muscular leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the dress?\u201d Lisa asked with mock curiosity, as she already knew what Jonny had made Selina do.  \u201cUm,\u201d the officer began, her eyes quickly darting around as she searched for an answer, \u201cI arranged to rent it from the store.  I told them the occasion, and they gave me a heavy discount,\u201d she said, seeming uncertain of herself.  Jonny chuckled, knowing that was a lie.  Selina\u2019s morals were slipping away already.  \u201cWell come on in and sit down,\u201d Lisa said.  Selina stepped further in and, upon seeing Jonny, she stopped in her tracks.  She looked at him as though trying to place him.  She raised her hand in his direction.  \u201cUm, you,\u201d she said, wracking her brain, the same one Jonny had played with so much earlier that day, \u201cyou\u2019re\u2014ah\u2014the kid, uh,\u201d she stumbled about.  \u201cThis is Jonny,\u201d she said, casting a warm smile in your direction, \u201cI\u2019m watching him while his mom\u2019s out of town.\u201d  \u201cMy mom\u2019s long gone,\u201d Jonny said with a slight laugh as he politely shook the officer\u2019s hand.  She seemed distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what brings you here, Selina?\u201d Lisa inquired, \u201cand what prompted you to wear the beautiful dress?  The gala isn\u2019t until tomorrow,\u201d Lisa said.  Selina put her hands on her hips, pausing thoughtfully for a moment.  \u201cYou know, now that you mention it, I don\u2019t know why I came by, I mean, what I came by for, I mean, yeah\u2014\u201c the frazzled officer said.  \u201cI was driving home, and coming here just seemed like the right thing to do for some reason . . . same deal with the dress.  Don\u2019t know why I wore it, really.  This whole day\u2019s been weird,\u201d she said, \u201cum, can I make use of your restroom real quick?\u201d she said.  \u201cSure, right through there,\u201d Lisa said, pointing the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer walked off, clutching her bag from work as though it contained her very soul.  Truth be told, it did still contain a bunch of drug money, whatever part she had not needed to buy the dress she now wore.  Lisa and Jonny stood and watched as she walked off.  \u201cIs it working, Master?\u201d Lisa said quietly as she looked down at her Jonny\u2019s borrowed body, \u201cIs it going according to plan?\u201d she asked giddily, like a kid asking about Christmas presents.  \u201cIt is,\u201d Jonny said simply, \u201cSelina\u2019s a lost lamb.  Her life\u2019s not her own, now, though it was so recently.  She\u2019s stolen evidence in a way she knows contradicts her own character.  She\u2019s bought a fancy new dress with that stolen evidence.  She drover all the way over here not really knowing why, and she\u2019s wearing the ill-gotten fruits of her own theft, again for reasons she cannot figure out.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s clay in your hands, Master,\u201d Lisa said with a smile, \u201clike me.\u201d  Jonny paused.  \u201cGoing in for the kill,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny disappeared in a sudden puff of black smoke.  He reappeared instantly inside Lisa\u2019s bathroom, where Selina was examining herself in the mirror and trying to do away with the bags around her eyes that came with being tired.  Immediately upon seeing Jonny in the mirror, Selina spun around, instinctively putting her hand to her waste to go for a gun that she didn\u2019t have because she had no uniform.  A look of terror filled her face.  \u201cWhat are you?!\u201d she demanded, \u201cyou\u2019re not just some kid Lisa knows!\u201d  Jonny laughed.  \u201cWhy, I\u2019m nothing at all my dear officer but a figment of your imagination.  I\u2019m nothing at all.  The kid\u2019s outside with Lisa chatting away with her.  How could I be him if I\u2019m out there, and you never heard the door to the bathroom open?\u201d  Selina paused, trying to work out that logic in her tired mind.  \u201cNo,\u201d she said defiantly, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy, and I\u2019m not seeing things,\u201d she said, backing away to the wall as Jonny stepped closer with a smile.  \u201cNot crazy,\u201d he said, just very tired, huh Selina?\u201d he said as he reached up and grabbed the officer by the shoulders firmly.  His eyes filled with a familiar red, and hers did the same as her body relaxed.  \u201cYou\u2019re hallucinating this whole thing.  It\u2019s just an after-effect of all that drinking you did earlier,\u201d Jonny said, his power again reshaping Selina\u2019s mind, which was like mush now after the morning.  \u201cDrinking,\u201d Selina mumbled.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI need to be at the gala tomorrow so that I can start my little game in motion, and you\u2019re going to help me do that.  See, Selina, you\u2019ve never been especially attracted to younger men before, but you have to admit that Jonny kid outside is pretty cute, and you need a plus one for the gala tomorrow anyway.  His body may be a little bit on the scrawny side, but it\u2019s better than all the cops with their jiggle-prone bellies, expanded over the years by too many doughnuts,\u201d he said.  \u201cJonny . . . cute,\u201d Selina echoed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to do the polite thing and, when Jonny walks you to your car, you\u2019re going to ask him to attend the event tomorrow as your date.  You know this is an unusual arrangement, but you feel what you feel nonetheless, so you\u2019re going to give it a go.  Jonny will accept, and you will arrange to have your wonderful tits here at this house at 5 PM in order to pick him up.\u201d  The officer sat, her mouth hanging open.  \u201cFive,\u201d she said.  \"And tomorrow before the evening begins, you are going to absolutely make sure that Jonny gets to meet one of the officers who will guard the Mayor.  This absolutely MUST happen,\" Jonny emphasized.  \"Must happen,\" Selina echoed.  \u201cGood,\u201d Jonny cut in, now removing his hands from her.  The red glow in their eyes faded as Selina collapsed limply to the bathroom floor, and Jonny disappeared in a puff of smoke, just as he had come.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the main room, Jonny was nonchalantly talking to Lisa about a random subject. It was just pointless chatter to pass the time while Selina was in the bathroom. After a few more minutes of bullshitting their conversation, Selina stumbled back into the room, looking very confused and dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Selina?\" Lisa asked, getting up and walking over to her friend with Jonny close behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked at Jonny and blush briefly came over her face before she turned back to Lisa. \"Y..yeah I'm fine, just really exhausted....I think I should be going...\" Selina said, sounding tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing\" Lisa said, frowning. \"I'll walk you back to you care.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it, Lisa\" Jonny said with a smile. \"I owe you for agreeing to take me in for the next while\" Jonny said, wrapping his arm around Selina, who didn't try to pull away. In fact, Jonny felt like she had purposely had her body rubbing against him and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're such a dear, Jonny\" Lisa said with a smile as she opened her door for Jonny and Selina to leave. Jonny made sure that Selina didn't fall or anything as he brought her back to her car. Though it was by no means as nice or expensive as any of the ones that Lisa owned, it certainly wasn't half bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be alright getting home by yourself?\" Jonny asked, sounding as concerned as he could while fighting his urge to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I should be fine,\" Selina responded, blushing just a bit more from looking at him. \"You mentioned inside that you'll be staying at Lisa's house for awhile?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"Yes, Ma'am. My father died when I was very young and now my mother will be gone for some time, so I'm staying with Lisa until further notice...\" he said, looking down at his feet, trying to appear sad and lonely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tomorrow night, Lisa has a ticket to the gala, so you'll be in her house all lonely\" she said, putting her thumb to her mouth, and biting in a cute way as if thinking something through in her mind. She was clearly uncertain as to why she was having the thoughts that were currently going through her mind, but that wouldn't stop her from doing as she was told. Her mind was so fragile at this point that nothing she did would be able to fight Jonny's commands. \"Do you want something to do tomorrow night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jonny asked, raising an eyebrow, pretending he had no idea what she meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Lisa only gets one ticket to the gala, but I'm allowed to have a plus one, since I've been in charge of all the security. I feel bad that you'll be here all by yourself and....you're kind of cute...\" she said, turning scarlet. Jonny just smiled at her in an awkward, kid like way. \"So I was wondering if you would want to go with me? I'll even introduce you to one of the mayors bodyguards before the event formally starts, wouldn't that be cool?\" she asked. Jonny grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! That would be great!\" he exclaimed with a smile. \"Thank you so much, Ma'am!\" he exclaimed. Selina hugged him, and Jonny smiled evilly as he felt her large breasts against his scrawny chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll be here to get you at 5 pm tomorrow. Make sure Lisa remembers to dress you fancy\" she says before releasing him from the hug and getting in her car. Selina waved good bye to Jonny with a cute smile on her face that certainly gave Jonny the impression that a certain police chief had a crush. As the drove away, Jonny laughed. This was absolutely perfect. Tomorrow night, Jonny's ultimate plan would finally begin. He'd meet with the body guard and work his magic before he finally finishes with Selina's mind, cleaning those pesky last morals right out of her and making her completely his. That way it would put him and his pawns (Lisa, the Guard, and Selina) in the perfect spot to take action. And the results would be beautiful. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day\u2019s appointed time drew near.  It was about 4:30, and Jonny had conjured for himself a nice suit that fit elegantly and snugly upon Jonny\u2019s bony body.  At the moment, he stood in Lisa\u2019s bedroom in front of a mirror, with Lisa prancing about feverishly behind him, doting over him as the big night approached.  She wore a form-fitting dark gown that accentuated her lovely covers\u2014the sort of gown that of course Jonny liked.  The gown was strapless and did a wonderful job lifting Lisa\u2019s magnificent breasts out before her.  They jiggled as she walked.  At the moment, Jonny stood and looked upon himself in the full-length mirror while Lisa brushed wrinkles out of his suit and removed little bits of lint here and there.  \u201cSo are you excited about tonight?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cOf course,\u201d Jonny replied, \u201cthis party will be the talk of the town for months to come,\u201d he said with an evil smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn around please,\u201d Lisa said, and Jonny did.  She now looked at his front as she went through the same process of smoothing out wrinkles and removing tiny bits of lint, as well as straightening Jonny\u2019s tie.  \u201cMaster,\u201d she began, looking earnestly into Jonny\u2019s eyes, keeping her gaze locked with his, \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be able to spend time with you tonight,\u201d she said with a nervous smile.  \u201cSince my husband left, my I haven\u2019t really felt special to anyone, but you make me feel\u2014\u201c she started, but then suddenly Jonny reached out his hand and laid it firmly on Lisa\u2019s bulging chest.  A sinister red glow filled his demonic eyes, as it did hers.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lisa, but you\u2019re not going to be able to make it tonight,\u201d Jonny said as the power radiated from him into her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny hated to do this, really.  That in itself was odd; he would never have thought twice about playing with a human\u2019s mind before, but this time was different.  Lisa really did want to go, and she really did seem excited about spending this time with Jonny, but Jonny just couldn\u2019t have it; it was too dangerous.  \u201cLisa, in a few seconds you\u2019re going to begin to feel quite sick, as though your stomach is turning flips inside you.  You\u2019ll remember having a couple big fattening hot dogs dripping with grease for lunch (even though she\u2019d actually had a ham sandwich), and you will be afraid that you\u2019re getting sick.  You don\u2019t want to make Selina or the Mayor or anyone else ill, so you will politely bow out for the evening and spend the evening watching the coverage of the event on TV,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa sat dumbly and listened to her master\u2019s instructions, \u201cSick . . . home . . . television,\u201d she mumbled.  \u201cYes,\u201d Jonny said as he removed his hands from the woman.  She sat solemnly for a couple seconds before perking back up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa?\u201d Jonny said, \u201cyou were in the middle of talking about how much you wanted to\u2014\u201c and suddenly Lisa held up her hand as if to say call for a pause.  Jonny heard a loud, unpleasant growling noise coming from Lisa\u2019s stomach, and she immediately held her hand to her mouth.  \u201cDammit,\u201d she said as she immediately jetted off toward the restroom and slammed the door shut.  The toilet seat went up very quickly.  \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d Jonny said from outside the bathroom door.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to throw up, but if I am this is the place.  Shouldn\u2019t have had those hot dogs for lunch, huh?\u201d she said with a slight laugh.  \u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d Jonny answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, three loud knocks sounded at the door.  \u201cThat\u2019s Selina,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cshe was going to drive all of us together, but if you\u2019re not feeling well I can sta\u2014\u201c Jonny began, not wanting to tell Lisa that his plan all along had been to leave her there for her own safety.  \u201cNo, no Master you have to go.  Go start your plan.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a thing of beauty.\u201d  \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Lisa responded.  Jonny walked off to the grand entrance door to the house and opened it, revealing a stunning Chief Selina in the form-fitting gown from the day before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d she said with the smile and tone of a giddy schoolgirl as she leapt toward Jonny\u2019s scrawny body and gave him a big hug, which Jonny happily returned.  \u201cDo you like my dress?\u201d she asked, stepping back and giving a lovely view as she twirled around.  \u201cI do,\u201d Jonny asked as the two made their way to her car.  The two got into the car, and Selina started driving in the direction of the vast skyscraper that would serve as the venue for the party.  \u201cSo have you been looking forward tonight?\u201d Selina asked.  \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Jonny said with a smile, \u201cit\u2019ll be a night to die for,\u201d he said with a chuckle as looked at his date for the evening.  She gazed with apparent longing into his eyes for a good five seconds, then seemed to shake her head.  \u201cSo how old are you again, Jonny?\u201d Selina asked.  \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, and you\u2019re like 37 right?\u201d he responded.  \u201cForty-four dear,\u201d she said, \u201cbut thanks for being nice.  You know this sort of thing would be illegal in this state if you were 2 years younger?\u201d she said.  \u201cOnly if we actually had sex tonight, right?\u201d Jonny responded.  Selina stayed silent, a devious smile crossing her face, and Jonny acted as though he were oblivious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, the pair arrived at the spot, and Selina parked the car.  She emerged from the car as Jonny did and promptly took the young man by the arm as the two walked, all smiles, down a long row of glittering decorations leading to the building.  Selina pointed out a whole bunch of people during the course of the walk\u2014the President of the school board, the city\u2019s chief engineer, the CEO of the city\u2019s impressive hospital system, and more.  The couple emerged into the foyer of the office building, it too being decked out with fancy lights and various fixtures.  Selina saw someone and beckoned him over, \u201cOfficer Brown,\u201d she said, beckoning him over out of the way near a long, dark hall that had been gated off for security reasons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who came over was the definition of perfect, or at least perfect for Jonny.  Officer Brown bounded over excitedly, following orders like any good soldier.  As he neared, Jonny estimated that the man must have been about six feet three inches tall and weighed approximately 200 pounds.  He clearly worked out daily.  His torso was the size of a tree trunk, ending at the top in a set of broad, powerful shoulders.  The man had a smooth and friendly face with blonde hair slicked back on top of his head.  He was a bloody Ken Doll crossed with a GI Joe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, there mam,\u201d he said in a deep and reassuring voice, offering a solute to his chief.  He looked down at Jonny as he towered over his small frame (as he towered over most people).  \u201cThis is one of the officers who will be guarding the mayor, so if there\u2019s anybody who makes trouble, Brown\u2019ll take \u2018em out,\u201d Selina declared confidently.  \u201cWell I\u2019ll sure do my best mam.  Is this your son?\u201d he said as he stuck out his hand to give Jonny a proper greeting.  \u201cUm, no,\u201d Selina said, blushing a little, \u201che\u2019s Jonny.  A friend of a friend and,\u201d eyeing you with a bit of a smile, \u201cmy date for this evening.\u201d  \u201cOh!\u201d Officer Brown said, surprised, \u201cWell make sure you keep your eye on this one; she\u2019s a handful!\u201d Brown said, motioning to Selina.  \u201cOh, I know,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cOh no,\u201d Jonny said, feeling around in his suit pockets, \u201cI think I left my actual ticket in the car, but I\u2019ll need that for dinner, right?\u201d he said to Selina.  \u201cYou will,\u201d she replied, \u201cI\u2019ll run to the car and grab it,\u201d she said, and suddenly she was off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny and Brown watched as Selina ran off.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got a live one there, little guy,\u201d Brown said to Jonny.  \u201cI think I can handle her,\u201d said the young man.\u201d  This was just the opportunity that Jonny needed.  He stepped over into the relative darkness of the hall a few feet from where everyone else had gathered and was chatting away.  Brown followed politely to continue the conversation.  Jonny turned to him and, in an urgent tone, declared, \u201cThere is going to be an attempt on the life of the Mayor.\u201d  Brown looked puzzled, \u201cUm, how would an upstanding little fella like you think he knew somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d Brown asked.  \u201cFunny you should ask,\u201d Jonny said with a sick smile as he firmly placed his hands on the big man\u2019s belly.  A familiar redness filled Jonny\u2019s eyes, as it did those of his good-natured giant of a pawn.  Brown relaxed, leaning against the wall of the hallway.  \u201cOfficer Brown,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cyou\u2019re going to do something for me.  Tonight at 7 PM, after dinner and as the Mayor\u2019s speech begins, I want you to take out your gun and shoot Officer Sletkov in the head without hesitation.  Then, I want you to grab the Mayor from behind and threaten her with the gun.  Shouldn\u2019t be a problem for a big fella like you.  Make sure it ends up on camera.  Then, you need to pistol-whip the Mayor with the butt of your gun and toss her aside, then walk, gun drawn, toward the line of officers who will have assembled in front of you . . . \u201c Jonny said, adding some other instructions and removing his hand from the officer just as Selina returned.  \u201cHere\u2019s your ticket,\u201d she said.  \u201cThanks,\u201d said Jonny, as he took it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you boys haven\u2019t been having too much fun without me,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cNot at all,\u201d Jonny replied, \u201cwe were just telling war stories.\u201d  Brown nodded good-naturedly as he tried to smile, though he was obviously unsettled by the thoughts that had been forced into his mind.  \u201cWelp, better get to it mam,\u201d he said as he tipped his hat and walked off in the direction of what would be his final post.  \u201cI think it\u2019s time to head up,\u201d Seina said with a smile on her face.  The two of you made your way to an elevator, which you somehow boarded with no one else.  The two of you stepped into the elevator and pushed the button for the top floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The machine started its mechanical hum upward, and suddenly a tune came on the radio.  It was Jackson Browne\u2019s \u201cSomebody\u2019s Baby,\u201d and immediately Selina smiled, \u201cI remember this song,\u201d she said.  Thinking now might be the time for some romance, Jonny took Selina by the hand and put his other hand on her waist.  She smiled and blushed in pleasant surprise as the two danced about in the elevator.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got the moves of a man three times your age; are you sure you\u2019re 18?\u201d Selina said.  \u201cNot exactly,\u201d Jonny said with a chuckle as he moved his hand from her hip down to her ass cheek and gave it a good, sexy squeeze.  \u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed, jumping with surprise, but not seeming to mind at all.  Her hips swayed sexily back and forth as she moved her beautiful face close to Jonny\u2019s, staring longingly into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing!\u201d went the elevator buzzer, and the doors opened.  Selina and Jonny pried themselves apart, \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this later,\u201d she said with a sexy smile.  The two exited the elevator as the song came to close and stepped out on to the roof of the grand skyscraper that seemed to keep watch over the whole city.  As dusk fell, lights dotted the beautiful horizon as the city hummed with activity far below.  \"I\u2019m going to go get a drink,\u201d Jonny said as the entourage assembled with the lectern situated before the TV cameras.  The Mayor sat quietly at a chair along with other local dignitaries, and Jonny just really wanted a good seat.  Officer Brown had positioned his impressive frame a few feet from the place of honor the mayor would soon take, and his fellow guard Sletkov, a burly Polish man with a gray beard and a stone face, stood just a few feet away.  Jonny watched for a few minutes as lesser officials came up and said a few words for the cameras, mostly just happy to get a photo op.  \u201cFinally, the main event!\u201d Jonny said as the last of these shuffled off the stage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mayor stood, she being a woman of about 62 with greying hair and an aged but determined face.  Applause erupted from the crowd as she took her place behind the collection of microphones the lectern held.  \u201cThank you all,\u201d she said as she waived pleasantly to the crowd.  Jonny watched Officer Brown like a hawk.  \u201cAny second now,\u201d he said.  The Mayor began, \u201cI\u2019d like to thank you all for coming tonight, and I would like to talk of the amazing progress of our fair city,\u201d she began.  Jonny glanced up toward Officer Brown and, in his eyes, he beheld a tiny glimmer of red.  Without a word, the big man drew his sidearm and fired one shot into the head of officer Slitkov, who crumpled to the ground without so much as whimper.  \u201cAaahhh!\u201d the Mayor screamed as the burly officer grabbed her from behind, lifting the little old Mayor clean off the ground and putting her in a kind of chokehold.  She gurgled and struck at the policeman\u2019s arm, but to no avail.  \u201cEVERYBODY BACK!\u201d Brown screamed, a deranged look in his eye.  \u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d Jonny said as the officer raged about, firing off various bullets at other high-ranking officials as they, being stuck in front of a large bank of people, could likely not escape.  \u201cEVERYBODY BACK OR SHE GETS IT!\u201d he screamed, motioning to the Mayor as she sobbed.  Screams still erupted all around Jonny as he watched his creation do his work.  Everybody ran; many were shot, while others were trampled as they tried to escape.  Within mere seconds, all the bullets but one were fired from Brown\u2019s gun.  He effortlessly tossed the tiny hostage aside, and she was pulled to safety.  By now a wall of police had assembled before Brown.  \u201cDROP THE WEAPON NOW!\u201d came the call from the cops.  Brown was undeterred.  He pointed his gun in the direction of the cops and began to walk toward them.  \u201cTHIS IS FOR JM!\u201d he screamed just before a hale of police bullets pierced his gargantuan body.  The big man\u2019s blood spattered all over the roof as he crumpled into a heap on the floor, his body now lifeless.            <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny noticed that the world suddenly seemed to be moving in slow motion.  Jack\u2019s body was suddenly producing a lot of adrenaline, he noted.  As he looked about at the chaotic world about him, he felt a sharp pain in his gut.  As he looked down, he saw that his shirt was covered in red\u2014in blood.  A puddle of the stuff had begun to form on the ground beneath him.  Jonny held his hands to his stomach as the blood gushed out, and he fell limply to the ground.  \u201cAw shit!\u201d he thought meekly, \u201cone of the bullets must have ricocheted and hit me,\u201d and with that he immediately disappeared in a sudden puff of grey smoke, just another of the injured among the chaos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, Jonny roared back into existence in another puff of grey-red smoke, this time on the floor of Lisa\u2019s living room.  \u201cLisa!\u201d he yelled, his voice a mass of rough gargles as the blood filled his throat.  He lay on the floor, coughing as another puddle of blood formed around him.  \u201cMaster?\u201d came Lisa\u2019s worried voice as she hurried into the room in a night gown, the one that showed her chest off nicely.  \u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d she screamed as she beheld Jonny on the floor.  She ran over to him and wrapped her arms around him as she sat herself on the floor.  She tried to get Jonny\u2019s head above his heart to keep the blood from all pooling in one area.  \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d she demanded as tears filled her eyes.  \u201cPlan worked, but could have worked better,\u201d Johnny said matter of factly but clearly in pain, \u201cthis body\u2019s got an extra hole in it, and I think that red stuff\u2019s all supposed to be on the inside, so I think I\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Jonny said as he began to shake and feel cold.  \u201cI\u2019ll get you to a hospital,\u201d Lisa sobbed uncontrollably, reaching for her cell phone.  \u201cToo far away,\u201d Jonny weakly answered, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to need a new body in the next minute or two, so hopefully we can find some sap off the street.  I don\u2019t care who it is, but you have to go get somebody soon.  I\u2019ll get a new meat suit temporarily and fine a more permanent one in the next couple hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused for a moment.  \u201cMaster,\u201d she said through her cries, \u201cuse me.\u201d  \u201cWha\u2014\u201c Jonny said.  Lisa tried to compose herself.  \u201cMaster, I want you to possess my body.  It would be an honor to have you inside me until you find a more permanent host.  Jump inside me and take my body to the orphanage on the other end of town.  Find a body you want, and take it.  No one will miss the people there, and they will be a part of your wonderful master plan if you are inside them, just like I will be if you use my body.  Please!  You just have to promise to come back to me!\u201d she said, clearly hysterical.  \u201cI will,\u201d Jonny said as he took Lisa\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

NOW!\u201d Jonny commanded, and Lisa seemed taken aback by his firmness, but she obediently stood and ran out of the house in search of a different host for Jonny.  As she did so, Lisa\u2019s worry for her master was mixed with a certain degree of hurt\u2014why hadn\u2019t the master wanted to use her body?  Did that mean he didn\u2019t think she was good enough?  She would have been honored to have him posses her, but none of that mattered now as long as she could find a way to make him safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny lay bleeding in the loneliness of Lisa\u2019s grand living room.  \u201cBeen a fine ride, Jack,\u201d Jonny said, addressing the absent personage of his borrowed body, \u201cI don\u2019t imagine Katie\u2019s going to be all that pleased that I fucked up and let her old meat suit die, but what the hell?\u201d he said with a slight chuckle.  \u201cI\u2019ll bet Selina\u2019s scared to hell,\u201d Jonny mused, \u201cdidn\u2019t even realize her date was a dead cop riding around inside this barely-college-aged kid who orchestrated the whole thing.  I guess a little bit of mind control can fix that part,\u201d Jonny said as he held his gut with the gaping hole in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny heard the door close and two sets of footsteps approach hurriedly.  Lisa entered the room as she wiped a tear from her face, and following her was a man Jonny had never seen before.  \u201cJonny, this is Arthur Fineburg; I found him outside taking a walk, and he works in my office,\u201d Lisa explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fineburg was a man of fifty-two years, a pleasant but rather boring accountant with a bald head and thick glasses adorning his face complete with very thick and dark rims.  Had the rims been metal, it is entirely possible one could use them to pick up satellite radio.  Given the rest of Mr. Fineburg, it was a mystery to Jonny how he took walks at all.  His sedentary job as an accountant had done his body no favors.  At approximately five foot seven, he probably weighed 270 pounds.  He today wore a dark suit that with a coat the hung wide open, either because he preferred not to close it or because he could not physically do so in any degree of comfort.  See, this man\u2019s body was\u2014shall we say\u2014rotund.  This is to say his big jello-like belly protruded a good distance out from the rest of him and jiggled as he walked.  His double chin gave his smile a pleasant appearance but was probably big enough for a whole extra face, and his rotund middle was so large that his suit pants were yanked half way up his stomach to contain his abdominal girth.  He did not exactly run into the room as Lisa had, but he did waddle like a man with places to go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeepers!\u201d the accountant said in a nasally and very high voice, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get this young fellow to a hospital!\u201d exclaimed.  He began to bend down and started to pick up Jonny\u2019s scrawny and ailing body.  \u201cThanks for the effort, Art, really,\u201d Jonny coughed, \u201cbut I think I\u2019m clocking out here.\u201d  Fineburg shook his head.  \u201cNo no no you just hang on and we\u2019re gonna fix you up just perfectly.  Lisa, grab his feet!\u201d the man commanded.  \u201cArt, buddy,\u201d Jonny sad as he took the fat man by the collar, \u201cyou\u2019re all I need!\u201d And with that, Jonny\u2019s eyes glowed red for the final time inside Jack\u2019s body, and wisps of swirling black and red smoke emerged from Jonny\u2019s mouth.  It was as though the boy was throwing up, and the smoky spirit of Jonny Macks forced its way inside the mild-mannered Arthur Fineburg.  Art tried to fight of Jonny with mad grabs at his ethereal form, but it was no use.  Fineburg\u2019s body was quickly on the ground as he grunted and rolled around, his giant belly shaking and jiggling as Jonny forced his way farther inside.  The scene looked almost like little old fat man fighting an anaconda in the water\u2014he had no chance, but her writhed and rolled about and gargled and struggled just the same.  Lisa watched in horror, of course having never seen this part before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, Arthur\u2019s body was still.  He lay on his back\u2014gut sticking up\u2014on the floor of Lisa\u2019s house.  He soon stirred, and Lisa ran over to the body now before her.  Jonny struggled to get to his feet while carrying so much more weight than Jack\u2019s body had.  Lisa helped him stand gingerly.  \u201cWell this is new,\u201d Jonny said as he looked down through his thick glasses at his pudgy fingers and protruding gut.  Arthur being a small man, Jonny didn\u2019t stand much higher than he did before, and Lisa remained a few inches taller than he was.  Jonny slowly and awkwardly turned to see the body of Jack, now empty of all life, strewn out on the floor.  Jonny waived his hand and, in a couple seconds, a kind of demonic flame appeared from nowhere and consumed his prior form, leaving only a tiny ash residue where Jonny\u2019s meat suit had been.  Lisa watched this unfold with a certain measure of trepidation at the whole thing.  \u201cYou\u2019ll clean up the ash later,\u201d Jonny said authoritatively, and he started to make his way toward the garage.  Lisa stopped him, pulling on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2014\u201c she started, \u201cIs that really you in there, Master?\u201d she asked meekly, a small smile across her face as she beheld this 52-year-old fat man Jonny occupied.  \u201cIt is for now,\u201d Jonny said with a smile, \u201cnow get to the car.  There\u2019s a bunch of homeless people down by the docks.  I think I can find a new meat suit there,\u201d he declared as he waddled away.  Lisa followed closely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drove through the streets of the city as ambulances and police cars screamed by, all in the direction of the skyscraper at which Jonny had first let loose his chaotic plan.  They all did so oblivious to the fact that the primary culprit was not Officer Brown at all and was in fact in a place they would never fine him.  Lisa reached down and turned up the news on the radio.  \u201cTerror grips the city tonight, as there has been an attempt on the life of the Mayor,\u201d the female reporter said, \u201cOfficer Jackson Brown, in a rage, fired into the audience, killing several people and wounding several more.  Still others were trampled as they tried to escape.  Before dying in a hale of bullets himself, Brown screamed that the attack was, in his final words, \u2018for JM,\u2019 leading authorities to wonder who JM is and what his connection is to the carnage.  The mayor is now in a secured location, and first responders are out in force tonight looking for evidence of who planned this.  Police Chief Selina McCarthy was unharmed but could not be reached for comment.  This is Ellen Chang, reporting for WTF News,\u201d and the reporter signed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do something about her,\u201d Jonny said flatly.  \u201cWho?\u201d Lisa replied.  \u201cSelina,\u201d Jonny answered, \u201cbut I\u2019d imagine this gives the old man the mayhem he wanted.  People will be on edge for months, and every unsolved crime with similar facts will send people into a frenzy, and trust me when I say there will be some,\u201d Jonny said with a smile.  \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cbut the first step has to be finding a more permanent meat suit.\u201d  The two of them rolled on silently as chaos filled the city.  Eventually, skyscrapers and high-rise apartments gave way to old warehouses and fishing operations.  The smell of salt hung in their air.  \u201cThis looks like a place to start,\u201d Jonny said, and Lisa pulled the car into a parking lot and the two got out.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny breathed in the night time air with Fineburg's mucus filled nose and looked around at the nearly deserted docks. He did not like this meat suit at all. The fat slob was a terrible excuse for a human being who was wasting his life and didn't know how to pull himself up to a spot where he could live comfortably. Not only that, but Jonny had tastes in his bodies like he had tastes in clothes, and Art Fineburg was certainly not his type. He felt unpleasant just being in this disgusting flesh and wanted out as soon as possible. He spit angrily into a puddle a few steps to his side as he heard the clicking of Lisa's heels come up behind him. \"Master?  Is everything alright?\" she asked, in a concerned voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"Yeah, everything is fine. I just can't stand this form one bit. I feel like I need a bath just wearing this meatsuit and I can't wait to let myself out of here and then wipe this guy out of the planet\" he said nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gave him a questioning look. \"You're going to kill Art?\" she asked, not seeming to care about her former co-worker's well being as much as she once would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. I see no reason keeping a useless man like this alive once he's served his purpose to me. Do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"No, master. I don't see a reason for anything unless it makes you happy\" she said with a smile, taking Jonny's fatty hand in her own. \"but for the record, I'll care for you no matter what body you're wearing\" she said. Jonny smiled at her, looking into those stunning eyes and seeing a woman that was truly at peace with her place in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa...why are you so eager for me to be happy\" I mean, I know that I made you this way at least partially, but I can't imagine that my slight mental manipulation gave you this incredibly look of purpose I'm seeing in you\" he said, genuinely curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slowly removed her hand and looked down at the ground, a blush forming on her smooth face. \"Well, master....before you brought me into your life, mine wasn't going too well. I was a workaholic that didn't care about anything accept my next new case. I made more money in one week than half of this city makes in a year and I was enjoying getting rich and going out to fancy nightclubs to show off the luxurious clothes I bought or my new cars. I was so materialistic. I never cared for anyone besides myself. I divorced my ex husband when he wasn't meeting my standards and left my son to him without a moments hesitation. I was never able to really relax because I'd be so focused on making more money and living my life at the top of the food chain. And then you came into my life. At first I thought you were just some stupid kid wanting to get with the hot cougar, but then your eyes became fire and I saw that you were so much more than I had assumed. You burned everything out of me except for a desire to serve you and I can never be more grateful to you for that. You released me from my cursed existence and made me yours and now I want to be this way until the day I die. Making you happy makes me not only happy but fulfilled. And being fulfilled is something that I never was before. After my divorce, I wondered what it would be like having someone I could really, truly be close to. I fantasized about giving up my work completely, settling down and just relaxing. Maybe I would find someone nice to start a family with. I actually always wanted a daughter that I could really be close with and spoil. I'd bring her shopping and get her the nicest things and she would love me and I would love her. but I never had the time to do that and didn't want that to end up like my last attempt at a family did. But now I don't need any of that because I have you, master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Lisa\" he said as he continued to look around. Suddenly, he heard a soft voice from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....excuse me, sir?\" a girl's voice asked. Jonny turned to see a young lady standing in an ally way. She had long red hair and soft green eyes. Her skin was just a bit too pale and she was a bit on the skinny side which was probably because she was living in these conditions for awhile. Despite those features, she had a very well portioned body with a very generous chest, though she did look a bit malnourished. If it wasn't for that, the girl would easily be beautiful. Strangely enough, the thing that struck Jonny the most about her was that she bore an uncanny resemblance to Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Jonny asked, moving closer to her in his chubby body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my name is Alice...I-umm, that is...would you...l-like to s-sleep with me? F-for money?\" she asked nervously, a blush on her pale face. Jonny couldn't help but laughing at the sight before him as Lisa watched from behind, a curious look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're some sort of hooker? How old are you?\" Jonny asked, looking the girl over, this time paying attention to her choice in clothing. She was wearing a very short dress that showed off her shapely legs, which again would look a bit better had she been well fed. She also had some makeup on, but didn't need it to look cute. Her legs were shaking ever so slightly, revealing nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm 17...\" she said, looking down with a blush on her face. \"I'm sorry, sir...I'm afraid I'm not very good at this. I'm new to this....job...\" she said, sounding upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell. What brought to you acting like this, Alice?\" he asked curiously, putting a hand on the girl's shoulder. She looked into his eyes and Jonny could see her eyes were watery. She looked more like a lost child than a promiscuous prostitute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my parents were both drug addicts. they died together in an overdose last month....I-I never did anything like that, but I didn't have anywhere to go...I took all the money I could find from the house and lived off of it for awhile, but...n-now I have to d-do this to survive\" she said, fighting back tears. She was a strong one, and Jonny respected that. From the corner of his eyes, Jonny could see Lisa giving the girl a sad look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jonny's eyes glowed red as Alice's did the same. \"Fall asleep, Alice\" he said to her as the girl fell limply onto his fat. Jonny struggled with his new body to lift up the girl and cradle her in his arms. He looked at Lisa. \"What do you think of her?\" He asked as Lisa walked over and brushed her hand through the girl's red hair. Lisa gave a slight smile as she looked at the girl's sleeping form. Alice looked so peaceful, as if this was her first real sleep in a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She....looks a bit like me, doesn't she?\" Lisa asked, keeping her hand on Alice's forehead. \"And she doesn't have a home...I feel bad for her\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you say if I decided to take her as my new body?\" Jonny asked, , looking at Lisa's face for a reaction. Lisa looked down at Alice and then up at Jonny, smiling at him as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say that whatever you say goes, master. I rather like her, but she is a bit young. Two years younger than your last body even, and you know how I thought of you in that before you brought me into the fold. Not to mention she's obviously not a man...\" she said with a giggle. \"But for you, I think I would be willing to give anything a try\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny grinned at her, looking down at the sleeping girl in his arms. \"then I think I'll give you that daughter you always wanted\" he said, eyes glowing red. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice Grayson woke up in a room she had never seen before. She sat up and looked around as her eyes adjusted to the light in the room. She was sitting in a marvelous bed in a luxurious room that looked fancier than anything she had ever seen in her entire life. Her eyes widened as she looked around more, seeing a flat screen television, large bookshelves, collections of dolls that looked like they hadn't been touched in years, and other knick knacks. As she inhaled, a smile immediately came across her mouth. It was the small of chocolate chip pancakes. They were her favorite breakfast before her parents started using those awful drugs. Alice jumped out of the bed and walked her skinny body out the door, entering a large kitchen, at the center of which there was a huge table filled entirely with the largest and most delicious assortment of food Alice had ever seen. She gazed at it all open mouthed as she heard footsteps behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepy head!\" A man exclaimed in a peppy voice. Alice jumped and turned around seeing a very heavy man who she vaguely recognized with an attractive woman standing next to him. the woman had long red hair and green eyes just like her. Alice couldn't help but think about how this woman looked like an older version of herself except this woman was clearly gorgeous while Alice was...well, Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...h-hello...\" Alice said nervously, a blush forming on her cheeks as she looked down to the ground, her embarrassed face reflected in the nearly sparkling tiles of the floor. the man energetically walked over to Alice and pinched her cheeks, grinning ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing!\" He said, taking a step back. \"You must be absolutely famished\" he wrapped his arm around Alice's scrawny body and sat her down at the head of the table before making her a plate of food. \"You eat up right now, young lady!\" He commanded in an authoritative voice as the beautiful woman smiled reassuringly. Alice didn't have to be told twice and took a bite out of one of the pancakes. A smile formed on her face as she took a bigger bite and then started eating faster, finishing the plate in no time. She never realized how starving she had been on the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is this heaven?\" Alice asked curiously as the woman sat across from her and crossed her legs. The heavy man made Alice another plate and put it in front of her as he stood next to her, waiting for her to finish her next helping. The man laughed when he heard her comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, dear. My name is Arthur Fineburg and this is my lovely....fiance....Lisa\" he said with that big grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa continued while Alice ate. \"Arty and I were walking through the docks when we found you about to pass out in an ally. We felt so bad for you and decided to take you in and give you some rest and a meal\" she said, sounding sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" Is all that Alice could say as the man...Arthur?...made her another plate of food. Alice didn't realize it, but the more she was eating, the more complexion was returning to her body and the more weight she was gaining. It was as if the food had some magical quality that was making her healthier as she ate. In reality, it was just Jonny altering her to the proportions he wanted her to be, but at the moment she was too happy to even realize she was changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mention it honey...it was the least we could do\" the apparent Arthur Fineburg said, putting his hands on Alice's shoulders, feeling more skin there than previously. Alice's looks were almost done returning to their natural state of beauty, which meant that it was almost time for Jonny to claim his new home. \"In fact...we'd like to do more for you\" he said, changing his tone to become serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" Alice asked, still nervous around these people. Alice felt like she could never be comfortable around anyone ever again. How could she ever trust people when the only contact she had in the past year was with her drug addicted parents and men who used her body for a quick fucking and sometimes worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled, placing her hand on Alice's before continuing. \"Well, Arthur and I were talking as you slept...and we couldn't help but feel terrible for a girl like you. You're beautiful, young, I'm sure you're smart...we just couldn't bear seeing you on the streets. To tell you the truth, you look like you could be my daughter, and I know I would never want my daughter to have the life you've had to put up with....so we decided that we'd love to have you in and have you live here with us...what do you say?\" Lisa asked with a sweet smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears formed in Alice's eyes. Were these people really serious? Was she about to finally get a home where she could be accepted and, dare she even hope, loved? \"I...I don't know what to say....I'd...love it...\" she said, part of her thinking she shouldn't be so trusting, but another part of her wanting an end to the pain she'd been through for so long. Now her body was back to the way it had been when she was completely healthy. She really was gorgeous, looking very much like a younger and slightly fitter version of Lisa, though part of that may have been Jonny's doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur Fineburg rubbed her shoulders gently from behind. \"The thing is, Alice....If we do this, there would be one condition....\" He said, his voice taking on a different quality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what condition? I'll do anything!\" Alice asked exclaimed, already fantasizing about the things she'd be able to do and how happy she could be having a real home with people who seemed to care for her and not just want her for her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"Fineburg continued, licking his lips \"The condition is you only get to live here...if I get to live in you\" he said laughing. as pulled Alice out from her seat. Alice let out a scream as the older man forced his lips onto hers. Suddenly Alice felt a cold force pushing it's way from the fat man's mouth into hers and down her throat. She tried to scream and push the man away but to no avail. Lisa came up behind her and held her straight, stopping her from moving back as Arthur continued pushing himself against her, the force pushing its way into Alice. Alice felt so scared and so cold....she felt her body shaking and her mind getting fuzzy....getting dark.....what was happ....................</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice's body continued shaking violently for several seconds, her recently improved breasts jiggling up and down as she convulsed, fighting against the invading presence even while her mind was fast asleep, lost in the sea of darkness that had pushed its way into the poor young girl's throat. Suddenly, the shaking all stopped, and Alice's body leaned against the wall. She breathed deeply, trying to get her breath back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? I-is that you?\" Lisa asked, her mouth agape. She had already seen Jonny possess the meatsuit of Arthur Fineburg, but Jonny understood that things like this must be hard to process for a normal human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's body got her breath back and , slowly felt over her body. She ran her dainty hands over her full hips, round ass, firm stomach and huge breasts, smiling as she took some of her scarlet hair and held it in front of her green eyes. \"Oh yeah, it's me in here\" she said in a voice full of more confidence than Alice had ever used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa ran over to the girl's body and gave her a big hug, both redhead's generous  boobs pushing against each other. \"Oh master! I was so worried! You're body was shaking so much, I thought you weren't going to make it!\" she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Alice Grayson hugged her back tightly and looked into Lisa's eyes, wiping away the tears that had began falling. \"It's fine, Lisa. You don't have to worry about me. I'm a big demon and can take care of myself\" she said in her voice, which sounded like a higher pitched version of Lisa's. Jonny realized that the voice was slightly different than the one Alice originally had. Maybe in his subconscious, as he was 'reinvigorating' Alice's weak body, he had actually been making her more like Lisa and didn't realize it? That was always a possibility, but it didn't really matter. All Jonny knew was that this young, beautiful meatsuit belonged to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Lisa released the possessed girl and smiled. \"What do we do now, master?\" she asked as Alice's fingers snapped. The tattered clothes that Alice was wearing burned up in black flames to be replaced with comfortable black leggings and a black tank top, cut low to show off her fantastic cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stretched his new body out, letting out a sigh as he cracked his stolen back. He looked down at the body of Arthur Fineburg that was laying on the ground. Before leaving his meatsuit, Jonny made it so he'd be asleep for the next few minutes, giving Jonny time to do whatever he would have to do on him. Jonny knelt down next to Fineburgs body and put his hand on his head. Jonny's stolen green eyes glowed red for a few seconds before he removed his hand from Fineburg's head and smiled. He then snapped his fingers, causing black flames to cover Arthur's body. When the flames disapeared, his body was gone. \"There we go....He'll wake up on his couch back at his house and figure he dosed off. He won't remember coming here and being possessed. I see no need to change or kill someone who doesn't deserve it\" he said, loving the sound of his new voice tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled. \"Wonderfully done, master!\" she said, clapping her hands. In response, Jonny curtsied with his stolen body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, onto the next part...Alice here wasn't very well known on the streets, but her memories are telling me that she did have some acquaintances that would notice her disappearance. Some of them might have even been in the shadows, watching as you and I got to the docks. To clear up suspicion, you're going to work your best lawyer magic on whoever it needs to be worked on, and you're going to adopt Alice here as your new daughter. I'll sign whatever papers need to be signed, but since Alice is underage I think you can handle all the paperwork by yourself. Tell people how you found the poor girl on the street and couldn't bear seeing her suffer. Let this be a known story so no one thinks it's strange that I'm living here. Sound good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded, smiling brightly. \"Oh master, it sounds great!\" she exclaimed, nearly crying from the joy. Lisa not only got to still have her master living with her, but she also would now have that daughter she always wanted. The fact that Alice and Lisa shared remarkable physical similarities only added to that notion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Get on that right away. The longer we give this, the more time there is for rumors to spread\" he said as Lisa quickly left the house to head to one of her cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled as he watched Lisa leave and then started to grope his body's chest. \"I really think I outdid myself with this one.I think I'll go take a closer look\" he said as he whistled a tune and walked over to Lisa's bedroom, making his clothes disappear as he did. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice was laying on Lisa's bed, breathing deeply in and out. One hand was resting on one of her exposed breasts while the other was over her crotch, running up and down ever so gently. She had quite a bit of fun getting to know her body and was now just relaxing, enjoying the feeling of her newly reinvigorated body. She slowly stood up and walked her sexy body to Lisa's full length mirror, admiring her reflection and striking a sexy smile. This new meatsuit of his really was a knockout, though Jonny couldn't help but realize that it wasn't really Alice anymore. The girl that Jonny and Lisa had found on the street was malnourished, but even with the nutrition back in her body, she wouldn't have quite looked like this. Her body was now older by a year or two, making her look closer to 19 or 20 than 17. Her breasts were fuller, and she was a bit taller and better built. Her face and skin was smoother and tanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny assumed his earlier hypothesis must have been right. Instead of just re-energizing Alice's body, he had transformed her into a younger, more idealized version of Lisa. Of course, that was by no means a bad thing. This body would certainly make for a great home, but Jonny wondered how much he had really done to Alice. Was her DNA now a partial match to Lisa's? Was Alice's mind still completely intact? Jonny closed his eyes and concentrated. After a bit of digging, he found Alice's sleeping mind and scanned through her memories. There wasn't much to see, due to her time on the streets traumatizing a lit of details away from her. Jonny felt bad for the girl in a weird sort of way. He wanted to put her out of her misery and what better way was there than this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a powerful pain went through all of Jonny's body. Alice's form crumpled onto the floor holding her stomach. Soon enough, Jonny realized what this was. He was hungry. Using magic to reinvigorate this sexy body had taken a lot out of him and now he had to refill himself. But where would he find a soul? Suddenly, he realized where. Well, he did say he wanted to put her out of her misery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny kept his eyes closed and a black aura of smoke surrounded his body. Inside, he felt Alice's soul waking up from her sleep. <i>Wh.what's going on???????</i> she asked in a worried voice. <i>Why do I feel different? Why can't I move my body?????</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" the new owner of Alice;s body said, concentrating. Alice's questions were replaced with a deafening scream as her soul was eaten from inside of her body. The scream was so powerful that she actually re-took over her body and was screaming with her actual voice until there was no longer anyone to scream. The screaming changed to a sexy laughter as Jonny completely overshadowed Alice, killing his body';s former occupant and eating her remains from within her own body. The now only Alice licked her lips and looked at her reflection happily. \"mmmmm....now this really is my body....\" she said as she heard the front door open. \"And there's 'mom' to get me all set for my new life. Speak of the devil...\" she said with a chuckle as black flames surrounded her body. When the flames faded away, she was wearing a white tank top and black booty shorts. She opened the door and ran out of the bedroom, embracing Lisa in a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you ready to make it official?\" Lisa asked, sounding energetic as the two large chests crushed eachother during the hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, am I ever! Thank you soooo much for rescuing me from those horrible streets!\" Alice exclaimed with tears of joy running down her face as the photographer Lisa had brought captured every moment on his camera. \"Then let's change your life\" she said, taking some forms out of her bag and sitting down at her kitchen table with Alice, handing her soon to be daughter a pen. \"Even though I'm now retired early, I can still do help others\" she said to the reporter as Alice eagerly took the pen and signed her name everywhere that needed it. She certainly looked over 18 now and no one ever bothers to know the age of those homeless kids so she could sign for herself. Once the last i was dotted she gave Lisa a big hug, which was photographed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for your kindness!\" she said, giving the reporter a great story to write about. Once it was published, no one would suspect a thing. the reporter left happily as Lisa finalized the documentation, officially adopting Alice as her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's it feel to be a mom, mom?\" Alice asked with a grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled as she signed her name for the sixth time. \"It's....strange..\" she said, face becoming scarlet. \"I feel so happy having someone in my life who looks so much like me...but I just can't see you as a daughter, master....er, mistress?\" she asked causing Alice to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me Alice, mom. Or how about Alli? That's a nice teenage girl's name, isn't it?\" she asked, putting her hand over Lisa's gently and looking into her eyes.  Alice's eyes glowed red, as Lisa's followed suit. \"You've been a wonderful servant and you deserve to be happy. Just see me as your daughter and enjoy getting the motherhood you never had, okay?\" </span></div></div>",

Lisa looked disoriented for s second but then just smiled calmly. \"Sorry, honey. It's just so strange having a daughter now. I always wanted one and now here you are. I just hope I don't mess this up like my last family\" she said, her voice hinted with regret. Alice frowned, seeing that sadness and guilt in Lisa's eyes. Lisa may only be a human, and she may only be doing any of this because of the mental control that Jonny had on her, but she was still his most loyal accomplice and definitely the closest thing to a friend that he could ever have as a demon. She was his number one woman and he wanted her to be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny got an idea. It would be a great way to test the extent of his powers, and also reward Lisa for her loyalty, but may also be risky since he could end up losing his current dominance over Lisa if he wasn't careful. Still, it was worth a shot. If it messed up, he could always undo his mistake. Jonny put Alice's hand on Lisa's shoulder and both woman's eyes glowed red. \"Lisa, I want you to go to your room and fall asleep. You will not wake up, until I tell you to. got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded, seeming to be half asleep already from her trance. \"Fall asleep...don't wake up until you tell me...\" she repeated as Jonny removed his hand and both woman's eyes returned to their regular colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa yawned loudly. \"You know, I'm really tired. Will you be able to take care of yourself if I go take a nap, mistr...oops, I mean Alice?\" she asked with a motherly concern in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded reassuringly. \"Yeah, MOM. I can manage for myself. go take a rest\" she said as Lisa turned and headed into her bedroom. Jonny watched as Lisa closed the door behind her and continued his thoughts. If he did this, things would change, though maybe in a good way. Lisa was a great slave, but she was getting a bit overbearing. He assumed that if this worked the way he wanted it to, she would still be overbearing and worried for him, but in a different way. There would be more of a mutual trust and understanding so Jonny would be able to be more independent. He also would never have to worry about Lisa developing any sort of romantic feelings for him, which it looked like she might be. the last thing Jonny wanted was to develop romantic feelings for a human. that could only end badly, and Jonny doubted that the Old Man would be agreeable with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Jonny walked over to a set of pictures on Lisa's wall. These were all pictures of her with her ex-husband and son that she had chosen to never get rid of for whatever reason. Jonny placed on of Alice's hands on the picture. His eyes glowed red as he attempted to use his shape shifting ability on the small picture. Suddenly, the image shifted and distorted, until it became a picture of Lisa with Alice. Jonny moved to the next one, doing the same. Jonny continued this with every picture in the house, changing them all so that the only family Lisa had in any of her pictures was Alice. Finally, the possessed Alice stepped into Lisa's bedroom and changed all of the pictures she had in there. She then picked up a random piece of paper and made it into a birth-certificate. Jonny didn't currently know how old his body was since he had accidentally changed it so much when preparing it, but he made the date on the certificate saying that his body was 20 years old, which seemed about right. Alice then placed her hand on Lisa;s forehead. An aura of energy flowed over both women as Jonny worked to change his body at it's core, making her a genuine DNA match for Lisa. Once that was done, she moved her hand to Lisa's chest. \"Lisa, I want you to open your eyes and become awake, but you will be unable to move your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's eyes opened, tinted red since Jonny established a mental bond for his purposes. \"Master? What are you doing?\" she asked, tired. Though Jonny had told her earlier to see him as her daughter, it hadn't worked enough. The command to be his slave was overpowering. This would fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping you to be happy, Lisa. You deserve that\" she said with a smile on her face as his mental commands on Lisa's mind were removed. Suddenly Lisa tried to move, but couldn't. There was a worried look on her face. \"W-who are you? Why do you look like a younger me?\" she asked, trying to move but finding it impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Lisa....I'm your daughter, Alice. Remember?\" She asked, going through Lisa's memories and carefully editing them, removing all memories of Lisa's true family and replacing them with memories of raising her beautiful daughter. No one else would have these altered memories, but none of Lisa's friends ever asked how her old family was doing, knowing it was a sore subject, and since the adoption of Alice would be in the papers, they wouldn't be surprised to hear Lisa talking about her daughter. the demonic Alice also made it so that Lisa was aware of her abilities and also knew that they were demonic in nature, probably due to that man she had sex with being a demon? As far as Lisa was concerned Alice was half demon, and half her. She knew Alice could leave her body and possess others, change her shape and others and control minds. She also trusted and loved her so much that she could never suspect any control over her. On top of that, she was extremely loyal to her daughter and still would do everything that she was commanded, but this time out of an unconditional love for her daughter as opposed to the mind control of a demon. Alice smiled and stepped back a few steps as Lisa passed out, letting her mind rework itself. If all went according to plan, Lisa would wake up being just as devoted to Jonny as before, but she would have no idea that he was anything other than her daughter, Alice who had demonic powers. She would still love Jonny, but as a mother. this meant that she would have no objection to Jonny bringing home slaves or one night stands because she had no reason to get jealous of them. In fact, she may even ask Alice to use her magic on a man she found attractive for her own fun. She still quit her job and already stopped sending welfare to her real family so there wasn't anything to clean up on that end unless they came looking, in which case the house would have another slave or two. Lisa would also be genuinly happy now and more independent of a thinker since there were no more official commands and just her false memories. Her true personality would be able to show itself, which may be very useful to Jonny as he remembered her being a very opportunistic thinker, and maybe even a little cold hearted (to everyone but her daughter, that is). Alice laughed, exiting the room and closing the door. Everyone was a winner today.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny waddled his overweight body along in the night next to Lisa as the two of them heard waves crashing in the distance.  \u201cMaster?\u201d Lisa said as the two walked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cWhat did you look like when you were alive?\u201d  Jonny thought for a moment.  It had been so long since he thought about it.  It had been so long since he looked into the mirror and saw his own, human face looking back.  \u201cUm,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I was about six feet tall, and I worked out a bunch, and I had dark hair and a small scar above my eye from a fight I had when I was a kid,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd how did you become . . .\u201d  \u201cA demon?\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cYes,\u201d Lisa answered.  \u201cWell, I was killed on October 13th of 1924.  I was coming back from a party with my partner when we got word that a mob boss we were after was maybe holding a meeting nearby, and we were go to there and recon the place and wait for back-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we drove the car to the place, which was a grave yard.  The night was dark \u2018cause it was really late.  There was mist in the graveyard; it was like something out of a movie,\u201d Jonny continued.  \u201cWe got there, and me and my partner split up \u2018cause we didn\u2019t know where the guy was.  As I moved through the yard I see this guy in trench coat and a hat, you know, built like the guy we\u2019re after, so I held up my gun and I told him to freeze.  He laughed at me.  I moved close.  My gun was still trained on the guy.  He made a sudden move, and I shot him,\u201d Jonny explained.  \u201cHe fell to the ground and, when I ran up to him and turned him over, he was still laughing at me like I\u2019d just told the greatest joke he\u2019d ever heard.  The man\u2019s name was Mike Marshall, a youth pastor in town.  The Old Man had jumped inside his body one night and used that meat suit to get to me.  He laid his hand on my belly, and it was the hottest thing I had ever felt.  It was like al my humanity was burning away.  I passed out, and my body never woke up.\u201d Jonny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedical records showed that my body somehow stayed alive for another three or four days in the hospital, but I was in a coma.  The next thing I remember, I looked down at my body, pale as a ghost, and I saw that I was this swirlin\u2019 mass of black and red smoke.  I heard a scream, and there was this nurse in the room there with me who was there when my spirit came out.  I forced my way down inside her body \u2018cause it was the only thing I knew how to do.  I forger her name.  She had big boobs.  I remember that\u2014those were new to me,\u201d he said with a laugh.  \u201cWithin a couple hours, the Old Man\u2014this time outside Mike Marshall\u2019s body of course\u2014found me and ripped me out of the nurse.  He killed her, and he took me to the mansion, where I stayed for decades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was surprised by all this.  She hadn\u2019t heard it before.  \u201cSo did you have a wif\u2014\u201c she started, but was cut off.  \u201cHere we are,\u201d Jonny said as the two reached the warehouse, and stepped inside, seeing various people huddled over in the corners with no place else to go.  Jonny looked around for a little bit, then quickly headed in the direction of someone who was of interest to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, son,\u201d he called out to a young man.  The boy motioned to himself, as if to ask whether Jonny was talking to him.  \u201cYeah, you,\u201d Jonny said as the two got closer, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name kid?\u201d  \u201cEddie Rollins,\u201d the boy said meekly.  Jonny shook his hand.  Eddie was a boy of sixteen with a face that looked a bit younger.  He was small of stature, standing no taller than probably five foot five and weighing perhaps 125 pounds.  He had a ragged set of clothes and messy hair, as well as a set of geeky-looking glasses.  \u201cHow\u2019d you get here, Eddie?\u201d Jonny asked as he sat his fat body down on a wooden crate.  Lisa stood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad died a long time ago,\u201d he said, \u201cand my mom just a few years ago.\u201d  \u201cHow\u2019d your mom die?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Eddie began, \u201c . . . started a few about five years ago.  \u201cI was eleven.  We got this knock at the door one morning after Mom had had been running herself ragged at work.  She said she was going to take me to the movie that night, but then this guy showed up.  He wore a white suit and looked like a slick used car salesman.  He came selling Bibles in the morning and said he could grant any wish my mom might have, and he said she should try him, she should wish for something.  She thought about it, and she wished that she could know what it was like to be other people, to understand them better,\u201d Eddie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was watching from the top of the stairs, and nobody thought I was, but I was, and so I saw what happened next.  This guy at the table . . . said his name was Zeke,\u201d Eddie recounted.  Jonny perked up, immediately more interested, as though he had heard the name before.  \u201cThis guy grabbed my mom by the hand, and his eyes glowed this bright red color, and so did hers.  He said he\u2019d granted her wish and that the spirits would be with her soon, and then he disappeared in this big puff of smoke.  Mom sat at the table in a daze.  I went downstairs to see if she was okay.  I was just about to touch her, but I heard this guy behind me.  It was a fat old man in a Hawaiian shirt with a straw hat.  He looked to be about seventy.  He said \u2018she\u2019s mine first, kid,\u201d and he just sort of walked up to my mom and sat down, but he sat down into her body.  She shook a bit when it happened, but then her eyes shot open.  She looked down at herself like she was seeing her body for the first time.  She even started playing with her own boobs, and she seemed to be enjoying herself.  \u2018Back in a couple days, kid,\u2019 she said in the man\u2019s voice, and she came back in a couple days later smelling like beer.  The old fat man got out of her body and just disappeared,\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you give us a second?\u201d Jonny said, and Eddie did.  Jonny and Lisa stood and walked some distance away so that the two could talk.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard of this Zeke guy before,\u201d Jonny said, \u201che grants wishes, but only kind of.  The kid\u2019s mom said she wanted to know what it was like to be other people, so this Zeke guy made her body a clearing house for every spirit willing to pony up to Zeke for just a couple extra days on Earth.  The jumped into her body and rode her ragged.  They\u2019d use her body to eat, drink, fuck, anything they wanted.  She\u2019d have been awake for the whole things so that she would know what it was like to be them, but she had no control over her own meat suit.\u201d  \u201cSounds terrible,\u201d Lisa said.  \u201cIt is, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cKid\u2019s mom probably offed herself for one of the couple-hour stretches every few days when she actually had control of her body, and Eddie would have had no other place to go when that happened.  He\u2019s only sixteen . . . kid doesn\u2019t even look like he has to shave yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel sorry for the boy,\u201d Lisa said, looking at Jonny.  \u201cAre you saying you want me to jump inside his body?\u201d Jonny asked, \u201cI picked my last body myself, and it ended up getting shot, so I\u2019ll leave this one to you.  Do you want me to make Eddie Rollins my new home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa opened her mouth and looked like she was about to answer until her cell phone started reading. She frowned as she checked the caller ID and brought the phone to her ear. \"Selina? What is it?\" She asked, moving to the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny watched her as she went and then looked down at Eddie. \"Give us a minute, kid\" he said in his newest voice. This one would be temporary, soon to be replaced with a new body. Jonny moved his fat form to Lisa and listened to bits of her conversation. She sounded as if she was trying to calm Selina down, which Jonny assumed was because of all the stress that Selina had just been through. After a minute or two, Lisa said that she had to go but would see Selina soon and then hung up her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Jonny asked, watching Eddie through the corner of his eyes and making sure that the kid didn't get up and move. That watchfulness was probably not needed though. Where would the kid really go? It wasn't like he could just get up and run away since he had nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put her phone back into her pocket and frowned. \"Selina is very upset, Master. It seems that she saw your old body get shot and then could not find you anywhere after the gala. She's so worried and it seems that she's waiting outside of my house as we speak...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny frowned. \"You couldn't have told her to not worry and go back to her place?\" he asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"I was going to, but then I thought....How do you feel about Selina?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny raised his eyebrow. \"I like her. She's very attractive and powerful. Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....you said that you would have to clean things up with her anyway....and you used to be a police officer, so I thought you might be interested in giving yourself a promotion. You could take over an attractive body, and be back in your old job. It might be good for you, Master...\" Lisa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought about that for a minute. That thought was definitely appealing. Selina really was beautiful and she had power that Jonny could use to make sooooo much beautiful chaos. Not only that, but he would also be back in his old job, which certainly would be nostalgic for him, plus he had not spent time in a female body in ages. It could certainly bring some fun. There was just on thing he did not understand about Lisa's suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, if I were to take over Selina's body, then you wouldn't be able to have me in your house to take care of anymore. So why are you suggesting this?\" He asked. Lisa smiled, and looked down at the ground. It was not a happy smile, but a sad looking one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just want you to be happy, Master. When we were talking about your old life earlier, you seemed to be happy remembering certain parts. I want you to just live happily, and if that means, living in Selina's body, and taking over Selina's life then who am I to tell you otherwise? Besides, we can still be friends....or more...\" she said with a blush. \"I always thought Selina was cute...and the ages would certainly work out better than they did before....you could stay in my house as long as you'd want and I'd be happy to continue serving you, no matter what body you call home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled. Lisa really did care about him, and strangely enough, that made him very happy. He hadn't felt that way in such a long time, he had almost forgotten what it felt like. It was tempting...the thought of being something more with her. And she was right, Selina's body would make that very easy, though he would not have the same need for her as he had in Jack's meat suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny glanced over at Eddie, who was just staring into space, forgetting the goings on around him. The kid's whole life was shaped by a demonic trickster. If Jonny took his body, he could potentially help the kid find revenge. He'd also be able to keep living in Lisa's home, though the age gap would be a bit more than it was last time. If he took Selina's body, then him and Lisa could really explore their relationship in a new way that wouldn't be judged as harshly, but judgments didn't matter to Jonny. He'd also have his former job, and be able to control the entire police department, which would come in very handy in the future. From Selina's body, he could also take in Eddie and train him, making the kid what he wanted. Or he could just forget about Eddie and let him live out his life. However, if Jonny took over Eddie, then he would still need to take care of Selina in some way. Maybe he could try out the cloning power he'd gotten from Cal and have the best of both worlds? Sigh...there were so many choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lisa. I'll tell you what. You get to pick this one for me. Same question I was about to ask you before you took that call, only with a new option. Do you want me to take over Eddie over here and keep up the relationship we had before, just with a different meat suit? Or should I take over Selina, run the police, and we can explore this relationship we have in new ways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, thought for a moment before finally answering....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took his borrowed hand and ran it gracefully across her cheek, and she held it.  Jonny soon turned and walked back over to Eddie, the young boy whose troubles had so moved him.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t quite win the sweepstakes, kid,\u201d Jonny said as he approached the boy.  Eddie looked puzzled.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.  \u201cNo need to worry about that now, because I think I may still be able to help you out,\u201d he said as he set his hand firmly upon the young boy\u2019s scrawny shoulder.  The eyes of Fineburg\u2019s possessed body glowed red, and Eddie\u2019s soon followed.  \u201cMake your way to a restaurant in town called The Warehouse,\u201d he said, \u201cand ask for Katie\u2014the black-haired manager chick with big tits.  See if she might give you a place to stay and maybe some work.  If nothing else, it\u2019s likely to be entertaining,\u201d Jonny said.  The boy nodded like a puppet, \u201cWarehouse . . . big tits . . . stay,\u201d he said.  Jonny released the boy, secure in the knowledge he\u2019d at least picked up the general premise, and he began to waddle back toward the car as Lisa followed.  The two got in, and Lisa began the drive back to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car hummed along as the sounds of waves and the salty smell of the sea gave way again to skyscrapers.  As the two rode along, Jonny looked suddenly to Lisa.  \u201cI was not sure whether you had feelings for me,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa looked straight ahead.  \u201cYes,\u201d she answered.  Jonny paused.  \u201cDo you think your feelings for me are real, or do you just have them because of the mind control I\u2019ve done on you?  I mean, I\u2019ve made you cater to my every whim . . . \u201c he said.  Lisa shrugged her shoulders.  \u201cDoes it make a difference?\u201d Lisa asked, \u201cEither I have real feelings for you, in which case I want you, or I have feelings for you because you\u2019ve molded my mind, in which case . . . I want you,\u201d she said as she glanced over to Jonny.  \u201cFeelings are real if the person who has them thinks they are, and I do,\u201d Lisa explained.  Jonny nodded, seeming to understand.  \u201cSo,\u201d he began, \u201cif I possess Selina\u2019s body, living arrangements aside, we may end up having some explaining to do because, as far as I know, Selina\u2019s not a lesbian,\u201d Jonny said, \u201ctimes are changing, but some people are not accepting of that sort of thing.  Even if they are, we may still have some explaining to do . . . it\u2019ll surprise people,\u201d Jonny said.  He thought for a moment.  \u201cCould you still be attracted to me if I possessed a woman\u2019s body?\u201d he asked.  Lisa paused.  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been with a woman before.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drive back, thunder was heard overhead, and lightening ripped the sky.  The rain came down in buckets, all of it seeming to be some kid of supernatural reaction to the carnage Jonny had wrought, or perhaps a portent of things to come.  Lisa pulled the car into the driveway, and Jonny saw Selina waiting in front of the door as she sat on the steps with her head in her hands.  Jonny and Lisa got out of the car.  \u201cYou go inside.  I\u2019ll do what needs to be done and follow soon,\u201d Jonny instructed.  \u201cYes, Master,\u201d Lisa said as she entered the house.  Jonny used Fineburg\u2019s rotund body to walk out of the garage and into the rain.  His overweight body was quickly soaked as he waddled up to the porch area where Selina sat just barely under a roof.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny inched in her direction.  \u201cHello,\u201d he said, and suddenly Selina looked up.  She\u2019d obviously been crying, and her already figure-hugging dress was soaked from the rain.  \u201cWho are you?\u201d she said.  \u201cMy name is Arthur, and I\u2019m a friend of Lisa\u2019s; what\u2019s wrong?\u201d  Selina sniffled.  \u201cI went to this thing tonight with this really cute, amazing guy, and it was so romantic \u2018cause we danced in the elevator and had dinner on this beautiful roof top with all the lights around us,\u201d she began, crying again.  \u201cIt was where the mayor was supposed to talk and one of my men\u2014I\u2019m the police chief\u2014one of my men took the mayor hostage and said something about JM and started shooting.  He killed a bunch of people.  I lost my date in the chaos, and I don\u2019t know where he is!\u201d she exclaimed as the tears spewed forth.  \u201cHe was great,\u201d she said, \u201cI was going to take him back to my apartment after and maybe have some wine and maybe we could\u2014\u201c she began, and anyone could infer what she thought might come next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny plopped Arthur\u2019s sloppy and soaked body down on the step next to Selina.  \u201cHave they figured out who was behind it?\u201d he asked.  She cried more, \u201cMy officer did it, and all the rest of my men are investigating why.  We still don\u2019t know who JM is or why he or she matters.  In all the chaos, they\u2019re probably all wondering where the hell I am, but I can\u2019t do anything but think about Jonny\u2014that was his name,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI have my gun and my badge and my uniform, but I just sit here in this dress \u2018cause I wore it just to look pretty for him.\u201d  Jonny watched silently inside Arthur Fineburg as the rain poured down.  He reached his pudgy hand up and set it upon Selina\u2019s shoulder, concentrating.  Jonny\u2019s eyes glowed red, and Selina\u2019s did too as her body relaxed and her mind cracked open and Jonny forced his way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelina,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cno matter what happened to Jonny, you will treasure your time with him tonight, and you will know that he treasured his time with you.  The time when you first mustered the courage to ask him out, the time when you fussed over your hair in your bathroom before your date, the time when the two of you danced romantically in the elevator\u2014all these things bring you great joy,\u201d Jonny said as Selina\u2019s face came to be filled with a great and wide smile as these memories filled her mind.  \u201cJoy . . . \u201c she said as she remembered.  \u201cYes,\u201d Jonny replied, as he released the officer.  The two sat there for a moment as Jonny beheld the mystical joy that had spread across Selina\u2019s face.  Then, just as she was shaking her head and starting to emerge from the mental haze, Jonny grabbed her by the shoulders.  \u201cTime for the dismount,\u201d he said as he opened his current host\u2019s mouth and tendrils of black smoke started to force their way out of that body and into Selina\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur Fineburg\u2019s body shook and choked and convulsed as Jonny left him.  Jonny\u2019s ethereal form quickly forced its way inside Selina, whose curvaceous body likewise jerked and jiggled about, her breasts in particular shaking like jello as the demon forced his way into her.  She grabbed and gargled and tried to yell, but to no avail.  Her body fell back roughly on to the ground as the last of Jonny disappeared inside her, and the traumatized body of Arthur Fineburg fell first to its knees and then forward as dead weight onto the concrete.  Jonny opened his new eyes first and immediately took a deep breath, his generous chest expanding mightily as he sucked air into his new lungs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly sat up, taking careful and glorious note of the globes on his chest and the slight bounce they made as he moved.  \u201cWow,\u201d he said as he looked down at them, \u201cI haven\u2019t had boobs in a good while.\u201d  Jonny also examined his dainty hands and his wide, motherly hips and his curvaceous ass.  He slowly stood, taking in all the wonderful sensations, including the fact that his form-fitting gown clung all the more to the new body that had been soaked in the rain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Jonny heard, and his head jerked in the direction of the noise.  Fineburg was loudly and clumsily standing his fat body back up.  \u201cHow did I get out here?\u201d he asked in his nasally voice, \u201cand why are you staring at your own boobs?\u201d he demanded of Jonny.  Jonny just smiled.  Without a word, Jonny reached down and rummaged around in the bag that Selina had brought with her.  He felt clothes, make-up, keys, and the finally what he was looking for.  Jonny stood his new body back up, this time with the gun in hand as he pointed it at Arthur.  Fineburg immediately put his hands up.  \u201cPut that down before you hurt somebody!\u201d he screamed.  \u201cThanks for the lift Art, but I really can\u2019t have any lose ends,\u201d Jonny said matter-of-factly as he fired a single, solitary shot straight into the fat man\u2019s head.  Fineburg crumbled, falling first to his knees, causing a shake in his considerable belly, and then to the side and into the pouring rain.  His blood ran down the sidewalk.  Jonny put the gun away and walked without a word into the house, his female form glistening with drops of rain that dripped slowly on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another room and without Jonny\u2019s knowledge, Lisa sat and looked upon a picture from about twenty years earlier\u2014her college graduation.  She\u2019d had big hair at that time and watched Friends obsessively.  So it was fitting that the picture itself included her best friend\u2014a younger and slightly less curvy Selina McCarthy, both of them smiling into the camera.  Lisa looked at the picture with a strange look of sadness and satisfaction.  She set the picture own the table and stared at it.  Her eyes narrowed.  \u201cNobody will have my Jonny but ME!\u201d she said as she brought her fist down upon the picture swiftly, shattering the frame, and ripping the part of the picture with Selina\u2019s image to shreds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Lisa had finished ripping up Selina's picture, she heard the clicking of heels entering the room. She jumped slightly and turned to see Selina standing in the door way, hands on her hips and a devious smile on her face that Lisa had only seen on Jonny's body before. \"Master!\" she exclaimed happily, jumping up from where she was seated and hugging the body of her former friend tightly. The possessed Selina hugged her back, smiling as she felt the two sets of generous breasts squeezing against eachother. \"That is you in there, isn't it, Master?\" Lisa asked, forcing herself away from the elegantly dressed police chief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent Selina kept that devious grin on her face as she nodded. \"That's right. Selina's body is mine now, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it will be for a very long time. It feels very nice in here. So mature, and well kept. Not to mention the power that I now wield as police chief will certainly come in handy for my future plans. And you're going to be right there with me as my right hand woman, won't you Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa happily nods, excited from the idea of being able to be of more service to her master, and still being excited from the contact they had just had. \"Of course master! I never want to stop being of use to you!\" she exclaimed, looking over Jonny's newest body again, as if in awe. \"I'm sorry, but this is just so strange. I see my friend Selina's body, but I know that it's my master in control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that going to present a problem for you, Lisa?\" The new Selina asks, still feeling over the curves of her body at every available opportunity, which lead to some laughs from Lisa, who knew that her friend would have never felt herself over the way that her body's new owner was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"No, master....actually, I suppose the correct term for you is 'mistress' now, isn't it?\" she asked with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled with Selina's beautiful face. \"It makes no difference to me. Call me whatever you're comfortable with, but you're right. Since my body is female, I'd technically be your mistress...\" she said, finding it odd, referring to herself that way but then shrugging. She'd get used to it soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Mistress....\" Lisa said, finding it difficult to keep a straight face with that statement. \"Anyway, it won't be a problem at all. If anything, I feel like this is the best of both worlds\" she says with a smile, putting her hand on top of Selina's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Selina smiled back at Lisa and looked down at the picture on her bed and ripped pieces on the floor.  She picked up the ripped picture and looked at it, having her body'd memories tell her exactly what it was. \"This was our graduation picture, wasn't it? We were so cute back then\" she says, getting into the character that her body was providing for her. Lisa looked confused, as if she was unsure that Jonny was still the one who was talking to her. Selina noticed that look on her face and smiled reassuringly, letting her know that no matter how she sounded, the real Selina was nonexistent. \"Why is my half all ripped? did you not like the way I was dressed or something?\" she asked jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laughed before responding \"Not quite, Mistress. I was...jealous of Selina...the old Selina, that is. Growing up, we were always into very different types of guys, so we never had a lot of competition. but lately you were spending so much time with her...I just wanted to have you all to myself. I want to be the only human you have doing your bidding. I want to do everything you need and I have the connections to do it, so why shouldn't I be the only one that you give those privileges to? I started to despise Selina for getting so close to you and for caring about you so much. I was so angry that I couldn't look at this any more. I felt like she betrayed my trust and friendship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's body let out a laugh from that. Even from within Selina's body, her laugh sounded like music to Jonny's ears. \"Well you won't have to worry about any of that now, Lisa. I see no reason why we can't just go back to being best friends now...plus a little more\" she said, leaning forward and kissing Lisa on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa pulled herself away, blushing. \"That...that felt very strange....I've never...kissed a girl before....\" Lisa said, flustered, which caused the newly possessed Selina to just laugh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Lisa. Would you rather that we just be friends?\" she asked, but was interrupted by Lisa kissing her deeply and running her hands over Selina's thigh as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mistress. I'd rather us be more. It was new, that's all\" Lisa said with a grin before you kissed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a bit of fun, you pushed her off of you and looked at yourself in the mirror. \"Sorry to cut this short, but I need to get to my station. Everyone has been freaking out, probably still is freaking out, and Selina here is nowhere to be found. I certainly can't lose my job the first day I have it, now can I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked disappointed that the fun was over, but shook her head. \"Of course not, mistress\" she says as a blush forms on her face when she sees Selina stripping off her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go to work dressed like this. My uniform is in my bag. Please bring it to me\" she tells Lisa, who does what she is told. Lisa helps her friend get her uniform on and then kisses Selina once again. Selina smiled and picked up her bag. \"I'll leave my dress here since I'm sure I'll be back to get it soon enough. Take care, Lisa\" she says turning around and leaving the room, her hips swaying behind her as Lisa watched with a smile on her face. She had no idea, that Jonny had done some additional fiddling with her mind, implanting the idea that she would now be sexually attracted to Selina's body in order to prevent any awkwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to her car, the newly uniformed Selina noticed Arthur Finebergs body was still on the ground in a pool of blood. \"Well, I certainly can't just leave you out here, now can I, Arty?\" Her eyes glowed red as the fat man's body shifted into the body of a dead bird. All of the blood around it evaporated from the ground. \"There we go...that's much better\" she said, stepping over the bird and getting into her car, which she now knew was an unmarked police vehicle. Selina grinned mischievously as she turned on her siren and sped off, no longer having to follow any rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny drove to the station like a bat out of hell, sirens blazing the whole way.  He skidded into the marking lot and into the specialized parking space reserved for Chief McCarthy.  He exited the car and walked into the station and was blasted with a plethora of noises as the whole places hummed with activity.  Papers flew about; cops and detectives talked on phones and via text and e-mail, contacting every informant and shady ex-con they knew in a desperate attempt to figure out why Officer Brown had seemingly attempted to kill the Mayor and had successfully killed a number of other officials, as well as just what his crazed screams were about.  A few people in the area when Jonny walked in noted the entrance of the chief, or at least of her body, and briefly acknowledged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny made his way through the throngs of people, with most people politely moving aside as they saw their superior approach.  Jonny came to the desk of one Eric Martinez, a 7-year veteran of the force, which Jonny knew from Selina\u2019s memories, as Martinez sat at his desk filling out paperwork.  \u201cMartinez!  Up!\u201d Jonny yelled, which he had to do to be heard over all the commotion.  Martinez quickly stood from his chair, awaiting the chief\u2019s next order.  Jonny climbed on to Martinez\u2019s chair and used that to climb next on to his desk, where he stood upon the papers that littered its surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP!\u201d Jonny screamed at the top of his host\u2019s lungs.  All of the commotion came to a halt in a few seconds as officers all looked to their chief.  \u201cOkay everybody,\u201d Jonny started, now not having to yell as loudly as possible, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of shit going on tonight, so we need to stay coordinated, and I need all you to make sure you\u2019re focused on the right stuff.  Here\u2019s what I want you to do.  Number one priority is making sure the Mayor is as safe as we can make her, so I want guards at her house and at her office.  Number two priority is figuring out what the hell was going through Brown\u2019s mind and why, and what was he talking about when he said what he did was for JM?  Did he mean a person?  If so, who?  Did he mean a company?  Did whoever it was for\u2014whoever JM is\u2014get to other people, and are there going to be more crimes like this?  Relatedly, I need to see Helen Gaston in my office immediately, so somebody get on the horn to her and tell her to see me pronto.  Let\u2019s go to work people!\u201d Jonny screamed as he started to get down from the desk, having given the officers who happened to be behind her a wonderful view of her ass of which they surely took advantage.  Of course, \u201cJM\u201d meant Jonny Macs, but that did not have to come out just yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMartinez,\u201d he said to the officer whose desk he had commandeered, \u201cthere\u2019s a guy named Arthur Fineburg who seems to have gone missing . . . fat guy with nerdy glasses and an accountant in the same building where the attack happened.  I want to know where he is, and I want to know whether the fact that we can\u2019t find his fat ass has anything to do with whatever happened on the roof tonight.\u201d  \u201cYes mam,\u201d Martinez said, nodding and running off.  Jonny slowly made his way to the chief\u2019s office.  He opened the door and made his way in, then closed the door again as he made his way into the room and looked at all the pictures on the walls, most of them of the chief in various big-time events.  Jonny plopped his generous posterior down on the chair behind the chief\u2019s desk and took stock of his handiwork, visible through the office window\u2014the cops were in a state of only semi-organized chaos, all because of the malevolent spirit now inhabiting their curvy chief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, there came a knock at the door.  \u201cEnter,\u201d Jonny called out, and the door opened.  The figure who stepped in was Helen Gaston, a woman of 29 years.  She had received an MSc in accounting some years before\u2014forensic accounting to be precise\u2014and quickly found a job with the police station.  Most of her time was spent tracking drug money that came in and out of local business that were suspected to be fronts for drug organizations and other illegal operations.  Even well-laundered money had to go somewhere, and Helen\u2019s job was to find it.  In order to clamp down on corrupt cops, she also did periodic financial work-ups on the various members of the police force just to make sure none of them were the target of improper influence from those who might want to have a cop in their pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen\u2019s work had not served her body well.  Hers was a sedentary vocation, often done in front of a computer our pouring over accounting and tax forms, which she mostly did from her desk as she scarfed down doughnuts.  Helen\u2019s body was rather sloppy, with her breasts sagging under their own weight and a blouse about to surrender to her bouncing belly fat as she walked.  Her rear and her legs were likewise abundantly pudgy, so she probably did not get out much.  Thick glasses adorned her face, and her sense of humor left a bit to be desired.  \u201cCome on in Helen; have a seat, and close the shades,\u201d Jonny said.  Helen ambled in, closed the blinds in the office, and wedged her ass into a chair, which took some effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we on Brown?\u201d Jonny said as he stood and walked around the front of his desk, plopping his beautiful form on the front of the desk and a few feet from Gaston.  \u201cI\u2019ve done the numbers on him 2 or 3 times.  He\u2019s clean, no big money transfers into his account or that of anyone in his family.  He must have just snapped . . . at least the people of the city can remember him as a good cop who had a psychotic break, not a dirty cop who was never on their side to begin with,\u201d Gaston said positively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee . . . Helen, that\u2019s no good for me,\u201d Jonny said.  Helen tilted her head to the side, confused.  \u201cWhat do you mea\u2014\u201c she began, just before Jonny leapt from the desk and wrapped his host\u2019s hands around Helen\u2019s thunder-thighs, his eyes glowing a familiar red.  Helen\u2019s sloppy, fat-filled body relaxed as her eyes took on the same glow.  \u201cHelen,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to forge some documents for me.  I want you to create some records showing that Officer Brown was not the squeaky clean officer we all believed him to be.  I want him to have gotten several large pay-outs from a certain person or firm of undeniably shady character who had some reason to want their mayor dead.  I want the city to know that their white knight was really just a liar and a thief,  I want their ideals crushed.  Understand?\u201d  \u201cLiar . . . thief . . . bribes,\u201d came the mindless response of the enthralled woman.  \u201cGood,\u201d Jonny said as he released the woman, \u201cnow get to it.\u201d  The accountant stood from the chair and left the office silently, off to shake the city\u2019s faith in its golden boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked back around and sat down at Selina\u2019s desk.  After a couple minutes of pondering, he hit a button on the phone, and a pleasant secretary-like woman answered.  \u201cGladys,\u201d Jonny said to the secretary, \u201cthere were people injured at the event tonight, and they\u2019ll be in the hospital.  I want to meet with them in the hospital, and I want the media there to see it, after which I want to spend some time alone with the victims.  Get the on the calendar as soon as possible.\u201d  \u201cYes mam,\u201d came the response over the phone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny kicked his feet up onto Selina's desk and leaned back in Selina's chair, relaxing. He closed his new eyes and smiled, breathing in and out, enjoying the feelings of his generous new breasts as they rise and fall. He thought about the wonderful life that he had stolen. Since she was the chief, Selina was very well paid compared to her lower ranked colleges, so Jonny now had a steady income that he could use for whatever he pleased, independent of whatever money that Lisa had for Jonny, which was presumably all of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, Jonny was now back in his former occupation, which he had to admit gave him a nice dose of nostalgia from his former life. This was far better than the past though. He was now a beautiful woman, and he was in a higher position than he ever would have achieved back in the day. Jonny opened his eyes and looked down at his chest. Just over his right breast was the custom police chief badge that Selina gladly wore and used to right the wrongs of the city. It was ironic that from now on, this badge would be used to bring about the chaos that Selina had fought against for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny;s thoughts were interrupted by the feeling of her cell phone vibrating inside of her pocket. She opened it, seeing a text from Lisa. <b>I miss you</b>, the text said.  Jonny sighed, unsure what to do about this. It was true that Lisa had proven herself incredibly loyal to him over these past few days. Jonny was also far closer with Lisa than he was, and probably would ever be, with any human. Still, Lisa was demonstrating some strange behaviors. Jonny notitced that Lisa was becoming quite clingy, taking it upon herself to make sure that Jonny was well dressed and that his plans were in proper order even if he did not tell her to do that. She also showed that fit of jealousy towards Selina by ripping up the picture of the two of them. The real Selina would have been absolutely heartbroken from the thought of her best friend doing that, but Lisa wasn't exactly the same woman that she was at that point in her life. Jonny's tweaking at The Warehouse had made sure of that, but it seemed to work too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Lisa was texting Jonny at Selina's workplace. It was clear to Jonny that Lisa wanted a relationship with him that was more than just a Master-Servant relationship. And part of Jonny wanted that as well, given their behavior before Jonny had left for the police station. Still, this felt wrong. Jonny did not feel any regret from playing with Lisa's mind, in fact, he absolutely loved the idea that he could make any human on earth that subservient to him. Part of him, also enjoyed Lisa's affection for him. It was nice knowing that someone cared for him and always would. Either way, Lisa may soon become more of an annoyance than a help, especially if she becomes jealous of every female that Jonny got close to, which would probably be quite a lot given the things that he would be doing. If this continued, Jonny may have to do something to Lisa that he would regret, and he really did not want to do that. Not yet, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's thoughts were interrupted yet again, but this time by a knock on the door. \"Come in!\" Jonny said in Selina's voice, as he pushed Selina's phone to the side of her desk. He would get back to that conversation later. The door to Selina's office opened and a policeman walked in. He looked to be about 30 years old with short blond hair. \"Yes?\" The apparent Selina asked as she removed her feet from the desk and took on a normal sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman stood at attention. \"Ma'am, we have reason to believe that the most powerful crime boss in the area has been assassinated by his youngest daughter, who has taken over the family throne by killing all of her competitors. She was last seen heading in the direction the The Warehouse, and we are ready to make a move if you give the order\" he said with a proud smile. Selina's memories told Jonny that the police had been after that family for years and this was a way for them to finally strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tempting as it was for Jonny to play the role of the good cop again, and as much as Selina's internal view of justice would have wanted the crime family taken down, Jonny just could not let that happen. Anything that had to do with the Warehouse was probably Katie's doing, which meant that it could be used to Jonny's advantage, but he'd have to find out what Katie was up to first.  \"Don't make any moves yet. Tell everyone in the area to just lay back and watch how things go. I'll go to the Warehouse myself undercover and will see what I can pick up. No one else is to go inside. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman nodded. \"Understood, Ma'am\" he said, before leaving to give the orders to the rest of the troops. the current Selina stood up and stretched, cracking her back. She opened her phone to find several more texts from Lisa. A sigh came from her mouth as she texted back. <b>I'm coming back to change into my dress. Miss you too.</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the message sent, Jonny left his new office and began the drive back to Lisa's house. Strangely enough, as annoyed as he was about Lisa's clingyness, he found that he had actually missed her as well. He hadn't missed anyone since becoming a demon. How strange....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny parked Selina's car just outside of Lisa's house and walked in, stepping on the dead bird that was once Arthur Fineburg as she made her way to the door, which Lisa had already unlocked for him. He opened the door and walked into the house, smelling Lisa's cooking immediately as the door closed behind him. Jonny could have easily just made a new night time outfit appear on Selina's body, but he wanted to take this opportunity to have a little talk with Lisa. Things had to be discussed and this may be the only time to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked into Lisa's bedroom, finding Selina's dress discarded on the floor exactly where it was left only a few hours ago. He picked up the dressed and looked at it with a smile on Selina's sexy face. This dress was the first thing that he had made Selina buy with her stolen money. It had wreaked havoc on Selina's conscience and set her up as Jonny's pawn. It was the starting point of her descent which ended with her being Jonny's most useful, and beautiful, meat suit yet. the possessed Selina began unbuttoning her uniform top, slowly revealing her breasts, which she moved on of her hands to and felt. Jonny hadn't gotten to spend nearly enough time getting to know his body before he found himself busy doing work. He still didn't have time to fully get used to being such a gorgeous woman. so much had to be done in such short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Come here!\" Jonny yelled as he dropped Selina's uniform top to the floor, leaving him in only Selina's bra and police pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa entered the room soon after, smiling happily. \"Hey there, Mistress! You look nice\" she said, walking over quickly and hugging the body of her former friend. The current Selina pushed her away, but smiled brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lisa. Sit down on the bed while I get my dress back on, please\" she says as Lisa does as she was told. Jonny slides Selina's pants off and stands in her underwear briefly before starting to slip the black dress on over her curves. \"Look, we have to discuss a lot of things. I really like you Lisa...Not only for the fact that you've been an excellent, loyal servant, or for the fact that you've given some wonderful ideas, not the least of which was suggesting that I jump into this...lovely meat suit\" Jonny says, putting his hands over Selina's breasts for emphasis. \"But I've also genuinely grown fond of you and enjoy the...love that you have displayed towards me. You make me feel things that I have not felt since I was alive and living with my wife. If I were still human, I would say that I love you, but as a demon, that's an impossibility.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny watched as Lisa blushed fromt he complement. \"Thank you, mistress...that means a lot to me\" she said, looking down at her feet, as if she were too embarrassed to look Selina's body in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny continued what he had been saying as he finishes sliding the dress on over Selina's body, feeling the tight material on every one of Selina's wonderful curves. \"But there are a few things that need to be discussed\" Jonny said, sitting down next to Lisa, making sure that Selina's legs were against Lisa's. He placed Selina's hand on Lisa's thigh and smiled at Lisa. \"As you know, my plans involve quite a lot of manipulation. Because of that, I'm going to need to have others around me quite a bit. Other women, and men who I have not devoured, but who are working under my orders. I will probably be quite close to them. And I cannot have you jealous and thinking that they are going to steal me away from you like how you were with Selina. Do you understand?\" Jonny asked, looking Lisa right in the eyes. Strangely enough, he did not just try to control her into acting better. Jonny felt that Lisa didn't deserve to be manipulated anymore by him. He cared for her too take away more of her free will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"Yes, mistress. I understand. I'll try to be less jealous of the people that you use. I just...I can't bear seeing you getting close to them. I care about you so much, and I want to be the only one to make you happy. I want to be more useful to you than anyone else tries to be.\" She puts her hand over Jonny's and holds it tightly. \"I want to be your only one\" she says, quietly as a tear drops from her eyes onto her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny moved Selina's other hand to Lisa's cheek and moved Lisa's head so her face was facing Selina's. Jonny smiled at her and wiped away the tears before kissing Lisa gently. \"Lisa, don't you understand? You are closer to me than any human will ever be. You have more money than anyone else I have in my network, and more connections than anyone other than the body that I'm wearing. You're my meat suit's best friend, and I never want anyone else to serve me in the ways that you do. You are the only human that I will ever feel anything even close to an emotional connection with. Therefore, by definition, you are the only human that can ever truly make me happy. You will be mine for as long as you wish it. And I hope that is for a long time. Now, are we good?\" Jonny asks, putting Selina;s other hand over Lisa's hand, sandwiching her hand between both of Selina's in a comforting way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiles and nods. \"Yes, mistress. We're good. I'll try my best not to get too jealous. No promises though\" she says, slipping her hand out from Selinas and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stands up as well, straightening out the dress and making sure that Selina looked good int he mirror before kissing Lisa one more time. \"Just try your best, Lisa. that's all I'm asking of you for now. Also, please try to refrain from texting me so much while I'm at work. If you want to be clingy, that's fine, but seven texts in 10 minutes? really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa giggled. \"Sorry about that. I guess I'm like a little puppy. I love hearing from you, Mistress. I'll text you less\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled. \"Great. See you later then\" he said as he turned Selina's shoes into elegant 8 inch high heels. The now dressed Selina did a quick spin in front of Lisa before leaving the house and heading back to her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled as she watched the possessed Selina leave the house. No one else had ever made her feel happier than Jonny did, which is why she cared so much for her master...now mistress. the fact that he was wearing the body of her former best friend made it all the better since she no longer had to worry about being jealous and already felt comfortable around her. She was so happy and would really try to behave the way her mistress wanted her to. Jonny was worth it for her to fight against her jealousy to preserve her relationship with him. Lisa locked the door and then went back into her kitchen, to finish cooking up her dinner. She did not notice the Old Man, standing in the back corner of the room, watching her as she went about her work.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina walked out to her car and got in, starting the drive toward the restaurant from which the man inside her body had first taken Lisa.  Jonny emerged from the car and strutted toward the restaurant, his stolen body\u2019s hips swinging and its breasts bouncing as he walked in high-heeled shoes.  A well-dressed doorman\u2014a pleasant fat kid named Michael, if his nametag was to be believed\u2014opened the door as Selina walked in.  Jonny gazed about as he beheld the splendor of sin and debauchery and depravity of various kinds that filled the restaurant.  Immediately upon entering, though, Jonny removed Selina\u2019s phone from her purse and texted the officer who she\u2019d talked to earlier.  \u201cStand ready with the SWAT Team,\u201d she told him, \u201cno one moves until I get a clue where he is.  If I give the order, come through the back door . . . we don\u2019t want to end up on the news unless we have the bastard in cuffs.\u201d  Jonny replaced the phone in the purse and walked into the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny strutted his curvy body straight past the tables and right into the restaurant\u2019s kitchen, flinging the door open mightily and simply walking in.  Cooks with grease-stained shirts eyed the newcomer suspiciously.  After all, she was not supposed to be back there.  After a couple minutes of looking about in the kitchen, Jonny heard a male voice behind him.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, but only employees in the kitchen please, now if you\u2019ll kindly come this way\u2014\u201c Jonny turned and saw a hulking giant of a man\u2014Dimbe.  \u201cNo you big ugly fuck, I think you\u2019ll take me right to your boss instead,\u201d Jonny commanded, his host\u2019s eyes glowing red as a display of power to the big, soulless Dimbe.  He followed Jonny\u2019s orders and led Selina down a couple hallways, and at the end of a second was a large door.  Outside that door were two very large guards with their arms crossed across their chests.  They were even bigger than Dimbe, and that was not true of many people.  Dimbe led Selina through the door, and the two large guards made sure to check out her curves as she passed.  Jonny gave them a slight smile.  Dimbe swung the door open, and Jonny stepped in to a spacious, well-appointed office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of this room stood two people\u2014Katie and a woman Jonny did not yet know.  Katie smiled, immediately discerning Jonny\u2019s presence despite his curvaceous meat suit.  \u201cHow\u2019s it going?!\u201d Katie said as she leapt into Jonny\u2019s arms and gave her a big hug as though the two were long-lost sisters.  After ending the hug, Katie stepped back with a smile and looked Jonny over, taking in his new form.  \u201cI heard my body bit the dust . . . damn shame.  Still, but of an upgrade, huh?\u201d Katie asked Jonny as she pointed to the globes dangling from Selina\u2019s chest.  \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to them,\u201d Jonny said with a lovely smile, \u201cand rest assured I\u2019m loving every minute of that process.\u201d  Jonny stepped over to the other figure standing at the desk, \u201cAnd you would be--?\u201d he asked.  \u201cVanessa,\u201d the woman responded, \u201cit\u2019s an honor to meet you,\u201d she said with a wide smile, \u201cKatie tells me you\u2019re really great, and he said you might be getting a new body soon, so congratulations on that.  I wish I could get bigger boobs too, but I just work for Master Katie,\u201d Vanessa said with a somewhat star-struck smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused for a minute.  \u201cWell the boobs are certainly legitimate items of concern, but at the moment I\u2019d really be more concerned about the policemen outside,\u201d he said.  The smile immediately dropped off Vanessa\u2019s face, and of course Katie was immediately concerned.  Jonny looked at both of the women, but particularly Vanessa.  \u201cMy young dear, congrats on the promotion, really, but you\u2019ve got a rat in your organization, \u2018cause my people were able to know when you\u2019d taken out Daddy and exactly where you were headed.  You might want to lock that shit down, whoever it is,\u201d Jonny said.  Vanessa gulped.  Katie looked concerned for obvious reasons.  \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d she said.  Jonny paused.  \u201cI can\u2019t maintain credibility among my people if I just call \u2018em off when they\u2019re sure you\u2019re in here, and they\u2019re right.  I\u2019ll work a bit of a trick to avoid major complications, but there\u2019s probably no way to avoid it\u2014they\u2019re gonna have to come through the door,\u201d Jonny said.  Katie nodded, not liking the idea but understanding the importance of keeping up appearances.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t go until I tell them to.  Do you keep the financials on site?\u201d Jonny asked.  Katie shook her head.  \u201cNo, we moved them to a secured location\u2014under the bed of Michael, the now-soulless fat-ass doorman.  Once I ripped his soul out of his body, you\u2019d be amazed how fast those Boy Scout ethics just dried right up,\u201d Katie said with a chuckle.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s the safest place,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not here, and that\u2019s good.\u201d  Jonny next walked up to Vanessa as the human stood nervously before him, \u201cAnd now what to do with you?\u201d he said contemplatively.  Vanessa looked confused, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d  \u201cWell I can\u2019t have the cops busting in here and finding the newest crime lord in town plopped in a chair and chatting with the new honor of this fine establishment merely hours after taking Daddy out, now can I?\u201d Jonny said, \u201cthat\u2019s bad PR.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought for a minute, and then a smile crossed his host\u2019s face.  He looked at Vanessa.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan you\u2019re not likely to be a big fan of,\u201d she said.  Vanessa frowned.  \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d she asked.  Without a word, Selina put her hands on Vanessa\u2019s belly, and both women\u2019s eyes began to glow red.  This, time, though, it was not the subject\u2019s mind she sought to alter\u2014it was her body.  Jonny had picked up the power to alter the bodies of those whose meat suits happened not to suit his purposes, and Vanessa\u2019s most certainly did not at the moment.  Vanessa\u2019s head dropped to her chest as her entire body relaxed, and then her body began to pulse and blur, shifting and swirling about.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The changes began in her legs.  Thighs and shins that had been toned and sexy suddenly became pale.  Her skin started to relax and sag, and her legs began to expand as though someone were injecting blubber straight into them.  An ass that would be the envy of most suddenly ballooned to a size worthy of a Goodyear label, shredding the lower part of Vanessa\u2019s sexy red dress.  Similar changes continued farther up, as Vanessa\u2019s belly suddenly surged forward, forming that of a person who clearly had not been to the gym in decades and who probably gorged on chocolate and cheesecake nightly.  Bits of hair dotted this new figure\u2019s stomach and chest, and arms and finger soon plumped up as well.  Vanessa\u2019s wonderful chest was overwritten with a sloppy set of man-boobs so big a bra was almost necessary.  Then came the changes to her face.  It too expanded as a double chin appeared, and decades were added to the body\u2019s age.  A thick white mustache appeared on her lip, and a thin layer of messy white hair sprinkled a head with not much hair left on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, black smoke began to envelop this less-than-ideal body.  A pair of dark suit pants appeared to cover the figure\u2019s pudgy legs, and a belt appeared around his waste.  Given the size of the figure\u2019s protruding gut, which strained against both the pants and the white dress shirt, it\u2019s a wonder that the belt was necessary; in fact, it probably was not.  A dark suit jacket also smoked its way into existence, with the front of the jacket left unbuttoned because it could not contain the figure\u2019s bulging belly.  Selina stepped back and beheld her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure standing before her was that of State Senator Thadius Blubberton, a man whose name had been aptly chosen upon his birth some 74 years ago.  This man was known for his physical size where he worked in the state Senate and was, both personally and politically, a supporter of the state\u2019s many fine (and not-so-fine) restaurants.  \u201cWhat in tarnation did you do to me?!\u201d the newly minted man yelled upon feeling his rotund (and quite male) body.  Selina just chuckled.  \u201cYou best be puttin\u2019 me back in my own body or I\u2019m gonna skin you like a runned-over possum!\u201d he shouted, \u201cand why in the sam hill am I talkin\u2019 like this?!\u201d  Katie could barely contain her laughter.  \u201cI gave you the body of the good Senator, Senator, as well as his mannerisms just so you could play the part for a time,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cYou\u2019re now precisely the kind of person you would find in an upscale, trendy establishment like this one.  Play the part when the cops come through the door.  Being in here is not a crime by itself, and they\u2019ll treat the gelatinous Senator Blubberton with much more respect than they will a newly minted murderer and crime boss,\u201d Selina explained.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I made the spell wear off an hour from now.  If the Senator\u2019s body is any indicator, you\u2019ll spend any free time you have after the cops leave emptying out the full-service buffet,\u201d Selina declared.  Vanessa grumbled but shut up because she really did not feel like getting arrested.  \u201cAnd once you do have your thinner, sexier body back,\u201d Selina started, \u201cput some effort into figuring out whoever tipped off my guys and killing them.  I\u2019d sooner have my guys working hard to solve crime that just pops back up again and again than have them sure they\u2019ve found a crime boss only to break down the door and find a fat fuck of a state legislator.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina turned to Katie.  \u201cAlways a pleasure,\u201d she said with a smile which was returned.  She then turned to the apparent Senator.  \u201cDo some sit-ups, Vanessa, if you want to maintain your girlish figure,\u201d she said as she patted the fat man stiffly on the belly.  She then turned and began to walk from the office and out the door.  Upon reaching her car outside, Selina drew her phone again to give orders to the SWAT team.  \u201cTwo big guards in front of back room door . . . assume daughter in there . . . had to leave because I thought I had been recognized.  Call in the morning with a report.  GO NOW!\u201d she said, hitting send as she put the car in gear and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Jonny arrived again at Lisa\u2019s house.  He walked though the door to find her sitting in the living room with her laptop open clad in pajamas.  She looked up at Jonny and smiled at him through her glasses.  \u201cHi Mistress!\u201d she said.  She even looked sexy when she was about to go to bed.  \u201cHey Lisa, Jonny said as he tossed the keys on the counter and sat his curvy ass down in one of the big leather chairs, taking a deep breath as her mighty boobs expanded with her inhaling.  Lisa sat and scrolled about on the computer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jonny had sat for a few minutes, Lisa stood up and came over to him.  She slowly and sexily sat her body down on Selina\u2019s lap, leaning in and pushing their sizeable boobs together as she kissed Jonny.  \u201cMistress?\u201d she said.  \u201cYes,\u201d answered Jonny.  Lisa looked down, biting her lip a little as if nervous.  \u201cWe\u2019ve . . . um . . . we\u2019ve never actually been on a date,\u201d she said.  Jonny paused.  \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.  \u201cWell, um, you know . . . most couples go places together and do things together and spend time together and they\u2019re open about loving each other and things and, well, we\u2019ve never been on a date.  Maybe if I\u2019m clingy it\u2019s because we don\u2019t go to dinner or to movies or anything like that,\u201d she said.  Jonny thought about it for a minute.  \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d he said with a slight smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused.  \u201cWell, there\u2019s this beach place\u2014this resort called Thousand Waves at the lake a couple hours away, and it\u2019s really romantic.  I was just looking online, and they\u2019ve got this hotel right on the beach and this restaurant with sea food and a piano player and you can hear the waves crashing into the rocks while you eat.  And if there\u2019s a storm, you can sit out on the porch and watch the clouds roll in, then when the storm really gets going you can run into the room and hide under the covers and turn all the lights off,\u201d she said, a wide, giddy smile crossing her face.  \u201cTomorrow starts the weekend, and we\u2019ve both got a couple days off.  Will you take me?\u201d she asked, her face sincere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can teleport us both there right no\u2014\u201c Selina began, and Lisa simply put her hand over Selina\u2019s lips with a laugh.  \u201cHaha no, no no no no , please, no powers.  No demons, no grand plan for chaos.  Things will be nuts enough without you for just a couple days.  You can even let loose a little mayhem tomorrow morning if you want, but after that, just for this weekend, it\u2019s us\u2014just you and me, please?  And we drive like a normal couple,\u201d Katie pleased.  Jonny paused for a minute, then he smiled widely.  Lisa smiled too, knowing what that response meant.  \u201cPack a bag in the morning,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cThank you so much.  I\u2014I think I love you,\u201d she said as she leaned in and kissed Jonny passionately on the lips.  \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that Chief McCarthy is well-take-care-of tonight,\u201d Lisa said with a sexy smile as she reached down and sexily fondled Selina\u2019s breasts and kissed her again and again, sinking into a night of pleasure.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The new Selina was sitting in the driver's seat of her unmarked police car, waiting for Lisa to finish getting ready so that the two of them could begin their weekend. Lisa wanted to take one of her lovely cars, but Selina insisted that they take hers so that the two could ignore speed limits and have a fun filled drive. Last night had been a wonderful night for Selina, filled with pleasure and happiness that the demon possessing her body had not experienced in over 70 years at this point. She listened to a lovely song on the radio, while reading through the text messages that she had ignored during the incredible sex that Lisa and her were having the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suspected, Selina's men had no luck finding the up and coming crime boss at The Warehouse, though they did interrupt a meeting between the Warehouse's new owner and a well known Senator, who really let them have it for interrupting his evening. Various guests at the establishment did say that they saw Vanessa that evening so the officers assumed they had been sloppy and let her slip away from under their noses. Selina made sure to let them know that she did not personally blame them for their mistake and assured them that they were forgiven for any mistakes they could have made. She did however, suggest for them to take a break from their jobs and spend some time with their families. After that, she called into her Lieutenant and let him know that she would be unavailable for the weekend due to a commitment. Once she closed her phone and slid it into the pocket of the tight jeans she was wearing, Selina looked back at the house, waiting for Lisa to be ready. As the front door opened, a smile couldn't help but come onto Selina's gorgeous face. She was genuinely excited and happy to be spending this time with someone that meant so much to her. Last night, Lisa had told Selina that she thought she loved her, and now that Selina had time to think about her own feelings, she could be honest with herself. She felt it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little bit before Selina had her revelation, Lisa was singing a tune to herself as she showered. It was early in the morning, and the attractive woman had turned 45 only a few minutes before waking up. Birthdays hadn't been fun for Lisa since she turned 21 and celebrated by having a night on the town with her best friend, Selina McCarthy. It was funny to her that now that she was 45, she'd be celebrating her birthday with a very different Selina. One that she was far...closer with. A smirk came onto Lisa's face as she remembered the fun that the two women had last night. It was the first real sexual experience that Lisa had in a very long time, and she loved every moment of it. In fact, Lisa loved everything about her Master Jonny, or now her Mistress Selina. She would do anything and everything to keep that love alive. Right now, she was just happy that her mistress agreed to her weekend. Lisa had a lot of fun planned for the two of them. If the new Selina thought that last night was fun, she won't believe what happens over the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lisa put the shampoo into her long red hair, there was a few knocks from outside of the bathroom. \"Lisa, will you be done soon?\" Selina asked, her voice muffled from the closed door as well as the sound of the shower running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'll be ready in a few minutes. Why don't you wait in the car, mistress? I'll join you once I'm done here!\" Lisa yelled so that she could be heard through the door as she closed her eyes  to run the moisturizing shampoo through her hair, adding the extra volume it would need to look as nice as possible for her mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just try not to take too long! You know I hate waiting!\" Selina yelled just before Lisa heard the clicks of her heels against the floor and her bedroom door closing. Just like that, Lisa was all along with her thoughts, though almost all of those were interupted by thoughts of her master/mistress. No matter what body Jonny wore, Lisa's love for him would never fade. Hell, she even loved him during that brief period when he wore that slobby Arthur Fineburg. Lisa wondered what had happened to him for a second but shrugged it off as she washed the Shampoo out from her hair. Arthur was a good friend of hers from the office, but he meant nothing to her compared to Jonny, or Selina, as he now was. Arthur could be dead for all she cared, as long as she had Jonny her life was content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, grabbing a towel to dry herself off. She looked at her reflection in the mirror and smiled sexily at herself. She looked down, admiring the curves of her body that were still pronounced, and the good shape that she was in. So what if she was 45? Lisa was still one attractive woman, and she would make absolutely certain that the possessed Selina knew that. Lisa looked back at her reflection and screamed, seeing the Old Man behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be alarmed, woman\" the Old Man said in his monotone voice as Lisa turned around to face him. His body was old, but it was relatively large and in good shape so it blocked the bathroom door almost completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...who are you???\" Lisa asked as the towel dropped to the floor from her shaking body, revealing her naked body to the Old Man, who just smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why Jonny views you as attractive. The one time that I made use of your body, I regret that I was unable to truly get to know you. Unfortunately for you, I will not be making that mistake again, human\" the old man said as Lisa's eyes widened and a new fear came to her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're the one....Jonny said....you're the one that possessed me and tried to take me away from my master!\" Lisa exclaimed,d barely making sense from her hysteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man simply laughed. \"Yes, I am. Very astute of you. It's no wonder you are a lawyer. I'm sorry, were a lawyer. I forget that Jonny had you give up your job so that you could do nothing but be his little maid and do as he commands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's expression suddenly became angry. \"I love my master. And Master Jonny loves me!\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man just laughed more. \"Of course you love him. You love him because he made you love him, though I know you find that fact irrelevant. To you, love is love whether it's a love implanted in your or your own real love. Your lack of caring impresses me. It is unfortunate for you that your second statement may be correct. Jonny indeed appears to have genuine love for you. And as a demon, that simply is unacceptable. I will have to rid him of that love, and it seems that I will have to do that by force. However, before that is done, there must be a lesson to Jonny that he will never forget. A lesson of what happens to demons who still think themselves human. You, my dear human, will be my tool to show Jonny the error of his ways\" the Old Man says, eyes glowing red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to back away, but hit the sink, not having anywhere else to go. \"Please...please don't hurt Master Jonny...\" she said as the Old Man put his hand on Lisa's head. Her eyes glowed red and she let out a scream as the Old Man removed Jonny's mental controls from Lisa's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still wish no harm to come to him, woman? Now that you are free of his manipulations?\" The Old Man asked, removing his hand from her head. Lisa held her head and tears fell from her eyes as she looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do. Not. Hurt. My. Master.\" Lisa said strongly, causing the old man to take on a surprised expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they do say love conquers all. It seems even without your compulsion to be Jonny's little slave, you still wish to protect him and love him. That is a shame. But you know what they say...if you want a job done...you have to do it yourself\" the Old Man said, turning his body into black smoke. Lisa opened her mouth to scream again as the black smoke forced its way into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent Lisa closed and locked her front door before turning and walking slowly over to Selina's car. A sexy smile was on her face as she walked over, wearing her white tank top and jean colored leggings. Her flowing red hair was hanging free down her back. Selina smiled as Lisa opened the passenger door and took her seat. \"What took you so long, Lisa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa closed the door and put on her seat belt before smiling mischievously at the demonically possessed Selina. \"Oh, you know. A lady has to look her finest for events like this. I wanted to make sure that I got out of that bathroom as a completely different woman\" she said with a grin. \"Now why don't we leave this place so that I can give you a weekend that you'll never forget.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled at that statement. \"I'd like that a lot\" she said as she put the car into drive. \"You know, I was thinking about how you told me that you loved me last night. And I think I do love you back\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's body smiled as the old man within her cringed in disappointment. This certainly was going to be a weekend that Jonny would never forget, but unfortunately for him, it would be quite a tragedy. \"I love you too, Mistress\" she said, returning the smile.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two sped off in the direction of the coast for a trip that would take much of the day.  They rolled through the swank neighborhood of Lisa\u2019s home for a few minutes and soon merged on to one of the main roads in town.  After a few more minutes of driving, the unmarked police car roared on to the highway filled with other travelers to places far and wide.  The two rode along without talking a lot at first until Selina spoke.  She looked over at the heretofore silent Lisa and asked \u201cSo, what is it that gave you the idea for this trip?\u201d Lisa chuckled a bit.  She smiled, \u201cWhen I was a little girl, my dad used to take me to this spot up by the water.  There wasn\u2019t much else there at that time, and whenever I got really sad he would take me to the ocean and stand with my by the water as the waves came in.  He told me that, if I wished it, the waves would carry away all my sorrows and all my fears,\u201d she said with a laugh.  \u201cIt\u2019s cheesy, I know, but I\u2019ve loved the water ever since then\u2014the smell of the salt, the sound of the waves, the sheer size of it.  I mean, you never know what it could bring you or where it could take you,\u201d she said with a smile as she looked over at Jonny, who smiled back.  \u201cDad also used to take me to this jewelry store on the coast . . . had all these beautiful rings and necklaces, and he would let me look at them for hours while he played cards with the owner, and I got to try \u2018em on too,\u201d she said fondly, \u201cI think it was called \u2018Riches of the Sea\u2019 or something.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not cheesy,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s maybe not an experience a lot of people have, but it makes you happy, and that\u2019s good,\u201d he said.  Lisa smiled at the admirable sentiment.  \u201cAre you close to your family?\u201d Jonny asked.  Lisa thought for a moment.  \u201cWell, I have a sister I don\u2019t see a lot because she lives down south, and we never got along a bunch when I was a kid because, after my mom and dad divorced, my sister\u2014Lori\u2014lived with my mom, and I lived with my dad.  I kind of felt like she betrayed him, and mom was the one who had the affair anyway.  That also explains why I don\u2019t see mom much or talk much with her.  She sent me a nice card for my 40th birthday a few years ago, but I actually found the attempt unnerving because I had tried to shut those memories out, and they all came roaring back when she did that\u2014\u201c Lisa trailed off, seeming to struggle to contain the emotion she felt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny reached over and put his hand on Lisa\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019m sure your mother and father love you very much,\u201d he said.  Lisa wiped away a couple tears as she looked over at him and smiled.  \u201cI can\u2019t wait for him to meet you,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019ll have to be our next trip.\u201d  \u201cI would like that,\u201d Jonny said.  Suddenly, Lisa\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at the car radio and seemed to listen intently.  Music played faintly on the car\u2019s satellite radio.  \u201cI LOVE this song!\u201d Lisa said as she reached down and turned up the volume, thus sending Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cRoll Me Away\u201d resounding through the car as she belted out the words as loudly as her voice would permit.  Jonny just laughed.  \u201cDidn\u2019t know you could sing!\u201d he said.  \u201cAre you listening?!  I can\u2019t!\u201d she yelled back with a smile just in time to belt out the chorus again.  Jonny chuckled, and the car powered its way along the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of driving, Lisa tapped Jonny on the shoulder, and he looked over at her.  \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll find a place soon,\u201d he said, and a few minutes later he pulled the car into a restaurant\u2019s parking lot.  The two went in and were soon shown to a table.  \u201cYou go ahead,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI\u2019ll join you in just a minute.\u201d  Jonny headed in the direction of the women\u2019s restroom and closed the door.  He walked his curvy body over to the mirror and gazed upon Selina\u2019s beautiful face.  \u201cShooting for the moon here . . . \u201c he said as his possessed vessel disappeared from the bathroom in a puff of black smoke.  After a couple minutes, a second mass of smoke appeared, and Jonny was back.  He calmly left the restroom and joined Lisa at the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was starting to worry about you,\u201d she said with a laugh.  \u201cWell, this body is taking a bit of getting used to,\u201d Jonny said with a mile, making sure to speak quietly.  The two ordered their food and made pleasant small talk for the course of the meal.  It was a bit passed the middle of the day now, and there were still a few hours to get to the destination.  The two quickly hopped back into the car and headed off, now with full bellies, to make the final stretch.  The hours rolled by, Jonny and Lisa laughing and having a great time in the car.  Lisa talked about the time she\u2019d tried to sneak into a Van Halen concert in 1986 only to get kicked out in time to see her car towed for being double-parked.  Her dad had not been happy to come and get her after that one.  Or the time when she was in law school and stumbled into class late during Contracts . . . the professor called on her for every single question he asked that day, and Lisa had not read very well the night before\u2014a scary experience.  She always thought that professor hated her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as the sun hung low in the sky, Jonny pulled the car into the resort as the smell of salt lingered around them, and waves crashed in the background.  Jonny went in and grabbed the key for the room and parked the car as close as he could get it.  He opened the trunk to reveal a gigantic suitcase\u2014Lisa\u2019s.  \u201cOne or two bags I told you,\u201d he said as he laughed.  Lisa smiled.  \u201cHey, you\u2019ve been a woman for about two days,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve been in that body a while longer, you can lecture me on my clothing needs,\u201d she said with a smile as Jonny slowly lugged the bag out of the car, huffing mightily.  Lisa grabbed Jonny\u2019s much smaller bag and tossed it over her shoulder.  She walked along pleasantly while Jonny huffed and puffed to carry her suitcase.  \u201cI have half a mind to just possess the biggest, strongest guy in the hotel to do this,\u201d Jonny said as the two reached the door to the room and Lisa opened it.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep Selina\u2019s meat suit in good shape for catching criminals . . . consider this cross-training,\u201d Lisa said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stepped into the room and tossed the luggage on the bed.  \u201cI want to go to the beach!\u201d Lisa said excitedly.  Jonny huffed again, \u201cNow?\u201d he said as he sat down on the bed.  Lisa just looked at him and smiled and nodded as she took Selina\u2019s body by the hands and pulled it from the bed, leading Jonny out the door.  The two walked toward the beach as the moon shone bright above.  Lisa removed her shoes and let the sand squash about around her toes.  The walked along the beach as they held hands together, and then broke the embrace as they came to a stop to watch the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of silence, Jonny spoke.  \u201cOkay, um, if you could just stand there for a minute and don\u2019t, like, look down or turn around or anything, that\u2019d be great,\u201d Jonny said as he stepped behind Lisa and rummaged about in Selina\u2019s purse for a minute.  \u201cAll right; should I be scared?\u201d Lisa joked as Jonny reached around from behind Lisa and put something around her neck.  It felt cold on Lisa\u2019s chest.  \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have to kill anybody to get it or anything, so it\u2019s probably not booby-trapped,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa chuckled.  \u201cUm, okay, you can look down now,\u201d Jonny said, and Lisa did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Lisa exclaimed, crying a little bit as she beheld the beautiful necklace hanging from her neck.  She ran her hands over a glittering blue shell that hung on a gold chain, giving off this kind of aqua glow in the moonlight.  Jonny stepped around to Lisa\u2019s front to look at the necklace and gage her reaction.  She wiped a couple tears from her eyes as Jonny explained.  \u201cYou, well, you said there was that jewelry place\u2014Riches of the Sea, I think\u2014that you used to go to when you were a little girl and that you liked trying on the jewelry.  Well, um, I checked, and turns out the place is still open, so while you were at the table by yourself, I zapped on over and bought this for you . . . I hoped you\u2019d like it \u2018cause I don\u2019t know much about jewelry, so I had the girl behind the counter help me pick it out . . . looks a hell of a lot better on you than it did on her though,\u201d Jonny said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wiped more tears of joy.  \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said as she hugged Selina\u2019s borrowed body and pulled it close for a kiss.  \u201cAnd this one isn\u2019t just for tryin\u2019 on . . . it\u2019s yours.  It is the second most beautiful thing on this beach tonight,\u201d he said with a smile as the two kissed.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa broke the kiss to look out over the horizon as she heard the rumble of thunder.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cThunder,\u201d Lisa said, \u201c . . . heard it was supposed to storm some time tonight and then break for a while during the day tomorrow, then kick back up in the evening,\u201d she said.  The two began walking along the beach again.  \u201cWell let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t ruin our plans,\u201d Jonny said with some hope, \u201cwhat is it you think you wanted to do anyway?\u201d he asked.  Lisa thought about it for a minute.  \u201cWell they\u2019ve got lots of stuff around here.  There\u2019s a boardwalk not far away that actually has all kinds of games and shops and knick-knacks; it\u2019s pretty idyllic,\u201d she said.  The two headed back up the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of talking brought them to a dock that stuck out over the water.  The two walked hand-in-hand, their heels clicking on the rustic old boards that could themselves have come from the wreck of an old ship at some point.  Not far from the dock as a lighthouse, shining out across the sea as a beacon to travelers and, increasingly, as an homage to days now gone by.  \u201cBeautiful, huh?\u201d Lisa said as the two sat and listened to the sounds of the sea, particularly a bell that hang through the openness of the night from some distance off.  \u201cYeah, yeah it is,\u201d Jonny said after a few seconds.  Jonny maneuvered Selina\u2019s curvy body up behind Lisa\u2019s and wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his head on her shoulder and feeling her generous breasts stick out before her, neither of which Jonny minded even a bit.  \u201cDid you ever come here when you were a kid?\u201d Lisa asked.  Jonny shook his head.  \u201cIn those days,\u201d he said, \u201ctransportation was not all that certain, and people just didn\u2019t go long distances as part of ordinary trips.  Folks were born an died in one town, and it probably would have taken three days just to arrive here.  Nobody could let work go for that long at the time,\u201d Jonny explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did your dad do?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cHe worked in a coal mine,\u201d Jonny answered, \u201che used to leave while it was still dark in the morning, and he\u2019d come back at 7 in the evening every bit as black as the night that approached from all the coal dust that he was around all the time,\u201d he said.  Their beautiful moment was suddenly interrupted as lightening ripped through the sky, again followed by thunder, this time both of them much closer.  \u201cOh!\u201d Lisa exclaimed, jumping a little bit as the noise tor through the peaceful silence on the beach.  \u201cWe may want to get inside,\u201d Jonny said as he and Lisa jogged back toward the hotel that was on the beach but by then not especially close to where the two had walked.  They did not make it all the way back, actually, and the rain began to come down in buckets.  \u201cFigures!\u201d Jonny said, laughing as the rain droplets caressed every wonderful curve and crevice of Selina\u2019s body.  Lisa looked over at him, her red hair by then wet with rain and therefore stuck to her head and shoulders.  She smiled.  After a few minutes of walking, the two reached the hotel and entered their room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa is beautiful,\u201d Jonny thought to himself.  The woman was simply dressed, wearing a low-cut blouse with jean shorts and a couple bracelets dangling from her wrist. There was nothing spectacular\u2014no elegant evening gown, no high-dollar jewelry, and no sexy lingerie, at least none that Jonny could see\u2014but, as she stood there and smiled at Jonny and the rain dripped off her happy face, she was absolutely beautiful to him.  \u201cWhat?\u201d Lisa asked as she saw Jonny looking at her.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cNothing,\u201d he said as he moved his own soaked body in the direction of Lisa\u2019s.  He put his arms around Lisa and pulled her close for a kiss as he reached down and grabbed Lisa\u2019s beautiful ass.  Lisa jumped in surprised please as he grabbed for her, and he lifted her up so that Lisa wrapped her long, luscious legs around Selina\u2019s body\u2019s waist.  Jonny made his way over to the bed and set Lisa down upon it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s put all of this body\u2019s working out to good use,\u201d Jonny said with a smile as lust and the night took them, all the while the storm raged outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stirred grudgingly in the late morning.  He would never be a morning person, no matter whose body he was in.  His eyes fluttered open slowly but surely as he glanced about the room, discerning a blurry figure nearby.  He wiped the sleep from his eyes and looked again.  It was Lisa, and she sat upon Jonny\u2019s torso, straddling Jony\u2019s curvy body there on the bed.  Lisa was already dressed, this day in a tasteful black blouse and jeans, complete of course with her new-found birthday present necklace from the night before.  \u201cUp!\u201d she demanded as she reached up and fondled Selina\u2019s breasts, causing a sudden moan to escape Jonny\u2019s lips.  \u201cNo fair,\u201d Jonny said as he laughed, now fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, Jonny, you have to take me to the boardwalk,\u201d Lisa explained.  \u201cOh I do?\u201d Jonny said with a smile.  \u201cYes,\u201d Lisa commanded, \u201cand I make a lot of money, so you should be very pleased that all I want is z few stuffed animals won in games along the beach with you,\u201d she said with a laugh.  Jonny laughed back.  \u201cOkay, okay\u201d he said, \u201cjust give me some time to get ready.\u201d  \u201cTime\u2019s wasting!!\u201d Lisa exclaimed as she stepped out of the room and left Jonny there to rise and prepare himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jonny had gotten dressed, he stepped out of the hotel room and joined Lisa as she stood outside and looked out over the water.  \u201cClouds are gone, at least for now,\u201d Lisa commented as they took each other\u2019s hands and began their walk in the direction of the day\u2019s festivities.  \u201cYep,\u201d Jonny responded.  The two strolled about for perhaps a half hour down the boardwalk before they came upon the bars and restaurants and arcades that were at least a substantial part of the attraction of the whole setting.  The mood was one of freedom, of carelessness, of escaping to the beach for a day of free-floating fun and celebration in a place so great it was amazing more people hadn\u2019t figured it out only to go home wiped out at night and sneak back into bed just to awake the next day in hopes of trying the whole thing all over again tomorrow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two happened to be walking by a game stand, one of those places where one stops and throws a dart or two at some balloons, and the skilled marksmen who hit the tougher targets win bigger stuffed animals than anybody should ever own.  Lisa glanced around.  \u201cI love stuffed animals,\u201d she said.  Jonny smiled at her as he kept walking.  After a couple seconds of walking, Lisa stopped.  \u201cAhem!\u201d she called out as Jonny stopped and looked back at her, confused.  \u201cLet me try that again,\u201d Lisa began, \u201cI believe I said \u2018I love stuffed animals!\u2019\u201d Lisa exclaimed.  Jonny smiled, now starting to get it and nodding.  Lisa gave him a thumbs up as though he\u2019d just accomplished some acrobatic feat that warranted praise.  Jonny walked back in the direction of the game, smiling the whole way.  \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m really a guy inside here,\u201d he explained quietly, \u201cso if you want me to win you a stuffed animal, subtlety probably is not going to get you there,\u201d he explained to her as he sat down at the game and gathered the necessary darts.  \u201cI\u2019ll get you trained yet,\u201d Lisa said confidently as she patted Jonny on the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny missed the first couple attempts but then made some really tough shots in his final opportunities, enough to warrant a prize of the biggest stuffed animal the world had ever known.  Lisa took it gleefully, jumping with delight upon being bestowed with it.  Jonny beamed as he saw how happy this tiny gesture had made Lisa.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to start practicing with darts,\u201d he said inwardly as he smiled.  Suddenly, Lisa handed the big prize to Jonny.  He took it, not sure what was going on.  \u201cYou\u2019re giving this to me?\u201d Jonny said, surprised.  \u201cOh hell no,\u201d Lisa said, \u201cbut I\u2019m the lady, and that means you\u2019re supposed to carry it for me,\u201d Lisa declared as she walked on.  Jonny should have figured this would happen, though he was not sure about Lisa\u2019s logic since Jonny was, at the moment anyway, a lady his very own self.  He tried to work out the sense of this argument in his head for a minute or so as he held the stuffed animal, promptly gave up, and then hurried, burdened now by the giant stuffed bear with a fisherman\u2019s hat an overalls upon which was sewn a representation of an anchor, to catch up with Lisa.  And so went the rest of the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evening approached, the two of them walked back toward the hotel.  Selina\u2019s body had gotten quite a work-out, as Jonny had been forced to carry every prize Lisa had commanded him to win for her, so many that Jonny\u2019s skill at darts, though impressive, was now officially a liability.  Lisa opened the door to the hotel and waited for Jonny to catch up as he carried all her winnings for the day, being tired as hell and not understanding why he had to carry everything, but at the same time not minding a bit.  \u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d Jonny said with mock annoyance as he passed Lisa at the threshold to the room, huffing his way in just to set the prizes down.  Lisa waited in the door for a second before closing it.  \u201cOh, you just wait,\u201d she said, her eyes suddenly glowing a villainous bright red as the door to the hotel room shut.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Old Man, who had been wearing Lisa's body like the cheap suit that it was for the past weekend, decided that now was the time to end his little charade. Jonny had to be punished for thinking himself human, and this was his punishment. Lisa's body strutted over to Jonny, who hadn't realized anything amiss yet. Her eyes stopped their glowing as she smiled evilly. \"I have to tell you something, Jonny\" she said, pulling Selina's body into a deep, passionate kiss before tossing herself away and grinning. Selina's face took on a confused expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lisa? What is it?\" she asked, leaning against the wall and crossing her arms under her generous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled as she faced the possessed Selina. \"I just wanted to tell you how stupid you are...\" she said with a grin as her eyes glowed again. Selina's body stiffened up as she became deadly serious. Lisa just laughed. \"It really surprises me how blind you were, Jonny. For the first time since your creation, I think I'm actually disappointed in you...\" she said, her voice now becoming a strange overlap of Lisa's voice and the voice of the Old Man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Jonny asked, through clenched teeth. Selina's hands were balled into fists squeezed tightly together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa's body let out a chuckle again. \"Remember when Lisa was taking so long in the bathroom before leaving for this little getaway? I possessed her body then and there. I really wanted you to see through my little act before the weekend started, but you were so blinded by your love for this woman that you never realized a thing. Every time you looked at me with those lovey-dovey puppy dog eyes, I wanted to laugh at you and reveal myself then and there, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. You see, I wanted to give you one last weekend of all of that love and happiness that you've built up for yourself before I tore it all down. Demons can't love, Jonny. Humans are nothing more than playthings to be toyed with....and eaten\" she said, licking her lips. Selina's fists were ready to strike when she suddenly found herself standing at attention, eyes glowing red like Lisa's. \"Now now, let a girl finish her story before getting so worked up\" she said with a teasing grin. How's it feel, being under someone's power instead of having the power over them? I like to think of this as ironic? This woman was your maid servant for so long, and now her body has power over yours. Everything comes back to haunt you, Jonny. Remember that well\" she said, cupping her breasts in her hands as she continued her little monologue. \"You know, I really do see why you made the mistake that you did. This body is very nice. Not as objectively stunning as the body you currently possess, but Lisa here certainly has a lot of ...features....to be proud of. I was debating keeping her body for myself for awhile, but that wouldn't have the impact on you that I want this lesson to have\" she says, looking into Selina's glowing eyes. The Old Man could tell that Jonny was trying to fight with all of his might, but he just couldn't. No surprise there. The Old Man's power was nearly unlimited thanks to the chaos being fed into him by all of the demons he had a connection to. Not even Jonny could fight against the Old Man's control. The Old Man placed Lisa's hand onto Jonny's head and wiped his free will out of him temporarily. \"Now, here's how this is going to work, Jonny. I am going to leave this body, and return to my business. But I can't have you just go back to your mistakes and return to loving this woman. This needs to be a learning experience for you, Jonny. So, before anything else, you are going to devour this woman's soul. You will simply walk over to her, rip it out of her sexy body, and eat it without any hesitation or regret. In fact, it will be the tastiest, most pleasurable soul that you have consumed yet. Only after you have done that, will your free will be returned to you. Then you will see that there is no room for human emotions within a demon. And you will be better for it. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's body nodded. The Old Man did not know if Jonny was completely in his power or still trying to fight, but that mattered not. The command was given and could not be fought. Lisa's body moved several steps backwards until her back was against the opposite wall of the room. The Old Man simply stepped out of her body, smiled at Jonny, and then disappeared in a blaze of black flames. Lisa held her head as she looked up to see Selina's body slowly walking towards her. Selina's eyes were glowing red and there was no hint of Jonny in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\nThe Old Man reappeared standing in front of an old house in a small town. the house had rumors surrounding it of being haunted and looked nearly identical to the one that Jonny and his group were trapped in for so long. The Old Man grinned. He had hundreds of these haunted manors spread across the entire world. Every demon trapped within them had a personal connection to him. Once released, they would feed him perpetually, making him more and more powerful until his final plans could be put into motion. He smiled. The only one that could possibly pose a threat to his want to overpower the light completely was Jonny, who had been developing human emotions in a troubling manor. The Old Man just laughed. He knew that soon Jonny certainly wouldn't have to worry about emotions anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonny...\" Lisa said, with tears running down her eyes as she looked at her former master, who was currently just a puppet of the Old Man's will. \"The Old Man kept me conscious for the entire weekend. I couldn't control my body, but I saw, heard and felt every moment of it...\" she put her hand around the necklace that Selina had bought for her. \"He removed your mental tampering from me, but even then I still loved you. You once asked me if the love I felt for you was real or just something you implanted into me. Well I know the answer now, and so do you. It was real, Jonny. You changed my life for the better.\" Selina was just in front of her now. Their chests were almost touching. Lisa stared into those empty red eyes. \"I know you aren't doing this because you want to\" she said, pulling the seashell necklace off of her neck and putting it around Selina's as Selina's hand was placed on top of Lisa's heart. The tears kept rolling down Lisa's face as she smiled at the body of the woman who used to be her best friend and was now occupied by the demon that she first saw as her master, then lover. \"I don't blame you for this, Jonny.\" she said, looking at Selina's emotionless face, with the necklace ow around her neck. \"I love you now, the same as how I loved you before. Thank you for being a part of my life\" she said, closing her eyes and leaning forward to kiss her Jonny one last time, but stopping before the lips could touch. Lisa mentally screamed as she felt the most excruciating pain that she had ever experienced as her soul was forcibly ripped out from her body. After that, there was nothing but blackness and silence. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Jonny blinked.  He found himself again in control of Selina\u2019s curvaceous form.  He looked down at his borrowed body, noting the jewelry dangling from his neck and hanging down toward his generous breasts.  He had been aware the whole time that control of this body was ripped from him.  He had felt himself ripping Lisa\u2019s soul from her body and taking it voraciously into his own.  He had seen the glimmer pass out of her eyes for the final time, and as he looked forward now he saw only the deadened, empty eyes of the woman he had loved.  Jonny began to sob.  He dropped to his knees and hugged Lisa tightly around her waste as the tears flowed from him.  \u201cNo no no no no I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he screamed as Lisa\u2019s body simply stood there before him without any kind of expression.  Jonny fell back on to his back and sobbed again and again for what seemed like hours.  The lightening and thunder crashed outside.  It was as though the sky itself were splitting apart as Jonny\u2019s emotions shredded him there in that dark room while Lisa watched motionlessly.  On this went for hours, until the sun peeked over the horizon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood, his features disheveled from the sobbing.  He was tired, or at least his body was.  He glanced about the room.  He looked at Lisa, who stood there predictably like a drone and simply stared forward into nothing.  \u201cTake the car back.  Fast . . . now,\u201d he commanded in a cold and emotionless voice as Selina\u2019s body was engulfed in a puff of black smoke and Jonny was teleported away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the blink of an eye, Jonny found himself in the familiar hallways of The Warehouse all the way back in town.  He glanced about to see no one familiar\u2014no one at all, in fact.  It was morning and, of course, there were no customers in the place yet.  Jonny walked in the direction of what he knew was Katie\u2019s office.  He had a plan taking shape now.  The city would know his rage.  As Jonny rounded a corner, he saw to hulking men standing at the other end of the hall in front of a door.  Jonny walked toward them without batting an eye, presuming that they stood in front of the door because Katie and Vanessa were having a meeting about business matters on the other side of said door.  As Jonny walked Selina\u2019s body closer to the door, the two men took notice, knowing not at all who was inside the voluptuous officer but knowing full well that no one was to interrupt the meeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina walked, hips swinging and breasts bouncing, up to the two giants standing before the door.  The larger one stepped forward.  \u201cLarger\u201d was not necessarily a word that captured this man\u2019s size.  He was immense, a mountain of a man, really.  He stood at probably six feet eight inches tall, towering over Selina by well more than a foot.  The man appeared to be in his early fifties and was dressed in a dark suit.  He looked as though he had at one point been in impeccable shape but that age was slowly winning its war with him.  The giant stood before Selina with his belly flabby enough to peek over he top of his suit pants, and a double chin appeared upon him.  His hair was mostly gray as he looked down at the slight woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to borrow someone,\u201d Selina announced.  \u201cNo one through door,\u201d the man said gruffly, a thick Russian accent dripping from his words.  \u201cI said I need someone,\u201d Selina repeated more sternly.  The big man was annoyed.  He bent down and lifted Selina\u2019s curvy form clean off the floor and dangled her in their air as he brought her like a rag doll up to his higher vantage point.  She was centimeters from his face.  \u201cI say no one through door,\u201d the man said again, \u201cnow walk pretty ass back to hooker bar or you need to borrow someone and also doctor too!,\u201d he said threateningly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled as her body dangled there in the air before the grand enforcer.  \u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d she asked.  The man was puzzled for a moment.  \u201cYes, have two,\u201d he said.  Selina smirked.  \u201cThen I don\u2019t need a doctor . . . you\u2019ll do just fine,\u201d she said as she moved close to the open mouth of her captor and pulled him in for a passionate kiss.  As she did, wisps of black smoke began to force their way from Selina\u2019s body and into his.  Selina\u2019s voluptuous frame shook and giggled, particularly her chest and ass.  Her body tensed up and convulsed as the big man held on to her.  After a couple seconds, the man could no longer hold her, as his own gargantuan body tensed and convulsed and writhed about while Jonny\u2019s essence forced its way inside him.  He dropped Selina roughly to the ground, and she landed with a thud as he tried in vain to fight off the advancing and invading mass of smoke forcing its way inside his body.  He fell back to the wall but now had nowhere to run as the possession continued.  Eventually, the final wisps of smoke disappeared into his mouth as the big man collapsed to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, he stirred.  Jonny opened his eyes for the fist time and looked around.  He saw another man\u2014the second security guard\u2014cowering in the corner and white as a sheet over what he had just seen.  Selina stirred as well.  Slowly, Jonny moved, gingerly standing in his new, larger body.  As Jonny stood, he could tell this body was way different from anything he had used before.  This body was in its fifties and male, not to mention huge.  Jonny stood and looked down on all the other people around him from over six and a half feet in the air.  His body was sore, but there was immense power in this mountain of a man\u2014Jonny could feel it.  Jonny looked down at his hands and his protruding gut as he felt his new form.  \u201cBig now . . . strong body,\u201d he said, suddenly infused with the broken English and thick accent of his host.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw that Selina had now stood up.  She looked around, sheer confusion and panic gripping her.  \u201cWhere am I?!\u201d she demanded, looking at the hulking brute Jonny now called home.  Jonny just smiled as he lumbered in her direction.  \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d she said as she held her hand up, panicked even more because she wasn\u2019t even in the clothes she remembered when it all went black for her, \u201cI\u2019m a cop so you better listen to me!\u201d she said as she tried hopelessly to contain the situation.  Jonny simply chuckled, his voice a foreign, deep, guttural growl befitting is ogre-like frame.  He walked slowly up to Selina, who became more afraid as he approached.  She was certainly outmatched physically.  Jonny looked down at her and laughed again.  \u201cCop?\u201d he said, \u201cno, no lady you are not cop.  You are only meat suit for Jonny,\u201d he said, and with that, he brought his hand up and clenched it into a fist.  In one motion, he brought his hand down on top of Selina\u2019s head.  The woman quickly crumped to the ground with only a whimper.  Jonny looked down at her unconscious body on the ground as he enjoyed the new-found strength running through his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny heard a noise and turned around.  There in the corner cowered the second security guard, the one Jonny had forgotten all about.  He huddled on the ground looking up at Jonny like a scared child.  Jonny looked down at him.  \u201cYou keep body safe,\u201d Jonny said as he pointed to Selina\u2019s unconscious form, \u201cI not done using yet.\u201d  With that, Jonny turned and headed out of the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who was Jonny\u2019s unwilling new host was Vasil Volov, a fifty-two year old former Soviet KGB agent and boxer.  At six feet eight inches tall and about 300 pounds, Volov was a mountain unto himself.  Age had begun to win against parts of his body.  His expanding belly shook as he walked, and his hair was grey, but he still had plenty of girth and muscle left.  Today, he wore a black suit and dark glasses that just made him look downright scary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolov\u2019s possessed body lumbered out of the building and reached the parking lot.  A large black SUV had just pulled into the lot, and out stepped its occupant.  Jonny beheld a woman of about 36 years.  She had black hair and a toned body with diamond rings on her fingers.  She beheld Jonny\u2019s imposing host as she got out of the car.  \u201cHello,\u201d she said, \u201cmy husband wanted me to come here and ask about having some catering done for his sixtieth birthday\u2014is this the place?\u201d  Jonny did not answer.  He was more interested in her car, to be honest.  He walked up to her with no expression on his face.  \u201cGive keys,\u201d he said as he held out his hand.  The woman looked perplexed, as though she did not understand what she had just heard.  \u201cWhat?\u201d  she said.  \u201cGive keys,\u201d Jonny said, this time more stern.  \u201cNo!\u201d the woman said as she recoiled, holding her keys closer to her impressive body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Jonny reached down and grabbed the woman by the sides of her head and yanked it suddenly to the side, snapping her neck like a twig.  Her body crumpled to the ground lifeless as her eyes lay eerily open to anyone who might pass by.  Jonny reached down and grabbed he keys from the woman\u2019s dead body.  \u201cNext time just give keys,\u201d Jonny instructed the dead woman as he stepped on her lifeless body to get to the car.  He climbed in and set off the direction of mayhem to come.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Near the center of town was an unmarked building about the size of the warehouse. It looked incredibly plane from all angles. In fact, the only thing that gave any indication that it was more than it appeared to be was the tall, electrified fence that surrounded it from all sides. The possessed Vasil drove his stolen vehicle to the one closed gate and looked at the bored looking man that was standing inside. He appeared to be in his mid sixties and was reading the comics section of this morning's newspaper which had just been delivered a few hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the vehicle pulling up the the gate, Philip Bradshaw closed the paper and smiled, unable to wait for the day to be over and his retirement to officially begin. Bradshaw expected to see one of the many scientists or assistants that worked within the gates of this facility, but frowned when he saw the hulk of a man that was now staring him down. \"Open door\" the giant of a man said in a thick Russian accent, causing Bradshaw's frown to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir, but you need to have special authorization to enter these premises...\" the aging man said, sticking to his script. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said open door\" the Russian said again, this time with less patience in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, sir. You need to have special authorization...\" he started to say again before noticing that the giant man's eyes started glowing a bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open door, then shoot self in head\" Jonny said, loosing all the patience he had for this geezer. Without a word, Phillip Bradshaw nodded and hit a button, opening the gate for Jonny to enter. As Jonny drove into the compound, he heard the gunshot that brought the guard his early retirement. Jonny parked his stolen car in the middle of the lot and kept the keys in the ignition. It wasn't like he cared what happened to it at this point. All Jonny could think about was the glorious chaos he was about to bring and how much better he would feel once it happened. Jonny took out both of Vasils guns and smiled, knowing that the Russian's aim was impeccable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slammed the door open and immediately fired a shot into the head of the first person he saw. As the man's body fell to the ground, Jonny looked around, firing two more shots and immediately killing two more innocent people. Jonny started laughing hysterically as he continued emptying his bullets into all of these people. This was actually rather cathartic for him. And it was only going to get better and better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Angela Donovan was in her private research lab, looking at some samples under the microscope when she heard the alarms sounding around her. She sighed as she stood up, putting her hand on her chair to help her with balance. Now that she was in the latter months of her pregnancy, the good doctor was having a bit trouble with standing up fast, though that was to be expected. She gently rested her hand on her bulging stomach as she walked over to her lab door and tried to look outside her door's window and see what was going on....she hoped this was just a drill and not anything serious that could take away from her work. The lab had been kind enough to provide her with all the samples that she would need to aid her in her search to find a cure for deadly diseases even though their main specialty was nuclear physics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela opened her door a crack, she heard the loud sounds of gunshots and bodies falling. A security guard ran just outside of her door and fell down, bleeding from the head. His gun fell to the other side of the hall. Angela screamed as she ran out and felt the guard for his pulse, but tears formed in her eyes when she couldn't feel anything. Angela then looked up to see an incredibly large man shooting at the two last security guards. There was a pool of blood on the ground around them all and it looked like there were several other scientists and guards dead around the man, who even with bullets entering his body, remained strong and standing as if he had years of experience with getting shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela looked at the fallen guard in front of her. His gun was empty and didn't have any bullets left in it, but he had a large knife in his belt. Angela grabbed the knife and ran towards the fighting, realizing that she had to do something to stop this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just continued his laughing as the two fools kept trying to bring him down. This was so incinerating for him. Vasils body was bleeding profusely from all of the bullet wounds he'd picked up, but this was nothing that the former KGB officer wasn't used to. He had trained himself to withstand anything and Jonny was very thankful for having that to back him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bored of this\" Jonny said in his broken english as he jumped onto one of the guards and snapped his neck, before shooting the other through the head and killing him. Jonny kept his laughing before he felt a terrible pain in his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nAs the man was distracted with his killing, Angela had taken her opportunity to stab him through his heart, knowing exactly where to aim thanks to her medical skills. The man looked down at her, straight into her eyes before he coughed out blood and fell to the ground. However, he put his hand around her and pulled her down with him, laughing as he refused to let her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch...\" he said to her in his thick accent, which was now weak thanks to the blood he was loosing. \"You think you do something? Vasil dead now....so YOU blow up lab for me instead\" he said with a grin as his eyes glowed a blood red. Angela screamed and tried to pull away but the Russian's grip was too strong. He opened his mouth and his body began to shake and convulge as black smoke shot out from his mouth. As his body spasmed, Angela broke free from his grip and tried to run away, but the weight from her pregnancy had slowed her down. As she stopped for a breath the smoke found her and forced its way into her throat. Angela's body immediately tensed up and shook and she tried to fight out the invading presence though it was no use. Her body kept shaking and spasming as her generous breasts and ass jiggled along with her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Angela's breathing returned to normal as she felt herself over. She smiled as her eyes glowed red and her hands moved to her stomach. \"Well, well...looks like I get to be a mommy for this part of my fun\" he said with a grin as he picked up one of the guards guns and walked his pregnant body into the main power reactor that the lab was working on.  The supposed Angela opened the door of the lab and gave the scientist a friendly smile before shooting his brains out and walking over to the controls. \"Okay Mrs. Donovan. Just show me what to do...\" he said with a grin as he used his hosts memories to set the generator to self destruct, which would create an explosion big enough to tear apart a large chunk of the town, though not enough to reach the warehouse, police station, or Lisa's house, which were currently the only places that Jonny cared about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving an evil smile, Jonny tossed his gun to the ground and walked out of the building. He looked back at it, noticing that from the outside, everything appeared quiet. The guard at the front gate was dead, but his body was hidden by the fence. No one would suspect that everyone inside the building was dead, and all security footage would be destroyed in the blast from the inside. But there were lots of cameras on the outside that may retain footage so Jonny walked over to one of them and gave it a wave and sexy smile. \"I did this all for J.M.\" he said in his stolen voice, making the shape of a heart with his hands before getting into his hosts minivan, which he knew she had bought specially in preparation for the large family that her and her husband intended on starting. Too bad for her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Jonny manuevered past Vasil's stolen car and drove out of the complex, back into the world, which would soon be thrown into chaos. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny drove back in the direction of the restaurant, the mom-mobile lumbering slowly through neighborhoods and hitting the occasional pot-hole or speed-bump.  Every such jolt brought a delightful jiggle from his host\u2019s milk-filled chest and swollen belly.  Jonny glanced at the face of his full and curvy body in the mirror, smiling as he enjoyed the ride in the borrowed car and the borrowed body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny ruffled his way through his host\u2019s mind and memories.  Dr. Angela Donovan was a woman of 33.  She had finished her PhD in nuclear physics from Duke two years prior and had taken her present job in lieu of a post-doc opportunity offered to her because she wanted to get straight into the field.  Her parents had been so proud of her as she walked down the isle at graduation and had the ceremonial academic hood placed over her head by her dissertation adviser.  A PhD in nuclear physics is tough enough, after all, but to be a woman in a field dominated heavily by men presented a sort of latent but ever-present difficulty of having to work that much harder to get extraordinarily well-respected men to take her seriously as something other than a decoration in the lab notable only because she happened to have boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had graduated from school and immediately married her husband Tom, a chemical engineer working for a pharmaceutical company.  Tom really loved Angela, and he so much wanted a family with her.  They both wanted one.  Angela had blonde hair and green eyes that Tom hoped she would pass on to the baby.  They had begun tossing around a few names\u2014Olivia for a girl and maybe Connor for a boy.  As Jonny drove through town, he looked down at his belly and ran his hand over it, feeling the baby kick from inside Angela.  It was almost as though the child knew something was wrong\u2014that mommy wasn\u2019t the one in the proverbial driver\u2019s seat at this point.  \u201cMomma\u2019s going to be famous soon.  Yes she is!\u201d Jonny said in the sort of patronizing voice one often uses to talk to young children as Jonny rubbed his host\u2019s belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van came at last to a stop, and Jonny emerged from it.  His host\u2019s white lab coat hung open in the front because of her swollen stomach, and her pants were stretched to the breaking point because of her enlarged belly, wide hips, and luscious ass.  Her thin white blouse was similarly strained.  Maternity ware had been on the shopping list for this week, but no longer.  All jiggled as Jonny walked his host body into the restaurant.  He entered and looked around.  The place was starting to fill up for lunch a bit, but this still was not the usual clientele of wheelers and dealers who will fill the place this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked his sexy body back in the direction the hallway and in the direction of the office.  He came to the door at which he had first possessed Vasil\u2019s gargantuan body and entered the room, hearing a few people murmuring.  There in the big office, he look over and saw Katie and Vanessa sitting over by the desk with the guard Jonny had instructed to watch Selina.  The man was slouched on a chair with an ice pack to his head and a big bruise covering half his face.  Katie and Vanessa looked up at Dr. Donovan\u2019s pregnant body as it entered.  Suddenly, Jonny\u2019s borrowed eyes glowed red, and the two women knew that body was only a temporary costume, and they knew who was inside it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my meat suit?  I want her back,\u201d Jonny demanded.  Vanessa slowly walked up to Jonny.  \u201cThe cop is gone . . . she banged Biff over the head with the chair she\u2019d been cuffed to, and she ran out.  Where\u2019s Vasil?\u201d she asked.  Jonny\u2019s eyes suddenly glowed red with pure rage.  He brought Angela Donovan\u2019s hands up and shot a red energy field out of them, and whatever it was impacted Vanessa and sent her flying against the wall, lifting her a good ten feet off the ground and keeping her suspended there against the wall.  The woman began to gargle and choke.  \u201cWHAT?!\u201d Jonny yelled from inside the pregnant scientist, \u201cyou let Selina get away?!  I didn\u2019t just take her body because I like the bounce of her tits!  I took her because without that meat suit I have to use my powers every time I wanna even fix a fucking parking ticket!  And as for Vasil, your hulking brute is fucking dead, but his body was a lot more use to me than you fucking seem to be at this point you incompetent fucking\u2014\u201c Jonny screamed, all the while Vanessa was choking and begging for help as she hung in the air against the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny felt something on his back.  \u201cJonny, it\u2019s all right.  We\u2019ll find Selina.  We need contacts in this town, remember?  Vanessa is one of them.  She is no use to us if you kill her,\u201d Katie said soothingly.  Jonny fumed.  Eventually, he dropped his host\u2019s hands, and the power that had held Vanessa suspended ceased.  She dropped roughly to the ground in a fit of coughing and tried desperately to get her breath.  \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d Jonny asked, calmer now.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, you crazy fuck!\u201d Vanessa yelled out.  Jonny paced for a couple minutes.  The whole room was quiet as Jonny rolled over the problem in his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny's contemplation of the state of things was interrupted by a ringtone emanating from Angela's pocket.  U2's \"Until the End of the World\" serenaded the group for a few seconds before they figured out where the noise came from.  Jonny grabbed the phone and looked at it.  \"It's her husband,\" she said as she took the call and masked his evil intentions in his host body's girl-next-door voice.  \"Hey honey,\" he said with a smile on his stolen face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angie baby are you ok?!?!\" came an intense and panicked voice on the other end of the phone, \"babe thank god you're ok I--I--I just saw the TV . . . explosion at your job!  Are you sure you're ok?!\" said the distraught young man.  \"Yes, yes Tom I'm fine, and the baby is fine too . . . I had a meeting at The Warehouse with some people, but, yeah, oh my . . . an explosion?  That sounds just terrible,\" Jonny said as he smiled and tried to keep himself from laughing at the irony of it all.  Some of the others in the room got it too.  \"Angie I want you to come home now--please?  I'm watching the news, and there's panic buying Angie . . . people are rushing the stores.  This military guy came on and said the President ordered the city under military protection . . . tanks and Hummers rolling down the streets.  They say it might have been a deliberate attack, maybe even connected to the mayor thing.  They don't know.  Baby please come home,\" he pleaded.  \"Oh the mayor thing huh?  You don't say,\" Jonny said, grinning again.  He paused for a minute.  \"Ok.  I'll hop in the car and be home soon.\"  A sigh of relief came from Tom.  \"Ok honey just please please please be careful,\" he said.  \"Will do sweetie!\" Jonny said as he hit the red button on Angela's phone and ended the call.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hubby's worried, it seems . . . nice to be wanted,\" Jonny laughed as he looked about at the people assembled in the room.  \"Okay so that bought us some time--bought all of YOU some time,\" he said, looking particularly at Vanessa, whose men had let Selina get away.  \"All of you have a mission.  Drop what you're doing right now and find Selina McCarthy.  Find me my body,\" he demanded, \"I've got some ideas for fun in the interim, but when I come back I expect her to be here, or I can think of someone I'll happily turn into my new meat puppet,\" he said as he stared daggers at Vanessa.  She turned white with fear.  The rest nodded silently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned from the room and headed for the door, his bulging belly jiggling slightly with each step.  He made it to the van soon and started for the home of the woman he had made his host.  The pregnancy made it impossible to put on the seat belt, but what the hell it wasn't his body anyway, right?  Jonny rolled through the streets of the panicked city.  There were already hummers patrolling the streets.  The explosion must have had people thinking terrorist attack because there were fully uniformed soldiers on top of the hummers with full-auto guns.  \"If you only knew . . . secret'll probably be out soon enough,\" Jonny mused to himself.  At the moment everybody was in panic mode, and it was not clear whether the site was safe.  Once people figured out that it was, people would swarm the area with cops and forensic instruments . . . the tape Jonny had made with his host would be discovered or pieced together from the rubble.  The hunt would be on.  Angela's heart quickened as he pondered it . . . he loved the thrill of the chase, though he was not used to being on this side.  He was always the good guy before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny pulled the van into the driveway of what Angela's memories told him was her home.  He parked the car and slowly got out, moving gingerly as his boobs and belly jutted out before him, each barely contained by the lab coat his host wore.  He no sooner than made it out of the car than a man of about 35 darted out of the house toward him.  \"Oh my god honey I was so worried,\" the man said he as ran up and awkwardly hugged his wife in a way that did not endanger her precious belly.  Jonny hugged back meekly as a smile crossed his face.  \"Tom, honey, I'm fine.  I promise, and so is the little one.\"  Tom was a man of 35, a chemical engineer by training and about six inches taller than his young and beautiful wife.  He had short dark hair and a pleasant face, plus a set of kakis and a nice sweater.  He gave his wife a look of worry.  \"Let's get you inside,\" he said as he took Jonny by the arm and quickly ushered him in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stepped into the house and walked toward the living room where there was a TV on.  The worried Tom placed his arm around his wife and pulled her close as they watched.  The news station flashed the \"breaking news\" and \"crisis grips city\" banners across the screen as a man in military dressed stepped up to a lectern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure took a deep breath.  \"My fellow citizens good evening.  My name is General Cyrus Ricks, and I am the commander of the 107th Infantry, United States Army.  I stand before you tonight on orders of the President, who sent me here to take precautions to protect this great city.  The explosion at a federal facility earlier today earlier today has shaken this city to its core.  Our experts assure us that such an event is unusual enough that an accidental detonation is unlikely.  We are proceeding on the assumption that foul play has occurred, and a threat of this size demands immediate action.  It is to that end that this city has been placed under quarantine.  It is now 430 PM.  By 7, civilians must be in their homes with doors locked.  We have no immediate suspects, nor do we have credible threats of further dangerous activities, but it is only prudent to take precautions.  Only emergency vehicles will be permitted on the streets after the appointed hour.    I thank you all for your cooperation.  Stay safe, and may God continue to bless this great country.\"  With that, General Ricks left the lectern, taking no questions.  Cameras clicked, and reporters chattered, but out he went.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom looked at his wife with a grave look of worry and fear in his eyes.  He suddenly hugged her.  \"I'm so glad you're okay,\" he said.  The hug lasted for a good two minutes.  The two walked into the kitchen and sat down for an early dinner.  Jonny mulled the evolving situation over in his mind.  This Ricks character was a new one on the scene, and the curfew would complicate things.  Sure, Vanessa's men could move about in the shadows, but they would certainly have to be more careful.  Selina was probably already half nuts and very twitchy wherever she was.  If she had seen what Jonny just had, she would be all the more so.  This place was crawling with soldiers with full auto-guns just looking for anybody suspicious.  Who could move about in an environment like this?  Jonny munched on pasta as he pondered these details.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull, Jonny let lose a loud belch and simply leaned back in the chair, his bloated belly full of a hardy dinner.  The woman's thin white blouse strained against her gut and her breasts, and Jonny had even gotten a bit of tomato sauce on his host's nice shirt.  Tom looked sideways at his wife, surprised by the un-lady-like behavior, though he said nothing.  It was nearly 6 PM now, and Jonny was getting restless.  He decided to kick the mayhem up a notch.  He was not sure how long he had in this body--cops would soon find the video he had made, and it would be all over the news soon thereafter.  \"So I wasn't sure the whole place would go,\" he said as he took a drink of water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked perplexed.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked. Jonny set the glass down.  \"Well when I fucked with the equipment, I didn't know how bit the explosion would be.  Seems to have taken out the whole place.  I wonder how many I killed . . . \" he said flatly.  Tom's jaw dropped.  \"Angela, that's not even funny.  Not funny at all.  I know we all deal with stress our own way, but what has gotten into you?!\" he said, flabbergasted.  Jonny smiled and stood slowly.  \"My dear boy, what has gotten into me is behind your comprehension,\" he said as he stood and examined his curvy form again, \"but I'm glad it's in me now, or rather that I'm in her--your wife.\"  Tom was getting annoyed now.  \"My God, Angela, what's wrong.  Just tell me, will you?\" he said, irritated.  \"GOD?!\" Jonny yelled at the top of his host's lungs.  Tom shrunk back in shock at the sudden change in tone.  \"Not quite God, really,\" Jonny said with a devious smile, \"but given my unassuming appearance I can understand the confusion, so let's try something a little different,\" he said has he took a step back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in the direction to Tom and concentrated.  Suddenly, Angela's eyes glowed red, and black smoke covered her beautiful body.  When it dissipated, her white lab coat and white blouse were replaced with a full leather suit.  It was jet black, the pants hugging every curve of her beefy legs and ample ass as it snaked its way up her body.  The tight-fitting leather was flush to her bloated, pregnant belly as it jutted out from the rest of her, and the top was cut low in the front so that it showed off her gorgeous, milk-filled boobs.  \"That better?\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom jumped from his chair and staggered back, knocking over some dishes in his haste.  \"What the hell?!\" he screamed.  \"Hell indeed,\" Jonny said, \"and I must admit I find your whole suburban housewife thing rather boring, hence my taking over your wife's body,\" he continued as Tom turned white as a ghost.  Jonny moved closer to him, grabbing a knife off the counter as he did.  He inched closer to Tom, who could move no more because he'd already reached a corner.  \"Normally I'd encourage you to put up a fight, but it'd be nice if you didn't this time . . . wouldn't want to hurt little baby,\" Jonny said as he rubbed his host's stomach.  Tom stood there mesmerized as his wife, or at least the thing that looked like her, approached him.  Suddenly, Jonny plunged the knife into Tom's gut.  He tensed up, and blood began to seep out his mouth as he coughed and gagged.  \"Thanks for staying still; you're a peach,\" Jonny said as he leaned in close to Tom, who sank slowly down the wall and landed in a growing pool of his own blood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked down at his handiwork.  \"Mayhem starts at home kids,\" he said with a smile as he looked down at his bloated belly.  Still inside Angela's body, he looked out the door to the barely controlled chaos that awaited him.  He smiled.  \"I wonder how many of them I can take out before they figure out sweet lil' Angie's the one who caused all this mess and shred this little body of hers.  Only one way to find out,\" Jonny said as he began to walk toward the door.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The possessed 'Angie' walked out of her house with a large evil grin on her face. She ad quite the plan in mind, and it was only a matter of time before everything would fall into place. the sidewalk Jonny walked down was completely deserted since everyone was inside their houses, worried sick. Jonny was glad that no one would be getting in the way, but at the same time, he was a bit disappointed that no one would be able to see his pregnant meat suit strutting across town in tight leather. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Jonny's top priority was finding Selina and jumping back into her body. The longer she wasn't being worn by Jonny like a cheap suit, the more of a threat she was to Jonny since Jonny had no idea how much she remembered from her time possessed. As Jonny was walking, and thinking over his plans to get his favorite meatsuit back, he noticed two soldiers walking, guns at their sides. They appeared to be having a conversation about what sort of a monster would be capable of all this damage. Jonny chuckled in his sweet host's voice. If only they knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" she exclaimed, running over to the soldier's who looked rather surprised the sexily clad pregnant woman running towards them. \"Please! You need to take me to general Ricks right now!\" She exclaimed, looking worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Why should we take you?\" She asked, not seeing reason to be concerned yet, but clearly suspicious. In retrospect, Jonny should have changed his outfit into Angie's normal work clothe's but he still wasn't thinking right after what the Old Man made him do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nonchalantly made a pocket appear in his leather outfit and pulled out Angela's ID, which he made appear in the pocket. \"My name is Dr. Angela Donovan and I worked at the lab that blew up! I have information that I must give to General Ricks personally! I know exactly what happened!\" he declared, making himself sound believable. The flabbergasted soldiers, immediately took out their walkie-talkies and called in this report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, General Cyrus Ricks, who Jonny had seen on TV only a few minutes ago was now standing only a few steps away from him. This was the most powerful person Jonny had been with yet. The General calmly extended his hand. \"Dr. Donovan, my name is Cyrus Ricks. Please tell me what you know\" he said as the possessed doctor, took his large hand in hers and shook it gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, General\" she said, smirking as she noticed the General looking down at the ground instead of at her sexily clad pregnant body. \"But I have to tell you in private...\" she said. As soon as the words left her lips, the general motioned to his soldiers and they all walked away. \"Thank you, general\" she said and suddenly pulled the man into a deep kiss. As soon as their lips touched, Jonny forced his smoky essence out of Angela's body and into the General's much older and much more fit body. His body spasmed and shook as Angela collapsed onto the ground. The genral put up a strong fight, and Jonny felt himself working up a metaphorical sweat, but eventually the human general proved to be no match for Jonny's demonic essence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....this is certainly different\" Jonny said with his new voice. Surprisingly, the General never fell to the ground, but was able to remain standing through the possession, a sign of the man's iron will. \"Well fought General ricks, but now your body and power belong to me\" he said as memories of the general's life filled his mind. Cyrus Ricks was 50 years old and the smartest, most calculating man Jonny had ever possessed or even met in his life. Jonny actually couldnt help but feel honored to have taken this great man as his meatsuit, even if only temporarily. Jonny took out the General's walkie-talkie and spoke into it \"Attention all men! This is General Ricks! Be on the look out for Police Chief Selina McCarthy of this city! I have strong evidence that she was recently kidnapped by the perpetrator of this terrible crime! She will have information that we need to solve this! I also have evidence that she recently escaped kidnapping and torture at the hands of the perpetrator! Her mind is not stable at the moment so do not believe anything she says! just bring her in to my office as soon as you can!\" Jonny received several affirmatives on his walkie-talkie, before putting it back and grinning at Angela's unconscious body. His grin grew as he looked at her pregnant belly. Perhaps some experimenting was in order while there were no soldiers around. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny bent down with a grin on his borrowed face.  He set his hand upon Angela's forehead.  \"Stay under until we're alone again.  Your time will come,\" he assured his sleeping former costume.  With that, Jonny forced his arms under the sleeping pregnant woman and lifted her off the ground, grunting a bit as he did.  At fifty years old, his body was not as young as it had once been, but Jonny could still feel the strength coursing through his veins.  He stood and lumbered his way back toward the convoy that had taken Ricks here.  The soldiers, who had been talking among themselves, turned their attention to their commanding officer as he approached.  \"What happened, General?\" one man said as he came up to the general.  \"She was just about to spill the beans, and she mumbled she wasn't feeling good and passed out.  I suspect the pregnancy had something to do with it.  We're taking her back with us.  I need to debrief her, and this is no place for a woman in her condition,\" Jonny said as he lay her softly in the back seat of an army jeep.  Jonny walked around the other side of the car and got in.  \"Back to HQ!\" he said to the lower-ranked solder who'd been tasked to drive him around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver glanced toward the back seat as the big jeep rumbled its way through the streets.  \"So sir, ah, you say a woman in her condition--did you mean a pregnant woman or a hooker, 'cause from that leather and those boobs, she could be both, I'm just saying,\" the driver said with an uneasy smile. \"Very perceptive,\" Jonny said with a laugh, \"you'll outrank me one day son.\"  This particular trip through the city was not accompanied by the pleasant bouncing of generous, jiggle-prone boobs, which Jonny found rather sad.  Still, General Ricks's body gave Jonny more direct authority than he had ever had before.  Even if he needed to leave the valiant General, enslaving him might be a good idea.  The jeep rolled up to a hotel in front of which were many soldiers at their posts, often on the backs of hummers.  Barricades were set up some distance from the building, but of course they let the General through without question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny got out of the car and picked up the sleeping MILF in the back seat.  He walked through the throngs of men into the grand hotel--a palatial residence that the army had cleared of its former guests in order to make room the General Ricks and his underlings. The General boarded the elevator with his special cargo and his aide by his side and rode it to the top floor.  The whole floor consisted of only 2 rooms--one for the General and another for his top-ranking aides, which is to say various Colonels and Captains who would carry out his orders to the mass of enlisted men who would implement his them.  Still with Angela in his arms, the General came to the door of his room and paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will the lady be resting with the General, sir?\" his aide asked.  \"She will,\" Jonny answered, \"putting her down there with all those sweaty young men is just asking for trouble.\"  The young man nodded.  \"I want the fugitive Chief's picture plastered across every billboard, every crawler on the news, every place you can find.  I want that woman found,\" Jonny said sternly.  \"Yes sir,\" the underling nodded.  With that, Jonny opened his door and walked into a very fancy, well-appointed hotel room, probably a couple thousand square feet by itself. \"Government work has its perks,\" Jonny said with a smile as he looked across the expanse of the grand hotel room.  He walked over and gingerly lay the body of Angela Donovan upon his soft and comfortable bed.  Her bulging belly jutted up from the rest of her as she took slow and deep breaths.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, she began to stir.  She moaned a little bit and shook her head as her eyes fluttered open.  Jonny stood over her, and suddenly her eyes went wide when she saw her companion.  \"Who are you?!\" she said worriedly as she quickly but awkwardly sat up nd shrunk back from the imposing figure of the General, \"And where the hell am I?!\" she demanded, very scared.  Jonny held his hands up as he stepped back a little.  \"I'm Jon--I mean, my name is General Cyrus Ricks, and you're in my headquarters--a hotel at the center of town,\" he answered.  Angela looked around a bit and realized she was in no immediate danger, and she seemed to calm down a little bit.  She then looked down at herself and beheld the sexy black leather that held in her chest and bulging belly.  She looked downright confused.  \"Wha--what happened?\" she asked as she held her hand to her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you remember?\" Jonny asked.  Angela paused for a minute.  \"I--I ah, well I don't know.  Um, I was at work.  After that, there was this guy who broke in . . . bit guy, foreign I think.  Security couldn't handle him, and--and--\" she paused for a minute.  \"Next I, I think I stabbed him, and the guy mumbled something about the fact that I would blow the place up,\" the woman said in a tentative tone, probably figuring that she could barely believe it so other people might think she was nuts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela slowly and gingerly turned her front to face Jonny, and she daintily placed her feet upon the ground, sitting now upon the edge of the bed.  \"Where's Tom,\" she asked as thought she just thought of it after having forgotten for too long, \"Where's my husband?\" asked the pretty young blonde.  \"Well that is a little complicated,\" Jonny said, laughing on the inside because it was Angela herself that had slaughtered him--sort of.  \"But let's start with getting you something to eat,\" Jonny said as he reached his hand out for Angela's, offering to pull her up, \"I think there are some pop tarts and stuff in the vending machine.\"  Angela let Jonny pull her up from the bed, and she began to walk in the direction of the room's kitchen area, which was itself quite impressive.  Jonny got behind her, ostensibly to catch the shaky woman in the event she faltered.  \"About Tom,\" he began, he won't be joining you,\" Jonny declared.  \"Why?\" said Angela, worried.  \"Because you killed him,\"  Jonny said as he suddenly placed his hands on Angela's bloated belly from behind her, and his eyes began to glow red.  Hers did too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well really YOU killed Tom . . . you'd planned it for so long.  He was a weakling.  The only thing he was good for was giving you a good fuck and getting you good and knocked up, which he seems to have accomplished,\" Jonny said as he motioned to Angela's belly.  \"Good fuck . . . \" she said in a relaxed and other-worldly tone.  \"That's right,\" Jonny said, \"And you're going to kill anyone else I want you to.  I can't be getting my hands dirty or keeping this within the chain of command, so you're going to be my sex little MILF assassin,\" Jonny said deviously, \"and you're going to love it, just as you'll love doing anything else I want,\" Jonny said as he reached down and slapped the sexy young woman on the ass.  Jonny's eyes returned to normal, and he let go of Angela, whose now-normal eyes still looked a big groggy.  She ambled over to a couch in the room and lay down upon it, as if to let her mind take in all that Jonny had just done to her.  Jonny smiled.  \"The hunt is on,\" he said with a chuckle.  </span></div></div>",

From what Jonny theorized, her falling asleep was a result of her brain needing to play catch up with itself. After all, Angela Donovan was little more than a kind and loving housewife with her first of many happy children on the way. From what Jonny had been able to tell wen he was wearing Angela's body as his meatsuit, the woman was barely even capable of a mean thought. That meant that the commands he had just implanted into her mind were currently giving her a massive internal conflict that her brain would need to spend time working out. Right now, her memories and whole personality was probably being changed and overwritten in order for the commands to take affect. the Angela that Jonny would find when he returned to this room would be one very different from the one he had possessed in the lab, and that idea delighted him very much. If he could change a person like this so completely, then he could really do anything between all of his powers. He might as well have been a god. Hell, he might even be able to give the old man a run for his money. That would teach the prick from manipulating his life, or afterlife. Jonny walked over to the sleeping pregnant woman and put his right hand on her forehead. His eyes glowed briefly, giving her one more command. \"Do not leave this room until I tell you that you can\" he said , before removing his hand and heading out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the interrogation, General?\" One of his men asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled and pretended to sound official, which was not hard at all with his current body. \"It went well. The woman is scared right now and probably under considerable stress from whatever happened. She's currently resting in my room. No one is to speak with her unless I give the heads up, is that understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" The man said, nodding and agreeing to pass on the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. How goes the search for our missing police chief?\" He asked as the two stepped in an elevator, which was set to take them to the parking deck. The new day was starting and Jonny knew that he had to get to work early if things were going to go as he planned. At first, he wanted Angela to take full blame for everything, but now he wanted to see how far his little experimentation would go. If he was truly able to change a woman right down to her core then he'd be able to do many things that would prove very useful for the future. This was his test and he didn't want that being cut short by his tape being found and people calling for Angela's execution. He'd need to find some way of pushing the blame onto Selina...that way he'd get farther with finding her and also ave time to watch his masterpiece. At this point, he didn't even care about jumping back into Selina's body. Sure, it was bust and fun to be in, but it brought up too many bad memories. It was time to start fresh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solider pulled up a file on his phone. \"Without anyone in charge of the local police, we've been officially giving them orders. We have many of our men, and all of them on the hunt for her. There's at least one soldier or officer going to every residence in the city. If anyone knows anything about her ware abouts, we'll know about it. I don't see how anyone could not have seen her in the getup she was last seen wearing though\" he said with a whistle as he pulled up a picture of the police chief. \"You really think a woman like this could have had something to do with the explosion? The had a pretty clean record...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you something son\" Jonny said as the elevator opened and the two stepped into the parking garage of the hotel, which was filled with military and police vehicles instead of the normal cars that would be filling it. \"You can NEVER know what a person is really like or what they really think inside of their body. That woman may seem like the perfect police chief, but inside that body may be a demon. You never know\" he said with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier nodded, taking what the General said to be a metaphor. \"I get it, sir. We'll continue the hunt and find her as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear son\" Jonny said with a smile as he got into his personal hummer and drove out of the hotel. Ten minutes later, he pulled up to the scene of the explosion, which was now being investigated by soldiers. The apparent General Ricks slowly walked around, looking official and watching the goings on. He continued that for about half an hour when suddenly there was a lot of commotion. He was called over to a group of soldiers that found exactly what Jonny had been hoping they would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this?\" he asked, looking down at the damaged, but not unplayable, take that had been dropped into his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe that it's the camera logs from the day of the explosion sir, but obviously we can't play it here\" one of the soldiers explained. Jonny nodded, as if this was all new information to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...this log could help us figure out exactly what we're dealing with here. I'll take it and play it back at headquarters. We'll figure out how to react once I see what's in it\" he said, as if he genuinely had no idea what was on the tape. Jonny absolutely loved that no one was questioning his orders. That was one of the perks of being the top ranked officer. This was too easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jonny had the tape safely in his pocket for future use, he drove his hummer just outside the Donovan's house. He walked inside the open door and quickly found the dead body of Tom, who was exactly where he had been left only yesterday. No one had come in here yet, but it was only a matter of time until one of his men found the empty house and figured out what happened. Jonny concentrated, and suddenly his old body shifted and changed, becoming that of Selina McCarthy. since Jonny had worn her body for such a long time, he was incredibly familiar with it, to the point that he subconsciously was able to even duplicate her DNA and fingerprints. After making sure that Selina's prints were all over the crime scene, Jonny changed back to General Rick's form and exited the house. His two jobs of the day were now done and it was barely even noon. Jonny took a deep breath of the fresh air and looked around the quiet, unsuspecting city, wondering what chaos he would bring about it next. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny returned to the General's hotel room to find Angela still laying down on the couch, fast asleep. \"Hmm, I guess she's really having a tough time, adjusting\" Jonny muttered to himself in the general's gruff voice as he sat down on his bed and looked at the sleeping MILF, listening to her light breathing. He noticed how peaceful and calm she looked, as if she were totally at peace with herself. Jonny just spent a few minutes watching her until suddenly her eyes fluttered open and she sat up gently and crossed her legs with a mischievous smile on her pretty face. If she had any discomfort about the clothing she was wearing, she wasn't showing it. \"I bet you like what you see, don't you General?\" she asked, seductively. \"Want me to be your baby momma?\" she asked teasingly, holding her bloated stomach and grinning at the not-General. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled as he looked into doctor Angela Dovan's eyes. There didn't seem to be any of the old her left. \"How are you doing, Doctor Donovan?\" he asked, playing it safe for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, call me Angie. Doctor Donovan makes me feel so old and ugly...I don't think I'm ugly though, General. I bet you'd fuck me, wouldn't you?\" she asked adding a purr after that. \"And I'm doing wonderful considering that weakling of a husband I had is dead. It's so fulfilling being a single mother\" she said, laughing evilly. Jonny just had to smile. This really was a different woman thanks to his manipulations. It had gone even farther than he thought it would, and seemed to even penetrate right down to her soul, which Jonny saw had a darker aura to it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that, Angie\" he said, staying in character. \"What do you know about why you're here?\" he asked, wanting to see how intact her memories were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I remember going to work and setting the lab to blow up to take out half the town, but it's strange because I don't really remember why I did that...but it was certainly fun. After I did my job there, I went right home, changed into my favorite leather suit and killed Tom. Now I woke up and I'm feeling soooo horny. Do you feel like fucking a pregnant MILF, General Ricks?\" she asked, giving him a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent General chuckled again. \"Good\" he said, ignoring her blatent lust for now. \"Now tell me about yourself\" he commanded firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're no fun, General....Fine, I'll play along. My name is Angie Donovan. Until recently, I  gave the appearance of being a doctor of biological science that was working at that lab. I also had a decent looking husband and have a baby on the way. Appearances are nothing but a mask though. In my spare time, I'm an assassin working for whoever pays me the highest amount of money or can offer me the best sex. In case you haven't noticed, I realllly like sex. Some would call me a nymphomaniac, but I just see myself as a gal that likes to have a good time. Too bad I have this brat on the way, or I'd be making more as a whore than as an assassin. I'm verrrrry good at my job, whether that job killing or fucking\" she said with a big smile. Jonny thought she was finished, before she continued. \"Oh, and I'm also your play thing, master. I'll do anything for you fre of charge, whether that's killing someone you don't want around or just fucking your brains out, regardless of who's body you're in\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you do know about me. I wasn't so sure\" he said, impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie giggled. \"Of course, I know about you, master. But I figured we could do some role play for a bit. The sexy assassin with the stiff General. I bet I could get you to loosen up, can't I?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you could, but right now, we have more pressing matters\" Jonny said, reaching into his pocket and taking out the tape. \"This is the tape that you made before blowing up the lab. I'll make sure that no one ever sees what's on it. I've also framed Selina McCarthy for murdering your husband, so you're in the clear. All you need to do is dress back up as your Doctor Donovan cover and make a press conference, telling the city that the police chief was responsible for blowing up the lab. Then, I want you to drop the act and go after Selina. Consider her your new target. Your job is to bring her to me, alive at all costs so I can figure out how much she knows and deal with her appropriately. Understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie nods. \"Whatever you say, General\" she said, mock saluting. Jonny grinned. He knew this was a good idea. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny smiled and watched as Angie strutted out of the room confidently. Jonny smiled as she closed the door behind her, leaving him alone in his newest base of operations. He trusted his creation to be good at her newly programmed job so he was confident that the former police chief would be brought to him like he wanted. It was only a matter of time before he would have her in front of him again. Jonny walked to the hotel room's window and opened the shades, looking down at the outside world. The streets were abandoned except for soldiers and police. Even though it was not yet curfew, people were scared. No one would be leaving their homes any time soon, which made the hunt for Selina all the more easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny could not wait to be face to face with his former meatsuit. He wanted to tell her everything that he had made her do and he wanted to see her reactions up close. Then he would break her mind completely. Even her admittedly powerful will would not stand against what Jonny had in mind for her. He would tear her mind apart and leave her to take blame for all that had happened in this city. Once Selina was taken into custody, the martial law on this city would no longer be needed. The governor would be able to lead the city in rebuilding while the army could return to wherever it was that they were based. Jonny would keep General Ricks' body and move back with them, starting over in a position of power the likes of which he had never held before. He would have enough access to be able to start chaos wherever he wanted to without having to answer to anyone. As for this city, Katie would be able to take things over from the sidelines with her sin controlling powers. She'd have this whole city in the palms of her hands before they know what hit them. Actually, that gave Jonny another idea...Jonny quickly texted Angie and then dialed the number for the Warehouse. This could be a lot of fun if it was played the right way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Jonny was awoken from the relaxing nap that he was in the middle of. There was a loud knock at the door. \"Come in!\" He exclaimed in the General's booming voice, sounding official. Even if his physical form was not as fun as some of the others that he got to wear, the authority he possessed was enough for Jonny to love and make him want to stay for an extended period of time. The General was a luxury that Jonny wanted to make use of for as long as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a young woman in military uniform opened the door, standing at attention. The name tag on her chest read \"Graves\" causing Jonny to chuckle a little under his breath. He had lead so many people to their graves lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir....we got a phone call. A tip on Selina McCarthy's location\" the woman said in a nervous voice. Jonny scanned his memories and saw that Allison Graves was 22 and had only recently joined the military. She had a strong sense of justice and wanted to save the world. the closest way to live that dream, in her mind, was by serving her country. The General had hand picked her for his personal unit because he admired her spunk. Jonny admired her body a bit more, but he would be able to have his way with her whenever he wanted. The Selina problem was something far more pressing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the tip? Who was it from?\" Jonny asked, keeping his voice cool and collected, but adding a sense of urgency to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was from a  woman... she didn't give her name but she gave an address...\" Allison said nervously. Jonny remembered encounters like this from General Ricks' memories. Though Allison Graves was strong around others, she was always nervous around him. She was him as her personal hero. Jonny could make use of this in the future. He firmly placed his hand on Allison's shoulder and smiled at her, giving a reassuring look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Graves, you have been superb thus far in your service to me and your country. Tell me this address and I will make sure that we talk about how you can do more for me and your unit\" he said. Suddenly, Allison blushed before catching herself and straightening up, standing more at attention. She smiled, knowing that her hard work had gotten the general's recognition and that she may be able to do more to serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woman said that she recently saw Selina in the Warehouse Restaurant\" she said. Jonny smiled. His plan hard worked sooner than he thought. Angie and Katie both worked fast to make this happen and now it was his turn to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Graves. Listen to me carefully. I am going to go to the Warehouse and see if I can talk to Selina McCarthy, assuming that she is still there. I still have doubts that she was the one who did all of this. I think there is a very good chance that she has been framed. If she is mentally stable, I will keep her there and extract the information I need. I need you to gather backup. You will lead our unit in my absence. Get everyone outside of the warehouse. If I find out that Selina McCarthy is guilty of these horrible crimes we will take her in and free this town from the fear that they are in. Be ready right outside. I'll send a signal to you, telling you what happened\" He says as Allison frowns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...that sounds risky....you never take risks...\" she said, sounding concerned. Jonny smiled. This is a smart girl. He'd have to figure out something sooner than later with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Right now, I just want this situation over. I'll be alright. I promise\" he said with a smile as he walked out of the room, brushing past his worried, and possibly suspicious soldier. Jonny got into a military vehicle by himself and drove to the Warehouse. He parked it right outside of the restaurant and walked inside, seeing people dancing and eating and gambling. The waitresses now wore much more revealing uniforms. The place had been greatly expanded since the last time he was here. Katie had done very good things to bring out people's sins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonny!\" Katie suddenly exclaimed, hugging his new body tightly, her breasts pressing against his chest. \"Your MILF whore told me that you were in this meatsuit to I came to greet you in person. She brought Selina to my office, passed out. They're both waiting for you\" she said with a grin on her face. \"What do you think will happen with your plan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that all depends on Selina\" Jonny said with a grin, wrapping his arm around Katie's slender body and walking into her office, holding the possessed girl against his aging body. Selina was tied in thick ropes to Katie's chair. Angie was laying down on the couch, smoking a cigarette in her mouth with a martini in her hand, completely disregarding her pregnancy. Jonny released, Katie from his grip as he got a text from Allison Graves, saying that the military was outside of the restaurant, waiting for his signal. He texted back that he had Selina in his sights and was about to make contact. He confirmed that they wait for his signal before doing anything and then turned off his phone. He did not want this moment to be interrupted. Jonny put the phone into his pocket and then closed his eyes, concentrating. Suddenly, his clothing and body changed, becoming the young man that Selina knew as Jonny. Katie grinned, seeing her original body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jonny was completely changed into his young form, he placed his hand on Selina's head. His eyes glowed bright red as she groaned, starting to wake up. He removed his hand from her head and smiled as she groggily opened her eyes, looking right into Jonny's burning red pupils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Selina. I think it's time for us to talk face to face\" he said with an evil grin. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina's eyes fluttered open as her vision slowly returned to her. What had happened? She remembered escaping from those goons that had presumably abducted her and she remembered going to her home to hide. Then a blonde woman snuck up behind her and knocked her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled as Selina looked around, a dazed look in her eyes. \"Goooood morning, Selina. Long time, no see\" He said with a huge grin on his young face. Selina gasped as soon as she saw the teenage boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonny!\" She exclaimed in surprise. \"I....I....I thought you were dead!\" There were practically tears dropping down her face as she looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled. \"It's funny how that works, isn't it?\" He asked with that grin still on his face. \"But for the record, you had thought correctly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...what do you mean?\" Selina asked, frowning. Jonny laughed, eyes glowing crimson as his body morphed back into the form of General Ricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that the kid's body died a long time ago. But don;t worry your sexy ass off, Selina. I'm going to be alive for a long, long time!\" He said. Selina looked at the general in disbelief as his eyes glowed again and his body shifted and twisted back into Jonny's form, only this time still wearing the generals uniform, just in a smaller size to fit his body. \"You really don't get it, do you, Selina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was shaking her head in disbelief. She couldn't believe what she had just seen. Jonny just kept laughing. \"Wh...what are you?\" Selina asked, still groggy from just waking up and trying to convince herself that her mind was playing tricks on her. She tried to convince herself that she wasn't seeing the boy she had fallen for back from the grave, and that she hadn;t just seen him turn into a grown man and back before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed. \"Isn't it obvious, you whore? I'm Jonny. I'm a powerful demon and you were one of my favorite playthings until you decided to run away on me! But it's okay. The meatsuit I've taken now is sooooooo much more useful to me than your busty shell. I have more authority than I know what to do with! All I need to do is make a call on my phone, and you get arrested and paraded around as the criminal responsible for the destruction of a whole chunk of the city.Or, I can absolve you of all suspicion, saying that you were framed and this is all just one big misunderstanding. It's all in my hands\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meatsuit?\" Selina asked in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed. This wasn't working. \"Let me spell it out for you, Selina. I am a demon! I have no physical body! I eat souls for breakfast! I live off of possessing others! The body that I made you fall in love with was just a shell I was using for clothing. And when he expired, I did the same to you! I had so much fun in you, Selina. I really thought we were perfect for each other. Here, why don;t you take a look\" Jonny said, eyes glowing red. Selina's did the same as her mind was suddenly filled with everything that her body had done while Jonny was in the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you...used me. Controlled me...paraded me around...\" Selina said as the memories settled in. She remembered everything as if she herself had done it, but she knew that it wasn't actually her. She had never felt so violated in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. You're body was my body for a pretty long time. And I was going to reclaim it before you decided to play hard to get. Now, I don't want to leave my current body because he's so useful, but there are still some options for you, Selina. The way I see it, you have a two choices\" he said, holding two fingers up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what choices are those?\" Selina asked, sulking and looking down, her hair falling in front of her face. She was just coming to terms with everything. She was never in love with Jonny, he only made her think that. And then he had taken her very life from right under her nose. He used her to lead to people's death. That made her an accomplice since it was her body that was used. She felt betrayed and she felt angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny crossed his arms, looking at the defeated former police chief. \"Option number one is pretty straight forward, Selina. You keep fighting this fight and hold onto your morals. If you do that, I will forcibly rip them from you. I will eat your soul and I will remove all sanity and justice from your mind. You will lose any connection to that conscience that you hold so dear. You will take the blame for the destruction of the lab as well as the damage in the city, be brought into custody by the military, and then executed for your actions. Option two is that you willingly give up. Tell me that I have won. Then, I will end your life quickly and painlessly by devouring your soul. I'll make sure you do not feel a thing. I have a business partner named Katie and I want to put her in a high position in this town. Once your soul has been removed from your body, it will become hers. She will continue your job as police chief while also running most of the city's underworld through this restaurant by turning you into a frequent patron. Your body will still carry a great respect in this town and you will be cleared of all suspicion in crimes. I'll find someone to take the blame for it. Either way, you  have to die because you are far too much of a liability to me and because I just want you out of my life. But if you show me respect in your final moments, I will make sure that your body lives on. Otherwise, this is the end of Selina McCarthy. Choose wisely, sexy\" Jonny said, snapping his fingers, causing the ropes holding Selina to her chair to burn away along with Selina's uniform, leaving the attractive woman completely in the nude like when she was born. That was fitting considering that she was about to die. Jonny, Angie, and KAtie just watched, waiting to see what would happen. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina sat with her naked body resting on the chair as she looked down in defeat.  This lasted for a few seconds as the imposing body of General Ricks stood expectantly over her as Jonny awaited her answer.  After a few seconds, Selina looked up, a determined look in her eyes.  She stood, her naked body glistening as she did so.  Jonny looked down on her still, as Ricks's body was more than a head taller than Selina's.  A smile crossed Jonny's borrowed face as it looked as thought Selina was about to say something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth, drew back, and spat right smack dab upon Johnny's face.  \"FUCK YOU!\" she said, \"I hope you fucking rot in hell you fucking monster.  I have to say it now that my body belongs to me again!  Fuck you!\" she screamed.  Angie and Katie stood off in the corner of the room, their jaws hanging open.  Jonny was more impressed than anything.  He smiled a bit as he wiped spit off the general's face.  \"That's my girl,\" Jonny declared with a smile.  He dropped the tissue as he moved close to Selina, approaching her confidently as her curvy body glistened with sweat and shook with rage.  \"FUCK YOU!\" she practically screamed through gritted teeth.  Jonny just smiled again.  \"Well my aren't you just a little broken record?\" he said mockingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stopped just a few inches from Selina.  The imposing body of General Ricks stood over her the enraged beauty.  Jonny waved his host's hand, and suddenly Selina's body was lifted off the ground and brought to a level that put her directly in front of Jonny's face.  Selina tried to struggle, tried to kick her legs and grab at Jonny with her arms, but to no avail.  Jonny had made her more or less paralyzed.  She could move enough to indicate her displeasure, but not enough to hurt her oppressor.  Jonny smiled as the woman struggled.  He leaned in close to her.  \"It's ironic, Selina--I spent all that time inside your body, and within a few seconds you'll be inside of me,\" he declared with a smile.  Selina's eyes widened with terror as she knew her time drew short.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked at the terror and rage in her eyes, and then he moved in.  \"I'm sorry it had to end like this, darling,\" he said as he reached around behind Selina, using both of the general's hands to grab generous handfuls of Selina's curvy ass and pull the naked woman in close to him.  Jonny went in for a passionate kiss as the woman struggled, but she did not do so for long.  Once the kiss began, Jonny's eyes glowed red as the power surged within him.  After a couple seconds, Selina's body began to shake and spasm, much as it had when Jonny initially forced his way inside her.  But it was not that Jonny was forcing his way inside her this time; no, it was that something was forcing its way out.  A tiny ball of brilliant light traveled up from Selina's belly, up her throat and into her mouth as her body shook and jiggled.  The ball made its way from her throat to her mouth, and then into Jonny's.  Selina's soul then forced its way down inside the demon, and Jonny's body began to shake from the power he had just absorbed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny staggered back as power filled his stolen body, and a brilliant white light filled the entire room.  Selina's body was lowered somewhat roughly back to the ground as Jonny's vessel surged with energy.  He struggled to control his body, like a man about to finish during sex--the power was just to much, so wonderful.  After a few seconds, the light stopped.  Jonny stood there inside General Ricks panting like a kid who had just had his first sexual experience.  \"Wow!\" Jonny said as he looked at the empty shell that had housed Selina's soul.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's body stood before him, a blank look on her face, though the body still worked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the blood pumpin' boss?\" said Angela from off to the side.  \"Damn right it did,\" Jonny said with a smile as he walked up to Selina's empty body and kissed her on the mouth again.  \"You were damn good,\" he said with a smile.  Another wave of his hand caused black smoke to condense around Selina's body.  Within a couple seconds, she was again wearing a wonderfully revealing police uniform that hugged every beautiful curve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned around and walked his General Ricks body toward the door to leave the room. \"All of you--out,\" he ordered.  Everyone in the room made a b-line for the door as Jonny pulled out his walkie-talkie.  He pressed a button and spoke authoritatively into it.  \"Graves?\" he said.  The woman's voice came on the other end.  \"Yes sir?\" \"She's guilty; move in, and then head to Angela Donovan's old house.  I think you'll find evidence of further crimes there.\"  Within a few seconds, Jonny heard the soldiers breach the outer doors.  He concentrated and disappeared in a puff of black smoke as soldiers rushed into the room, himself being gone mere seconds before he would have been seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, General Rick's body appeared at the make-shift headquarters, a smile on its face.  \"A fine day's work,\" he said to himself as he flipped on CNN and beheld the siege of the Warehouse building as the military carried out his own orders to bring Selina to justice, or to whatever it was Jonny had orchestrated for her.  \"Got that out of the way . . . \" Jonny said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny watched the TV as Selina was walked into a heavily guarded police car. The look of the former police chief, still in her oh-so-attractive uniform, with her hands cuffed in front of her brought an evil grin to Jonny's face. The camera zoomed in on her face, revealing a blank expression and soulless eyes, as if all human light were drained away from them (which, of course, was the case). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's annoying...\" Jonny muttered to himself in General Ricks stern voice. He now realized that he was so distracted with eating Selina's soul and wanting her out of his way that he had failed to give her now-vacant body any orders. As a result, she was just an emotionless meat suit, running on little more than her human instinct. While her blank face and empty eyes gave her quite a sociopaths look, which was sure to convince those watching this broadcast of her guilt, it would not be ideal for people to talk to her and receive only robotic replies. Fixing this would require Jonny to be with Selina privately before other people got a chance to interrogate her. If he could do that, Jonny could give her orders to act like her old self, but with memories of joyfully committing all the crimes that she was accused of. That would not only guarantee her guilt in court, but would also give Jonny one final victory over the police chief that had managed to turn into such a thorn in his side.  Luckily, Jonny didn't expect her to have much conversation during her ride to her holding cell, which gave Jonny quite a bit of time to get things in motion. Just as he was about to teleport himself to the station in preparation for Selina's arrival, there was a knock on his door. Jonny sighed deeply. \"Come in!\" he said, not in much of a mood to be held up right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'm glad that I caught you!\" Allison Graves said energetically as she came into the room and saluted her general, standing at attention like a good soldier. \"How did you get back here so soon, sir? I thought that you said you would be meeting former Chief McCarthy at the Warehouse?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny motioned for her to relax, which she immediately did. \"I have my ways, now how can I help you, Graves?\" Jonny asked, crossing his arms as he dismissed her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I'm sure you saw, we have her arrested. She's currently on her way to being held in the police station which she herself was in charge of until recently. Now that we have her in custody, I was wondering what the next course of action is that we should take, sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled, looking over the young soldier. Allison Graves was truly a work of art. She had an athletic body that she clearly kept in good shape specifically for her job in the military. And she was young enough to still be nice and firm. Jonny could also tell from the look in her eyes how much she adored his current body. General Ricks was clearly her personal hero, a man that she looked up to as a moral guide and also as a father figure. Jonny made sure to keep mental notes of all of this, knowing that she would no doubt be helpful to him in the future. \"I'm glad that you asked, Graves. I believe I mentioned earlier that I want a team investigating the home of Doctor Angelina Donovan. When I briefly spoke to Ms. McCarthy, she mentioned killing a man there. I still don;t want to believe that she is a killer, but after our talk, I think its clear that she's guilty\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraves nodded. \"Yes, sir. I ordered a team over there when you mentioned it before. We should be hearing back from them any minute\" she said, causing Jonny to smile. This girl was very efficient. She would definitely be of use to Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Then I'd like you to phone the police station. Tell them that I want to speak to Ms. McCarthy ALONE before anyone else talks to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir. But, may I ask why? Didn't you already speak to her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions, Graves. I have to follow up with her about something happened during our brief conversation. If it ends up being relevant, you will be the first to know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I'll call them immediately\" she said before turning around to leave the room. Jonny caught a nervous look on her face before she turned, though. It was as if she had a moment of confusion about her bosses order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graves! ...Allison....Please wait for a moment\" Jonny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" she asked, turning around, eyes wide that her superior had just addressed her by her first name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been paying attention to your exploits since you joined my unit\" Jonny said, digging into the General's memories and pulling up Allison Grave's records. He made sure that every word he was saying was the truth that General Ricks really believed. \"You have always gone above and beyond your orders. And that has not gone unnoticed. Effective after my meeting with McCarthy, I would like to promote you to being my personal assistant. You will be the line between me and the rest of the unit. That means that you and I will be working a lot closer together. And you will be my most valued, useful subordinate. Is that understood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile suddenly crossed Allison's pretty face. Jonny could swear that he noticed her eyes watering with tears of joy just a little. \"Sir! Yes sir!\" she said happily before leaving his office with a new energetic pep in her step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled as he watched her hips swaying as she left. \"Yes, you're going to be very useful to me Allison...\" he muttered as black smoke surrounded his body.Once the smoke dissipated, Jonny found himself in the back parking lot of the police station. Meanwhile, in the front of the station, the car that had been driving Selina McCarthy to her holding cell had just arrived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny stood in the silence of the back lot of the police station as the muscular but aging body of his host surveyed the station, a puff of black smoke announcing his arrival.  \"Just a couple things to tidy up,\" Jonny mused to himself as he walked toward the door of the place.  He reached the doorway and pulled the door open, stepping into the bustle of the police station as officer and his own military men scurried about.  Jonny smiled slightly as he looked upon the empire of chaos he had begun to build.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Jonny said to a pretty young officer seated at a reception desk.  The officer looked up, her eyes widening with surprise as she realized who stood before her.  \"Ah, hello, hello sir,\" she said, standing quickly to greet her visitor, \"what, ah, what can I do for you?\" she asked quickly.  Jonny looked down at this busty young thing, her boobs wonderfully revealed and barely contained by her tight-fitting uniform.  \"Well, Officer . . . Wallace,\" Jonny addressed her after looking at her name tag, \"I would like to see your old chief, who I understand has recently arrived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Wallace suddenly got an odd look on her face.  \"Um, yes sir, I just got a call from your office indicating that you would be coming, but we did not expect you so quickly I'm sorry to say, but if you'll give me just a moment I'm sure we can help you sir,\" she said as she sat back down and started furiously punching buttons on her phone.  Jonny nodded and stepped aside to wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited, he picked up little bits of Officer Wallace's conversation.  \"Yes, General Ricks wants to see McCarthy.  . . . I know but he's here NOW!\" she urgently and yet quietly screamed into the phone.  Jonny shook his head with delight at the things his borrowed body seemed to be able to do for him.  Within a couple minutes, the buxom Officer Wallace called to him.  \"They're ready for you sir,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jonny replied as he followed the voluptuous young officer down the hall, looking at her form-fitting outfit as her hips swayed sexily in front of him.  The two walked down a long hallway and through a couple set of locked doors, each guarded by two officer or by Ricks's own men or some combination thereof.  Eventually, the two reached the final door, this one too guarded by two soldiers.  Both saluted the general, and Jonny returned the gesture.  \"The general has come to see the prisoner,\" Wallace declared.  \"Very good, sir,\" one of the men said as he produced a set of keys and went to work on the door's heavy-duty locking mechanism.  \"Is there a camera on the prisoner?\" Jonny asked the other guard.  \"Yes sir,\" the pretty young soldier said.  \"Turn it off,\" Jonny commanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the first guard opened the door and motioned for Jonny to enter.  Jonny stepped into the darkened room and looked around briefly.  The whole thing was not very big . . . probably eight feet by ten feet.  The place had a somewhat dirty concrete floor and a single lamp hanging from the middle of the ceiling with one dim bulb to illuminate the place.  At a single table situated in the middle of the room, there sat the form of Selina, Jonny\u2019s vessel during the carnage he had wrought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across Jonny\u2019s face as he maneuvered the aging body of the general into the room.  \u201cThank you,\u201d he said to the people who had guided him in as one of them closed the heavy metal door and it clanged shut.  Jonny sat down on the fairly uncomfortable chair and looked across the table at the shell of a woman before him.  Jonny looked upon Selina; the buxom middle-aged woman sat staring blankly ahead as sweat poured down her curvy body.  Her breasts rose and fell with each slow, deliberate, robotic breath, her eyes locked forward as she stared at nothing in particular.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there,\u201d Jonny said.  Still, Selina gazed forward into nothing.  \u201cHow\u2019s the food here, hot stuff?\u201d Jonny asked, chuckling a bit.  Jonny\u2019s face took on a look of mock disappointment.  \u201cNot feeling too talkative, are you?\u201d he said, looking sad.  Suddenly, he smiled.  \u201cI know what to do!\u201d he said, we\u2019ll have a a girls\u2019 night!\u201d  Jonny exclaimed as he concentrated.  Suddenly, long, dark hair began to sprout from his host\u2019s head.  Jonny\u2019s aged, wrinkled face changed melted into a darker skin tone as the years washed away.  His skin became smooth and beautiful.  Farther down, the general\u2019s cut, toned body beefed up, his belly and arms and thighs adding some girth and stretching the limits of his very tight military uniform.  Ricks\u2019s hips and ass suddenly flared out, letting forth their delightful, jiggle-prone fullness as the general\u2019s legs took on the same tone as the rest of his body and his by-now-erect member was sucked inside of him.  Last but certainly not least, the general (if he could still be called that) felt a tingling in his chest as two globes of wonderful flesh surged forth to form a set of breasts that would make any man hard. Jonny\u2019s now-shredded general uniform disappeared in a puff of black smoke and was instead replaced by a curve-hugging, tight police uniform that showed off his new body\u2019s cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there,\u201d Jonny said from a body that was duplicate of Selina\u2019s.  Jonny\u2019s reached his middle-aged vessel\u2019s hands up and cupped his impressive chest.  \u201cYou know the thing about bodies like yours?\u201d Jonny asked.  Still, Selina stared forward.  \u201cMiddle-aged women,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cwhen women hit middle age their bodies fill out in this way that\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d he mused as he massaged his chest.  \u201cSome men think that the greatest thing in the world is a tight, toned body of a 24-year-old, and I see their point, but I tell you lady, if I had a body like yours I\u2019d play with it so often I\u2019d never leave the house.\u201d  Jonny looked across the table.  Still nothing from Selina.  Suddenly, Jonny\u2019s eyes began to glow red as he stood, and he slowly brought his transformed hand up with him.  As he did, Selina\u2019s chair floated into the air a few feet and then slowly tipped forward.  The buxom woman slid slowly from the chair to a standing position.  Jonny then sat the chair slowly back down, a smile crossing his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right . . . I forgot,\u201d he began as he gestured to his voluptuous form, \u201cthis body . . . this isn\u2019t what you like, is it?\u201d  He paused.  \u201cMaybe this will be more your speed.  Suddenly, Jonny\u2019s body began to shift and change again.  The wonderful globes dangling from his chest deflated; his hips began to collapse in on themselves.  His hair was sucked into his head, and his body shed its middle-aged visage.  Within a few seconds, there stood before Selina the body of Jack\u2014the first vessel Jonny had possessed so long ago after the Old Man turned him loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sexy,\u201d Jonny said, his male voice one he hadn\u2019t heard in a while, \u201cremember me?\u201d he asked as he began to walk around the table toward the apparently entranced woman.  Jonny walked close to her, stepping up behind the waiting, middle-aged woman.  \u201cI remember when you first approached me,\u201d Jonny said as he wrapped his arms sexily around Selina from behind.  \u201cI kind of made you do it,\u201d he said with a chuckle as he reached his hands up from her belly and firmly grasped her bulging boobs, cupping them in his hands.  A moan of pleasure escaped Selina\u2019s lips; though her soul was gone, her bod still worked just fine.  \u201cFigured you\u2019d like that,\u201d Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slowly made his way around to Selina\u2019s front.  She stood over him, her body being physically taller than his.  Selina\u2019s wonderful boobs jutted out from her chest at just barely below Jonny\u2019s eye level.  \u201cI like the view,\u201d he said as he put his arms around Selina as if to embrace her.  Suddenly, Jonny leapt into the air toward Selina.  As he jumped, he wrapped his legs around Selina\u2019s curvy waist and hips and held on.  Jonny pulled himself in close and pulled Selina in for a passionate kiss as his dick hardened from its proximity to the beautiful woman\u2019s form.  The kiss lasted for a good ten seconds.  Jonny broke the kiss and pulled just a couple inches from Selina\u2019s face, is legs still wrapped around her.  \u201cI forgot how good you taste,\u201d Jonny said, as his eyes began to glow red.  Selina\u2019s did too.  \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cwhen the cops come in here to interrogate you, or when the prosecutor does, you\u2019re going to admit to it all.  You\u2019re going to tell them that you walked your beautiful ass into that place and did it all your fucking self and that you loved every minute of it.  None of these blank stares either . . . act like your old self, got it?\u201d he asked.  \u201cYes Master,\u201d Selina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny pulled Selina in for another kiss as his eyes returned to normal.  \u201cGood to hear . . . I\u2019ll miss this body of yours,\u201d Jonny said as he unwrapped his legs from the woman and stood again under his own power, \u201creally I will,\u201d he declared as he reached up and drummed playfully on her cleavage.  \u201cToo bad you had to be stubborn,\u201d Jonny said as his body shifted back into that of the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he headed to the metal door and knocked loudly.  An officer came to retrieve him as he left Selina for what would likely be the last time.                   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a shame that all of this happened young man. I'd heard only good things about your former police chief. Until now, that is\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer. \"Yes, sir. She was one of the best women I had met. I can't help but wonder what could have lead her to this...\" he said sadly, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A demon named Jonny</i>, the possessed general thought to himself, suppressing a chuckle. \"There's a lot of evil in this world, officer. A lot of it stems from circumstance. It's very easy for people in a position of power to abuse that power. Remember that...uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trask, sir. Officer Nick Trask\" he said with a smile, extending his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny shook the hand firmly. \"It's a pleasure, Officer Trask. Tell me, now that this has all happened, who will be taking over for McCarthy as the head of police here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrask frowned. \"I don't know off the top of my head, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded with a look of understanding. \"Not a problem,\" he said as he placed his hand on Trask's shoulders. \"Do me a favor, son. Find out who the new chief will be and give me their info. I want to publicly wish them luck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Trask said with a smile as Jonny handed him one of the general's business cards. Jonny smiled. General Ricks was in such an authoritative position that he didn't even have to control the young officer into getting that information. If Jonny kept Ricks as his primary meatsuit, things would certainly be easy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much son\" Jonny said as he left the building and walked back into the parking lot. In a puff of smoke, Jonny vanished and reappeared in Katie's office in the Warehouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! You scared me!\" Katie exclaimed, nearly jumping from her seat. \"Nice new threads. A bit rusty, though\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This body may just be the most useful one I'll get. The reach I have with him is enough to warrant looking past his age. Besides...\" the general's body suddenly shifted as he became what Ricks would have looked like in his mid 30s. \"I can be as handsome as I want\" he said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've got me\" Katie said with a shrug. \"So what brings you here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be leaving this town soon to return to the military base. I've had enough of things here and this meatsuit will let me have lots of fun. But before I go, I want to make sure that this town is left in capable hands. How's business been here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible. I have a feeling no one will be coming in anymore after this place made the news with Selina's capture\" Katie said with a pouting expression on her face. \"And after all the work I put into it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing I have other plans for you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Care to fill me in on these other plans?\" Katie asked, raising an eyebrow curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's going to be a new chief of police in the near future. I don't know who they are, but I'm going to find out as soon as possible. When I do, I want you to leave your current meatsuit and take theirs. You get to be the head of police and your whole 'lord of sin' powers will be very useful from that position. And since I'd assume you'll have your toy Vanessa still, you have underworld access as well. You will literally be running this whole town. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie frowned. \"Well, I'm going to miss Katie's body a lot...But this is one hell of a promotion!\" she exclaimed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like it. I'll contact you when I have more information\" Jonny said as his body reverted back to it's proper age before he disappeared in a puff of black smoke, only to reappear just outside of Lisa's house. Jonny frowned. \"This isn't where I wanted to go...\" he said, looking at the large house and remembering the times that were had there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's where I wanted you to go, Jonny\" a booming voice said. Jonny turned around to be face to face with the Old Man. \"How are you feeling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stared at the Old Man and thought for a moment. The being he was looking at was the most powerful in existence. He could create or destroy demons with a thought. He was responsible for the devouring of Lisa's soul and for all the death and destruction that Jonny had been responsible for. He was the reason for Jonny's current existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny knelt one one knee and smiled at his master, the one that gave him true life. \"I feel good. Free.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might,\" the Old Man said with a smile motioning for Jonny to rise. \"When I created you as a demon, I did not realize that your humanity was still prevalent in your being. Lisa was able to awaken that humanity and nurture it. But in devouring her, you also devoured that humanity. Your being has been purified. Now you are ready to embrace your purpose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master\" Jonny said. \"I see now how much of a fool I was. Emotions are meaningless and detract from my purpose as a demon. Love is a lie. Pleasure is all that is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoken like a true demon. What shall you be doing now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled. \"I'm going to ensure that Jack, the demon currently in a meatsuit named Katie, is in an ideal position in this town. And then I will leave and have fun with my new life. Until it starts to bore me and I move on again. But first...\" Jonny looked at the house. His eyes burned red as the house became engulfed in black flames. \"No reason to keep that eyesore in existence\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man smiled. \"Good. I'll be watching you, Jonny\" he said before disappearing. Rather than teleporting away, Jonny stayed and watched the engulfed house. As he watched it burn to ash, the memories of his experiences with Lisa played in his mind. The love and loss that Jonny had experienced taught him a valuable lesson. Humans were only useful as toys. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jonny didn't know anything about this Brenda Nelson, but she wouldn't be his problem. She would come to his office to meet with him and would leave possessed by the demon currently calling himself Katie. Once that happened, Jonny's business in this town would officially be over. He would leave the town and bring his military forces with him. Yes, the future was looking brighter and brighter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>General Cyrus Ricks sat at the desk of his makeshift office, typing away at his computer. He was finishing his report of the events that had transpired in this city since his arrival. He wrote about the trial of the former chief of police, which ended in an order of execution for Selina McCarthy. He concluded his report with the statement that he would be heading back to his base immediately after wishing luck to the soon-to-be-appointed new police chief. As soon as he sent the report to his superior at the White House, General Ricks closed his laptop. He smiled when he heard the knock on his door a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Ricks, Officer Nelson is here to see you\" Allison Graves said from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Please send her right in!\" The possessed General exclaimed, loud enough to ensure that he was heard through the closed door. He stood up and walked towards the opening door just in time to see Brenda Nelson walk in. \"It's nice to finally meet you. I've heard a lot about your love for justice, Officer Nelson\" he said as he extended his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is mine, General. Please call me Brenda\" Nelson said, taking his hand in hers and giving it a surprisingly strong shake. \"I was surprised that you wanted to speak with me, but I guess this is as good a time as ever for me to give you my own thanks for keeping this city in one piece through all that chaos.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos...That's an appropriate word for everything we've all been through\" Jonny said, nodding to Graves to close the door and lock it from the inside as he released Brenda's hand. \"But it's not over yet\" he said ominously as he looked over the soon-to-be-chief. He had read her file before finishing his report, but the words could not do her justice. Brenda Nelson was 45 years old, but she managed to look remarkably good for her age. Her body was kept in superb shape, leaving it to no wonder that new male officers would always talk about her behind her back. While her moral code was firm, Jonny had no doubt that her body's future occupant would quickly make her into the cougar of the force, an image which got General Ricks' body quite excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda nodded. \"Of course. We still have a lot to do to get things back to normal. I'll do my best to make it a quick and easy process for everyone involved\" she said as Graves crossed her arms, standing behind her, in front of the closed door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that you will. Everything from the record of your work that I've read to the sense of justice that you're displaying right now has shown me that that is the case. That's why I need to replace you with someone a little more to my liking before leaving\" Jonny said as he snapped his finger. Suddenly, Allison Graves' body fell limply to the floor as black smoke exited her mouth and nose. Brenda turned around and opened her mouth to scream as the smoke lunged into her open mouth, forcing its way down her throat. Brenda fell to the ground and shook violently as the smoke made its way further inside of her body. Once it was completely gone, Brenda stood up and brushed herself off, making sure to feel herself over in the process. Her eyes were glowing bright red as the demon completed his takeover. \"How's she feel, Jack?\" Jonny asked with a grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the morning, Jonny brought Graves with him to the warehouse to visit Katie. He wasted no time having Jack leave Katie's body and make Graves his temporary meatsuit, though he was very strict that Jack would not make any mental changes to her or devour her soul. She was Jonny's toy and Jack was only allowed to use her until getting to his next stop. Katie's soulless body was commanded to keep running the Warehouse as if nothing was different and report anything interesting to the new police chief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like her as Katie or that assistant of yours...but she'll be fun.She's a nice change of pace for me\" the newly-possessed Brenda said with an evil smile, as the red glow in her eyes faded back to her natural brown color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the chief of police AND queen of sin, I expect nothing less than the complete corruption of this city and its police force by the next time I hear from you. It's a big job, but I have faith in you\" Jonny said as Graves' body stirred. She stood up, holding her head. \"Are you alright Graves? Do you need something to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, sir. I don't know what happened...\" Graves said truthfully. As far as she was concerned, she suddenly got lightheaded and had to sit down for a few minutes. She happened to stay in the room to hear her general wish the new police chief luck and give her some advice, but nothing out of the ordinary. She quickly unlocked the door and headed back to her desk as the general escorted Brenda out of the base. </span></div></div>",

She's nice, but she may be a bit young for me. I definitely have some fun planned for her when we get back, though\" Jonny said with a grin. He wouldn't be making the same mistake that he made with Lisa, but Jonny knew he wanted some kind of servant at his side to give him human input as well as pleasure him when bored. Graves would be as good as anyone where that was concerned and her position as his new assistant meant that she would be with him close to 24-7. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while you're off playing big boy military man, I'll be here ruling the police as myself and the underworld through Vanessa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also have Angie if you ever need an assassin. Think of this as your test. I'm giving you access to an entire town to play with. If you don't disappoint me the next time we run into each other, I won't destroy you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you even destroy me, Jonny? I am the queen of sin after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget that I was the one that made you what you are. That was a gift that I gave to you and it's a gift I can take away in a heartbeat. Whatever body you're in and whatever powers you have, you'll always just be some whiny teenager that was in the wrong place at the wrong time to me, Jack\" Jonny said and then placed his hand on Brenda's shoulder. He looked into her eyes and gave her a prideful smile. \"You haven't disappointed me just yet, and I don't think you will when we next meet. Take care of yourself\" he said as he disappeared in a puff of black smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't\" Brenda said with a smile as she turned to walk back to her new office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where did the general go?\" Allison Graves asked as Brenda entered the station alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he told me to tell you he'd be walking around town for a bit. He said that you should go pack things up at your makeshift base and he'd meet you back there when he's ready to leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it\" Allison said with a nod as she hurried out of the station and to the car that she brought the general over with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda, formerly Katie, formerly Jack watched as she did so. The girl was already so loyal to her general that the new police chief couldn't possibly imagine how Jonny would play with her more. Oh well, that wasn't Brenda's concern. Right now, she had to arrange a meeting with Vanessa and Angie to discuss their next moves in a city without Jonny. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny reappeared on a beach several miles outside of the city. It was the same beach where the Old Man made him devour Lisa's soul. The same beach that lead to Jonny finally giving up on his humanity and fully embracing his role as a demon of chaos. How many people had he killed in the explosion that followed? How many families were forever changed, how many lives were forever ruined, thanks to the actions of one demon throwing a tantrum? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny crossed General Ricks' hands behinds his back and watched the waves crash, content in his thoughts. He had to admit that it would be strange leaving this city. Ever since the Old Man told him that he had a special mission, Jonny had called this place his home. It was the first area touched by his demonic powers. Jonny wondered where his original group had gone. What became of Kal and the Calhouns? Were they still together or had they decided to go their separate ways and spread their chaos on their own? Jonny also wondered what the Old Man was doing. Was he making new demons? Would one of them be an \"alpha\" like Jonny? Would they suffer the same fate and have to get their humanity ripped from them in the same way? All of these were questions that Jonny knew he would likely never get the answers to. The Old Man was more powerful than any demon. He was something greater than anything that existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is also weaker now than he ever was, Jonathan Macks\" a voice said. Jonny nearly jumped of surprise as he turned to find an older woman standing next to him. She had long blonde hair that was starting to grey and had on a long purple dress with a matching scarf on her head. She looked to be about the same age as the general that Jonny currently inhabited. \"You must be wondering who I am\" she said, turning to look at Jonny, her eyes a bright purple. Jonny nodded, but said nothing. \"Well,\" she continued, \"you can call me Lena. Alternatively, I suppose you can call me the 'Old Woman'\" she said with a chuckle, causing Jonny to raise his eyebrow. \"It's true that I'm not as old as my father, but I don't have to be to be old, wise, and powerful. I've existed for a very long time, watching as he made his demons and fed on his chaos. It's a viscous cycle, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jonny asked, finally joining this conversation. He couldn't help but admit that he was curious who this woman was and what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father is immortal, but he is not ageless. He was once an angel that found himself cast out of heaven. In order to survive away from Grace, he had to create an energy source for himself. That energy source was chaos, which he harvests with the demons that he creates. The energy from that chaos keeps him in existence but he always ends up using more power than he generates. That's why, every once in awhile, he creates an alpha with the potential to have the same powers as he does. He'll let them generate and gain power from chaos and then adsorb them into himself to bring his power back to maximum. Once that happens he replenishes all the demons that got themselves destroyed over the years and then has to make a new alpha to get himself back in shape. You are only the latest in a chain, Jonny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want you to help me break the cycle,\" she said, placing her hand on Jonny's shoulder and looking into his eyes. \"I've been watching you from the very beginning. The Old Man tried to erase your humanity by making you kill the woman who you fell in love with and he mistook your anger at the world for success. But that anger wasn't because your humanity was ripped out of you. It was because of your passion. I know that your humanity is still strong inside of you, Jonny. You may have lied to yourself and said that it's not, but you came here, to this beach, because you still care. I've traveled to many different realities to meet you, Jonny. All of them as an enemy trying to win you to my cause by force because I could not bring myself to believe that you had any shred of humanity left in you. But seeing you now made me realize that you are more human than I ever was when I was a mortal. I don't want to be your enemy, Jonny. I want to be your friend. I want to help you eliminate the Old Man so that no one else has to suffer the way that you have. Will you help me do that? Or will you be my enemy like in every other reality I found myself in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought for a moment. He didn't know what this woman was talking about about alternate realities, but he did know that she was right about his humanity. He may have tried to convince himself that it was burned out of him, but if that were true, he would not have brought himself to this beach. Somehow, he managed to maintain connection to himself that other demons did not. He imagined what happened with him and Lisa happening to others and balled his hand into a fist. He looked at Lena sternly. \"I'll help you, Lena. Where do we start?\" </span></div></div>",

Once his vision returned, the woman was gone. \"So that's what that feels like\" Jonny said under his breath before doing his own disappearing act and reappearing a few blocks away from the makeshift military base. Jonny walked in to find men in the finishing stages of packing everything up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! I was wondering when you would get here!\" Allison Graves chirped from behind him. \"We're almost done here and should be on our way back home in no time\" she said, clearly excited to leave this city and get back to base, where General Ricks' memories told Jonny that her fiance (a well-liked commander, on his way to becoming one of the most trusted people on the base) was eagerly waiting for her return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're eager to get back to a special someone, Graves\" Jonny said with a smirk, quickly causing Allison to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yes, s-sir...\" she said, clearly flustered. \"Is it that obvious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed. \"Only to me, Graves. I have some experience when it comes to love\" he said, placing his hand on her shoulder. \"Don't lose that feeling of love, Graves. It's powerful\" he said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked into his eyes and smiled brightly. \"Sir, yes sir!\" she exclaimed passionately. Having this kind of conversation with General Ricks just made her look up to the man more, which was exactly what Jonny was hoping for. He wanted her to stay close to him if he wanted to really keep his ties to humanity and he would explain it away to the old man by saying he was toying with her emotions and slowly molding her into his willing slave. With that conversation over, Jonny walked over to the generals desk and began packing up the few belongings he had with him, including a picture of him with his children and grandchildren. It caused Jonny to start wondering how things would have been different if he stayed human. Would he have had a family like this? Jonny chose not to dwell on the past too much, and instead simply placed the picture into a box along with the rest of the belongings. Less than an hour later, Jonny was in a military car, being driven by Graves back to his base. They drove in silence, with Jonny watching the skyline of the city slowly disappearing behind them. </span></div></div>",

While his demonic nature ensured that he did not need sleep, Jonny's borrowed meatsuit was grateful for the chance to rest up after essentially spending the last several days working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jonny was snoozing, purple smoke started to escape from the ventalation shaft and quickly forced itself into Allison's body. However, this was not done in the same way that a demon would possess one of their victems. The smoke was slow moving and pleasant smelling. It whispered lovely things to Allison and allowed her to continue focusing on safe driving as it slowly took control of her body. Once the smoke was fully inside, Allison's eye glowed bright purple. Rather than turning to head in the direction of the military base, Lena drove to a very nice looking mansion estate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Jonny\" she said, nudging the general awake and smiling as he opened his eyes. \"I told you that we'd be in touch. It's time for us to get to work\" she said, stepping out of the car and motioning for Jonny to do the same. She made sure to keep her eyes bright purple so that Jonny knew exactly who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Jonny asked as he looked up at the mansion, which was clearly the result of centuries of saved wealth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my home, Jonny. This is where we defeat the Old Man once and for all\" the possessed Allison said with a smile. Allison's body then exhaled purple smoke, which formed Lena's body straight from it. \"Ah, much better. I'm not like you demons. I have my own body that I keep even when possessing others\" she said, somewhat truthfully. While Lena did have a main body, it was one she had to upgrade every few years to best contain her magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her?\" Jonny asked, motioning to Allison, who was standing at attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I temporarily removed her will. I dont want her asking questions. Before we go inside, I have a special body for you\" Lena said as the door to her home opened and a young woman in a beautiful gown walked down the steps. She was a black girl who appeared to be in her mid to late twenties. For some reason, she looked vaguely familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress! I'm glad you made it back safely\" she said happily before turning her attention to Jonny. \"And you must be Jonny. I've heard so much about you from Misstress Lena\" she saifd, cutsying. \"I hope that I can be of service to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled and turned to Jonny. \"This is my lovely apprentice, Leah. In another reality, she was a cop from the very city you just came from who found her body possessed by an evil demon. I erased that demon and gave her acess to the demic energies still inside of her body before bringing her with me to thus reality. She now uses those powers along with the magic that I have been teaching her to assist me in my mission.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny frowned. \"You keep talking about realities and moving between them. What does that mean, exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, imagine as if life were a story. Each choice that the characters make would lead to different endings. My father and I are singularities. No matter which version of the story, we are the same being. We can move around them as we please. But everyone else is different. This reality is the only one where you have retained enougb of your humanity to be able to help me. So this is the reality where my mission must come to an end. Now before you ask any more questions, please possess Leah's body. Sbe's perfectly willing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked at Leah, who nodded energetically. \"If this will put an end to all of this chaos, it's my honor to assist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought for a moment before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny briefly thought this over and came to the conclusion that it was best to do as he was asked. He concentrated and left General Ricks' body, which fell limply to the floor as his smoky form rushed itself into Leah's mouth, which she had opened for him. Her body gave no fight whatsoever as he entered. In fact, upon beginning his possession of Leah, Jonny found himself met with a very familiar feeling power which pulled him in even faster. Opening his new eyes, Jonny saw Lena leaning over the General, whispering something into his ear as he stood up and stood at attention next to Allison Graves. When Jonny was about to ask what was said, he felt a pain in his head. The pain was so strong, he began to scream as he fell to the ground, blacking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny woke up what he assumed was several hours later. He was laying in a very comfortable bed in what he assumed was the mansion that he was outside of the last time he was conscious. He sat up and looked down at himself, seeing that he was still inside of Leah's body, but had changed from the gown she wore earlier into a simple t-shirt and sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see that you've woken up\" Lena said as she entered the room and sat on a chair next to the bed which Jonny sat on. \"If your mind clear now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"It is\" he said, remembering the information that had entered his mind, which caused him to pass out in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then explain it to me so I know you understand\" Lena said, offering Jonny a glass of tea which seemed to just appear out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny shook his said, feeling Leah's long hair moving back and forth as he did so. \"No thanks\" he said softly. \"Before I do, where are the general and Allison?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled, keeping the tea with herself and taking a slow sip. \"Oh, they left a little over an hour ago. I fixed up their memories so they assumed a wrong turn was taken and their GPS wasn't working. They stopped here to ask for directions and I made sure they didn't leave without a bite to eat first. Now tell me what you know.\" The way Lena said that last part betrayed a slightly impatient tone. As if she were in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I possessed Leah, her memories became clear to me. In the reality you brought her from, her body was possessed by a demon, like you said. But that demon was me. You used your magic on me and erased my personality, merging my soul with Leah's and making me believe that I was her just with access to demonic powers. Then you taught her magic with the hopes of training her to destroy the old man with that combination. But it didn't work. When I possessed her before, my demonic powers merged with her magical ones and combined with the version of me that possessed her initially. I'm the only soul in this body and I have the combined powers of two alpha demons and a sorceress in training. I take it you think I'm finally enough to destroy him or you wouldn't have sacrificed Leah's life like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena nodded. \"I did what I had to in order to get you where you now are. I told you I tried getting you on my side in other ways and turning you into Leah was one of them. It worked in getting you to my side, but your powers were still not good enough. And the humanity you had in you was one that I forced upon you. The version of you from this reality was clearly the best option to give these powers to. So here we are. You can either spend time planning revenge on me for what I did to the alternate version of you, or we can destroy the Old Man. Make your choice, but do it fast since we don't have much time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed. Obviously destroying the Old Man was the choice he'd make, but he wasn't convinced that these means were justified.

In addition to that, you wouldn't be so confident in this plan unless you knew he wasn't able to barge in and stop it. You have him prisoner somehow, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo\" Lena said, handing Jonny a crystal ball. Jonny took it and looked inside, seeing dark energy within it, trying to break free. The ball also had a crack in it, showing that he had at least some success so far. As Jonny took it in his hand, a second crack appeared. \"Just before getting you, I took a new body from the same reality that I brought Leah from. That body have me more powers which I used to make my spell stronger. But he can still break free. You need to destroy him before he can do that or all is lost\" Lena said, putting her hand to her face and peeling off her older appearance. Beneath that older skin was the face of Lisa! \"Without her master, Lisa would have lived the rest of her life miserable on that world. She allowed me to take her body and use her life force to power the magic which currently keeps the Old Man trapped. Do not waste time and allow her sacrifice to be for naught\" she said, now in Lisa's voice as her eyes glowed bright purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny was too strong for any of her powers to affect him in his current state, but Jonny knew that Lena knew she had nothing to fear from him. Jonny was already planning how to get revenge on Lena for her actions towards the alternate versions of him and Lisa, but for now he knew that he had to focus on the Old Man that he had in his hands. Jonny closed his eyes and used his power to replicate the power of the demon nearest him, which was now the Old Man. He felt the Old Man's power within him and all of his abilities and suddenly, Jonny knew what he had to do. He placed the crystal ball against Leah's chest and felt a warmth escaping from the crystal ball as a third crack appeared. He pressed it against himself harder now, causing the ball to suddenly enter inside of Leah's skin. He heard the Old Man screaming in pain and then felt a burning sensation throughout Leah's entire body. Leah's skin burnt away as Jonny became a pillar of darkness, combining his increased demonic powers with that of the Old Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena watched as the demonic energy then concentrated itself in one location and formed a human body. It was a male body in his early thirties, wearing a police uniform that was at least a few decades outdated. \"Welcome back\" Lena said, still using Lisa's voice as he stood up and walked over to the newly formed man. \"Do you see the big picture now, master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded, finally understanding everything now that the Old Man's essence had combined with his. Everything had been part of this plan from the start. He wrapped his arm around the possessed-alternate-Lisa's body, resting it on the small of her back and pulling her close. \"Thank you, Lena. And goodbye\" Jonny said as his newly made eyes glowed bright red. Lena screamed as her body disintegrated into magical energy which then returned to Jonny's body. \"I'm sorry, Lisa\" he said as walked in front of the mirror and looked at his reflection.  He concentrated and watched as the policeman's uniform he was wearing changed into a black suit with an overcoat above it and his hat changed into a black fedora. He now looked almost exactly like the Old Man, but decades younger. With his magical powers, he would be able to easily travel through time and to alternate realities while his demonic powers would allow him to take mortal souls and make them like him. When Lena told him about the cycle that the Old Man always went through, she was talking about this. Jonny lived his mortal life and became a demon, only to eventually become the singularity he now was and create himself. Over time, the powers he acquired would get weaker, causing an aged appearance. That would signal the time for this cycle to restart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, man who could no longer be described as a human or a demon but simply an entity concentrated on using his powers to explore different times and realities, creating demons along the way. The circle must continue after all. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere around the time that darkness still covered the city and General Ricks's possessed body lay down in his opulent hotel room, Selina McCarthy huddled in an alley outside an apartment complex and shivered in the cold of the waning night.  The curvy chief's hands rubbed her bare arms as she tried to keep warm but still shivered.  Jonny had placed upon her middle-aged body a sexy black dress that left little to the imagination but plenty to the elements, and Selina was now paying for that decision even though she did not make it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stumbled, panicked, through the alley outside an apartment building somewhere in the city.  \"Dammit!\" she said as she bumped into a garbage can and sent in tumbling, her balance thrown off by the sexy high heels Jonny had put on her.  Suddenly, Selina spied a police cruiser and an army jeep rolling suspiciously down the street together.  She dove behind a rusty old dumpster and lay down on her belly.  She peeked around the corner of the dumpster just barely as the lights of the police cruiser probed about the darkened corners of the alley, illuminating garbage and the occasional scurrying rat.  Sweat formed on Selina's forehead as her heart quickened, but the cars and their accompanying light soon passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to me?!\" Selina said as she clenched her fists and scampered back up from her hiding spot.  She shuffled her way to a flight of stairs and up to the first level, still rubbing her arms to stop the cold from biting at her.  Selina then stumbled like a crazed drunk down a hallway on the second level of the apartment building.  Her heels echoed in the hallway as she headed haphazardly toward the middle of the building away from the balconies on the outside of the building and, rather importantly, away from the prying eyes of passers-by.  There, Selina slowly sank down in a corner where not much light was to be found.  She closed her eyes and tried to get some rest and hoped not to be discovered.  She tried to calm her mind, and this was the first real sleep she had attempted in days.  She needed the rest.  Was all this real?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes of trying to doze off, Selina jumped and her eyes shot open as an apartment door a few feet away swung open.  Out of the room stepped a young boy of about seven.  He had curly blonde hair and an Iron Man set of pajamas.  \"I think I left it out her--\" the boy started, apparently looking for a toy or something of the sort.  The boy's eyes scanned the fairly dark hallway.  As soon as he saw Selina, he jumped.  \"Wha--who--\" he began, his voice shaking as he backed away.  The last thing Selina needed was for this little kid to scream and alert everybody to her presence.  \"Hi there!\" Selina said to the young boy with a broad smile on her face, \"what's your name?\" she asked.  The boy stared at her for a few seconds, probably having been told never to talk to strangers, certainly not scantily-clad ones outside his apartment in dark corners of the building at night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood afraid for a few more seconds before he seemed to relax.  \"My--my name's Tommy,\" he said meekly, \"What's yours?\" Selina smiled.  \"I'm Selina,\" she said as she extended her hand and shook Tommy's.  She'd had to do this sort of thing before.  Life as a cop put her in contact with a lot of kids who just happened to be at the house where a drug bust occurred or perhaps a whore house where some of the hookers had kids.  This was the ugly part of the job, but Selina's younger days--perhaps 15 or 20 years ago--taught her something about dealing with situations like this.  She looked nervously around the hallway and listened intently to the television that was on inside Tommy's apartment.  \"Tommy, are your parents home?\" Tommy shook his head.  \"My mommy's a nurse at the hospital . . . said she's gotta work late 'cause the army men told her she's got to treat the people hurt in the big boom across town . . . Daddy's gone,\" Tommy said as he looked down, obviously missing his father.  \"So you're here all by yourself?\" Selina asked.  Tommy nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was no good, and Selina knew it.  A kid this young shouldn't be home alone ever, and sure as hell not at a time like this.  His mom probably had no choice but to work all the hours she could get--still, this wasn't safe for Tommy.  \"You're a pretty lady,\" Tommy said nicely.  Selina smiled.  \"Thank you Tommy, and you're being such a brave big boy handling things here all by yourself.  Say, Tommy, since you're the man of the house, do you think you would mind doing a pretty lady a favor?\" Selina asked.  Tommy nodded pleasantly.  \"Do you think you could let me come in to your house just for a bit to stay and get warm--I'm pretty cold,\" Selina said.  Tommy thought about it.  He had been told not to do such things, but it was awfully cold, and this woman seemed nice.  \"Okay, come on in!\" he said with a smile as he took the tired police chief by the hand and led her into the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stepped into the apartment and was greeted by an oh-so-pleasent warmth.  Sexy clothes were great, but not in the cold of the night.  Truth be told, Selina had another motivation--she couldn't be out in daylight, and daylight fast approached.  She figured whoever pursued her could be anywhere, or anyone, and the last thing she wanted to do was be visible.  Selina looked about the house.  It seemed like the home of a loving mother who could not be home nearly as much as she wanted.  Pictures of Tommy and his mom were all over the place, but the place was a mess.  There were instructions for Tommy to make his own meals taped to the wall because his mom as unlikely to be home to do it herself.  Tommy's clothes were strewn about, as were a few pairs of scrubs that presumably belonged to his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina heard a noise and let out a slight yelp as she jumped.  Tommy looked at her strangely.  \"It's okay . . . just the microwave with some pizza roles.  Want some?\" Tommy said as he removed the things from the microwave.  Selina had to calm down--what was wrong with her?  She had spent too long as someone else's puppet.  She trusted no one--other than Tommy, at the moment.  \"Um--sure, yeah.  Thanks Tommy,\" Selina said as she walked over and sat down next to Tommy, who kindly allocated half of the pizza roles for himself and the balance for his new friend.  \"So are you?\" Tommy asked.  Selina paused, struggling to understand the question.  \"Oh--you mean my job?\" she asked.  Tommy nodded.  \"I'm a policewoman,\" she said.  Now it was Tommy's turn to be confused.  He looked Selina up and down.  She looked like a hooker.  \"Did you get new uniforms?\" he asked, \"or were you undercover?\" he whispered with a smile indicating he was enthralled by the idea.  \"No, no Tommy I--well, see I'm still figuring that part out,\" Selina said as she tried to put on a brave face.  The two munched their pizza rolls in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a bit of warm food in her belly, Selina thanked her young host.  \"That was a fine meal, young man,\" she said. She leaned back and stretched and yawned.  \"Tommy,\" she began, \"I'm real tired.  Do you suppose that I could rest in your room?\" she asked. Tommy quickly agreed and pointed the way to his room, saying that he would be watching TV.  The morning cartoons would be on soon.  Selina stood up and walked back to Tommy's room.  As she stepped into it, she noted an assortment of Marvel characters adorning the wallpaper.  Action figures littered the floor, and Tommy had Captain America sheets on his bed.  Selina laughed.  It had been a long time since she had slept in such a small bed.  Still, she lay down and pulled the covers over her buxom body as sunlight began to creep through the closed curtains.  She tried to drift off the sleep and enjoy, however tenuously, her control over a body that had not been hers in some time.  At least she could pass some time here.  Who knew when Tommy's mom would return and how she would react, but it was better than being outside and paranoid.            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina slowly stirred from a peaceful and deep slumber to the sound of a voice.  \"Selina?\" asked Tommy as he shook her, \"Selina?\" he said again a few seconds later.  Her eyes fluttered open, and Tommy stood expectantly at the side of a bed that, to be fair, was his anyway.  \"Hey big man,\" Selina said with a smile.  \"Feel better?\" Tommy asked.  Selina nodded.  \"What's up?\" she asked.  \"Well,\" Tommy began, \"my mommy says I gotta ask her before I have milk and cookies, and I want some, but mommy's not here, so since you're kinda a grown-up like my mommy maybe I should ask you--can I have some milk and cookies?\" he said.  Selina laughed.  It was cute that he'd mustered the self-control to ask.  Selina would not have managed that at his age.  \"Sure,\" she chuckled.  \"And can you have some with me?\" he said.  Tommy was clearly lonely . . . he wanted attention, and a kid this age should really have somebody around.  Selina nodded with a smile as she got up from Tommy's bed and headed for the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pointed his new friend to the location of the milk glasses and where his mom hid the cookies, or at least where she put them thinking they were hidden.  Selina got out both and poured two glasses of milk, setting the cookies on the table.  She sat down, as Tommy already had.  \"Do you know how to eat 'em?\" he asked, \"they're oreo cookies,\" he explained.  Selina was pretty sure she knew what he was talking about, but she decided to humor him.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked.  Tommy carefully took the top of the cookie and twisted it off, leaving only the bottom half with the filling.  He then dipped the top half of the cookie into the milk glass and ate it.  He then did the same with the bottom half.  \"My uncle taught me,\" he said, \"I like these cookies 'cause they're the only kind it works with.\"  Selina smiled, trying it herself.  The top half snapped in two as she tried to take it off.  \"That happens sometimes, but you'll get the hang of it,\" he said, optimistic.  \"Well as long as I've got you to teach me, I'm sure I'll be fine,\" she said kindly.  Tommy smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy actually devoured most of the oreo cookies in the container.  Crumbs were scattered around his mouth.  He leaned back with a full belly at the end of the session.  His stomach stuck out a little bit--apparently he could cook, but could not cook healthy food.  His belly was a bit pudgy.  \"Did you like them?\" Tommy said.  Selina nodded pleasantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there came a knock at the door.  \"Open up!  Police!\"  came the familiar call. Selina's eyes widened.  She looked panicked at Tommy.  She hated to drag him into this, but she saw no other choice.  \"Tommy,\" she said in a worried whisper, \"I gotta hide, and you have to tell them you're alone!\" she said, scared as she stood up and tried to scurry off in the direction of his room.  Tommy tilted his head in confusion.  \"I thought you were a police lady?\" he said.  Selina again shushed him, knowing she had to be quiet, \"Just do it!  You gotta help me!  Please!\" she said as she shuffled back and close the door to Tommy's room as quietly as she could.  From there, Selina listened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy got up from the table and went to the door, opening it. \"Hey there little fella,\" said a single male voice that Selina thought sounded familiar, \"what's your name?\"  \"Tommy,\" came the answer.  \"I'm Sargent Grubman,\" said the man.  That was it!  Selina had known this cop for years--good guy, very by-the-book, but always nice.  He was about sixty years old with a white mustache and a bulging, bouncing belly from way too many doughnuts over the years.  Selina never saw him the in the gym.  He was short too--a body that short wasn't made to carry his girth.  \"Are you here all by yourself?\" Grubman asked.  \"Yes,\" Tommy responded.  \"Are you all right?  Do you need anything?\" the officer inquired.  Tommy went on to explain the reason for his mother's absence but also noted the bountiful provisions he had in the house, making sure to mention the cookies he so loved.  Selina stood with her ear agains the door in his room as sweat formed on her forehead.  She hoped he would buy it.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina knelt down on Tommy's blue carpet, her ear on the wooden door that separated her from Tommy Sargent Grubman. There was silence for a few seconds after Tommy explained anything. Selina could mentally imagine the scene outside. Grubman, the old and fat cop, was probably looking into Tommy's eyes with a look of unspoken accusation. That was a common strategy that Selina herself used on more than one occasion to convince younger witnesses to tell her the truth. She also imagined Tommy staring defiantly up at Grubman, not telling him anything. Atleast, she hoped that was what he was doing. Selina could afford to be hopeful about this since there was no sound of a conversation going on out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the silence, Selina looked down at herself, seeing the fine dress hugging the curves of her body. She wished that she could have met Tommy in clothing that was more of her style. even though she always knew that she had a good figure, Selina had always been careful to dress modestly and never flaunt herself around, feeling that such behavior was incredibly unbecoming for someone in her position. Despite the fact that she admittedly loved the way she looked in this dress, it just wasn't her. But then again, she hadn't exactly been herself in a very long time, had she? Memories flashed through her mind, hurting her head a bit. This had been happening regularly since she woke up in the Warehouse. At first, Selina chalked it up to a bad dream from being knocked out, but then they just kept coming. Flashes of things here and there. First she remembered meeting Jonny. She recalled his eyes glowing and then her thoughts changing...did he do something to her, put her under a spell of some kind? As time went on, she remembered more. She remembered a strange man talking to her, and then black smoke leaving him and forcing its way into her. That should have been all Selina could remember, but when Jonny was made to devour Lisa's soul, the emotional stress he was under, caused some sort of psychic bleed over. Selina remembered things that Jonny had done in his body and knew that the black formless smoke was actually Jonny. She also got a little bit of Jonny;s thoughts from when he was in her body, telling her that Jonny was never actually just a kid. He was a powerful demon who enslaved her best friend and then wore her own body like the dress that she was now wearing. Selina clenched her fists. She wanted revenge on this monster for taking away her life and for potentially killing her best friend, but she didn't know how she could do that. Jonny could be anyone right now and she had no clues. All she knew was that she had to get out of this dress and that she had to find a place that she could hide out for awhile and wait things out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Selina's thoughts were interrupted by Grubman's laughing. \"Thanks for the milk kid! Be careful in here. There's a dangerous fugitive on the loose and we're going to need your help to catch her, so stay inside and stay safe. If anything happens, let me know!\" he said as Selina heard the sound of an empty milk glass hitting the table and then the door closes. Selina had been so lost in her thoughts that she didn't even hear the conversation. What had Grubman said to Tommy? Selina opened the door slowly to see Tommy looking up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selina? Are you a bad lady?\" Tommy asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina just knelt down on one knee again so that she could be at Tommy's height. She knew that she wasn't a bad person, but there was no doubt that she had done bad things while her body was under Jonny's control and she certainly didn't currently look like a good police officer. She didn't know how to answer the question right now so she just responded with, \"do you think I'm a bad lady, Tommy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shook his small head. \"I don't think you're a bad lady, but the big man said you were. He said you made that place go boom\" he said, clearly distraught, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina sighed, now wanting revenge on Jonny even more. \"Tommy, I promise you that I did not do anything like that. I'm a good guy, and the bag guy is making me look like the bad guy right now. I'm being framed, like that time when everyone thought Superman had turned evil but he really hadn't. You remember that right?\" She asked, making a reference that she knew the boy would understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smiled a little, feeling reassured. \"Yeah, I remember. Can I help you be good again?\" he asked eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled warmly at the seven year old. \"Right now, all I need is a place to hide and some new clothing. Can you help me with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy nodded. \"My mommy has spare clothes in her room\" he said sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, Tommy\" Selina said, hugging the boy tightly. As Tommy hugged back, something strange started to happen. Selina started to feel dizzy. Her vision was going black. What was happening? Had Jonny found her? Was her body about to be taken over again? Her entire body felt like it was burning apart. Tommy started to get scared and cry. Selina's whole body felt like it was on fire as her skin became replaced by black smoke and flames. Her dress, undergarments and heels fell to the floor in a pile as Selina's entire body was replaced with the smoke which by natural reflex lunged into Tommy's open mouth. The boy's small body shook and choked as the smoke forced it's way all the way down his throat. He fell to the floor unconscious, his body still jerking as the smoke forced itself into control of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Tommy's eyes opened and the boy sat up. \"What happened?\" He asked and then jumped, noticing his voice. He jumped up and then nearly fell back down. something was wrong. His weight distribution wasn't right. He looked down and instead of seeing two large mounds protruding from his dress covered chest, he saw  nothing but the small fully clothed body of a seven year old boy. The dress was on the floor in front of him. \"Oh my gosh...I...I possessed him? Am...am I like Jonny?\" he wondered aloud, getting used to his new voice as he began pacing around the room, just as hyper as a normal seven year old. He had to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy picked up the bundle of clothing from the floor, which was very heavy for his small body, and carried it into his room, hiding it under his bed. With that out of sight, he jumped onto Tommy's bed and looked at his reflection in the mirror. Memories of Tommy's life filled his head, but he also got more flashes of Jonny's thoughts from when the demon had possessed Selina. Suddenly, he knew all about the possession power somehow. Jonny's rage from killing Lisa must have triggered more than just memories to bleed over, but powers as well. Selina could willingly turn her body into demonic smoke and do to others what Jonny had did to her. The last thing she wanted was to steal the life of an innocent child, especially one who had helped her to hide, but this would definitely help her to hide from Jonny and figure out where the demon was. Still, this felt bad...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina stood on the bed and looked into the mirror as the young boy's innocent face looked back at her.  Behind his eyes was the look his young body's world-weary possessor, full of confusion, fear, and angst, and maybe just a tiny bit of solace.  \"I'm sorry little guy,\" she said to her silent companion, \"I can't use you like this . . . cookies and comics ought to be the biggest things you worry about,\" she said.  She jumped down from his bed, sure now of what she had to do.  She ran through the house with the energy of her young, hyperactive host.  She hadn't felt this kind of energy and excitement in over 40 years--since she was a little girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through the house to where Tommy's memories told her she'd find his coat and gloves.  Removing them from the hanger, she threw on his coat, adorned on its back with an impressive Captain America logo.  Selina smiled at her super-hero garb.  Indeed, little Tommy had been her knight in shining armor for these last few hours.  He had graciously offered her a place to sleep and eat, and he believed in her innocence despite just having met her.  Such a thing was rare, she figured.  She quickly threw on his gloves and a hat and darted out the door, motoring her little legs and tiny body down the hall as fast as she could.  She ran past the doors of the other apartments, noting the conspicuous absence of bouncing on her chest, and seeing also that her head came up only about as far as the knobs on the doors, which was quite different from what she was used to.  Selina quickly and haphazardly rounded the corner and began to bound down the stairs, her tiny meat suit breathing heavily as she did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to the next story down and looked down the hallway to the right.  The morning sun cut through the cold sky and peered into the otherwise dark hall.  The curfew was only in effect at night, so most of the building was empty.  Selina could motor around and acclimate herself to this new body in relative solidarity.  She then looked to the left down the other side of the hall, and she saw what she had been pursuing.  \"Well mam, you be sure to give us a ring if that woman does get in contact with you, and make sure to stay in when the curfew kicks in--not safe out there after dark, you see,\" declared Sargent Grubman in a pleasant voice as the person to whom he spoke silently closed her door.  Selina ran up to him.  \"Mr. Officer Man!\" she called out, getting bit of a kick out of the innocence and youth she could not project, \"Mr. Police Man!\" she said as she ran up to the waiting officer and tapped him on the leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrubman turned with a start toward his pint-sized companion, and a smile crossed his aged, jolly face.  \"Well hey there Tommy!\" he said nicely, \"why you look like you've been running--everything all right, little fella?\" he asked as he bent down a bit to take a look at the little boy.  Selina paused.  She wasn't entirely sure how to handle this part.  She'd done it before, but of course that had been accidental--could she do it on purpose?  Selina gulped.  Sargent Grubman cocked his head.  \"You all right?\" he asked.  \"Sorry, Walt . . . I'll give it back.  I promise,\" Selina said as reached out her little hands and placed them firmly on the policeman's blubber-filled mid-section and concentrated.  Within a second or so, the swirling mass of smoke and dust and magic that had become Selina's form began to emerge from Tommy's mouth as his body shook and convulsed.  It was as though the little boy was throwing up, but Selina herself was coming out.  The spasms and jerks continued as Selina forced her way out of the boy, and the black smoke that emerged almost instinctively and automatically made its way toward the waiting, plump officer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust and smoke and sorcery snaked their way up to the cop's mouth as it hung open in amazement at what he was seeing, and then down it went.  Selina forced her way inside the aged cop, his plump, rotund body giving mighty jiggles and bouncing about as she did.  He choked and jerked and gasped as he slowly lost control of his own body.  His soul tried with no success to fight off the invading presence, each battle manifesting in another jerk or gargle that lasted briefly and then gave way that much more of the cop's body to its new owner.  Suddenly, all the struggles stopped, and Grubman's body slumped limply against the wall as Tommy fell with a thump to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina felt strange.  She shook her head and closed her eyes, opening them again only to repeat the process a couple more times--like shaking off a sleep.  She turned her head slowly toward the wall against which she was leaning, and she saw the first sign that something was dramatically afferent.  What she saw was not the dainty, young hand of Tommy, but instead an aged, pudgy hand belonging to a nearly sixty-year-old man.  Little bits of hair stuck out from the calloused fingers as Selina beheld them.  \"Oh my go--\" she began, only to note that her voice was quite deep and hoarse.  She quickly put her hand to her throat to feel a large, jiggly double chin in the way.  Selina slowly stood entirely upright and looked down at herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Selina saw was, yet again, quite different from her expectations.  She was not very far off the ground because Walter Grubman was not a particularly tall man--five feet eight inches, if that.  Still, years of doughnuts and a stressful job had ballooned his belly, and indeed a mighty gut stuck out from his body and strained against the pressed confines of the police uniform.  Selina's new belly jiggled as she stepped, as did a sloppy set of man-boobs that were really just unattractive fat deposits on Officer Grubman's chest.  She took a couple steps and felt her body's odd weight distribution.  \"Well they aren't the boobs I hoped for, but they'll work,\" she said with a smile as she ran her hand over her bald head and grey mustache and looked down at her unfit body.  She slowly turned and looked down at Tommy as he began to stir, moaning a little bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god--Tommy!\" Selina suddenly heard.  She looked in the direction of the noise and saw a woman who probably wasn't any older than 23 or 24 herself.  Selina quickly studied this woman--she had black hair running down much of her back, and she was roughly Selina's height.  She was a little bit chubby--not fat, but with a little extra pouch in her belly and her ass and her thighs, essentially the figure of a woman who probably wanted to keep in shape but whose schedule didn't permit it.  The look in the woman's eyes suggested she was tired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman ran up to Tommy as he lay on the floor.  \"Tommy!  Tommy!\" she said, \"is he all right?\" she asked of the plump sergeant before her.  \"He's my boy,\" she said as she grabbed him from Selina and held him in her arms.  \"Oh yes mam.  Yes indeed, he's fine.  The little tike was running after me to help me probably and, well, he took a little spill and landed wrong--banged his head on the floor as he went down it looked like,\" Selina said.  Even her brief time inside Tommy's body confirmed that this was indeed his mom.  \"I'm Amber,\" she said as she swooned over her son.  \"I'm Sel--I'm ah, I'm Walter Grubman . . . folks call me Walt,\" Selina declared, finding it odd to refer to herself as her host.  \"You know, Tommy and I chatted just a few minutes ago--he's a very nice boy, lots of energy and lots of potential.  You're lucky to have such a wonderful little guy,\" Selina said.  Amber smiled.  \"I know,\" she said, \" . . . just wish I could spend more time with him.  I'm working as an RN and going to school for my BSN.  The money at my job isn't bad, but I work weird hours, and that plus school means I don't get to see my little fella as much as I'd like.  I just have to keep doing it for another couple years and then it'll be done--I'l be able to move us into a nice place and get a promotion so I can make my own hours at least a bit more,\" she explained.  Selina smiled.  This wasn't an uncommon story, the economy being what it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wel best of luck to you and Tommy,\" Selina said, \"will you be working again tonight?\" \"Yes . . . . the explosion freaked everybody out, and they're making us all work overtime in case there's another attack.  We have to be caught up when the next thing happens or we'll start off behind,\" she said.  \"Well I'll make a point of dropping by and checking on the boy before I go home tonight just to make sure he's all right,\" Selina said.  Amber smiled.  \"Thank you so much,\" she said happily.  With that, Selina waddled away, ensconced safely (for now) inside the aging, overweight body of Walter Grubman.  The uniform felt natural, even if this body filled it out very differently from her own.  She thought little Tommy really did need somebody around, somebody to look after him and talk to him--it wasn't good for kids that young to be left totally alone for that long.  Plus, Selina could use the shelter--a place to rest and recharge away from the prying eyes of the whole military and police establishment and whoever Johnny might have possessed or otherwise controlled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina lumbered out of the building and got in the police car, fastening the seat belt tightly around her sloppy middle.  She took a deep breath and looked in the mirror at her host body.  \"I'm sorry, Walt, I really am,\" she said to her vessel, \"I'll get out of you when I figure this thing out . . . you're a good guy, and you don't deserve to be used like this, just like I didn't.  But you're the one I've got, and you're a good guy.  You might even have let me do this if I'd had the occasion to ask you,\" she said to him.  With that, she started up the car and headed off.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina rolled through the streets of the city in silence.  Every foreign, strange jiggle of her bloated body got her attention.  The curfew was not in effect at this hour of the day,--it began at 6--but traffic flow was definitely reduced noticeably.  \"So strange . . . \" Selina marveled in Walt's gravelly but kind voice.  She sifted through her host's memories and found many things she had not expected.  The very idea of combing through the memories of another human being was strange, but she remembered Walt's first baseball game, his high school graduation (which happened around the time she was born), his first sexual encounter, and so many more things.  She could tell how Walt felt about each of these things; it was like reading somebody else's private journal.  Selina assumed that Walt probably could not tell that Selina had possessed him.  She knew Johnny had been inside her, but that was only because she had seen his vessel for long enough for the memories to bleed over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina made her way toward a convention center in town.  The place was right next to a big fancy hotel, and it had become the gathering place for cops who would then be given their marching orders by the military guys who had effectively taken the lead in securing the city and searching for Selina.  Selina pulled his host's car into an unused parking space and turned off the engine.  She got out of the car and took a deep breath, drawing air into Walt's lungs and expanding his aging belly.  \"Here goes nothing,\" she said as she slowly waddled toward the entrance to the great hall where the meeting would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina opened the double doors to the auditorium and beheld hundreds--maybe thousands--of cops as they milled about and talked with one another.  \"Holy shit,\" Selina marveled at the immensity of the crowd gathered before her, \"this place is like the fucking Woodstock of the law enforcement universe.\"  Cops walked about and chatted with each other as a light shone on a lectern at the front of the room.  Presumably the speaker would arrive soon, or at least Selina figured as much.  She wondered who was running the show, who got the spot at the lectern.  This whole situation was so weird--possessed by Jonny and paraded about in sexy clothes with him inside, then turned into a damn fugitive seeking help from a lonely little boy, then shoved unintentionally into the aging body of Walter Grubman.  \"When it rains it fucking pours,\" Selina said to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw a familiar face.  The face was a fairly young and fresh face of a young man she had known in her previous life--when her body was entirely her own and she didn't have to make a puppet of Grubman.  \"Martinez!\" Selina called out to the young man who had been her go-to guy for a couple years now.  Martinez suddenly looked up as he heard his name.  A strange look crossed his face when he saw the source of the greeting.  \"Um . . . yeah,\" he began, confused, \"you--ah, um . . . .\" he said, understandably struggling to recognize his old boss given the new body she wore.  \"Walter Grubman,\" Selina said, introducing herself as the man whose body she wore.  \"Right!\" Martinez yelled out as though it had been just on the tip of his tongue.  Selina came up and enthusiastically shook Martinez's hand.  \"Walt . . . right?\" Martinez said, \"people call you Walt, right?\"  Selina nodded.  She searched her host's memories and found that they two had met only a couple times.  \"Yeah, yeah people call me Walt,\" she said, \"say we got a lot of new folks around here . . . mind if we sit together?\" she asked.  Martinez seemed surprised at the request.  \"Um, sure . . . sure thing Walt,\" he said as he led Selina to a couple of empty chairs and each took one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina plopped Walt's overweight body down upon the wooden chair, forcing it to creak under his girth.  Quiet but persistent chatter filled the room all around the two of them.  \"Weird huh?\" Selina asked Martinez.  He nodded back, \"What have you heard?\"  Selina was desperate for any hint of information about what was going on.  She was used to knowing these things, and being in the dark just made all the other things so much worse.  Martinez leaned in close to the apparent Walt as if to dispense some grand secret.  \"Explosion at the power plant, right?\" he began, \"the President called in the military, and they're fucking everywhere.  The top guy is some big-time general . . . says Chief McCarthy is the one who blew up the place, and we're all supposed to be looking for her,\" Martinez said quietly and seriously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina leaned back in her chair trying to process it all.  All these cops were looking for her!  Thousands of them . . . not to mention all the military guys that had been added to the equation.  She would have to lay low . . . the refuge she had found in Tommy's apartment would be all the more important now, as would this new-found ability to posses other bodies.  \"Do--do . . . . . . do you think she did it?\" Selina asked, trying to gauge whether Martinez had bought into the shit the new higher-ups were peddling.  Martinez immediately shook his head emphatically.  \"No no no I don't,\" he said, \"Chief wouldn't do that . . . gotta be a set-up,\" Martinez said.  Selina smiled from Walt's body.  She was quite honored that the young cop had such confidence in her . . . it was endearing.  \"What do you think, Walt?\" Martinez asked.  Selina shook her host's head a bit.  \"Couldn't say . . . you know her better than I do, but yeah it does seem hard to believe that she would do that,\" Selina said, trying to answer the question the way her host would if his body were his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked around the grand room.  There was an entrance from this grand auditorium into the hotel next door.  A bunch of military guys were guarding the entrance to the luxury hotel, presumably because that was where the top brass from the military were staying.  Suddenly, Selina beheld a strange sight.  A woman walked out of the hotel door.  She didn't look a lot like she belonged in a place like this.  The woman had blonde hair and a fairly toned body . . . probably in her 20s or early 30s.  She wore tight-fitting black clothes--leather, in fact.  The sexy black leather hugged the woman's curves beautifully, showing off a generous chest with boobs that bounced as she walked.  Rather notable also was the fact that this woman was obviously pregnant, and quite so.  Her belly jutted out before her as she walked too, barely held in check by the black leather that tightly hugged her beautiful skin.  Come to think of it, that was the same sort of clothing that Jonny had dressed Selina's body in when he was inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Selina asked.  Martinez looked.  \"Don't know,\" Martinez answered, \"she's been coming and going from the hotel a bunch . . . word is she spends time with the general,\" Martinez said.  Martinez thought some more.  \"Come to think of it,\" he began, \"lot of sexy women seen coming and going from that building . . . chicks in their 30s or 40s with big boobs and wonderful asses--full-bodied women.  Maybe that's what the general likes,\" Martinez said with an unusual tone, which made sense given the subject matter.  \"Speaking of hot ladies,\" Martinez said, \"the Chief?  She's beautiful, I've always thought.  She's a few years older than me, and she's not built like a toothpick, but she's got an ass that demands to be stared at.  One of the best things about having a desk next to her office is getting to see her strut her body right by me in the morning,\" Martinez said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina blushed a bit but tried to hide it.  It was nice to be thought of this way at her age, she guessed, but it was still a bit awkward to hear it.  This was like the ultimate undercover operation, but getting used to what she heard was a bit challenging.  \"Martinez . . . think they want us to pair up to search the city; mind if we patrol together?\" Selina asked.  Martinez nodded happily at the suggestion.               </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny strutted his sexy new body out of the house as he stroked and patted his bloated belly.  He began a strange and lonely walk down the street, passing houses and beholding a strange sight--nothing.  Occasionally, a mother or father would pop out of a house just long enough to grab a kid playing innocently outside, scurry back in, and promptly shut and lock the door.  Jonny smiled as he sensed the mayhem, the fear, the confusion that he had wrought.  \"Your momma did that, little one, yes she did,\" he said with a sick smile to his host's unborn child.  What was once a bustling street filled with townhouses and neighbors pleasantly passing by had become a ghost town because of Jonny.  People fled.  They shut themselves up in their houses.  The strutting, sexily clad Jonny drunk in the erie silence like it was nectar from the gods themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked down the street for a block or two, hearing erie silence that sometimes was sliced open by the loud wail of a siren some place within earshot.  Jonny enjoyed the slow and steady bounce of his host's boobs and her plump, bloated stomach as her entire form strained against the leather in which he had clothed her.  Suddenly, Jonny came to a stop.  \"Well I'll be damned,\" he marveled to himself as he looked across the street and saw a lone gas station chocked full of candy, beer, and, rather notably, a person who seemed to be in a hurry to lock up and go home as she frantically darted about behind the counter of the place.  \"Not so fast, bitch,\" Jonny sad as he headed in the direction of the gas station to play around a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny heard the tiny ring of a bell above his head as he stepped into the gas station.  The attendant at the gas station looked up in surprise.  \"Got the call from corporate to close up for the day at 5 . . . that's only a few minutes away,\" she began, \"so get what you need and then head home sweetie!\" the young woman said as she scribbled some things on a notepad.  Jonny strolled leisurely through the small gas station glancing at pop and candy of various types.  Jonny's host's belly growled loudly.  \"Patience is a virtue, you little fuck,\" Jonny said as he patted his stomach soothingly.  The gas station attendant gave him a very strange look indeed.  Jonny reached down and grabbed a Three Musketeers bar off the shelf and tore open the rapper, beginning to scarf down the sugary confection.  He simply tossed the rapper aside when he was done.  \"Not my body anyway . . . why the fuck would I care,\" Jonny said, casting a short glance in the direction of the gas station attendant, who regarded him suspiciously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas station attendant in question was 19-year-old Marcy White, a college freshman who worked this job when she was not in class simply because she needed the money.  She was a fairly short girl with black hair held back by a headband.  Marcy was a heavy-set young woman whose belly stuck out a bit before her and shook as she walked, straining against her cute pink sweater.  Her arms and fingers too were plump, and her thighs rubbed together has her blubber-filled lower body carried her about rather ungracefully, her tight skirt struggling to contain her girth.  The young Ms. White had a double chin and a plain face save for nose and lip piercings that tended to attract a certain measure of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to pay for that!\" Marcy yelled as she quickly and awkwardly shuffled around the counter and made her way in the direction of the possessed body of Angela Donovan, whose inhabitant had just scarfed down the candy bar and tossed the wrapper aside.  The pregnant woman just laughed as she grabbed for a small bag of Doritos, ripped it open, and began stuffing the cheesy chips into her mouth, leaving powdered cheese smeared about the outside of her mouth.  \"Honey, never get between a pregnant bitch and her food,\" Jonny said with a smile as he gorged on the sweets.  \"I said you gotta pay for those!\" Marcy said, more forceful this time, reaching out and grabbing Jonny's borrowed body by the shoulder.  Without a word, Jonny spun around, his eyes flashing red as his demonic powers welled up within his pregnant host.  \"NO!\" he said as he reached out and grabbed the unsuspecting chubby coed, spinning around and hurling her into the glass doors for the refrigerators at the back of the station.  Marcy flew through the air and slammed into the doors, caving in the glass and knocking over a large number of Cokes and Diet Cokes and such.  The girl had a shocked look on her face as she slid down the broken door, a couple drops of blood visible where she had cut herself on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's eyes returned to their normal color, or at least the color that was normal for Angela Donovan.  He shook his head as if to clear her blonde hair out of his eyes.  \"I warned you, dear,\" he said as he strutted his bloated body toward the young Marcy, who lay limply upon the now-messy floor, \"Don't ever stop me from having fun inside one of my meat suits,\" Jonny said as he got down on his knees and looked into the terrified eyes of Marcy White.  Jonny knelt, his host's bloated stomach and leather-clad body just a few inches from Marcy White's trembling body, over his prey.  He smiled.  \"I think I have plans for you, cutie,\" he said as he set his hands upon Marcy's pudgy belly.  Jonny's host's eyes glowed red, and Marcy's followed suit.  \"I don't like this body of yours much, so you're going to get a new one,\" Jonny began as a plan took shape in his head.  \"This body of yours will transform into that of Brad Wilford, a moderately successful accountant whose life has recently gone terribly awry,\" Jonny commanded as Marcy's body began to twist and reshape itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE BITCH!\" came a sudden male voice screaming at Jonny from up by the counter, and then there came the sudden cocking of a gun.  The red glow faded from Jonny's eyes as he looked up at his new guest.  A look of surprise crossed his face as he looked at the young man with the gun.  He smiled and slowly put his hands up as he stood, leaving the terrified Marcy White on the ground.  \"Hey there you handsome boy,\" Jonny said to the officer who had found him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat officer was 20-year-old Billy Green, a member of the force so new that even Jonny's time inside Selina's body had not alerted him as to who this young man was.  The young and motivated Mr. Green had sought a career in law enforcement all his life and just recently passed the necessary exams that resulted in his assignment to Selina's command.  Of course, given the emergency now gripping the city, one wondered whether it would have been possible for him to pick a more dangerous time to show up.  Green was about five feet seven inches tall with a fairly frail body and thin appearance.  His face was smooth, either because he shaved thoroughly or because he simply struggled to grow facial hair--perhaps some of both.  A thin and nerdy pair of glasses rested upon his nose, and his uniform was the traditional policeman's garb, his shirt and pants very neatly pressed and his belt holding the hole ensemble very close to the young man's small frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat ran down Mr. Green's face, and his eyes were wide with fear.  The gun he had pointed at Jonny shook as tremors besieged the young man's hands.  This was not the sort of thing that one could train for at the academy.  Billy Green had never had to pull his gun in a genuine confrontation; he was like a first-time fisherman who had gone fishing and caught a shark he could not hope to reel in, and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--you criminals nnnnnn--need to learn that an emergency ain't a license for you to do what--what--whatever you please,\" he stammered.  Jonny just smiled as he slowly approached the frightened young man.  \"Do we now?\" Jonny asked with a mocking tone.  Billy Green nodded furiously as Jonny reached up and set his hands upon the cop's gun.  He leaned in closer, host's tongue licking his lips, as he put Green's gun in his own mouth.  He closed Angela Donovan's lips around the cold metal of the pistol and moved the weapon's barrel around inside his mouth, making the whole even look like a sudden, unexpected, and strikingly dangerous erotic display--giving a gun a blow job is not something one sees every day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, a loud sound was heard as all of Jonny's vision went black. A bullet whole was blasted straight through Angela Donovan's head, followed by her body falling limply to the floor in a pile of blood and brain juices. Billy Green looked terrified as he watched the pregnant body fall to the ground with a heavy thud. The gun in his hand was smoking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I'm sorry...I di...didn't mean it...\" he said nervously, tears of regret growing in his eyes. It had all happened so fast for Green that he didn't even realize what he did until the body had fallen onto the ground. He had gotten so scared by the woman's movement that his hand had slipped on the trigger and he had shot her right through the head, killing her and her unborn child instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela's body was laying on her back in a pool of her own blood. One of her eyes was still open and seemed to be staring right at Green. Her mouth was open and suddenly black smoke flew out of her mouth. The smoke travelled fast, smashing through the window of the gas station and flying out into the city. Officer Green looked at it as it flew away with disbelief. It must have been a side effect of his stress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny flew as far away from the station as he could in his smoky form. He was really starting to like it in Angela's body and that idiot of a cop fucked him up. Still, maybe this was convenient. This way, the cops and army would find the woman who was responsible for all this dead. Everything would clean itself up. Jonny flew himself into the corner of a dark alleyway, staying in his smoke form, but condensed near the ground, away from view. He needed time to think and plan and this way he could do it out of sight. Jonny couldn't just stay in this form forever, nor did he want to...he had to find a body to inhabit so that he could go back to causing his chaos. This lead to a few different possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea that Jonny had was that this loss of host gave him an excuse to just ditch this city and be done with it. The place would no doubt be in chaos for awhile after all that he did. Jonny could leave and let the chaos reign. Selina, wherever she was, would think her missing time was just her going crazy, Lisa's soulless shell would probably just die on its own, and both of his meat suits would be dead. Jonny could leave this place and find a whole to place to cause chaos in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Far away, nestled beautifully among the Rocky Mountains, was a town called Snow Creek, Colorado.  The city was located reasonably high in the mountains and had all the trappings one might expect of such a location--most notably vibrant skiing and snowboarding culture.  This place was a vacation spot for well-to-do professionals and their families, and the elevation made for good skiing year-round.  Some people came and stayed in cabins, while others had second homes there.  Owing to the economically affluent population, the town had a blessed bounty of upper-crust department stores, bars, restaurants, any any other facility a wealthy shopper with money to burn might want.  Its education system was second-to-none because of the high property taxes.  Mountain View and Snow Peak educated the community's children during their elementary years, which the local law defined as up through and including the 5th grade.  Grant Middle school absorbed the students after their elementary years, and Glacier Pass High School took them after that.  At least those were the public schools, which were impressive.  Private schools also took on a fair number of students if the parents could afford the fees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow Creek also had a top-tier university called Mason College--a small but extraordinarily well-funded college, not unlike Bowdoin College or Kenyon College.  The place was well-kept and excelled academically in both undergraduate and graduate studies.  Specifically, its Departments of Political Science, Economics, and Foreign Languages drew undergrad and grad students from across the world, as well as renowned faculty from other places to lecture there.  Students and speakers interested in the Middle East and Eastern Europe in particular flocked to the place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the town's many fine restaurants/bars was called The Haven--called so because it was a final respite for many people either before or directly after they set out to climb the treacherous mountain that served as the backdrop for the restaurant.  Perhaps more accurately, that's how the restaurant had started--it had begun as a watering hole/restaurant/triage center for weary climbers back in the 1800s when the town was founded.  The storied nature of the town and the location had turned it into quite a spot, and its owners had capitalized on that such that The Haven was now a rather high-class restaurant complete with fireplaces, a scenic view, and plenty of well-to-do patrons who used the restaurant and bar as a place to let off steam built up during a week's work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Not another one . . . \" lamented Ernie Lane, a heavy set, well-dressed bar tender inside The Haven as his eyes focused on the television.  Ernie was nearing sixty years old with gray hair and a big belly that shook as he walked and that his stretchy paints and white shirt struggled to contain.  His black suit jacket--standard for employees of the expensive and exclusive Haven restaurant--was buttoned in front of him, with the button waging a never-ending struggle against his advancing gut.  Ernie's parents had, when he was a younger man, told him he should be a psychologist, but he had gotten full-time work at the restaurant because an absolutely beautiful woman he was immensely fond of worked there.  She soon left, but Ernie stayed.  Still, he figured that his position as a bar tender made him essentially the cheap man's psychologist.  Ernie's free-flowing spirits and affable nature made him the perfect man to listen to a rich guy who had lost a bit business deal or whose preferred hooker had mustered the will to demand a raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Ernie saw on the TV that elicited his lamentations was a giant swirling mass of white and purple approaching  Snow Creek--the whether channel's way to indicate an approaching storm.  The mountains made storms frequent because whatever weather was in the valley was trapped there.  Clouds ascended to cross the mountains, but thin air made it impossible to hold the precipitation, hence the frequent rain and snow.  This snow would be accompanied by bitter cold and blowing wind in the next couple hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToward the back of the restaurant, a woman struggled and huffed and puffed as she lugged a big black garbage bag toward the door.  \"Want some help boss?\" asked a young woman with a name tag that read \"Kate.\"  The woman with the garbage bag smiled pleasantly.  \"No thanks . . . go help Yana with the dishes, will you?\" she asked.  The young Kate obeyed and headed back into the kitchen.  The first woman lugged the trash bag out into the cold night air, sweat beginning to form on her brow.  She grunted and huffed her way to the dumpster and forced the big black garbage bag into the big metallic monster which read \"Waste Management\" across the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was really something to behold.  Her name was Laura Stanton.  She was 42 years old and stood at about five feet seven inches tall.  Curly black hair cascaded down from the top of her head and descended well down her back.  She had a pleasant face and skin that was just a little bit naturally tanned.  At 42 years old, Laura was not quite the spring chicken she had once been.  Her eyes had just a couple tiny lines around them, and her body in general was very curvy and voluptuous.  Men tended to love this woman's buxom frame, but part of the reason for it was that Laura had picked up a couple extra pounds in her belly and her ass.  Her thighs were meaty, and she bounced about with a set of wide, child-bearing hips despite the fact she'd never had kids.  Laura made a serious effort to stay in shape, but time had slowed its inevitable advance only so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's top was a shiny red blouse that was cut low in the front to show off her impressive cleavage and reveal a tiny bit of the lacy red bra she tasked with holding her considerable bust at bay.  Still, her boobs were so big it appeared they might fall out of her shirt.  They bounced and jiggled as she walked.  The shirt was tucked in tightly, which meant the material hugged Laura's magnificent bust and also that a tiny bulge in her stomach could be noted if one looked closely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants tonight were black like the color of her curly hair, holding tightly to the sizable round ass that stuck out beautifully behind the curvy Laura.  Her hips, thighs and legs were shapely and full.  She stopped at the dumpster, standing there in her shining black high-heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was a woman always on the move.  She had moved to Snow Creek from LA fifteen years prior just a few years after college with the dream of starting a restaurant.  She enjoyed LA but needed a change of scenery.  Upon arriving, she had purchased The Haven with only $5,000 down because that was all she had.  She spent six months living in an old van a college roommate had given her because she could not afford an apartment, showering at the local YMCA while she networked and scrimped to get the restaurant off the ground.  Extensive remodels ate up every dime the place generated and more for months, but eventually the tide began to turn in her favor through a combination of hard work and a determination to do whatever she had to do to make her dream work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward fifteen years, and that determination had not left the ever-so-beautiful woman.  She lugged the trash bag out to the dumpster because it needed done, never mind the fact that she now had 4 restaurants across town and a palatial house on a mountaintop with an indoor pool and all the material comfort she could ever need.  She was not at all adverse to breaking a sweat, and she showed as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, Laura stood outside, her boobs rising and falling slowly under her tight-fitting blouse as the winter wind blew about her.  She looked intently into the vast forest that began where the blacktop ended as the branches swayed in the wind.  \"What the hel--\" she asked herself, presuming some predator lurked about in the vast expanse of forest.  Such animals were around these parts.  Laura gazed intensely into the forest for another minute or two--something had to be there.  All that answered was the cold wind and rustling of leaves as the impending snowstorm moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to turn to head back into her restaurant when suddenly a swirling, writhing mass of black smoke and burning embers and dust lunged out of the darkness of the forest at her.  She opened her mouth to scream, but that was precisely what the mass of dust and magic and death had hoped for.  The swirling mass of dust hurled itself at the terrified woman and began to force itself down her open throat.  Her eyes grew wide with terror as it entered her, and she began to jerk and gargle and spasm, but the black, smokey dust just went into her faster and harder.  Her body shook and jiggled as she began to lose control of it, producing a delightful set of gyrations of her ample boobs and luscious ass.  She tried to scream for help, but only fell upon her knees and over to her side as the last of the blackness entered her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all of the movement stopped as the defeated Laura lay upon the cold, dark ground, her chest protruding out from her curvy body.  Suddenly, her eyes shot open, and a deep and unsettling blood redness filled them.  Laura's body was levitated off the ground as if by some unseen and unknowable force as she body was brought to a standing position.  A smile came across her face as the thing inside her turned to the side, where an old bathroom mirror stood propped up by a brick wall.  Laura's hands--no longer hers--reached up and caressed her belly and her ass, followed by delightfully cupping her boobs and moaning pleasurably.  \"If you'd let the other bitch handle the trash, these would still belong to you,\" Jonny said to his absent host with a naughty smile as he beheld the jello-like mounds on his chest.  With that, he turned around and headed, hips swaying, back into The Haven.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The possessed Laura smiled as she strutted confidently back into the Haven and looked around. Some patrons sat at various tables, enjoying delicious, high quality dinners while others were at the bar drinking away their troubles or having a conversation with the bartender who Laura's memories were telling her was named Ernie. This place reminded Jonny a lot of the Warehouse, only it seemed to cater to a considerably wealthier and more respectable crowd. Like anywhere on earth, there were still criminals and low-lives in Snow Creek, but it was a very different way of life. Unlike the big city that Jonny had previously called home, there was no constant battle here between the police and the criminals. The little knowledge of this topic that Laura had in her head told Jonny that they main crime family in town had connections to almost every institution in the area, which included the local authorities. That meant that as long as they were smart about what they did, they had free reign. It was a very interesting set up and Jonny made a note to try to get his influence into that family somehow, but Laura's limited knowledge just couldn't give him enough information to know how he could go about doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked through the restaurant that he now owned and smiled kindly at the faces that he recognized thanks to Laura's memories. He walked over to Ernie winked at the heavyset bartender, sitting down on the seat immediately in front of where he happened to be standing. \"How's my favorite in-house psychologist doing?\" she asked, making sure to treat this fat fuck with the same respect that the real Laura would give him. Jonny wanted to be careful not to blow his cover, which meant playing the part of his meatsuit for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing great, Laura!\" he exclaimed, pouring his boss a beer. Laura had taken a risk hiring him all those years ago and there was never a second when he wasn't grateful to her for it. He leaned over the bar to whisper in Laura's ear \"lemme tell you, though. Some of these guys have some mighty big chips on their shoulders. Awful lot of stress. Maybe it's a good idea to invest in those strippers I keep suggesting to get them cheered up\" he said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supposed Laura laughed and playfully jabbed his shoulder. \"Ernie, how many times do I have to tell you that the Haven will never be one of those classless joints. We want to actually keep up our high end business\" she said with a smile on her face. In her mind, Jonny actually liked the sound of that. Maybe Ernie here could be made into the first new hire...but that wasn't a thought for right this moment. The last city had taught Jonny many lessons. He certainly did not want to repeat his mistakes. \"Ernie, I need to go to my office and make a few calls to the other places I own. Need to make sure they aren't being burned to the ground by those stand-in managers that I have\" she said, getting up from her seat and pulling down her skirt. While Laura owned several high end bars and restaurants, the Haven was her first and so it was the one where she kept her main office. She ran the others through a selection of stand-ins that she contacted regularly to give orders to. \"Do me a favor. If you see Kate, let her know that I want to have a word with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss\" Ernie said with a smile as he walked over to one of the patrons to refill his drink. Laura grinned as she walked away from the bar and into her spacious office, which had several couches and tables in it. Laura was always an approachable and well liked woman. She enjoyed giving her employees great benefits, so if business was light, she would allow for her office to double as a lounge for employees who were taking a break and wanted to schmooze. Several waiters and waitresses were currently inside, making small talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry everyone, but I need to make a few phone calls and then have an important meeting. Please leave as soon as you can\" she said with a pleasant smile on her face. No one gave a fuss and within a  few seconds the room was empty. the employees were used to this happening fairly regularly and since Laura was such a good boss to them, they never minded having to leave their little lounge, especially since it was only their lounge because Laura was okay with it. Jonny smiled at Laura's reflection in the large mirror on one of the walls. \"So, this is what it's like to be listened to out of love instead of fear or force. It's actually pretty nice\" he said, placing a hand on the mirror and seeing his sexy reflection do the same. It was strange. Jonny was so used to using his demonic powers to demand things of people that he was not used to being truly adored or respected as Laura was. Laura was a genuinely kindhearted woman and that automatically put her in a different category from all of his other meatsuits. Jack was a perverted teenager and Selina may have had an iron will, but she still enjoyed the perks that her job allowed her when it came to giving people orders over doing things herself. Fuck, even Angela Donovan was partly doing her medical research because she thought it would make her famous. From what Jonny could tell, Laura was a good boss because she wanted her employees to have a positive experience working for her. The fact that she had started from nothing made her incredibly humble, willing to take out the heavy trash herself instead of having a worker do it. She reminded Jonny a lot of...himself when he was human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked to Laura's desk and reclined in her leather chair. He closed his stolen eyes and for the first time in a long time, just relaxed and thought about things. Jonny's mind flashed through the events leading up to this moment. In his mind, he saw himself dying and being made into a demon, being freed from that house, leaving his group of fellow prisoners, possessing Jack, warping Lisa's mind, possessing Selina...loving Lisa as Selina...devouring Lisa's soul...Suddenly Jonny felt his stolen eyes tearing up. He reached for a tissue from Laura's desk and dabbed his eyes. He expected to see smudged makeup on the tissue, but Laura's memories told him that she didn't believe in altering natural beauty. Jonny smiled as he continued to relive the past in his head. the Old Man had made him kill the only person that he had ever cared for since becoming a demon. In his anger, he destroyed a good chunk of the city. Then his meatsuit at the time was shot and killed by some idiot of a cop who didn't know how to proper handle his gun. In the shock, Jonny let instinct take over and just flew as fast as he could. And Now Jonny found himself here, in the small town of Snow Creek, Colorado. It was a beautiful area that was so very different from the big city that he had just come from. He was in the body of a gorgeous woman whose tender heart reminded Jonny of his own from so very long ago. He was now rich. Thanks to the clientele of this town and the amount of places that Laura owned, Jonny now had access to more money and nicer commodities than even Lisa would have been able to give him back in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny moved his hands to his chest and cupped his stolen breasts. A smile formed on his stolen face. Was this Jonny's second chance? In this body, Jonny had a chance to lay low and regain his composure. In the city, he tried to do too much too fast. Here, he could take his time and really master his powers. He could make smaller, more meaningful moves in order to spread the perfect amount of chaos in this place. He would teach himself not to repeat the mistakes of the past and while he's doing that, he could figure out how to get his revenge. The Old Man thought that having Jonny kill Lisa would destroy all that was left of Jonny's humanity, but he couldn't have been more wrong. While Jonny's ties to humanity were truly cut while he was in shock, it was now clear that he was still very much himself. He still felt loss for Lisa and he still felt some small need to actually be a good being that Lisa had brought out and that his current body was kindling in him. Of course, Jonny still would have plenty of demonic fun and he'd still enjoy spreading much needed chaos into the world, he now had a drive to free himself from the Old Man's grip. Where Jonny was certainly one of the bad guys, the Old Man was in his own realm. And as a former cop, Jonny felt that he had to be brought to justice for what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the office door. \"You wanted to see me, boss?\" Kate asked from the other side of the door in a soft, unsuspecting voice. Jonny grinned, removing his hands from his stolen chest and fixing his shirt, which had slid down quite a bit. Laura's memories of Kate's interview told Jonny that this young woman was almost 21 years old and studying psychology at Mason. She was a very attractive and sweet girl who Laura had taken an immediate liking to. Of course, Jonny had something quite sinister in mind for her. He may have rediscovered his humanity, but that didn't mean that he wasn't still a demon with his own drives and desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kate. Please come in\" Jonny said with a sinister smile on Laura's face. He licked his lips as Kate opened the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kate stepped through the doorway and closed the door behind her.  Jonny looked her up and down from his own curvy vessel as Laura's body sat sexily in the chair.  Kate was a young college student with a body to die for.  Long blonde hair cascaded down from her head and traveled a chunk of the way down her back.  Tonight, she wore a white button-down blouse with the Haven's logo stenciled into it.  Her boobs stuck out from the front of her body and bounced and jiggled around as she walked.  The rest of her body was equally noteworthy, though less jiggly.  Kate was an avid tennis player, and she played and worked out fairly frequently.  She had the body to show it.  Her abs were flat, and her ass was a beauty to behold, but it was also the sort of toned, muscular ass off which one could bounce a quarter.  Her legs went on forever, and they too were beautifully toned.  Kate's ass and upper thighs were contained by a tight-fitting black skirt that was, like the shirt, part of her work uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, Kate,\" Jonny said.  Kate walked in, looking a bit confused at the relaxed, very not-lady-like posture Jonny had assumed inside Laura's body.  Jonny stood up and began to strut sexily in Kate's direction, his vessel's boobs jiggling a bit as he walked toward her with a devious smile.  \"Yes, I did want to see you, Kate,\" Jonny said as he approached the woman and looked down a bit at her, Jonny's curvy body being a bit taller than Kate's.  Jonny stopped only a few inches away from Kate as the latter looked up expectantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is there something I can do for--\" Kate began as she looked up at her boss's body, feeling a little weirded out by the whole thing.  Suddenly, Jonny reached out and placed his host's hand firmly upon the beautiful chest of the waiting young woman.  Jonny's host's eyes began to glow a familiar red, as a devious, sexy smile spread across his face.  \"There is much you can do for me, little one,\" Jonny said as he leaned in close to the entranced Kate, Jonny's boobs mere inches from her deadened face and empty eyes.  \"But there is also much that I can do for you, and you realize that now,\" Jonny Kate stood motionless, hanging on Jonny's every word.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just begun to notice something, Kate,\" Jonny began, \"and that something is just how ravishingly beautiful I am . . . my body is the stuff of dreams.  My boobs are perfect, and my ass is the stuff of dreams,\" Jonny declared.  \"Dreams . . . \" Kate repeated.  \"You've just begun to notice now,\" Jonny said, \"you've never had these feelings for a woman before, but my god you think I'm beautiful.  What would your mother think?  What would the rest of the world think?  You don't know, but you know that nobody makes you feel the way I do,\" Jonny said.  \"No one . . . \" Kate mumbled.  \"Kate, you're going to go home and see to it that I am invited to your house for dinner tomorrow.  At that time, you're going to try to summon the courage to confess your feelings for me.  You don't know whether you will get the answer you want, but you have to try,\" Jonny said.  \"Have to try,\" Kate responded.  \"Right,\" Jonny said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released Kate from his thrall, and both parties' eyes returned to their normal color.  Kate staggered back a few steps and shook her head a bit, as if shaking off a daze.  Jonny's new programing was slowly forcing its way into Kate's mind, and she needed time to process it all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um . . . is that all?\" Kate asked, confused as hell about what had just happened.  \"It is, Kate,\" Jonny said as the young woman began to slowly make her way in the direction of the door, \"now go home and get some rest . . . you don't quite look like yourself,\" he said with a smirk.  \"Yes ma'am,\" a confused Kate said as she left the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood there a couple minutes pondering the organization he had just begun to build.  He would soon turn Kate into a slave.  She would struggle with new and unexpected feelings that Jonny had put in her mind.  Her world would be turned upside down, and Jonny would be at the center of it all, of it and so much more.  \"The game begins . . . \" he said as his mind raced.       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny smiled mischievously from within Laura's lovely body as he took another bite of the delicious meal that had been made by Kate's family. \"Thank you again for inviting me over, Kate. I don't know what I've done to deserve such kindness\" he said in Laura's sultry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate blushed a bit, looking down at her plate. \"It's my pleasure\" she said shyly. Her tone was one that was very out of character for the usually outgoing college girl. \"I guess I just wanted to thank you for always being such a good boss. And...there's something that I want to say\" she said, finally working up the courage to look 'Laura' in the eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's parents looked at their daughter in a confused manner while Jonny just smiled, meeting the girl's gaze. \"Oh? And what would that be, dear? As long as it's not asking for a raise, there's no need to be so nervous\" she said, placing a hand over Kate's in a gentle, reassuring way. Kate looked around the table nervously. Her parents looked back at her, unsure what she was going to say. Meanwhile, her two younger siblings were hard at work, trying to finish their meal as fast as they could so that they could go back to whatever it was that they were doing. As Jonny looked around the dining room, he couldn't help but feel excited for his future in this small town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's family was one of the wealthier ones in the area. While they were not as affluent as Laura was, they made enough that they were far from poor. The family home was a very modest size, big enough to comfortably fit it's five residents, but small enough to feel cozy. What made the house so valuable was because it was surrounded on all sides by several miles of forest. Behind the house was a lake, which was also a part of the family property. As soon as Jonny had pulled in to the house and saw the deed for the land hanging in the living room, Jonny knew that he would have tremendous use for this family. This home, along with Laura's gigantic home would be his two fortresses. Places where he would be able to ensure his safety and the safety of those that he would make into his loyal slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wealth of Kate's family came primarily from her father, Gerald. Gerald was one of the most successful realtors in the state. He owned most of the real estate in the county as well as several dozen properties throughout the area. Because of this, he was travelling almost every day and made it his business not to rest until a sale was complete. At 50 years old, he knew that he was doing a pretty damn good job about it, but his good Christian upbringing taught him to always be modest. That was one of the reasons that despite their large property, their house was so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald's wife, Joanna, was just shy of 47 years old. She was a heavyset woman who was quick to smile and spent most of her days baking and watching her dramas on the television. Thanks to her marriage to Gerald, she did not have to work a day after graduating from college. Joanna truly loved her husband and her family and was always willing to support the choices that her children made in their lives, provided that they did not come into conflict with her religious values, which she deemed to surpass even her love for her own children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate also had two younger siblings named Kyle and Jenna. They were twins and both were going to turn 17 next month. Both of them were very mature for their age, but that could only mean so much for 16 year olds. As Jonny placed Laura's hand over Kate's, Kate distracted herself from the butterflies in her stomach by watching the two kids continue their eating race. Jonny also turned his attention to them and laughed. \"They're very cute. And so mature for their age...\" he said, smiling then at Kate's parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna smiled proudly. \"We do our best to raise them well and instill good values in them. I do hope that our Katherine hasn't been showing you anything contrary to that\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate became bright red, this time not because of Jonny. \"Mom, you know how much I don't like being called that!\" she said, always having hated her full name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just continued smiling. \"Of course not! Kate has been one of my best employees. She's so modest and smart\" Jonny said. Laura's memories told him that Kate had always made sure to dress modestly, no matter how the weather outside was. Jonny knew he'd have to change that soon. No slave of his would be doing that. \"Honestly, I never quite figured out what a girl like her was doing working at my Haven\" he said, wiping his mouth with a napkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our family rule is that no child of ours can go to college without working. It teaches them how to be responsible and earn their livelihood\" Gerald said, smiling. \"We think it's done a good job with our Katherine so far and it'll no doubt do wonders for these two hooligans\" he said, motioning to the twins, who were actively ignoring the grown-up talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. He himself had been raised in a family with a very similar dynamic. Of course, such a dynamic was far more typical in the generation he was raised in than it was in this modern one. Some part of Jonny deep inside was actually glad that families like this one still existed. At the same time, another part of Jonny couldn't wait to alter everything about these people and bring them into his world. \"Well Kate has certainly been well loved by everyone. Especially me\" he said, winking at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear\" Joanna said, and then looked at Laura's hand still on her daughter's. \"Would you mind giving our daughter some space?\" she asked, causing Kate to blush even more. She had clearly been enjoying the physical contact with the woman that she assumed to be her boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Jonny said, removing her hand. He then looked over at Kate. \"Anyway, what did you want to say, Kate?\" he asked, knowing that Kate would be unable to resist the programming that he had put in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's blush intensified as she stood up so quickly that the chair she was sitting on fell backwards onto the floor. \"I...\" she said, her voice cracking from the nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on dear. Say what you're thinking\" Jonny said, his eyes glowing just gently enough for Kate to see and for her programming to intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's own eyes took on a very slight red glow. Filled with confidence, Kate said proudly \"I love you, Laura. I've been infatuated with you since my first day on the job. You make me feel like no one has ever made me feel before. You are the woman of my dreams!\" she  just before leaning across the table and kissing the possessed Laura passionately. Jonny smiled and kissed the gorgeous young woman back, listening to the gasps from around the tale. Kate's family was clearly sicked by what they were watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the heaven's name are you doing, Katherine?????\" Gerald asked, standing up and looking very angry at his daughter. Joanna was practically crying from the horror of what she was witnessing. Meanwhile, the two twins were just watching curiously. They had never seen something like this before in their relatively short lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny pulled away from Kate, much to her dismay. He then smiled evilly as his eyes glowed brightly red. \"<span class=\"clred\">Kate is mine now. Soon, she will be entirely under my power. And so will all of you</span>\" Jonny said. His own demonic voice was the one leaving Laura's lips. Jonny laughed as invisible energy bound all those around the table except for Kate. Everyone struggled, but no one was able to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" Kate asked, shocked by what her boss was able to do. Jonny smiled at her evilly. Jonny placed his hand on Kate's head. Her eyes glowed bright red as she stiffened up. Kate's parents watched in horror as this happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled evilly as he thought about what to do now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny walked sexily around behind Kate, keeping his hand upon her the whole time and thus keeping the young woman enthralled.  When Jonny was directly behind Kate, he reached his hands around to her front and began to massage her wonderful breasts.  He grabbed Kate's generous, jiggle-prone boobs and squeezed, forcing a wonderful, sex-soaked moan from the young woman's lips.  Jonny leaned down and rested his chin on Kate's shoulder, speaking sexily right into Kate's ear.  \"Your body belongs to me now, my dear,\" Jonny began.  \"Body . . . yours,\" Kate said as her knees quivered and her voice shook as sexual pleasure rocked the body of which Jonny was taking control.  Jonny left one hand on Kate's left breast as the other snaked its way around,caressing Kate's every sexy curve as Jonny brought his hand to rest on Kate's ass, to which he gave another squeeze.  \"You'll give me a fuck when I want.  Your belly may carry my children,\" Jonny said as he looked down at Kate's stomach, \"your lovely little ass belongs to me,\" Jonny declared.  \"Fuck . . . belly . . . ass,\" Kate said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny glanced up from Kate as his reddened eyes spied Kate's family, particularly her mother and father.  \"Sorry to be telling you this, but this sexy little woman never belonged to you, but I do thank you for getting her good and fuckable for me,\" Jonny said with a laugh.  Suddenly, Jonny took Kate's cute little body and spun her around, pulling her close to him and into a passionate kiss.  Kate moaned with pleasure as Jonny reached down and grabbed her ass while her conservative family looked on in horror.  As Jonny pulled away from the kiss, he leaned over to the entranced young woman.  \"Dance for me,\" he ordered, and so Kate began a sexy dance that brought wonderful bounces from her chest as Jonny reached up with his own female hands and delicately removed her top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kate danced provocatively for her entranced family, Jonny turned his attention to Kate's mother.  \"Joanna, we need to have a chat,\" Jonny said as he sauntered over and sat down at an empty chair next to the heavy-set woman of 47 years, \"we need to talk woman to woman . . . I am a woman, at least for now,\" Jonny declared with a sly smile.  Joanna looked on, still in a kind of magic-induced haze.  She did not move, nor did she have a particularly expressive look on her face.  In her eyes, though, was a look of sheer terror.  She was unable to move, rendered a prisoner inside her own body.  Her daughter had been enslaved before her very eyes, and she'd become a thing Joanna could not recognize.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up, honey,\" Jonny commanded, and Joanna stood silently.  Jonny looked her up and down.  Joanna was, as noted, a woman of 47.  She had long dark hair and a large set of breasts dangling from her chest.  She was too conservative to show them off.  In fact, Joanna was big--kind of in general, really.  She had an impressive bust, but her belly was fairly soft, and her whole body was quite pudgy, having been acquired over years of staying at home, giving birth to and raising three children, and baking (and eating) her own confections.  It wasn't that she was not pretty, but here was a bunch of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a big, sexy bitch, aren't you?\" Jonny said with a smile as he reached out and smoothed some wrinkles on Joanna's blouse and set his hands firmly upon her shoulders.  \"Your daughter belongs to me now,\" he declared as he stepped closer to the entranced woman, the two sets of boobs beginning to touch as dirty thoughts raced through Jonny's mind.  He smiled as he wrapped his arms around the heavy-set but pretty woman and pulled her close.  He reached around behind her and grabbed her generous behind, and a moan escaped Joanna's lips.  She was turned on, as much as she hated to admit it.  \"Part of you likes this . . . you've been repressed for years.  Don't fight it,\" Jonny instructed, \"I'll help,\" he said as his eyes turned red, and Joanna's followed suit.  After a few seconds, though, Jonny's eyes stopped glowing before he had really done anything to Joanna.  \"I just had an idea,\" Jonny declared as though something had just hit him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced across the table, past Kate's sexy dancing to her also-entranced younger brother Kyle.  Kyle was a boy of nearly seventeen--a skinny little guy with nerdy glasses and curly hair.  His body type was quite different from his mother's.  Jonny sauntered sexily over to Kyle, his hips swaying from side to side as he removed Laura's revealing shirt, exposing his own wonderful chest as his boobs jiggled a few small inches from the entranced eyes of the young man.  \"Do you like these, Kyle?\" he asked with a smile, \"I got them because I like them,\" Jonny declared in referenced to his host's boobs.  \"I'll bet you would like a set of your very own, wouldn't you?\" Jonny asked.  Jonny leaned into Kyle, and he could hear the young man's breath speeding up--a lot.  Kyle was trapped in his body like Joanna was . . . he was clearly turned on (who wouldn't be?).  In a house like this, that meant his mind and body were being showered with feelings he had not often confronted before. He didn't know how to handle it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny rested his hands upon Kyle's shoulders, smiling sexily at him.  \"You do want your own set of boobs . . . I bet I can help with that,\" Jonny declared.  With that, Jonny simply snapped his fingers.  Suddenly, Kyle's skinny little body began to shake and spasm, just as Laura's body had done when Jonny forced his way into it.  Joanna's did the same.  Her wondrous chest and pudgy belly shook and jiggled too.  Suddenly, a small pearl of shining white light emerged from Joanna's mouth as her body stayed essentially frozen.  A similar ball of light emerged from Kyle's mouth.  The souls of mother and son left their own bodies, each traveling through the air in the dining room and toward the empty vessel that was the body of the other.  Suddenly, Joanna's soul forced its way down into her son's body, causing it to spasm and jerk as it fell to the ground with a heavy thud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked down and smiled.  He bent down on all fours and straddled Kyle's body, which Joanna now inhabited.  \"I know you're in there, Joana,\" he began, \"your going to have fun in that body . . . make sure to enjoy Kyle's dick.  Find some hot woman to stick it into,\" Jonny said, \"your delicate motherly sensibilities won't like it too much, but your new body's hormones will end up running the show . . . part of you may even get to like it, even though you know you shouldn't.\"  Jonny looked down at the unconscious body of Joanna as Kyle's soul became accustomed to its new home.  \"Hope momma's boobs will do for now, Kyle,\" Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny then repeated the same process with Jenna and Gerald.  All of the males in the family had now been shoved into female bodies, and all of the females were inside men.  Only Kate was left inside her own skin.  Jonny put a stop to her dancing as all four of the other family members lay on the ground, soon to awaken inside bodies not their own.  Jonny smiled down at them.  \"Let the fun begin,\" Jonny said.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny smiled as he looked at the watch on his stolen wrist. Laura's memories told him that this golden watch was a gift to her from her father and that she wore it every day in his memory. I happened to be a very nice watch, so that was a tradition that Jonny did not mind keeping for the woman who's body he had stolen. \"Oh my, it's getting late. Maybe I should retire for the evening and see my new abode\" he said aloud, wanting to hear his sexy voice. Jonny walked outside of Laura's office and pulled out her keys from her purse, locking the office door. He then walked over to Ernie. \"Ernie, I need to head home a bit early. I'm really not feeling like myself tonight\" Jonny said, trying his best to hide a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErnie nodded with a look of understanding on his face. \"No problem boss. I'll make sure to lock up. Feel better\" he said, trusting his boss completely. The supposed Laura smiled and pecked Ernie's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best!\" she exclaimed, before heading out of the restaurant. Ernie's face became bright red as Jonny walked out of the Haven and over to the car that his memory was telling him belonged to Laura. It was a very nice looking red sports car. \"Mmmm, someone liked to show off her money\" he said, opening the door and sitting in the fancy car. Laura was an extremely kindhearted woman, but coming from the bottom like she did, she enjoyed to flaunt her wealth when it suited her. It was because of that that she had such a nice house and several nice cars. The fact that she had been so focused on setting up her businesses that she never had time to settle down and start a family ensured that Laura never had to spend money for anyone other than herself. Because of that, she could afford to live the high life in a few key areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sped off into the city, firmly enjoying himself. The real Laura had been a stickler for following the law, but Jonny wanted to enjoy his life. Once he was already half way to his new home, he heard the familiar police sirens behind him. \"Well, so much for taking things slowly...\" he said with a grin on his beautiful face as the police officer exited their vehicle and stood outside of Laura's car. Jonny rolled down the window and was face to face with a young police woman with long black hair. She looked to be around the same age as his current body, maybe a little bit younger or older. she was very good looking with an athletic figure and a rack to die for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, do you have any idea how fast you were going?\" The police woman asked with a stern voice. She took out her ticket book and a pen from her breast pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny put out one of Laura's best smiles. \"I'm sorry, officer. I must not have been paying attention to the speed limit\" he said, batting his eyelashes. \"I promise that I won't do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop lady was having none of it. \"I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm afraid that you're going to need to come to court\" she said as she began to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny shook his head. \"I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand. I'm trying to lay low and you're ruining my chances, bitch\"  he said, clearly in a bad mood. This police woman reminded him of Selina, which in term reminded him of Lisa, which made Jonny angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer chuckled and continued to write. Clearly she was used to being told off by people who she pulled over. Jonny reached out his host hand and placed it around the officer's wrist. The officer found herself in a vice grip so tight that she actually dropped the pen that she was writing with. Jonny's stolen eyes immediately glowed red as the officer's followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Jonny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Brenda Nelson, mistress\" the entranced officer responded, in a monotone voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Brenda, you happen to have gotten me in a particularly bad mood. Granted, that isn't your fault, but I'm now very angry. I want you to forget about writing me this ticket. In half an hour, I want you to meet me at my house. We're going to discuss your new future\" she said, letting go of the officer as both women's eyes returned to normal. \"See you soon\" he said with a sexy smile and wink before rolling up her window and speeding away. Within a few minutes, the car pulled into Laura's estate. Jonny smiled as he looked at it. The house might as well have been a palace. It was nearly double the size of Lisa's house. \"Home sweet home\" Jonny said as he opened the door to his new residence and walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Billy Green stood as steadfastly as he could, but he was shaking like a brittle leaf in a windstorm.  Jonny removed the gun from his mouth after a few seconds, smiling erotically at Green.  \"Like that little fella?\" he asked.  Jonny and Green stood there, eyes locked for a few seconds.  \"R--r--radioed to base already.  They'll be here soon,\" Green declared.  Jonny's face took on a look of mock pain.  \"Now why did you have to go and do that?\" he asked.  He then smiled a bit.  \"Not to worry . . . we can still spend some quality time together.  I've got something new in mind,\" Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny quickly closed the distance between himself and the ever-so-nervous Billy Green as he leapt the few feet through the air that separated them.  Angela's Donovan's pregnant body flew through the air and toward the unsuspecting, dumbstruck officer.  Angela's body disintegrated into the familiar trails of whipping and swirling black smoke that forced their way into Billy Green's mouth and down his throat.  Green shook and spasmed and gargled as the demon-possessed woman forced her way inside him.  He gargled and writhed about.  As a reflex, the young man fired off his gun several times, putting several bullet holes in a Pepsi display and a nearby window and eliciting further screams from Marcy White as she lay paralyzed on the floor hearing sounds of struggle and chaos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few seconds, the shots stopped.  So did Billy Green's struggling.  The officer's hat had fallen off in the struggle, and he slowly put his arms down, his body now with a new occupant.  Green's body had undergone other changes too--new, different ones.  Green's eyes were a strange color, a sort of mix of green and red.  Sweat still poured down his face.  He had the look of a man who had been through hell, like he had just stayed up for a week straight with no rest.  He dropped his gun, the weapon clanking to the ground with a metallic ping as it fell from his hand.  Green looked around through tired, run-down eyes.  The most notable thing about him, though, was his stomach.  Moments before, Green had been a young man who was thin as a rail, perhaps owing to a combination of a skimpy diet and unfavorable genetics.  Now, however, his waist and belly were distended--jutting out from the rest of him to the point of causing some small rips in his tightly worn police uniform, exposing the skin of his stomach.  It was almost as though Angela Donovan's pregnancy had survived Jonny's jumping into Billy Green.  The young man looked down at himself, his eyes suddenly growing wide as his mouth hung limply open.  The belly scared him too--that hadn't been there a few second ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly took a couple slow steps toward Marcy White, who still lay paralyzed on the tile floor of the gas station, blood slowly dripping out of her as the broken glass crunched under Green's shiny black shoes.  \"M--mam wha--whas.  Awwww,\" Green said, struggling to verbalize his thoughts. \"Mamwasyour--wasyourname?\" he said the newly bloated, pudgy officer looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his eyes glowed a bright red, and he put his hand to his head as if to ward off a sudden and intense pain.  \"Not so fast, you little fucking do-gooder!\" spat out the young officer, his voice a mix of his own, Jonny's, and Angela Donovan's.  He suddenly turned around and waddled, the new weight in his belly slowing him down a bit, away from Marcy White.  \"The cops have to find somebody, and you're it!\" Green said as Jonny battled the young man whose body he had just taken as his own.  Green's face contorted into a sick smile.  \"Now why don't you buckle up and let momma take over?\" he said as his eyes glowed a bright, intense red yet again.  Green's eyes closed as more changes overtook his body.  What had been short brown hair sprouted into long, sexy blond strands that dangled from his head and ran down his back.  Green's face softened and thinned out even more than it was before, taking on a decidedly feminine shape.  Farther down, his arms thinned out, and his hands lost what little tiny hairs they had as his fingers thinned out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips cracked and expanded, jutting out into a wide set of motherly, child-bearing hips.  His thighs and ass plumped up too, and the moaning, which had been doing on during the whole transformation, became far more womanly as Billy Green's voice changed over the course of only a few seconds.  His bloated belly jutted out further, seeming now more tight and beautiful than sloppy and an afterthought, like before.  Suddenly, two big, pillow-like mounds of flesh forced their way out of the man's chest, as beautiful boobs seemed suddenly to find him and plop themselves wonderfully down upon him.  The person who stood there was now fully and properly a double of Angela Donovan.  The former Billy Green simply collapsed to the floor, his pregnant stomach protruding up from the rest of him as his eyes fluttered and he looked down in horror at the female body that was now his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned around and looked with a smile into Billy's eyes.  He bent down and laid his hand upon Billy's bloated stomach as his eyes glowed red.  \"Your name is Angela Donovan, so you better start acting like it little Billy,\" he said, \"you know . . . this didn't have to happen if you hadn't radioed in, but it essential now--the cops have to find somebody, don't they?\" Jonny said deviously.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny was suddenly distracted by the wail of sirens and the flashing of red and blue lights nearby.  A look of disappointment crossed the face of Jonny's curvy host.  \"Oh well drat,\" he said, his sexy, curvy exterior taking on a sort of pouty appearance like a little girl who had just been denied candy, \"big mean policemen have to come and ruin all my fun,\" Jonny said.  He turned and beheld the body of Marcy White spread across the floor, still under the thrall of Jonny's magic.  \"I was hoping I could make you my plaything,\" he said, crestfallen, \"but I guess it was not to be,\" Jonny said.  Suddenly, Jonny disappeared in a familiar puff of black smoke, his pregnant host body gone in the blink of an eye as it carried his essence across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's brief time inside the body of the young Officer Billy Green had not been fruitless.  The memories of the young Mr. Green were an open book to the spirit that had possessed him.  His childhood, his first sexual encounter, his family history, his favorite band--all these things lay before Jonny when he entered his host even briefly.  One recent memory swirling about in the officer's mind was a radio transmission he had heard in the police car on the way to the gas station.  Apparently, some guy named Officer Grubman--a man Green had met only briefly--had radioed that he suspected something fishy at an apartment building across town.  A young tike named Tommy had been home, ostensibly alone, but Grubman had thought the missing Selina McCarthy might be hiding somewhere in the neighborhood.  Apparently the young boy seemed shifty when Grubman talked to him, and he asked for permission to return to the apartment later that night in hopes of catching the suspect--the former Chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smoked back into existence in the darkened corner of an apartment building across town.  He glanced around from his obscured perch.  \"Well at least this looks like an apartment building, sort of . . . \" Jonny said to himself as he looked around.  It was the middle of the day, and normally people would have been coming and going from lunch or scurrying home to make sure the babysitter had things under control, but none of that now--it was dead quiet.  A smile spread across Jonny's face as he reached down and rubbed his bloated belly.  \"Your mommy did that--yes she did!\" he said, using a voice that parents often used to playfully talk to young children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stepped out from the corner, strutting sexily down the shiny tile floor as his motherly hips swayed from side to side.  He summoned up the fragments of Green's memory that he could still access, being no longer in Green's body.  Grubman's radio message had described the boy as young and wearing superhero pajamas with curly hair.  That was at least a place to start.  Jonny ascended the stairs of the building, coming to the top and looking down a cavernous hall.  \"Here little fella,\" he called out playfully.  If this kid could tell him where Selina was, then he could get back into her body and exert the kind of control over this town he'd been accustomed to.  All the doors down the hall seemed closed, and Jonny strolled down the hall to the muffled sounds of frantic newscasts as the people locked up inside their apartments were watching.  The calm was erie.  For Jonny, it was the sound of victory, yet just the start of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by as Jonny reached for fragments of the now-absent Green's memory for clues, but none came.  \"This body has its advantages,\" Jonny said looking down at his bulging chest, \"but I need to find this fucking kid,\" he said, exasperated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny heard three strange noises from behind him.  \"Bang!  Bang!  Bang!\" called out a young-sounding voice.  Jonny spun around quickly, his borrowed boobs lurching about as he did so.  As he brushed some shiny blond hair out of his eyes, he beheld a small boy at the other end of the hallway.  Squinting, Jonny could see that the young kid seemed to be pretending that his outstretched fingers were a pistol, as so many kids do playing cops and robbers as children.  Jonny smiled as memories of his own childhood briefly drifted into his mind.  He began to walk toward the boy and squinted his eyes a bit to keep the blinding sun out of his field of vision.  As he approached the boy, his features became clear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy seemed to be about seven years old, and a somewhat unruly puff of curly blonde hair adorned his head.  He was small in stature, as his age would suggest, but he was a wee bit pudgy around his belly, probably from too many sweet, sugary foods.  He wore a set of pajamas modeled after an Iron Man suit, complete with the cloth made to look metallic red with bits of gold plating here and there.  As Jonny approached, Tommy regarded him with a certain measure of apprehension.  \"Hi there!\" Jonny said, a wide smile spreading across his host's face.  Tommy stepped back a little bit and looked the possessed body of Angela Donovan up and down.  The leather hugging her every beautiful, sexy curve revealed an erotic beauty that was, of course, lost on the little boy.  He didn't know what to make of it.  \"Um . . . hi,\" he said pensively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Jonny asked.  Tommy paused again, seeming unsure about whether answering was a good plan.  After a few seconds, he seemed to have decided.  \"Tommy,\" he said, \"my name's Tommy.\"  This was the kid!  Jonny had found him!  He could lead her back to his Selina body, but he figured he should play it cool for now.  \"I'm Angela,\" Jonny said as he Tommy's little hand, \"what are you doing out here all by yourself?\"  Tommy responded enthusiastically, \"I'm helping the police get the bad guys that they say are everywhere,\" he declared, nodding profusely.  Jonny smiled again.  \"I'm sure you are, a big boy like you,\" he said with a smile.  Tommy smiled back.  \"Say,\" Jonny began as he bent down on his knees and put his host's head at about the level of Tommy's, \"do you suppose you could help me with something?\"  \"Sure,\" Tommy said.  \"I'm looking for a friend of mine,\" Jonny explained, \"it's a lady, a grown-up lady with dark hair and dark clothes, sort of like mine,\" Jonny said.  Tommy looked deep in thought for a moment, as though he knew who Jonny was talking about but didn't want to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This grown-up, ah, well she took my . . . my--,\" Jonny searched for the metaphor, \"my costume,\" he declared confidently, having found an interesting, kid-friendly way to refer to the curvy body of Selina's that was so recently his.  Jonny smiled at Tommy.  \"You know, I don't think she meant to do anything bad, but yeah, she has my costume, and it's the costume I need to stop the bad people,\" Jonny declared.  Tommy was mulling it over.  \"Tony Stark wouldn't be much without his Iron Man suit, would he?\" Jonny pushed, \"us good people sometimes need costumes,\" Jonny said.  Tommy began to nod.  It was working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H--her name's Selina.  She's my friend . . . says she'll be back tonight after my mom's gone,\" Tommy said, finally giving up the pearl Jonny needed.  Jonny beamed inside his sexy host.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, get back inside.  What have I told you about running out at times like this?\" came a female voice.  Jonny looked up at a woman who shuffled quickly out of an apartment, rushing toward the small boy.  This woman wore a set of scrubs that concealed her figure a bit, but Jonny could tell her boobs were impressive--not as much so as Selina's, but impressive still.  Curly dark hair cascaded down from her head, framing a face with a pleasant smile.  Her face and body seemed a bit pudgy.  This woman seemed like many working mothers--a bit out of shape because she didn't have the time to exercise and eat right, though she tried.  Her boobs and ass jiggled adorably, however.  This woman beheld Jonny with substantial reticence.  \"Um, hi . . . .ah--I--I'm Lauren,\" she said, sticking out her hand to greet the hooker-like woman talking to her young son.  \"I'm Angela,\" Jonny answered as a plan formed in his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes turned red as he shook Lauren's outstretched hand, and he reached down and touched Tommy on the shoulder at the same time.  Jonny smiled as the two new companions fell totally under his thrall there in the hallway.  \"Wonderful to meet you both, but now I'll have to insist we head inside.  Tommy and Lauren turned around without a word and headed into the apartment.  Jonny followed behind them, and then he closed the door.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny grinned from inside Angela's body as she locked the apartment door. Her two newly acquired helpers walked to the table that was in the apartment's kitchenette and sat down quietly, waiting to be told what to do next. Jonny strutted his sexy body to the table as well and sat down in the empty chair between the mother and son. \"Why don't you get me some food, Lauren? I'm starving and a soon-to-be mother like me has to eat for two\" Jonny said, putting a hand on his pregnant stomach and grinning evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mistress. What would you like?\" Lauren asked, getting up from her chair and walking over to the fridge, opening it up and looking around at what she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Angela chuckled and looked at Tommy, who was sitting down quietly, eyes facing forward with a blank expression on his face. This was probably the first time in a very long time that the kid wasn't running and jumping all over the place. \"What's good in this joint, kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the Coco Puffs\" Tommy said, prompting Jonny to laugh. He hadn't eaten cereal since he was alive. \"Get me a big bowl of Coco Puffs!\" she yelled to Lauren, who closed the fridge and walked over to the closet where she kept all of Tommy's favorite cereals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked back at Tommy and smiled, placing his hand on the boy's forehead. Suddenly, the life came back to Tommy;s eyes and he looked around, scared. \"How did I get back inside?\" He asked, jumping from his chair and looking at his mother, who walked back to the table and put the cereal in front of her new mistress, who licked her lips and took a big spoonful into her mouth. \"Mommy? Are you okay?\" Tommy asked, running over to his mother and hugging her leg, but not getting any response from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mommy can't hear you right now Tommy. I had to use my powers on her\" the possessed Angela said with a grin as an idea formed in her head. Suddenly, Angela's body began to shift and change. Her tight leather clothing became a grey suit with a white dress shirt. Her feminine body aged significantly and became masculine, with her pregnant belly receding into her. Finally her hair retracted into her head and a black and red tie appeared on her shirt with an X logo on it. \"Do you know who I am, Tommy?\" The now bald man asked in a British accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor X!\" Tommy exclaimed with a smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny, in the form of Patrick Stewart, grinned and nodded. \"That is correct Tommy. I apologize for the form I took before, but I had to hide who I was so that the bad guys would not find me. I need help that only your mother and yourself can give to me\" he said, getting into character. \"Selina McCarthy, the woman who you said will be coming back today, is actually an evil mutant who wants to capture you and your mother for evil purposes. I am going to protect the two of you, but I need you to tell me everything that you know about her first. Please tell me how you came about her\" he said. Sure, he could have easily just gotten this information out of the mind controlled boy, but this was a lot more fun. Besides, this way the kid got to meet one of his comic book heroes in person. Jonny had been a comic book fan back in the day and saw a lot of himself in this kid for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy related the story of how he was playing and Selina had found his house. Tommy took her inside and hid her in his room, lying to the face on Officer Grubman in order to protect the woman who he had befriended. Selina had been coming over and hiding out whenever Tommy's mother wasn't home, and had been leaving shortly before Lauren came back, leaving her oblivious of the stranger spending so much time with her son. Tommy explained how Selina was talking strangely and seemed to remember bits and pieces while she was possessed by Jonny. He even said how Selina talked about being on the run from a demon during a nap she was taking once. Tommy also said how Selina would be back tonight as soon as his mom leaves for work. Jonny smiled and patted Tommy's head. \"Thank you for that information, Tommy. You'll make a great X-man one day\" he said with a grin as his eyes glowed red. Tommy's did the same as the blank look once again took over the child's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's body shifted back into it's proper form as the demon looked at his enslaved mother and son pair. At this point in the game, there was no point to stay in the body of Angela Donovan. She had outlived her usefulness to him and it was only a matter of time until the authorities find out that it was her who blew up the lab. The top priority right now was getting back into Selina's body. That was where Jonny was most comfortable, having spent so much time in it already and was also where he would be able to wield the most power, once he explained away all of her suspicious behaviors. Clearly Selina was scared for now, knowing that there was a higher power that had been playing around with her life and this town. She was definitely scared of going back to her old job out of fear that the entity that took her over was waiting for her to show herself. She had no idea that she had just been found and that this game of hide and seek was now over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's best bet for now was to send Angela away and use either Lauren or Tommy directly. The only question left at this point was which of them to take over and which of them to just keep enthralled. It didn't take much to say that Lauren was the preferable body to be in. She was older and attractive enough that Jonny's stay in her would be enjoyable. Jonny already knew how to operate a body like that, so it wouldn't take long to get used to being in her driver's seat. On the other hand, Tommy was Jonny's direct link to Selina. If he took over the kid, then Selina would come right to him, he could gain her trust and play with her before revealing who he is and taking back HIS body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked back and forth between the two options in front of him, finally choosing that he would possess... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie\u2019s levity broke the silence.  \u201cPut on a bit of weight, big guy?\u201d she asked with a chuckle, motioning to Jonny\u2019s vessel\u2019s swollen belly.  Jonny said nothing, and he pondered more.  \u201cI have an idea,\u201d Jonny said flatly, and his possessed vessel disappeared in a puff of smoke.  Vanessa and Katie just stood and looked at each other.  Vanessa rubbed her throat as if to sooth the pain of being lifted into the air and nearly choked unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny puffed back into existence at Lisa\u2019s house.  He appeared in the living room and looked about.  He figured this might be the place Selina would go upon escape only because it was the last place she really remembered being before Jonny possessed her.  Jonny walked Angela\u2019s body through the house and came to the kitchen.  There he found Lisa standing by the dinner table.  She wore the same low-cut blouse and jeans she had been wearing when Jonny last saw her.  Jonny slowly approached Lisa as she stood blank-faced and started into nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jonny asked Lisa as he came and stood before her.  \u201cYou instructed this one to come home, so I did.  This one is waiting for more orders, Mistress,\u201d she said, her voice as empty as her eyes were.  Jonny looked at her, and she looked right through him, or at least through the meat suit he had borrowed.  Jonny stood there a few minutes, staring into Lisa\u2019s eyes.  The two were silent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny heard the front door fly open.  It was Selina!  Jonny shuffled his plumped-up body off to a corner out of sight just in time to look back and see Selina run frantically into the kitchen and up to Lisa.  \u201cLisa Lisa you\u2019re never going to believe what happened.  I remember being here, and Jonny, that cute kid\u2014he went to the dinner with me and to the gala, and there was this horrible shooting and I came back \u2018cause I lost him,\u201d she explained frantically, tears welling up in her eyes.  \u201cThen I came to your house to look for the kid, and there was this pudgy fat guy and we sat on the porch and that\u2019s all I remember . . . I . . . . I . . . I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she sobbed as she sank, seemingly defeated, into the chair.  After sobbing for a few seconds, she looked up at Lisa, who simply stared straight forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the love of god, hon, say something, please!\u201d Selina begged.  Nothing.  Jonny stood in the darkened corner, tucked away snuggly inside the body of Angela Donovan.  He had an idea.  His eyes glowed red, and he concentrated.  Suddenly, his plump, voluptuous body began to shift.  Angela\u2019s legs and meaty thighs lost their girth, and her belly deflated, each feature being replaced by a slim, even wiry counterpart.  Her mil-filled breasts retreated into her chest, and her arms slimmed out and became much skinnier.  Her facial features hardened a bit, but her whole body grew younger until it looked like that of a boy at about age 18 or so, a boy with dark hair and glasses.  A formal evening suit appeared on the boy\u2019s body, and a big sloppy red spot appeared on his white shirt.  Jonny stepped from the corner clad in a body that was familiar to him.  \u201cHey Selina,\u201d he said pleasantly.  She suddenly turned, and her jaw dropped.  \u201cOh my God!\u201d she exclaimed as she threw herself into Jonny\u2019s arms and hugged him, as he wore the same young male body he had been inside when he went to the gala.  \u201cOh my God Jonny I thought I lost you!\u201d she said as she stepped back.  \u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Jonny said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stepped back.  \u201cMy god . . . what\u2014what happened to you?\u201d she said as she gestured at the giant spot of blood on Jonny\u2019s shirt.  \u201cHit in the belly by a stray bullet when you took me to dinner that night,\u201d he said, \u201cGuess you didn\u2019t watch me close enough huh?\u201d he said.  Selina stepped back and began to cry again.  \u201cI . . . I would never have let anything happen to you!\u201d she said.  \u201cBull shit; you did, and now I\u2019m dead.  I wasn\u2019t even old enough to drink, and you\u2019re old enough to be my mom.  You were supposed to take care of me that night!\u201d he screamed.  Selina sobbed again.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so so so sorry!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI want to go back to my apartment and spend time with you but I lost you!\u201d  Jonny cut in, \u201cYeah, I wanted to fuck you that night too, but now that I\u2019m dead I suppose that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Jonny said with an obvious edge.  \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen,\u201d she cried, with her head in her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny concentrated again while Selina looked away.  His body shifted again.  He stayed about the same height, but rapidly aged a few decades.  His suit had to resize itself as his entire body inflated.  His belly surged forward so that it was barely contained even by the larger dress shirt and pants he now wore.  Thick dark glasses appeared on his face, as did a jiggly double chin.  An overcoat adorned the rotund male form that Jonny now wore, and a small hole appeared in his new body\u2019s head.  Blood seemed to seep out.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s quite irrelevant,\u201d Jonny declared from a new body.  Selina looked up, amazed again.  \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re the guy from\u2014\u201c she began.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI\u2019m Arthur Fineburg, and I got this nasty whole in my head a few minutes after I met you,\u201d he said as he gestured to his wound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina cried more.  \u201cI don\u2019t even remember\u2014\u201c Selina began.  \u201cI DO!\u201d the plump accountant screamed.  Of course, Jonny left out that he had possessed Selina\u2019s body in order to shoot the fat man.  \u201cYou know I notice a theme here\u2014Jonny met you, and he\u2019s dead.  I met you, and I\u2019m dead.  Wanna take a guess about what exactly is the fucking common denominator here?!\u201d he shouted.  Selina could not stop crying.              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny looked over Selina's body as the curvaceous cop fell to the floor, trembling from her tears. He could tell that she was a mental wreck, probably due to the combination of losing all that time and now being shown all of this. Selina was being broken worse than she had ever been before, and Jonny certainly wasn't going to be letting up. The more he payed attention to Lisa's shell staring at him from her corner of the room, the angrier he got, and toying with Selina was the best way to keep his mind off of his perpetual anger. Jonny turned his attention back to Lisa, who was slowly standing back up, but still crying hysterically. Her make up was smeared over her face and her clothes were wrinkled. To think, she was such a strong woman when Jonny had first laid his eyes on her during her little meeting with Lisa. At this point, taking back her body would be doing Selina a favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's legs were shaking as the tears kept falling from her eyes. Her words were weak, and tear filled. \"P..p...please...I don't even know who you are...I d-d-don't remember....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny interrupted her in Fineburg's rather annoying voice. \"Well....do you wanna know why it is that you don't remember, Selina?\" He asked, moving closer to his former and soon-to-be-again meat suit. He put one of Arthur's fat hands on Selina's cheek, wiping away some of the tears and grinning at her evilly. \"Its because I was wearing your body like a cheap suit. And while I had control over your lovely sack of meat, I shot old Arthur here right through the head\" He made his fingers into the shape of a gun and mock shot himself through the head, right on the spot where his bullet wound was. \"And then I strutted my sexy new body...your body, in case you haven't been following... away, clicking your heels on the ground and swaying your ass with a purpose that you hadn't really had in you for years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina shook her head in denial. \"No....nononononononoooooo....\" she said, closing her eyes and shaking her head, her long black hair swaying back and forth, tears still falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny removed Arthur's hand from Selina's face and shifted his body back into the one that Selina knew best. This time, he decided not to have the blood stain. In fact, instead of the black suit, he decided to wear all white. \"Open your eyes, Selina\" he said with a kind smile. Selina opened her eyes and suddenly a wave of ease came over her body. As confused as she was, she was happy to see Jonny looking like this. \"I'm afraid that you're very confused right now. I owe you some answers....\" Suddenly, his body shifted again, the bloody black suit returning as his skin took on a grey, dead looking hue. His eyes became demonic red, not for using his powers, but to scare Selina a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina gasped as the change occurred and started shaking again, scared. Her senses had started coming back, but she couldn't make herself think straight. She slowly walked backwards, her back hitting against the front door of the house. Selina's gaze switched off between looking at the dead, haunted looking Jonny and her best friend Lisa, who didn't even seem to recognize her. \"W-what are y-y-you???\" Selina asked, her hand wrapping around the door knob, preparing to run if she had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jonny\" he said with that sinister grin, his voice sounding like the kid's but with a rather demonic tone at the same time. \"I'm a demon with over a century of life behind my belt, and right now I am very very angry at the world.\" Jonny placed his hand on Selina's temple as her eyes glowed. Her body suddenly became stiff and she felt her hand letting go of the door knob behind her. Jonny moved his hand around her's and slowly lead her to the center of the room. Jonny looked at Lisa's shell. She was just standing there, watching the two of them like a sentinel. Or a fucking robot. Jonny gritted his teeth angrily. \"You,\" he said to the former Lisa, not willing to call her by her name. \"Make sure Selina won't try to escape again\" he commanded in a distant voice, like a master commanding a slave as opposed to the way he used to talk to her as if they were friends, or even lovers. Jonny saw no reason to even pretend things were the same as they were. This was not Lisa, this was just a doll for him to use as he saw fit. Even she saw herself that way now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master\" she said almost mechanically. She walked behind the un-moving Selina and wrapped her arms around her chest from behind, holding tightly as Jonny snapped his fingers, letting Selina move again. As Selina realized her position, she tried to struggle, but Lisa's grip was very strong. All of her willpower was being used to restrain Selina. She wasn't even thinking of doing anything else. In as weak of a state that Selina was in, she didn't stand a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lisa...why are you doing this...\" she said, trying to fight her way free. Lisa didn't respond and just kept doing her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled. \"Answer her, slave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am doing this because my master told me to. I do as my master tells me\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled at Selina. \"You heard her\" he said, clenching his fists. \"She does what I tell her to. Just like you will\" he said, looking into Selina's fear filled eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I will n-never do what you tell me to, you monster!\" she yelled, spitting into Jonny's face, prompting Jonny to laugh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute....I can't believe you actually think you have a say in this matter. Don't you get it Selina? I can take you over whenever I want to....and when I do, I'll go back to wearing your body like the sexy suit that it is! In fact, I'll want to be letting off some extra steam so I'll be doing even more than that first time!\" Jonny, moved his hand around Selina's body and slapped her ass, causing her to jump a bit. \"You see, when I'm back in your driver's seat you and I are going to be partners in crime. Everything that I do will be something that WE do. I'm going to make sure that you know exactly what's going to happen so that you can't feign innocence or ignorance....Here's what's going to happen Selina. I'm going to once again possess that mighty fine meat suit of yours, and I'm going to do it painfully slowly. You will feel every minute of what I do to you. Even after my possession, I'm going to keep your mind conscious so that you can see and feel everything we do. Then, I'm going to get out of this forsaken house and buy US the skimpiest, sluttiest clothes you've ever owned. I'm going to take us to the Warehouse and parade us around, giving the surviving residents of this neighborhood a show that they would have never dreamed from the famous police chief. I'll even find us a nice looking man or woman. Someone nice and young. We'll get them to trust us and lust for us. And then we're doing to rip the soul from their body and put a whole through their head just like we did to poor Arthur Fineburg. After a loooong night of getting 'reacquainted with our body and maybe having our slave here help us with that, we're going to go to work and order police raids that kill a lot of people, and it'll all be justified because we're going to trump up some nice false charges. If all that doesn't break your will beyond repair and make you BEG me to keep your body forever, I just don't know what will. But before we do anything...I'm going to give you a SMALL taste of my suffering\" he said, taking a few steps back. He snapped his fingers and looked at 'Lisa'. \"Let her go\" he said as his slave did as she was told. Selina tried to rutn around, but Jonny;s eyes began glowing again. \"Don't even think about moving\" he said as Selina froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gun suddenly appeared in Selina's hand. \"What's the meaning of this?\" she asked, able to talk. At this point, Selina wasn't crying anymore, but she was fighting this with all her might. She understood that she had been used from the very beginning, but was trying to not let her deep feelings of betrayal affect her. It took all of her training as a cop not to collapse on the ground into tears again and Jonny could see that plainly. Selina gasped as Jonny;s body shifted again, returning to the pregnant form of Angela Donavan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Angela' smiled evilly at Selina. \"This is my current meat suit, Selina. Her name is Angela and she's a 33 year old doctor. She's pregnant with a baby boy and has a loving husband waiting for her back home. In a few years they want to have a nice big family for themselves. But you're not going to let that happen...because you're going to shoot her through the heart right now and kill both Angela and her little boy....isn't that right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I won't!\" Selina screamed, trying to summon up all of her will power as her armed hand lifted itself up without her will. Selina tried with all her might to fight against this as Angela's body just kept smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you will, Selina....This is the end of your life as you know it...but don't worry. It's also the beginning of our new life together\" the future-mother said with that evil Jonny grin on her face. Selina just kept fighting against this, tears forming in her eyes with the same despair that Jonny himself had in him as he was made to devour Lisa's soul. Jonny couldn't help but feel that there was something incredibly fitting about making Selina go through with this before he took her over completely. Jonny snapped Angela's fingers, forcing Selina to pull the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud shot rang out in Lisa\u2019s home, piercing the relative quiet of the mid-morning.  The bullet rocketed through the air and pierced the chest of Angela Donovan, a woman whose life and body were torn from her just an hour or so before.  She had planned to go shopping for baby clothes today . . . but no longer.  Feeling the sharp, excruciating pain, Jonny staggered back a few steps, his meat suit in shock more than anything else from the shot.  He coughed, and blood dripped from Angela\u2019s mouth.  He flashed sick and bloody smile in Selina\u2019s direction.  \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he declared just before Angela\u2019s body gave out and dropped limply to the ground with a thud.  She lay there, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina let forth the most gut-wrenching scream Jonny had ever heard, and that was saying something for a demon.  \u201cNo no no no no no no no no!\u201d Selina screamed as she held her hands to her head and tried to stop the waterfall of tears streaming out of her.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t real it\u2019s all fake I\u2019m\u2014wake up!  Just got to wake up!\u201d she wailed at the top of her lungs.  Still, Angela\u2019s lifeless body just lay there in pure defiance of Selina\u2019s insistence that it was all fake.  Her swollen belly protruded into their air. After a minute or two of this, a black, swirling mass of smoke and dust arose from Angela\u2019s body like a person rising from a comfortable sleep.  The swirling mass that was Jonny\u2019s ethereal form glided slowly in the direction of Selina, who had stopped to her knees and sobbed more\u2014it was as though she had given up.  She\u2019d taken a human life\u20142 really, and the fact that she was forced to do it made no difference in her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny came to a stop a few feet from the wailing woman.  Selina glanced up, her eyes red with tears and hate.  \u201cWhat do you want!?\u201d she screamed at the demon, \u201cYou\u2019ve already taken all I have!\u201d  The dusty mass seemed almost to chuckle at Selina\u2019s pain.  \u201cNot quite,\u201d Jonny thought, and suddenly the writhing dust made a move in the direction of the crying woman.  Jonny forced his way into Selina\u2019s open mouth and down her throat.  From there, he spread into her belly and throughout the rest of her tired and desperate body.  From the outside, it looked almost like a vacuum sucking up a billion tiny particles of dust but struggling mightily to cope with the load.  Selina\u2019s body shook and shuttered and jiggled as Jonny\u2019s essence filled her yet again.  He filled Selina as a drink fills a belly, forcing his way inside until Selina was as full as she could be, until her frame almost struggled to contain the swirling mass of demonic essence that writhed about inside her\u2014as a person who drinks to much water too fast and simply must either stop or burst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of this spectacle, Selina\u2019s body, now filled to the brim with Jonny inside, stopped.  It collapsed forward on to the floor and lay there.  Seconds passed, and Selina stirred.  Slowly she rose, with Jonny using his new host\u2019s hands to brush displaced hair out of her eyes.  He stood slowly, again feeling the familiar weight of her chest and the slight jiggle in her hips and belly.  He took a deep breath, his borrowed bosom expanding mightily as he did.  Selina\u2019s eyes glowed a familiar red.  \u201cHome,\u201d he said, his voice a strange, otherworldly mix of hers and his.  Jonny glanced about, seeing that Lisa was still standing limply over by the wall in the room.  \u201cCome,\u201d he commanded, as he walked his host into the living room and plopped down on the couch.  Jonny reached for the remote and switched on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe set flickered to life, and immediately red letters \u201cBreaking News\u201d flashed across the screen.  The news woman spoke, \u201cThe Rangers say Hernandez will be good as new by next wee\u2014I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re getting some breaking news right now,\u201d she cut herself off, her hand to her earpiece as she reported the news just as her producers gave it to her, \u201cit appears that there has been an explosion at Protean Labs on the outskirts of the city!  The these pictures are from a news chopper just now on the scene,\u201d the woman said as the devastation flashed across the screen.  Rubble littered the ground, and sirens could be heard in the background as emergency crews of all kinds screamed to the scene.  \u201cThe explosion happened minutes ago and destroyed the lab, which was filled with highly noxious chemicals that are a danger to anyone who inhales them.  Much of that section of town has been leveled, and power is out to much of the rest of the city.  Those not affected but currently within the sound of my voice are urged to stay inside for their own health and safety,\u201d the woman said gravely.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cAuthorities have obtained this picture of a woman believed to be Angela Donovan, who is wanted for questioning in connection with these events,\u201d the news reporter said, and across the screen flashed a frame of the pregnant mother while her then-possessed frame smiled into the security camera.  \u201cThis is for JM,\u201d Donovan announced on the video, forming her hands in the shape of a heart before the frame went dark.  \u201cIf you have any information of interest to the authorities, please contact the police or FBI immediately, and again we urge residents of our fair city to take good care and stay in their homes if they are anywhere near the blast.  This is Ellen Chang, reporting for WTF News,\u201d the reporter concluded, and live footage of the blaze resumed.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frame was played again and again and then frozen on the side of the screen so that Jonny\u2019s former host could be seen by all and sought.  Jonny turned the TV off and stood inside Selina\u2019s body.  He glanced over at the lifeless body of Angela Donovan, her blood now staining the floor.  \u201cThe first responders will be too busy\u2014bedlam out there,\u201d Selina declared, \u201cput her in the car and drive her out to the docks.  Toss her in one of the abandoned warehouses or maybe in the water or something.  It\u2019ll take time for anyone to find her . . . they don\u2019t even know she\u2019s dead,\u201d Jonny said, directing his commands to Lisa, who just nodded.  \u201cI\u2019m going shopping,\u201d Selina said, a smile creeping across her face as she disappeared in a familiar puff of black smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, another puff of black smoke appeared, this one as Jonny arrived at his destination.  He stood for a moment and looked around.  Not much was in this area\u2014an old industrial park with run-down housing nearby.  This place was known to be a fairly active spot for hookers to frequent though.  Coming here at night was sure to be a way to get lucky and, if you weren\u2019t careful, also to get crabs and get car-jacked by a less-than-scrupulous lady of the evening.  Jonny looked before him at a run-down storefront with some wonders inside.  The place was adorned with a partially lit sign:  \u201cXXX Costumes!!!\u201d came the flashing fluorescent reminder.  See, this place was a sex shop specializing in various toys and costumes catering to various fetishes.  If you fantasy was to be spanked by a naughty nurse, there was a costume for that.  A sexy teacher who took quite a liking to her students?  They had that too.  What about a cop with some really creative uses for handcuffs?  All inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused for a moment and concentrated.  His curvaceous, borrowed body flashed red for a moment and then stopped.  Jonny had used a tiny bit of magic to compose himself.  Selina\u2019s messy hair and running make-up and tired, disheveled appearance were suddenly restored to perfection.  Selina looked just as beautiful as she had when she picked Jonny up for the gala that had gone so wrong, and she still wore the same form-fitting sexy dress.  \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she said with a smile as she walked toward the door of the store and stepped in.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ringing of a tiny bell announced the arrival of a new customer, and the door closed behind Selina.  She glanced about at the walls filled with leather and lace and spandex and blindfolds and innumerable other implements of erotic pleasure.  She saw behind the counter a fairly young man\u2014one who did not look like he belonged where he was.  Selina walked sexily toward the counter and the young man.  \u201cHey there,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name kid?\u201d she asked.  The boy\u2019s jaw dropped as he saw the curvy officer approach him in the dress with such a plunging neckline that showed off her wonderfully full chest.  He\u2019d seen many women who were sexy, or certainly who tried to be, but Selina was something different now\u2014she was beautiful.  \u201cAh ah um\u2014I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m Alfy,\u201d he stammered, smiling weakly.  He couldn\u2019t have been more than 18.  He had scraggly blonde hair on a thin frame and a beard that looked as though it was still in the research-and-development phase.  He wore a beat-up black shirt with the Aerosmith logo on it.  \u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to be in a place like this boy?\u201d Selina asked as she came to the counter and cocked her head thoughtfully, placing her elbow on the counter, her chin in her hand, and leaning in and putting her bouncing, full cleavage on display for the lucky young man.  \u201cUm ah well yeah but uh my dad says I gotta run the place while he\u2019s busy with something else right now so you know,\u201d Alfy responded, seeming to think that his ramblings constituted a complete thought of some kind.  \u201cHe does, does he?\u201d Selina asked with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm . . . yeah?\u201d Alfy said, seemingly rather unsure of himself.  \u201cWell very good then!\u201d Selina exclaimed, \u201chow\u2019d you like to help a woman sex herself up, Alfy?\u201d Selina asked.  \u201cSure!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat, um, do you like?\u201d he asked pensively.  Selina smiled sexily at him.  \u201cRuling the world,\u201d she said.  He chuckled.  \u201cHang on a sec,\u201d he said as he disappeared into the maze of isles for a few minutes.  Selina waited with a smile on her face as the boy rummaged about.  He emerged a couple minutes later carrying a bag filled with clothes of all kinds.  \u201cI got a number of things for you,\u201d he announced, \u201cbut you said you liked the idea of ruling the world, so I thought this would be a place to start,\u201d he said as he pulled out a particular ensemble. Selina immediately liked it.  It was a full outfit\u2014pants and a top, but it was specifically a black leather outfit that Selina very much liked the idea of wearing.  \u201cIt\u2019s an S &amp; M outfit, the sort of thing a woman wears when she wants to be in charge.  Selina took the outfit on a hanger and examined it.  She spun it around to discover that one had to lace up the top from the back\u2014it was a corset.  It was precisely the sort of thing that Selina\u2019s curvy body would look great in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot a place where I can try it on?\u201d Jonny asked as he took the bag of outfits and certainly the one Alfy had brought him.  \u201cYeah, over here,\u201d Alphy said as he showed Selina to a small fitting room with a mirror.  Selina stepped in and closed the door, smiling at her possessed body in the mirror.  \u201cBet you didn\u2019t ever dress in one of these in front of your momma hot stuff,\u201d she said to her reflection, knowing full well that the real Selina was inside her mind and a prisoner inside her own body who could hear her.  She could feel the tiniest tingle, hear the faintest scream in the back of her mind, which of course she chuckled at and then brushed away.  Selina removed the form-fitting evening gown she had worn.  Her boobs swing free, and her amble rear was now on full display as Jonny beheld his voluptuous, curvy, 44-year-old body, her tanned skin and jet black hair just adding to her allure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring his body for a few minutes, Jonny began to put on the new clothes.  He first slipped his meaty thighs into the black leather pants, forcing them up and around his beautiful bubble but.  He fastened the jeans in the front after having had to suck in his belly just a bit to do so\u2014one of the perils of advancing time, it seemed.  Jonny ran his hands over his curvy rear and gave it a slight slap.  \u201cGoing well so far,\u201d he declared as he bent down and picked up the top.  The corset, of course, had no straps and was to be kept up entirely by the figure of the woman who wore it.  It covered, not just the boobs, but the torso/belly area as well.  As Jonny tried to put it on, he found it exceedingly awkward.  He would get it most of the way around his body but would be unable to fasten it in the back.  This made sense, as the back was two leather ends that had to be held together by an assortment of black strings tied together, and that was hard to manage when you could not see what you were doing.  \u201cDammit to hell,\u201d Jonny exclaimed in futility.  Then he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlfy, get in here!\u201d he yelled out.  \u201cUm what?\u201d came the boy\u2019s surprised and obviously giddy response.  \u201cI can\u2019t fit myself into this fuckin\u2019 thing, and I need help.  Get in here son!\u201d Jonny yelled again.  After a couple seconds, Alfy timidly opened the door and peered in.  Selina motioned him to come in the rest of the way, and he closed the door.  The room wasn\u2019t much bigger than a couple of telephone booths welded together, so Alfy suddenly found himself in very close quarters with the curvy Selina.  She stood with her back to him.  \u201cI can\u2019t get this top fastened, so you need to help me, got it?\u201d  Alfy paused.  \u201cYeah yeah sure I can help . . . I can help you,\u201d he stammered.  Selina could feel Alfy working his hands about behind her, tying the two ends of the garment together string by string, and the leather slowly enclosed Selina\u2019s middle as Alfy worked his way up her back.  As he got to top, he stopped.  Jonny paused for a minute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you stop?  It doesn\u2019t feel as snug as it should I think ,\u201c he said.  Alfy seemed to stumble.  \u201cWel\u2014um\u2014ah,\u201d he started, \u201cI can\u2019t get it to\u2014\u201c  \u201cCan\u2019t get it to fasten?\u201d Selina said with a slight laugh.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Alfy confirmed.  \u201cHaha it\u2019s ok kid.  These clothes were made for a 20-year-old vixen built like a stick, and I am 44, I like my pastries, and I think women whose thighs never touch need to eat a fucking sandwich.  Tell you what, I\u2019ll inhale a bit and you give those strings back there good yank\u2014sound good?\u201d  \u201cSure,\u201d Alfy said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina breathed in, compressing her belly but causing a notable expansion in her breasts.  Suddenly, Alfy yanked on the strings, and the corset tightened around Selina\u2019s middle.  The yank was hard enough that it actually caused a few delightful cracks in Selina\u2019s back, and her generous chest was immediately forced upward to an even more prominent position, if that\u2019s even possible.  The skin from her boobs peeked over the top of the corset.  The effect of the whole thing was a bit like forcing the last bit of toothpaste to the top of the tube.  \u201cWow!\u201d Selina said, exhilarated at the sensation of wearing the thing.  She turned very slowly and looked at herself in the mirror.  She was really beautiful\u2014hot too, and of course those aren\u2019t quite the same thing.  Alfy\u2019s jaw dropped as he beheld the woman\u2019s curvy, eye-popping figure.  \u201cYou look great\u2014I mean\u2014if I was into that sort of thing and women your ag\u2014I mean, you know chicks who are built like\u2014well, women who have been around a couple ti\u2014you look real nice!\u201d he said as he quickly and nervously existed the small room, nervous as hell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny admired himself in the mirror.  He liked the effect of the clothes like this on his vessel.  Basically, the form-fitting nature of the leather and the corset in particular meant that there was but one way to walk around when dressed like this\u2014eyes front, shoulders back, and boobs bobbing beautifully at the ready.  Selina existed the fitting room some time later, her chest jutting out beautifully before her as she strutted about.  He grabbed the bag of other clothes Alfy had procured, still wearing the dominatrix uniform.  \u201cAll the rest of that stuff\u2014the maid stuff, the nurse stuff, the cop stuff, the teacher stuff, the housewife stuff, all of it, it\u2019s all the same size as what you\u2019ve got now, so it\u2019ll fit well if you make it fit,\u201d he said.  \u201cThanks, Alfy, you\u2019re a doll,\u201d Selina said as she ran her hand sexily over his face.  Suddenly, her eyes began to glow red, as did Alfy\u2019s.  \u201cYou found it so joyful helping me wedge my boobs into this thing that you\u2019re going to give me all these clothes for free,\u201d she said.  \u201cBoobs . . . free,\u201d Alfy said.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Selina said, releasing the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strutted out of the shop into the open mid-day air.  \u201cWhat a nice boy,\u201d she mused to herself as she pondered her next move.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina took a few steps down the street and then disappeared in her usual puff of black smoke. The seductively dressed police chief reappeared in another puff of smoke back in Lisa's living room. She dropped her new bag of clothes onto the floor and looked over the room. It was just the same as she had left it an hour or so ago, though the body of Angela Donovan had been moved. Lisa was kneeling on the floor, scrubbing away the blood stains with soap and water. Selina's fist clenched as she watched Lisa silently cleaning, that dead, submissive look in her eyes as she worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do what I asked?\" Selina asked, watching the zombified Lisa do her thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress. I took the woman's body to an old warehouse and left it to rot. Just as you instructed\" she said, without missing a beat on her cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're cleaning up the mess she left. I didn't tell you to do that, did I?\" she asked, crossing her arms around her leather-clad chest. There was a touch of hope in Selina's voice now. Could some of the old Lisa still be alive in there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress. It was my assumption that you would not want any evidence left behind\" Lisa replied as she just continued her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up and look at me, Lisa\" Selina said, calling her by her name for the first time since being made to devour her soul. Selina looked Lisa over and saw that she looked very tired, as if she hadn't slept since returning home from the get-away. Her clothes were also the same that she was wearing on that day, but now they were wrinkled and dirty. The saddest part of all was that Jonny saw absolutely no emotion coming from Lisa at all. Before all this had happened, Lisa had seen Selina as her best friend, and after Jonny took over Selina's body the first time, the two of them shared some time as lovers. But now there was none of that. \"Do you remember what things were like for us before you were like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress\" Lisa answered, not even smiling from the memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want that to continue?\" she asked again, looking into Lisa's eyes, which remained just as blank as they were when Jonny had first realized what he had done to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want anything, mistress. If you wish for it, I will give it to you. You are my will\" she said. Jonny looked straight into Lisa's dead eyes and they looked right back at Selina's. No emotion was exchanged between them. Jonny realized that the brief glimmer of hope was just Lisa's slave programming, telling her to do whatever would help Jonny most. That was not out of love, but out of drive. Every thought that was once in her head other than serving Jonny was a foreign concept. She wouldn't even sleep unless her mistress commanded her to. Jonny could literally just have her work to death and then be done with it. But no. He wouldn't do that. He felt that he had to keep part of Lisa alive, even in some way. If only to serve as a reminder for him to never make the mistake of falling in love again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get one of your best cars ready and bring it to the front of the house\" Jonny commanded, no longer having any ideas in his mind of trying to salvage their relationship. What happened happened and now there was only the fallout. \"You're going to drive me to the Warehouse so I can make an impressive entrance. Then go back here and go to sleep. You need rest. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress\" Lisa said, hurrying out the door to her garage. Jonny then snapped Selina's fingers, making the soupy water disappear from the carpet and letting the bloodstain come back. Clearly, Lisa didn't know her mistress after all. Jonny loved the reminder of what he had done, rather what he had made Selina do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Selina....you were the one who did this\" he said in Selina's sultry voice, turning to look in the mirror at his reflection. He struck a sexy pose that he knew Selina could see from her mental prison and grinned evilly, eyes glowing demonic red. \"And trust me, sexy. We're not even close to being finished. I feel you fighting in here to get out. I'm impressed by your will power as always, but it won't last. I'm going to eat away at your resistance until there's nothing left. That's a promise\" she says as she laughs evilly, hearing the sound of Lisa parking out front. On that note, Selina's body strutted out from Lisa's house, clicking her high heels on the floor as she walked to the car. Lisa was standing outside of her black sports car and held the door open for Selina, who got in without a word. Lisa gently closed the door for her mistress and then walked around the car, getting into the driver's seat and heading out into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two lovely woman drove through town, getting caught in some traffic casued by the mayhem Jonny had wreaked earlier, balls of sweat formed on Selina's lovely face as she put a hand to her head, grimacing from the powerful headache she was now experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, mistress?\" the soulless Lisa asked, not taking her eyes off from the road in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...I'm not...pull the car over now\" Selina commanded, closing her eyes, and leaning against the window, taking deep breathes in and out as the sweat became more prevalent, dripping down her face. Inside of her mind, she could feel the real Selina fighting to get out. Her will power was absolutely incredible and Jonny could feel it actually trying to push him out from Selina's body. He just kept taking his deep breathes as Lisa swerved out of the traffic and into a nearby rest area. As soon as the car was parked, Jonny opened his passenger door and fell out of the car, langind on Selina's leather clad knees as he started coughing violently and against his will, feeling Selina trying to kick him out from her body. As he opened his eyes and looked up, he saw what appeared to be a vision of Selina looking down at him, with anger in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You should have thought twice before you messed with me and stole my fucking body!</i> She exclaimed rather loudly from within Jonny's mind as the coughing continued. Jonny's vision began to blur as he felt Selina's will getting stronger and really trying to force him out. For Jonny, the scariest part that came with this was how close she was to succeeding. Jonny really felt like he could be pushed out of Selina's body if he didn't do something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Jonny screamed at the top of his stolen lungs as Selina's eyes glowed bright red. \"There's no way in hell that I'm going to lose control to a whore like you!\" he yelled, using his annoyance at this to regain the upper hand and cause the hallucination to fade away. \"Lisa! Get over here right now!!\" she yelled, having to act fast if the new Selina wanted to keep her upper hand over the inferior model. Once Selina saw Lisa walk to her, she pounced on the soulless slave, pushing her onto the ground, practically straddling her.  \"Sorry to do this to you....nothing personal\" she said, kissing her restrained empty body deeply on the lips and closing her blood red eyes, forcing Selina's real soul entirely out from her body and into Lisa's empty vessel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Lisa's body barely reacted at all as Selina's soul was forced into it. Naturally, it shook and jiggled quite a bit in retaliation, but that was more of a reflext than anything else. Jonny knew full well that Lisas body had no soul to fight back and that whatever programming was making her body act the way it had been would be completely overridden by the new soul enterring her body. But that was okay. Any soul in that body was better than what he'd had to deal with until now. Once Lisa's body ceased it's shaking, Selina's body relaxed a bit, breathing a sigh of relief. Her mind was now quiet, and she felt a wave of confidence fill her body.  Jonny was now completely alone in his lovely meatsuit, with no pesky soul trying to force him out of the gorgeous body that he had claimed as his home not so long ago. It actually felt incredibly nice being the only soul in his body. He didn't feel this good in a host since he had put Jacks demonicaly altered soul into Katie's soulless body. The only difference here is that Selina was still just a regular soul, now permanently trapped int he body that used t belong to her best friend, but was now just an empty shell. The new and now only Selina looked down at Lisa's sleeping form and smiled as she opened her eyes. Jonny actually saw the light of a soul in those pupils, though he knew it wasn't Lisas and would never be able to live up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sunshine\" he said with a grin, eyes glowing red as the new Lisa slowly sat up, a disoriented and confused look on her face. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny placed Selina's hand on the new Lisa's face. Her body stiffened up as her eyes blazed red just like Selina's. \"Do not freak out or make any sudden moves....\" Jonny said soothingly with Selina's voice as the world shifted and changed around the two women. Before a moment was up, the two had been moved back into Lisa's home. The new Lisa was now sitting comfortably on one of Lisa's soft chairs while Selina's body was standing over her. The read haired woman's eyes were still glowing red as Jonny gave her commands. \"I will not make you forget who you were, or even take away that rock hard will of yours that you've made such use of. But....given that will of yours, I will have to make some fixes to you. I hope you understand...\" Selina said, concentrating on doing what she wanted to do before removing her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's body slouched down as her eyes returned to their normal color. She put her hand back on her head and frowned as she looked around the room before her gaze settled on Selina's body. She then looked down at her own body and frowned, feeling herself over and then pulling some of her red hair in front of her eyes before standing up and looking at Selina with a look of anger in her eyes. \"What the hell did you do to me, mistress?\" he exclaimed, pointing at Selina's body and then frowning, putting her hand on her mouth in surprise. \"Wait, why the hell did I just call you mistress, mistress?\" she asked, frowning again as she realized it happened again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed from Selina's body and crossed his arms under Selina's generous chest, smiling at his new creation. He had to admit, it was really really pleasant seeing Lisa's body as more than just some mindless shell. It made him feel good knowing that her body once again had a soul inside of it that could actually think and feel, though he knew he'd have to be careful with how he treated this one. He couldn't risk getting attached or the Old Man was liable to step in again. \"You're calling me that because it's a command that I implanted into your subconscious mind\" he said with a wide grin on his stolen face. \"You see me as yourself as my faithful servant without knowing why. I like to think it'll prevent you from doing anything regretful like trying to escape or kill me or anything else along those rather stupid lines. What do you think of the plan?\" he asked as the former Selina looked down, as if thinking about his strategy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's a good plan, mistress. I desperately want to attack you right now and make you pay for this, but at the same time, I find myself wanting to stay quit and hear you out more than that. It's certainly keeping me in line\" she said, clenching her fist into a ball. Jonny could tell that she really did want him dead but his command was also doing what it was meant to do. She was docile and open to listening to what he wanted to say, which would let him explain this situation to her in better detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a good plan. That's why I did it. Here's another thing I did...what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown appeared on Lisa's face. \"What the hell kind of a question is that, mistress? My name is Lisa!\" she exclaimed and then frowned. \"Wait, why did I say that my name was Lisa? My name is Lisa! What did you do to me??\" she said again before she threw Jonny and angry look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny responded with a laugh again, which proved to get his new toy even more mad at him. Seeing her own body and hearing her own voice being condescending to her was probably quite annoying, but Jonny was getting a huge kick out of it. This was the most fun he had since he had unintentionally killed Lisa. \"I made it so you're unable to think of yourself or refer to yourself as anything other than Lisa. You know that's not actually who you are, but nothing is going to change how you see yourself and what you call yourself. This way you can't go trying to explain your situation to anyone. Again, smart plan, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lisa' nodded. \"Yes, it's a very smart plan, mistress. Now can I ask you some questions so I have a better understanding as to what the fuck this all is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed again, admiring her courage. Even with the commands he gave her, the former Selina still had the guts to talk to him like that. She actually reminded him a lot of himself back when he was a human. If the two of them were born around the same time and things were different, Jonny could actually see the two of them having been very close friends. Selina had the same courage and sense of morality that Jonny had in his youth. Maybe that was why he enjoyed Selina's body so much and thought of it as his new home...food for thought. \"Go ahead...ask me anything you want. As payment for you being so cooperative, I'll answer as honestly as I can\" he said, motioning for the Selina-possessed Lisa to sit down on the chair behind her as Jonny made a chair appear under his own curvaceous body. he then sat down and crossed Selina's lovely legs, making himself comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, mistress. There's a lot I want to know, but let's start with the basics. Who are you and what the hell are you?\" the new Lisa demanded, treating this little interview like a cop performing an interrogation. Jonny had been so used to having Lisa's body completely subservient to him that her newly found chutzpah was actually refreshing. Though she would always be below him and she knew that, she was taking to Jonny as if he was the one below her. She even called him her mistress in a way that sounded like she was above him. Jonny smiled. He liked her already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thinking of yourself as the head cop even without being yourself anymore, I see. Alright, I think I owe you that answer...\" He said, as Selina's body shifted and transformed into the teenage form of Jonny, causing the new Lisa to gasp in surprise. \"I see you weren't expecting that\" he said, having Jack's appearance but Selina's voice still. Once he got the point across, his body shifted back into that of Selina. He cracked his neck before looking straight into Lisa's beautiful eyes, which were once again alive and soulful. \"That was the body you knew me best in, but it wasn't quite my own. You see, my name really is Jonny, but I was by no means a 19 year old kid. I'm actually a demon that was created about a century ago when the embodiment of chaos saw it fit to rip me out of my human life and transform me into what you now see before you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown came to Lisa's face as she thought this all through. The rational part of her brain clearly didin't want to accept the existence of demons, but nothing else made any form of sense to her. \"Okay. So you're a powerful demon. You clearly have supernatural powers like shapeshifting, mind control, possession....anything else I should know about?\" she asked, perhaps wanting to plan ways of outsmarting Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cocky grin appeared on Selina's face. \"Well I can copy the powers of any demon I interact with, which means that I can in theory send clones of myself into people, manipulate the seven deadly sins and do many other things depending on who else I meet in my adventures, so I can essentially do anything I want whenever I want it. I can wipe away that strong will from you and just make you my slave now if I want to, which is what I had done to Lisa. She actually served me quite happily and lovingly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't do that, will you mistress?\" Selina asked with her own cocky grin on Lisa's face. It was a dominant look that the old Lisa had never had. \"If you wanted me to just be a typical happy slave girl to you you would have done that already, but you didn't. You chose to let me keep my will for some reason. Not only that, but I was nearly able to push you out of your body before. I don't think you can bring yourself to getting rid of me in that way, can you, mistress?\" she asked, crossing her arms and giving Jonny a victorious look. Jonny genuinely smiled from that. She really was a smart one. He could see that she wasn't chief of police in this city for her looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny shook his head. \"No, I won't do that. I like having you like this. You're controlled enough to do what I want, but free enough to question me and still be yourself. I think this is thebest solution for both of us, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Well, it's certainly better than me just being your mindless doll. But I hope you're aware that I'm planning the best way of getting my body back and sending you to hell for what you've done to me and Selina\" she said firmly. Jonny manipulations stopped her from phrasng that the way she probably meant to, but it was fine. He got the gist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't expect anything else from you...I would have done the same thing when I was a cop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a cop?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"That's right. Get on the database and look up my name when you have spare time. I was one of the best in my district until I died\" he said with just a bit of pride. \"That's one of the reasons I love your body so much. Having it helps me reconnect to my past life. Relive my glory says, some might say\" he said which his new Lisa nodded to. Angry at him or not, she understood where he was coming from with that. She'd feel the same way if she were ripped from her life and then had an opportunity to be back in a familiar environment. Actually, that was what happened to her. \"Alright, LISA....I'll give you one more question. Then I'll give you an honest choice. You can choose to either take over Lisa's life and be my new right hand in her place, or I can use my powers to make you that way. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped before responding. \"Yes, mistress. I understand. Before I make up my mind, I need to know...where is Lisa...the actual Lisa...in all of this?\" A sadness filled Jonny's eyes as he looked right at the former Selina, who was filling Lisa's body with a life it hadn't seen since that fateful day. Jonny wanted to dodge the question, but he owed her better than that....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny decided that it would be best for this new Lisa to know exactly what had happened to the old one. It was only the fair thing to do. Jonny placed Selina's hand on Lisa's forehead. Selina's eyes glowed red, which was immediately echoed in the new Lisa's eyes. Once the glowing stopped, Selina's hand left Lisa's head and Lisa fell to the ground, holding her head, a look of pain on her face as Lisa's more recent memories flooded inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa held her head as she remembered everything as if she were the one who had lived through it. She remembered meeting Jonny at the Warehouse, first being annoyed, then terrified, and then controlled. She remembered serving Jonny's every need faithfully and eventually developing a love for him. She remembered everything the two of them had done together. And then she remembered Jonny being controlled by the Old Man, walking over to her, and feeling the sharpest pain imaginable. Tears formed in her eyes as she looked up at Selina's body, her own former body. She saw the deep look in her old eyes and realized from Lisa's memories that not only did Lisa love Jonny, but Jonny actually started to love her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry, mistress\" she said, standing up and looking down at the ground. She was still pissed that her body had been stolen from her, and she in no way liked her situation, but she could understand why this demon did what he did now. She also knew based on what he did to Lisa that he would have no qualms wiping away her own will if she didn't give in and agree to serve him as she currently was. If she agreed to serve him now, then maybe she could earn his trust, get more freedom and figure out a way back to her body. At the very least, she'd have the chance to do that, which would be an impossibility without her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your answer Lisa?\" Selina asked, looking at the new Lisa expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a deep breath in, weighing her options one last time before exhaling and looking into her former eyes. \"I'm in, mistress. I'll play your game and serve you however you would like\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appeared on Selina's face. \"I'm glad to hear that Lisa. I really didn't want to make any more changes to your mind. Like I said, I like your spunk\" she said, slapping the new Lisa's ass. \"But just so you know, if you betray my trust more changes will come\" she says with a wink before getting into the passenger seat of the car. \"Now, why don't you drive us back to your place for some fun?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All things considered, things had went well for the two women. Selina's body was now inhabited only by Jonny, while Lisa's body once again had life in it in the form of the original Selina. The two women, neither of whom actually owned the body they were in, actually managed to have a civil conversation on the ride back to Lisa's home. Selina told Lisa all about her former life as a cop nearly a century ago and the new Lisa listened intently. It turned out that Jonny's last partner before being murdered had actually been Selina's grandfather, giving the two an unexpected connection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were back, Selina had asked Lisa if she was willing to have some fun in bed, but Lisa declined the offer a bit more politely than she would have had she not been under Jonny's limited control. Unfortunately, the subconscious restraints that Jonny had put on her prevented Lisa from saying 'fuck you, there's no chance in hell'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Selina\u007f just smiled and said that was okay. He said that Lisa may be spunky but she was far from the original. Selina would be keeping Lisa's main bedroom as her own, but Lisa was more than welcome to take any of the other rooms for herself. Lisa had settled for one of the nicer guestrooms and decided to get an early night's sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa slept, a purple smoke entered the room through the window. The smoke slowly gathered in one place and grew to form the body of a woman, eventually solidifying into a human. The mysterious woman then silently walked to the sleeping Lisa and placed a hand on her head. Lisa's eyes opened, but immediately began glowing a bright purple as Lisa fell under the sway of the unknown woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Selina. Or, should I say Lisa? My name is Lena and I am a witch. I've been watching your friend Jonny for quite some time now. I would like to use Jonny to help me destroy the old man. You are going to help me with that. do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"I understand, Mistress Lena\" she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled. \"Very good, child. Now, I can see in your mind that the old Lisa had a deep love for Jonny. But you do not share that love, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"No, Mistress Lena. I may have once had a sexual desire for him, but all of that is gone now that he has stolen my body and imprisoned me in Lisa's corpse\" she said, clearly having strong opinions on this matter. \"No matter how Lisa felt, I can never share those feelings\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled, but shook her head. \"I'm sorry child, but I cannot have that. Let's open your mind a bit, shall we?\" she asked, running her hand through Lisa's red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open my mind?\" Lisa asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, child. I think that you love Jonny very much. Even more than Lisa did. Think about it for a little. Jonny was once a cop, just like you. You and he share the same value systems though it may not be seen. All of the moves that Jonny pulled on you were things that you would have done in a heartbeat so people who had gotten in your way. Let's face it, Lisa. You envy Jonny in ways that you have never envied anyone else. But on top of that envy, you desire him. You know that your body is attractive. And Jonny uses that body in ways that you only wish you did. Everything that Jonny does with your skin, he makes look good. You don't care about the fact that it used to be your skin, you just want Jonny. And deep down, you want Jonny to succeed and are willing to help him succeed, because you know that he will never love you as much as he loved the real Lisa. Did you get all of that, child?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"Yes, mistress Lena. I have been repressing my feelings for Mistress Selina. Deep down, I know that I care for Jonny. We are very similar. I want to be by his side and help him achieve his goals because I want him to care about me the way he cared about the old Lisa. I also desire Jonny in ways that I have never desired anyone else. Even if it used to be my body, Jonny uses it in ways that get me so hot...I want him. I want him so much\" she said, eyes now burning violet due to her passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you can admit that, Lisa. But remember that you are playing hard to get. You'll still put up some fights and pretend to want your body back. It's all a game that you're playing though, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I act like I want my body back, and I won't do everything that Jonny tells me to. But it's playful because I love him and I want him\" she said, her very soul changing at it's core to fit her new outlook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Lena said as she snapped her fingers. \"I have made my business card appear in your old wallet, which Jonny should have access to. You are going to gain his trust. Become his friend...confidant...lover. Surpass the old Lisa in his feelings, but do it carefully so that the Old Man will not become weary. Be as useful as you can while maintaining your playful charade. Once Jonny is close enough to you, suggest turning on the old man. Say you know a psychic who can help and show him my card. Then we'll get back in touch. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress Lena. Your card is in my old wallet. I'll earn Jonny's love and then we'll get your help to beat the old man\" she said, understanding her new role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. When you wake up, you will not have any recollection of this conversation. Now go back to sleep\" Lena said as the glow faded from the new Lisa's eyes and she returned to her dreams. Lena then returned to her smoke form and left the house as quietly as she entered. Things were now in motion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny drove his stolen car several miles away from the warehouse to one of the city's main electrical plants. He parked the car outside the plant and got out of the car, slamming the door shut so hard that the window cracked. Jonny looked up at the plant. So big and yet so fragile. Just like everything else in this useless world that he lived in. This was all nothing but a fragile glass snow globe. It looked nice while you held it and shook it, but one drop to the hard ground and the truth comes out. At the end of the day, there's nothing but water and broken glass. Without Lisa, Jonny no longer had any reason to care what happened to this city he had adopted. There was now no purpose to anything except for wreaking mayhem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled as he walked closer to his target. A man in a workers suit came out from the side with a questioning look on his face. Jonny responded by raising one of Vasil's guns and using the Russian's aim to shoot the man straight through the head. His body hit the ground before he even knew what hit him. Jonny tossed the gun to the side and looked around the plant. He walked over to the body of the dead worker and concentrated on it, his eyes glowing bright. Suddenly the workers body started to change and shift, turning into a large container of gasoline, filled to the brim. He grinned evilly as he picked up the container. The poor son of a bitch he had used to make this would be more use dead than he ever was alive. Not that people who were alive were of any use at all besides for the use of playthings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jonny walked around the electrical plant, dowsing everything he could with the gasoline that had once been some poor worker just doing his job like anyone would have. The more gas he spilled on the electrical stems, the more he thought of Lisa. Though he would no doubt be keeping her body around for his own enjoyment, nothing would be the same. Her smile would never have the same light it did. Her eyes would never have the same look of love and devotion. Even her words would no longer be the same. Everything would be empty as it was with all soulless humans. She would forever more be a shell of her former self, knwoing nothing other than loyalty to her master. She may still be able to act like her old self, but it would only be that. An act. To Jonny, this new slave of his didn't even deserve to be called Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Jonny thought about this, the angrier he got. He couldn't think. All he wanted was for things to end. He wanted death, destruction, and so much chaos. That was all that mattered now. It was the only thing he could think of that might make him feel better and escape this emptiness. He was running on little more than his demonic instincts that he had been fighting for such a long time. He'd thought that Lisa would be able to help him keep his demonic side quiet. And look where he was now. Once all of the gasoline was split, he through the bucket to the side and laid his stolen body onto the ground. He looked up at the early morning sky, watching the sun rise up in it's golden glory. Lisa's shell of a body was probably just pulling into her driveway, doing exactly as she had been instructed. At the warehouse, Selina was probably starting to wake up again. If she was as resourceful as her memories had lead Jonny to believe, then she would probably be able to out smart that other bouncer and try to escape her situation. Jonny would have to repossess her before things get too out of hand, but right now, he just watched the sunset, finally calming down a bit from his rage. Jonny opened his stolen mouth and let himself exit Vasil's gargantuan body. The Russian shook and spasmed as the smoke rose out from his mouth and formed a humanoid shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the smoke formed into Jonny's smokey body, the Russian looked around confused and held his head sitting up. Jonny put his smokey hand into Vasil's chest and pulled out his soul, eating it quickly, savoring the taste. Mmmmm, that was deliscious. Why had he wasted so much time trying to fight his temptations before? As the light died in Vasil's eyes, Jonny consentrated, causing Vasil's body to shift and change. He split Vasil's form in two and made each half into something different. One of the halfs became a replica of Lisa while the other hald became a replica of what Jonny had looked like before he had become a demon. He made the two hold hands with eachother and smile at him before they became flames of fire. Jonny flew his smoke form up above the flames as the gasolina ignited, causing the entire plant to explode loudly and violently. Jonny raced back int he direction of the warehouse as most of the town lost power. Now only that, but the explosion would be big enough to tear apart atleast a third of the town, causing all sorts of mayhem to be let loose. Ae Jonny flew, he laughed, feeling free. Lisa might as well be dead, and the same could be said for Jonny's humanity. Jonny looked back to see that the flames coming from the plant took on the forms of the letters JM. This would put even more fear and confusion into the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a safe distance, the Old Man had been watching all of this with a smile on his face. Had he known getting rid of the woman would have finally let Jonny's demon side out he would have done it a long time ago. Now there would be nothing stopping his most powerful demon from bringing about hell on earth and feeding the Old Man enough power to finally enact his ultimate plan. The Old Man could feel himself gaining power already. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny squeezed his scrawny Lisa's hand tightly with his scrawny hand as his eyes glowed bright red. He let out a painful scream as Jack's body coughed out blood and the life drained from his eyes. As Jack's body exhaled for the last time, a thick black smoke exited from his body and wrapped itself tightly around Lisa's body as Jack's grip loosened around Lisa's hand and his body fell to the ground dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-master? Is this you?\" Lisa asked, putting her hand through the smoke curiously, feeling it's odd texture on her skin as she looked around herself at the strange essence that was making what seemed like a tornado around her. The air coming from the smoke felt like a strange combination of burning hot and freezing cold, though Lisa did not find it at all unpleasant. How could she ever find her master to be unpleasant in any way? She smiled as she opened her arms and smiled happily. \"What are you waiting for, master? Get in here!\" she called out as the smoke suddenly charged at her, into her open mouth. Lisa fell backwards onto the floor as her gag reflex kicked in, causing her entire body to struggle against what was happening, albeit against her will. Lisa's body may physically be trying to fight off the possession, but her mind was incredibly accepting, wanting nothing more but to be her masters home for as long as he needed before finding a new body. She would gladly make this sacrifice for him as many times as he needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's body shook and jiggled on the floor next to Jack's lifeless corpse as Jonny's essence forced it's way into control of her form. Though every other human Jonny had possessed found this to be a horrible sensation, Lisa was mentally laughing at this, getting nothing but pleasure out her her master taking her body for his use. This was her purpose being fulfilled to its most extreme extent, and Lisa knew that she would never be happier than at this moment, serving her master in the best and most personal way possible. <i>Thank you for using my body, Master...</i> was her last thought before the darkness took over her mind, allowing Jonny full control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lisa stopped her spasming, her body laid on the floor unconscious for several seconds as Jonny's demonic essence got used to its new form. Once those seconds were up, Lisa's eyes fluttered open, and the attractive woman sat up, seeing the red hair falling down in front of her eyes and pushing it away out of habit, much like her body's rightful owner would have done. She stood up and brushed the dust off of her clothes before looking down at Jack's dead body, her former meatsuit. \"What a waste\" she said in her new voice, enjoying the sound of Lisa's voice from her own mouth even more than she did from in Jack's much younger body. She looked down at her body and then at her face in a mirror, smiling. Lisa really was a great looking woman, and for now she was all Jonny's, in every possible way. Strangely enough, Jonny felt a sense of joy coming from Lisa's mind as he thought about that. It seemed to him as though Lisa really, truly wanted Jonny to have her body and be in complete control over her like this. Jonny had to admit, he was impressed by her willingness and eagerness to let this happen to her. It proved to him not only how much control he could have over someone's mind, but how loyal of a servant Lisa was to him now, getting so much pleasure from allowling him free reign over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny took a second or two to feel over Lisa's curves and smile to himself again. Lisa's body was very nice. It was cozy and warm, and he felt so welcome inside of it...maybe he could stay for awhile and enjoy his time here...after all, he wasn't in THAT much of a rush for a new body, and Lisa would definitely not mind him overstaying his welcome in her skin. But that didn't seem quite fair to Lisa since there were so many options for new bodies so close at hand...unless he just decided to take Lisa's body for himself permanently and just put her soul into a new body and having her serve him from someone else....That could certainly work out as well....hmm, choices, choices... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Jonny was done feeling over his newly possessed body, he looked down at the lifeless corpse on the floor that he once called a meatsuit. His former body was covered in blood from the bullet wound and the blood was still draining out of the body, staining Lisa's carpet. \"Well, we can't have this mess, now can we?\" Jonny asked aloud in Lisa's sexy voice. He snapped Lisa's finely manicured fingers and the dead teenager suddenly disappeared in a puff of black smoke, to appear somewhere at the gala. No one would find anything unusual, he would just be seen as one of the unfortunate tragedies of the evening. Selina was bound to be heartbroken, but nothing could be done about that....or could it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked into Lisa's bathroom and looked directly at his sexy reflection in the mirror. \"Lisa...can you hear me?\" He asked, eyes glowing as he attempted to awaken Lisa's mind from it's forced slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmmmm....Master?</i> Lisa's voice asked, sounding rather groggy. Jonny could feel that there was now another active presence in his head, although he still had full control of Lisa's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I took over your body like you asked me to. I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you\" Jonny said, not knowing what this must feel like, being awake in your body but not having control of it. It didn't sound particularly fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa mentally giggled. <i>Not at all, Master. It feels great to know that you're using me in this way. Honestly, you having complete control of my body like this is getting me hot</i> she said, changing her tone a bit to flirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jonny laughed, though it sounded like a reflection of the giggle that Lisa had given him only a moment ago. \"But you'd rather be serving me right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just want to be as much of a help to you as possible, master. If you using my body is letting me do that for you, then I'm happy to let you be in the driver's seat for as long as you want.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do really like your body....I want to keep it for awhile. But I also want you to be out and about, serving me.\" Suddenly, Jonny out his hand on Lisa's stomach, feeling a raging pain in his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OWWWW!!!!! I've never hurt like this before!</i> Lisa exclaimed mentally, clearly sharing Jonny's pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's eyes glowed as he used his demonic energies to calm the pain. Lisa's body was now starting to sweat from the excretion and he was only barely able to give his reflection a reassuring smirk. \"I'm sorry Lisa....My transfer into your body and keeping my old form alive long enough to get here must have burned up a  lot more power than I hoped. You're feeling my demonic hunger. I need to eat a soul soon, or your body is going to burn out...and then none of us will be very happy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well then what are you waiting for??? Eat my soul, master! Let me die bringing you back to health!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I will not do that to you, Lisa. You mean too much to me.\" Jonny could swear that he could feel Lisa blushing inside of her body. \"I do need to eat soon, though. Which brings me back to what I was saying before. What would you say if I told you that I could take your soul out of my body and give you a new one? I'll eat their soul and then put you in their empty shell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mean I would get to serve you while you have my body? That would be very hot, master. You can put me in whoever you want. I can be a hot young girl for you. I'll even play the part of your slutty maid if that's what you want me to do! I'll do anything for you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I have someone in mind for you. How attached are you to Selina?\" Jonny could feel Lisa's uncertainty. Lisa immediately knew what it was that Jonny was asking and Jonny could tell that she was thinking things through from every angle. Selina had been Lisa's best friend since the two of them first met as roommates in college. They were closer than sisters, but Jonny's mental programming made Lisa's drive to serve him override all other thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lisa made her decision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i></i>I will take Selina's body if you wish it, Master.<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled a bit.  He knew it might be a bit strange for Lisa to be inside a body other than her own.  After all, Lisa wasn't a body-hopping demon who used up and changed bodies like old laundry, but she sure did love her master.  With that, Jonny's vessel disappeared in a puff of smoke as Jonny made his way back toward the gory scene of the very chaos he had caused only moments before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of dust and smoke signaled Jonny's arrival in a darkened stairwell of the grand and chaotic office building where the gala had been held.  Jonny felt again the familiar, gnawing pain in his belly, and he leaned Lisa's curvy body against the railing to steady himself in the darkness.  He felt weak.  He felt drained.  Jonny looked down at himself--at Lisa's body--in the darkness.  A bit of light from the \"Exit\" sign above him shone down and illuminated the tired demon and the body he now controlled.  Jonny looked down and saw that Lisa wore a tight-fitting set of red silk pajamas.  She must have gone up and put them on as soon as Jonny left for the event because she felt sick (which was, of course Jonny's doing) and wanted to rest.  Lisa's substantial bust pressed against the soft, smooth fabric, as did her wide, child-bearing hips farther down.  Jonny quickly felt his meat suit though . . . something felt--off.  His belly felt flabbier.  His thighs seemed to jiggle more as he shifted his weight, and his breasts seemed to droop more than he expected.  He examined Lisa's hand a bit.  He could not see well in the darkness, but it looked a little more veiny than normal--older, perhaps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing these thoughts aside, Jonny pushed the metal door open and stepped in the hallway.  Light shone down upon him as he stepped into the welter and chaos of the scene of the crime.  Cops and medics scurried about yelling to one another.  \"Put some pressure on that wound!\" came one frantic command.  \"Get him down to the ambulance now!\" came another.  Jonny smirked internally as he made his way through the throngs of people too busy to notice the pure oddity of a middle-aged woman running through the hall in pajamas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Master?<i></i> came Lisa's call.  Her voice sounded weak and far away.  Jonny looked around frantically.  Where the hell was Selina?  He looked down at himself.  It was as he had suspected--Lisa's body was beginning to shift.  Before she had been a curvy cougar--a sexy woman who jiggled in the right places.  But Jonny now looked down at a flabby middle that had aged and gained 20 pounds since he had last seen it.  His fingers looked pudgier too, and they were older.  They were the hands of a woman in perhaps her early sixties.  \"Damn!\" Jonny thought as he tried to surge forward as his vessel began to fall apart with him still inside it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked far down at the end of the hall.  At the end of the hall stood a doorway, and cops and medics and a couple people in suits seemed to be rushing in and out of the door at top speed.  \"There must be somebody important in there,\" Jonny said, resolving that that was where he needed to go.  Jonny began to make his way toward the blessed portal beyond which rested--well, he didn't really know who, but he needed to eat fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Sorry about that.  If you could--thanks,\" came the hurried and frantic requests of the demon Jonny as he asked people to move out of his way as he approached the doorway.  Finally Jonny stood before the door.  He reached for the handle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry ma'am, but you can't go in there,\" came a female voice.  Jonny was surprised.  He looked immediately to his right as the source of the voice moved between him and the door.  What Jonny saw was a woman probably between 30 and 35.  She was somewhat dark-complected, with dark hair and a toned body.  Her breasts were protruding beautifully from her chest, yet not at all sloppy or ill-kept.  Jonny looked at her bountiful cleavage for a moment before noticing her attached to her uniform--Diva Patel.  That made sense; the woman's skin was tanned, and it appeared she was of Indian ancestry.  \"Mam, you have to go,\" Diva said.  Jonny just smiled.  \"No . . . no I don't think I do,\" Jonny said as he placed his host's hand sternly upon the chest of the beautiful officer, and his eyes took on a familiar red glow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least they should have.  Jonny felt something akin to the surge of demonic energy he had been accustomed to, but it was weaker somehow, like a car engine that was trying to start but just couldn't turn over.  Jonny's demonic powers must have weakened as his expended his dwindling energies controlling Lisa's body.  Jonny looked up at the lovely Diva, who looked back with a confused expression.  Suddenly, she reached up and grabbed Jonny by the arm and slammed him into the wall, forcing his arms behind his back.  \"Mam, you should have just left when I told you to.  It's for your own safety.  You're going downtown,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" came a female voice from inside the room Jonny had been trying to enter.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny smiled as he looked about at the chaos he had wrought.  Brown the big man lay dead in a heap on the ground, and the collective mass of the crowd was either running for their lives\u2014perhaps afraid of some other gunman\u2014or surging forward to ensure the safety of the mayor or tend to one of the injured victims, some of whom were much more than injured.  In any event, it was chaos, all right.  As Jonny looked about at his handiwork, he spied a familiar face in the distance.  He gazed upon Katie, whose dark hair, deep blue eyes, and red dress he could identify anywhere at this point, especially all attached to a spectacular body.  Katie waived from across the way, and Jonny waived back through the throngs of screaming and crying people.  Figuring that he could go unnoticed in the carnage, Jonny disappeared in a puff of grey-red smoke and instantly reappeared right in front of Katie, who smiled to see him.  \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked pleasantly.  \u201cOh we\u2019ve got some exciting projects in the offing,\u201d Jonny said as he motioned to the mob, \u201cjust decided to shake up management a little bit,\u201d he explained as he sat down on a beer cooler that held refreshments for the evening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is your doing?\u201d Katie said as she sat next to him.  \u201cA bit, yeah,\u201d Jonny answered.  Katie paused for a minute.  \u201cYeah, I thought I saw a flash of red in that cop\u2019s eyes before he went ape-shit . . . figured that might have been you,\u201d she said.  \u201cYup,\u201d Jonny answered.  \u201cSo how\u2019s the restaurant going?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cGood,\u201d Katie answered, \u201cgot my powers now too\u2014I control the seven deadly sins . . . gluttony and lust and greed are my biggest profit centers, so that\u2019s handy.\u201d  Katie looked Jonny over.  \u201cI see you\u2019re making good use of my old body,\u201d she said with a smile.  Jonny chuckled, \u201cYeah, and if all goes well I\u2019ll be getting some ass in it tonight, or at least pretty soon, though the attempted murder-suicide may have killed the mood,\u201d Jonny mused.  \u201cWhich one is yours?\u201d  Katie asked.  \u201cUmmm,\u201d Jonny said as he searched the crowd, \u201cthat one over there, the one trying frantically to control the mob and boss the cops around,\u201d he said as he motioned to Selina.  Katie admired her.  \u201cNice ass . . . boobs are good too,\u201d she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap,\u201d Jonny said as he spied Selina making her way through the throngs of people to where he had stood, \u201cgotta keep up appearances,\u201d he said, as he disappeared in another puff of smoke only to reappear where he had stood only a few minutes before.  In the midst of all the screams, Jonny looked about himself.  His host\u2019s eyes glowed red for a moment and, across his forehead, there appeared an ugly gash, and blood ran down from it to his face.  Jonny ripped open his shirt and tore a couple buttons off his nice jacket, and he lay down on the ground and began to moan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny lay on the ground for a few second before Selina frantically ran up to him, kneeling on the ground with tears in her eyes.  \u201cOh my God, Jonny, are you all right?! What happened?!\u201d  Jonny moaned for another minute or so.  \u201cUm\u2014ah\u2014ow\u2014I . . . I think one of the waiters knocked me over when he ran, and one of his glasses fell on my head,\u201d Jonny said he held his hand to the cut in his head.  \u201cLet me see,\u201d she said as she examined the wound.  \u201cThat looks painful . . . we need to get you to a hospital!\u201d she said as she helped Jonny to his feet and rushed him of the roof the skyscraper and into an elevator.  Jonny stood in the elevator and leaned against the wall to steady himself.  As he looked at Selina, he could tell she was nervous . . . her lips were quivering, and she was holding back tears.  Jonny and Selina reached the ground floor and headed quickly to the car, Selina helping Jonny the whole way.  Selina put her date in the car and sped off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set now, though there was still light in the sky.  \u201cDoes it still hurt so much?\u201d Selina said as she looked over at Jonny but tried to focus adequately on the road too.  \u201cWell it\u2019s really not that bad,\u201d Jonny answered, \u201cI\u2019ve been cut by stuff before . . . doesn\u2019t feel great, but it doesn\u2019t kill me,\u201d he said, trying to calm her.  \u201cLisa\u2019s gonna kill me if I let anything happen to you!\u201d she said, obviously worried, \u201cI\u2019m a grown woman, and I\u2019m a cop.  It was my job to protect you tonight!\u201d she yelled, clearly distraught.  The car slowed as Selina began to pull of the road to fiddle with her GPS; she needed to find the nearest hospital.  With the car at a stop, Jonny saw an opportunity.  He placed his hand on Selina\u2019s, and his eyes glowed a familiar red; hers followed.  \u201cSelina, the cut hurts, but it won\u2019t kill me.  Try to be calm,\u201d Jonny said, and he released her.  She shook her head a couple times.  \u201cI at least need to get you a bandage,\u201d she said as she hurriedly stepped out of the car and ran in to a gas station where they had stopped.  Gas stations were really just little convenience stores now anyway\u2014got a bit of everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled to himself, surprised at the doting nature of Selina.  He\u2019d worked a bit of magic on her before in order to get himself invited to this thing, but the rest was all her . . . it was impressive.  He waited for a couple minutes and then heard a strange, vibrating sound.  He searched around for a minute until her found its source\u2014Selina\u2019s phone.  He picked it up and saw a picture of the beautiful red-haired Lisa on it.  \u201cShe\u2019s probably calling because she\u2019s heard about the shooting,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cshow time,\u201d he announced to himself as his eyes glowed red again, and he picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said, only this time it was Selina\u2019s womanly voice that escaped his lips.  \u201cSelina, oh my god I saw on the television!  Are you all right?  Where\u2019s Jonny?  Is he hurt?  Did my Jonny get hurt?  Where is he?  Is he still with you?\u201d she demanded in rapid-fire succession.  \u201cLisa, Jonny is all right . . . got a little bit banged up as people ran, but he\u2019s going to be fine.  He\u2019s resting right now, and I am going to take him home with me \u2018cause I\u2019ve got some stuff at the house that will help a headache he has,\u201d Jonny said in the voice of his date.  \u201cWel . . . all\u2014all right,\u201d Lisa said, calmer now, \u201cjust . . . just make sure you take care of him, will you?\u201d  \u201cOf course I will,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cin fact, he\u2019s going to be with me for a bit while I try to manage this crisis.  He told me he wants to major in public administration, so this will be a good bit of hands-on experience for the kid.  I initially thought it was a bad idea, but he convinced me.  He\u2019s very persuasive,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa chuckled, assuming that Jonny had mind-controlled Selina into the deal.  \u201cWell yes he is,\u201d she said, \u201cenough so that you may be waiting on him hand and foot by the time it\u2019s over,\u201d she said.  Jonny laughed back.  \u201cWell we\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he said, \u201cgotta go honey, he\u2019s waking up,\u201d Jonny said, and quickly hung up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Selina hurried back seconds after the phone call was over.  She bore bandages and rubbing alcohol.  \u201cThese should help,\u201d she said reassuringly.  She dabbed about the wound with the rubbing alcohol, causing Jonny to cringe a bit.  It stung.  \u201cSorry sorry,\u201d she said gingerly.  She then drew a bandage from the box and applied it slowly to the cut.  \u201cThere,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cis that better?\u201d  \u201cUm, yeah, it does feel a bit better,\u201d Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas Lisa or anybody called?\u201d she asked.  \u201cNo,\u201d Jonny lied, \u201cshe usually goes to bed pretty early, so I\u2019ll be back at the house by tomorrow when she figures out what happened,\u201d Jonny said.  Selina paused for a minute.  \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, as she looked about the fairly empty road.  She paused, seeming a couple times to want to say something but remaining silent.  She looked at Jonny.  \u201cWhat?\u201d Jonny asked.  Selina paused again.  \u201cWell,\u201d she began, \u201cwell, you know . . . there\u2019s the beach not far from here, and it\u2019s really nice, and it\u2019d be beautiful at night, and\u2014uh\u2014well . . .\u201d she stammered.  \u201cSay what you want to say,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cI would like it very much if you would go to dinner with me,\u201d she said as she stared straight into his eyes, \u201ctonight didn\u2019t go like I planned, and I\u2019ve got deputies all over the city looking for whoever did this, and I will have to be in the office all day tomorrow, but tonight I want to take you out for a real nice dinner by the ocean.  Would\u2014would you like that?\u201d she asked pensively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused for a minute.  He smiled.  \u201cYes, yes I\u2019d like that very much,\u201d he said.  Lisa beamed.  She put the car in gear and headed off toward the beach for the remainder of the evening.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The car slowed to a stop outside a restaurant as the sun\u2019s light dimmed in the sky.  \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try this place,\u201d Selina said with a smile.  \u201cIt looks nice,\u201d Jonny said as he climbed out of the car.  The waves crashed in the background, and the gulls echoed their call from the water.  The two walked toward the restaurant as the breeze rustled about.  Stepping inside, Jonny was greeted by the sound of a piano\u2014a sort of Tony-Bennett style melody with a singer dressed in a nice suit.  \u201cGood evening,\u201d said a middle-aged man in a very nice suit, \u201cwould the lady like a table a table outside this evening?\u201d  Selina seemed surprised by the luxury of the place.  \u201cOh, well, sure,\u201d she said as she looked to Jonny, \u201cyeah outside would be great,\u201d she said.  \u201cVery good.  Right this way,\u201d said the man, and they both followed.  They were led out on to the patio in full view of a now-dark sky and seated by the edge of it.  \u201cThank you,\u201d they both said as the man handed them their menus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by as they both decided what they wanted and ordered.  They gave the waiter their menus back and then looked to each other there in the night.  \u201cSo can I ask you something?\u201d Selina asked.  \u201cSure,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cThis thing\u2014this\u2014what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she began, \u201cour date . . . would Lisa mind this?  Would you parents mind this?\u201d she said pensively.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cRight now the important thing is that I don\u2019t mind this, not one bit,\u201d he said.  Selina smiled widely.  \u201cSo how long are you staying with Lisa?\u201d she asked.  \u201cWell,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cI think my family will actually be out of town for quite a bit longer than we thought . . . just got the call today, so not sure but a while,\u201d Jonny said.  Selina looked pleased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Selina started, \u201cwhen I asked you to come with me tonight, why did you say yes?\u201d Jonny chuckled a little.  Of course, Selina had no clue the only reason she had asked him at all was that Jonny\u2014a formless, shapeless demon who had forced his way inside the body of a young boy\u2014had used his supernatural powers to mind control her into having a crush on Jonny\u2019s meat suit which was about a quarter-century younger than that of the curvy officer.  Jonny figured spilling the beans on that one would screw up the romantic mood, so he kept it under wraps.  \u201cWell you said you thought I was cute,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cand I think you\u2019re kinda cute too,\u201d he said with a smile.  Selina blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, what do you want to do after college\u2014well first what do you want to major in I should ask,\u201d Selina inquired.  \u201cWell I really don\u2019t know what I want to major in . . . I like to write, so maybe English or History or something,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cand after that . . . not clue,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cworld domination!\u201d he said, smiling.  Selina laughed loudly,  \u201cAnd how do you plan to manage that?\u201d she asked.  \u201cOh well the plan had been to start collecting various minions,\u201d he said with a joking look, \u201cand maybe sometimes I\u2019d step in and do some things myself if I needed first-hand knowledge,\u201d he said.  She laughed again, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018step in yourself\u2019?\u201d she asked.  \u201cOh,\u201d Jonny explained, \u201cI was referring to body snatching,\u201d he said, laughing harder now, \u201cit\u2019s the ultimate way to be a fly on the wall\u2014I could be your greatest informant!  You know . . . posses the mob boss\u2019s wife just to keep an eye on him,\u201d he said.  Selina was laughing hysterically too.  \u201cWell you\u2019ve certainly got a vivid imagination,\u201d she said, wiping tears of laughter from her eyes.  \u201cOh do I ever,\u201d Jonny answered as he took a drink of water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were interrupted as the food came, and they ate in peace, chatting it up the whole time.  At the close of the meal, Selina leaned back in her chair, her belly full.  \u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d she said.  Jonny nodded.  The two sat and looked into each other\u2019s eyes.  The waves crashed on to the beach, and a bell rang in the distance.  \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Selina asked as she perked up and looked off into the distance.  \u201cI think it was the bell from the lighthouse,\u201d Jonny answered.  Selina smiled.  \u201cI love lighthouses,\u201d she said, \u201c . . . have since I was a little girl . . . always wanted my dad to take me on a tour of lighthouses \u2018cause they were so pretty, but he never would because he was afraid of heights.\u201d  Jonny turned around and peered about for a couple seconds.  \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Selina asked.  \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t think I see your dad around here,\u201d Jonny said with a mischievous smile.  Selina\u2019s jaw dropped when she discerned what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d she said, trying to hold back her laughter, \u201care you fucking serious?\u201d she asked.  \u201cWhy of course I am, my dear officer,\u201d Jonny said pleasantly.  \u201cOh my God you\u2019re just the cutest little thing,\u201d she said with a wide smile and deep laugh.  Within just a few minutes, the two of them were trekking along the beach with the sand seeping into their shoes and between their toes.  \u201cOkay, so, if we get caught, we\u2019ll just tell them you\u2019re a cop, right?\u201d Jonny said.  Selina shook her head, \u201cWe\u2019re not in the city anymore,\u201d she said, \u201cI have no jurisdiction here.\u201d  \u201cBest not get caught then,\u201d Jonny said with a laugh.  Within a few minutes, the two reached the lighthouse and traversed the rocky terrain that led to the door.  \u201cHere goes nothing,\u2019\u201d Selina said as she tried the door knob.  It was locked.  She tried to jimmy it open.  Still locked.  \u201cDamn . . . don\u2019t suppose you have minions nearby do you?\u201d she asked with a laugh.  Jonny shook his head, \u201cNope . . . still in the research and development stage on that one.  It\u2019s tough to find good help these days,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around it and see if there\u2019s another door,\u201d Selina announced, and off she went.  Jonny tried the doorknob only to have equally bad luck opening the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he said as he backed up.  Then he got a plan.  Suddenly, his eyes began to glow red, and he concentrated.  His tiny, frail body suddenly shot up about a foot into the air.  His entire body beefed up, as his arms became the size of tree trunks, and his thighs grew and expanded by orders of magnitude.  His belly suddenly surged forward, all of this shredding the suit that was designed for a much smaller frame.  Jonny gained about a foot and a half in height and three hundred some pounds of girth in a matter of seconds, and his gigantic body suddenly came to wear a spandex wrestling outfit, a theatrical ensemble befitting the six foot eight inch 400-pound body that had been dubbed \u201cThe Blob\u201d by WWF fans years before.  \u201cThis works,\u201d Jonny said as he beheld his huge, lumbering body.  He drew up his arms and forced them upon the old wooden door as hard has he could.  The door shattered like a toothpick as it flew clean off its hinges.  \u201cWho said violence never solves anything,\u201d Jonny said as he shifted quickly back into his own more familiar form, or rather Jack\u2019s.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at the opening in amazement, and then down at her pint-sized hero.  \u201cHow the hell did you\u2014\u201c she began, \u201cyou\u2019re not that big.  You\u2019re cute, but you\u2019re not Mr. Universe, so how did you open the door?\u201d she demanded.  Jonny laughed.  \u201cIt was like lifting a car during an adrenaline rush . . . my date said she wanted to tour the lighthouse, and the door was in the way, so, well, the door just had to go,\u201d he explained.  Selina shook her head in amazement as she stepped into the lighthouse and began her climb up the rustic, metal stairs.  Jonny followed close behind, ensuring he had a fine view of Selina\u2019s ass with her every step.  The climb was arduous, but the two reached the top in a few minutes.  Selina stopped in her tracks when she reached the top.  The wind rustled through her hair as started out on to the bay.  The lights of fishing boats dotted the darkened horizon, those lights being the only indication of whether the ocean stopped and the sky started.  \u201cIt\u2019s just as beautiful as I imagined,\u201d she said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny moved in close, putting his arms around Selina\u2019s mid-section, making a complete circle and clasping his hands together as they rested upon her belly.  He leaned in and kissed the side of her neck lightly.  She flinched a bit, as though it tickled, but certainly did not complain.  She turned around quickly and drew Jonny into a passionate kiss on the lips, pulling his small body close to hers.  As the two broke their embrace.  \u201cSo . . . gun shots notwithstanding, a good night?\u201d Jonny inquired.  Selina chuckled and smiled, \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cyes, a good night.  Thank you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat up there for the next hour or so, with Selina beginning to drift off to sleep as she was cradled in Jonny\u2019s arms.  She slowly stirred as the morning approached.  \u201cShit!\u201d she yelled as she suddenly jolted awake.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jonny asked, worried.  \u201cI can see light . . . the sun\u2019s starting to come up.  I\u2019ve got to get you back to Lisa\u2019s before she wakes up and there\u2019s been a shooting and you\u2019re not there!\u201d she said worriedly, \u201cand I\u2019ve got to get to work!\u201d  Jonny and Selina hurried down the metallic winding staircase and jogged quickly back to the car\u2014still parked where Selina had left it.  The two jumped in the car and headed back in the direction of the city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours, with the sun now peeking over the horizon more intently, Selina pulled her car up to the side of the road out in front of Lisa\u2019s house.  She put the car in park and paused thoughtfully.  \u201cI\u2014I really had a good time with you,\u201d she told Jonny, \u201cAnd, um, I would like to maybe do it again soon.  If Lisa will let me have you, maybe I can see you again tonight?\u201d she asked, \u201cBelieve it or not, my high school reunion is tonight, and I would love it if you could come an meet some of my friends,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cI\u2019d love that too,\u201d Jonny said.  He leaned in and kissed Selina passionately on the lips.  \u201cI think we\u2019ve got something here,\u201d Selina declared with a smile.  Jonny got out of the car, giving Selina\u2019s hand a squeeze as he did, and he closed the door.  Selina sped off in the direction of the police station to get to the work of managing the crisis that, little did she know, her own boy toy had begun.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa expected Jonny to be with Selina, but Selina expected him to be with Lisa for the day.  Intent on learning more about the workings of the city, Jonny headed in the direction of the police station.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny stood there on the street corner by Lisa\u2019s house.  He wanted to make sure that Selina arrived at the police station first\u2014it would not work unless she did.  So Jonny decided to walk, figuring that Jack\u2019s body should stay in good shape, so exercise was good.  He concentrated for a moment, and his host\u2019s eyes glowed red again.  His suit disappeared, and a twirl of black smoke replaced his outfit with a simple t-shirt and jeans.  With that, he set of on foot toward the police station.  Jonny walked through the pleasant suburbs and past the big, beautiful houses and the expensive cars and the well-kept lawns.  Eventually, these scenes gave way to city streets.  Car horns and rock music blared.  Random passers-by sometimes ignored Jonny, sometimes bumped into him, and sometimes said hello\u2014all of them totally unaware of the power of the raw demonic power swirling about inside his temporary human meat suit, that he could make them all his obedient playthings in mere moments if he so desired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about forty-five minutes of walking, Jonny was within sight of the station, a grand, multi-storied building that, today, had a throng of reporters outside it as people eagerly awaited any announcement of leads in the investigation of the shooting from the last evening.  Being fairly small, Jonny wedged his way past the crowds and into the front door of the place, and he stepped into a sea of confusion and panic.  People ran to and fro; papers flew everywhere, and phones rang off the hook.  A big banner hung over the chaotic scene\u2014\u201cWelcome New Recruits!\u201d it proclaimed.  Jonny had an idea.  He walked up to the front desk of the police station and grabbed the attention of the heavy-set older woman plopped pleasantly upon a chair.  She wore a police uniform that her girth had almost defeated, and she wore her hair like a grandmother . . . probably in her mid-60s.  \u201cHello,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cI\u2019m from the Mayor\u2019s office, and she would like to wish our new officers a hardy thanks for their service and best of luck on the job.  Could you point me in their direction, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s face changed from a pleasant smile to one of laughter.  \u201cSon,\u201d she said, motioning for you to come closer with her finger, \u201cturns our I know the mayor\u2019s assistant.  His name is Russ, and he\u2019s about forty-five years older than you, bald, and he\u2019s got himself a set of man-boobs that even my biggest bra would struggle to hold back, so why don\u2019t you get your cute little pre-pubescent ass out of here, and I\u2019ll forget you ever came in here and impersonated someone from the mayor\u2019s office,\u201d she said with a gotcha smile.  Jonny paused for a moment.  He motioned for the woman to lean in closer with his finger.  \u201cAll right, Alice, is it?\u201d he asked, looking to her name tag.  \u201cYes, Alice, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but the Mayor\u2019s been busy.  See, it seems that some whack-job from, well, this very office tried to kill the Mayor just ten or twelve hours ago.  So she\u2019s a bit frazzled.  We can handle this one of a couple ways.  One is that you can spend valuable police time and resources calling the Mayor and consuming the valuable resources of her office just to confirm that I am her new assistant because the whack-job from this office charged with protecting her actually killed her old assistant just last evening.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be more than happy to take time out of her schedule to listen to someone from the office that failed to protect her last night in the same incident that took Russ\u2019s life just so that she can confirm what is, let\u2019s be honest, the fairly trivial fact that I am her assistant.\u201d  Alice looked blind-sided, her eyes darting about in panic as she grasped the magnitude of the shit-storm that would ensue if she did such a thing.  \u201cOr, Alice,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cyou can avoid all that unpleasantness by just pointing my cute little pre-pubescent ass in the direction of the new recruits, and I will forget this ever happened.  Sound peachy?\u201d Jonny said with a fake smile.  Alice was speechless.  Without a word, the pointed in the direction of a hallway off to the right.  \u201cYou\u2019re a doll,\u201d Jonny said as he headed off in that direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked down the hallway past the people milling about and talking frantically into cell phones.  The hallway was a long white corridor with pictures of slain officers on the walls.  Jonny walked through the door at the end of the hallway and came upon a gathering spot filled with the bright young faces of new officers.  All the uniforms were crisp, and the badges and shoes were shined.  The ideals were riding high.  Jonny looked at the bright group of men and women, and then his mood soured.  \u201cPublicity,\u201d he said, \u201cthat won\u2019t do,\u201d and he looked about some more.  A few feet away was a door labeled \u201cWomen\u2019s Locker.\u201d  Jonny smiled.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the rest of the cops were distracted as they talked to each other.  Jonny walked in and looked about, finding no one else in the locker room.  \u201cExcuse me?\u201d he said.  He heard a noise from around the corner and walked in the direction of it.  As he rounded the corner, he saw a woman.  She looked to be about 24 years old.  She was a black woman\u2014at least in part.  Her skin was not very dark; he probably had one parent who was white and one who was African American.  The woman had a pretty face, smooth skin, and hair that was braided tightly together and that hung down her back.  She had a very toned body\u2014a stomach that was flat as a board, and she had muscular arms.  What really stuck out about her (both literally and figuratively) was her chest.  Despite a toned mid-section and muscular arms, this woman\u2019s breasts jiggled and shook as they sat proudly upon her chest.  They could not be seen in great detail because she had properly buttoned her police uniform, but they were large indeed.  Jonny could see by looking at her figure\u2014her wide hips especially\u2014that her ass was also worth seeing, but her front was to him at the moment.  \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the woman said kindly, \u201cbut this is the women\u2019s locker room . . . you don\u2019t look like a woman to me sir,\u201d she said.  Jonny chuckled as he walked toward her.  \u201cNo, no I suppose I don\u2019t at the moment,\u201d he said as he stuck out his hand to shake hers.  She kindly shook it.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cbut I\u2019m from the Mayor\u2019s office, and she sent me here to welcome new recruits and check in on them; ah, everything going all right?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m Officer Leah Brady,\u201d she said, \u201cand yes everything is going well.  I heard about what happened to the Mayor.  I do hope she\u2019s all right.  I am going to volunteer to be on the task force that looks for the guy who did that horrible thing,\u201d she announced.  \u201cMay I sit?\u201d Jonny said.  Leah nodded, and they both sat down upon one of the wooden benches in the locker room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was it that made you want to become a police officer?\u201d Jonny asked.  Brady sighed.  \u201cMy daddy was a police officer,\u201d she said, \u201cand he was killed in action in 1995\u20142 years after I was born.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cIt was hard on mom and me . . . mom had to work two jobs just to make the house payment, and I worked real hard in school because didn\u2019t ever want to have to do that for my kids, and I wanted to help my mom,\u201d she explained.  \u201cI went to college, which you don\u2019t have to do to do this job, but I was thinking the BA would let me move up faster . . . maybe one day I can work in the Mayor\u2019s office like you,\u201d she said.  \u201cLeah Brady, Chief of Staff to the Mayor,\u201d she said with smile, \u201cnice ring to it huh?\u201d she said.  \u201cYeah, yeah that\u2019s nice,\u201d Jonny answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I fit in here,\u201d she said, somewhat solemn suddenly.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cWell . . . got a lot of racists in this town,\u201d she said.  \u201cMy dad was a black man, and my mom was white . . . in some parts of the country that was illegal not too long ago,\u201d she said, \u201cand when I was a kid, it was the reason I didn\u2019t fit in anywhere . . . like havin\u2019 a foot in two houses at once, but not belonging in either one.\u201d  Jonny paused.  \u201cTo the mayor, there\u2019s only one color that matters\u2014red, red like the blood you put on the line to protect this city, and she thanks you for that,\u201d Jonny said.  Leah smiled widely.  \u201cThanks,\u201d she said.  \u201cYou\u2019ll fit in just fine,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry.\u201d  He shook Leah\u2019s hand pleasantly as she turned around to pick up her hat and head out with the other new recruits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leah turned away, she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sorry but I never did get your name\u2014who are you?\u201d  Jonny walked up behind the unsuspecting officer.  \u201cFor now, I\u2019m you,\u201d he declared as he jumped up and propelled his body in the direction of hers.  \u201cWhat the hell are you--!\u201d she began to scream as she struggled, but the process had already begun.  Because Jonny was already inside Jack\u2019s body, the process was a bit different from the norm.  Jonny\u2019s form dissolved into this kind of ooze-like substance, as Leah began kicking and struggling. It was as though Jonny was becoming some kind of sludge.  \u201cMy God!\u201d the woman screamed as she realized something was seriously wrong with her companion.  Jonny\u2019s form dissolved into a moving, thinking, devious pile of liquid that covered Officer Brady\u2019s uniform and then began to force its way down her mouth and up her nose.  Other parts of Jonny simply seeped into her uniform and into her body through her pours.  The woman\u2019s ample breasts shook as she struggled against an adversary that defeated her within only a few seconds.  The officer\u2019s buxom form fell to the locker room floor with a thud upon her gorgeous posterior.  The body\u2019s breathing slowed, and its muscles relaxed.  After a few seconds, it began to stir.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny\u2019s new eyes fluttered open.  He saw the world through them for the first time.  Slowly, he forced his body up, surprised at the weight of the orbs now upon his chest.  \u201cNever tried a double possession before . . . I guess it worked,\u201d Jonny mused as he looked down at his stolen form.  He had thought that being already inside Jack\u2019s body might pose a problem, but perhaps the fact that Jack\u2019s body carried no other soul allowed him to possess people without leaving it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slowly stood, feeling his shapely hips and ass strain against the officer\u2019s belt.  He looked at himself in the mirror, a smile spreading across Officer Brady\u2019s face.  He glanced down at his hands again, noting that his new body was African American\u2014or at least half so.  \u201cThis should be new . . . haven\u2019t been in a body like this before . . . \u201c he mused.  \u201cI\u2019m not worried about your fitting in, honey,\u201d he said to his new reflection, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I fit into you,\u201d he declared with a smile.  With that, Jonny turned and walked the body of the young, shapely woman sexily from the locker room.  \u201cTime to go see the Chief,\u201d Jonny said.         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny walked the body of the possessed officer out of the locker room and through the throngs of people darting about in the chaos of the bust station.  People yelled into cell phones, checked databases furiously, and anything else they could do to figure out who had been responsible for the attempt on the life of the Mayor.  Little did they know the culprit was right before them tucked into the body of one of their very own.  As a new recruit, Officer Brady wore her crisp new police uniform with pride, the tight, wrinkle-less uniform hugging her every luscious curve and her badge sparkling with the indelible shine of a bright future.  Jonny strutted through the police station, his wonderful ass gathering a few lustful stares from the convicts who sat handcuffed together on the benches nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Brady\u2019s possessed meat suit strutted up to the Chief\u2019s door and knocked politely.  \u201cCome in!\u201d came Selina\u2019s yell from the other side of the door.  Jonny entered and closed the door behind him, his host smiling warmly at her new boss.  Selina looked tired, and two cups of coffee sat upon her desk, even at this early hour.  She motioned for Jonny to sit down, which he did\u2014still getting used to the expanded rear end his current body carried.  \u201cGood to have you one the force, Officer Brady,\u201d Selina said, shaking Jonny\u2019s hand.  \u201cGood to be here,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this since I was a little girl.\u201d  Selina wasted no time.  \u201cSo what do you think we should do about this Mayor thing?\u201d she asked immediately.  Jonny was surprised that she would ask such of a thing of a new recruit.  He paused.  \u201cI\u2019d place round-the-clock guards at the Mayor\u2019s house and office, and if you can get the people to be feds or state guys that\u2019s even better because we don\u2019t know who we can trust after what Brown did,\u201d Jonny declared.  \u201cDone,\u201d Selina said, \u201cbut still good thinking.\u201d  Jonny felt pressed to come up with more.  \u201cAny unusual transactions in or out of Brown\u2019s account?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cChecked.  Nothing,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cWhat about other\u2014companionship?\u201d Jonny asked.  Selina frowned.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d  Jonny paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he began, \u201cI know that cops\u2014especially male cops\u2014sometimes get so stressed out by the job that they seek, well, prostitutes,\u201d Jonny said, not sure how Selina would react to a suggestion like that about one of her fallen officers.  Selina thought for a minute.  \u201cI had not considered that,\u201d she said, \u201cgood going rookie,\u201d she said as she stood up.  \u201cYou\u2019re with me,\u201d she declared as she walked out of the room.  Somewhat surprised, Jonny stood up and followed.  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Jonny asked.  Selina responded as the two stepped out into the parking lot and headed for Selina\u2019s car, \u201cThere\u2019s a whorehouse on the edge of town.  If Brown was getting his fucks from anywhere other than his wife, that\u2019s where he\u2019d go,\u201d she said as the two got into the car and started in that direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rolled through the streets of the city over the potholes and past the empty storefronts with broken windows.  \u201cThis was a nice place when I was your age,\u201d Selina said, \u201cyou\u2019re like 22 or 23 right?\u201d  Jonny nodded.  \u201cI remember my mom told me when my dad died that this place was going downhill,\u201d Jonny said, tapping into his host\u2019s memories.  He let himself be overcome by Officer Brady\u2019s emotions\u2014seeming to choke back tears.  Selina noticed.  \u201cI bet that was hard for you,\u201d she said, \u201cgrowing up the daughter of a black father and a white mother . . . how did you cope with that?\u201d  Jonny paused.  \u201cI dreamed a lot\u2014about a job I could do that would make things better, one that would make people respect me.  That\u2019s why I am so excited to have this job.  Ever since I put on the uniform, well, it\u2019s like something all new has gotten into me,\u201d Jonny said, chuckling on the inside.  \u201cWell I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here Leah,\u201d Selina said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis job will pull you in fifty different directions at once.  You\u2019ll want a family, friends, dates, time off, and all that stuff, but especially early on you just won\u2019t have time,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to get minions,\u201d replied the possessed officer.  Selina smiled a bit.  \u201cWhat is it chief?\u201d Jonny asked.  Selina paused again and shook her head.  \u201cNothing . . . just . . . you\u2014you reminded me of someone is all,\u201d she declared as the two pulled into the parking area in front of the building Selina had talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a house that, at one time, must have been very nice, but had seen better days.  Shutters fell off, pieces of the siding rotted.  Still, lights were on inside.  \u201cWait here for five minutes, then come in.  I\u2019ve dealt with these bitches before, and I want to talk to them alone before you do anything,\u201d Selina instructed.  \u201cGot it chief,\u201d Jonny responded.  Selina exited the car and walked up to the house.  Inside Leah Brady\u2019s body, Jonny watched Selina\u2019s curvaceous ass as she strutted up to the house and entered the door.  Jonny sat in the car and waited a few minutes.  He examined his new face in the car\u2019s mirror.  \u201cFitting in just fine, my dear,\u201d he said to his vessel with a smile.  After a couple more minutes, Jonny exited the car and walked up to the old house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered to find Selina talking to an older woman.  This woman appeared to be in her mid-fifties and was trying to stay a whole lot younger.  She seemed to have had several botox injections and a face lift or two.  Her boobs were so big they were obviously fake, and her lips were massive.  This aging madam had destroyed her body just to try to stay young, which failed anyway.  \u201cYou say Brown\u2019s favorite girl was this one?\u201d Selina demanded as she held up a picture.  \u201cYes, but she\u2019s long gone now.  She took her fake tits and bolted as soon as Brown\u2019s story ended up all over the news.  How\u2019s that going, by the way?  I do hope nothing happens to you, my dear officer,\u201d the woman said with mock sincerity.  \u201cI\u2019ll bet you do bitch,\u201d Selina said.  The woman eyed Jonny when he came in.  \u201cBabe,\u201d she said, \u201cif you ever figure out how underpaid you are, give me a call.  I could use new women, especially with bodies like yours.  I\u2019ve got a man who insists on trying out every biracial girl in my employ, and you\u2019d make me a bundle,\u201d she said with a smile as her eyes crawled all over Jonny.  \u201cI\u2019d like to make you a prisoner,\u201d Jonny replied flatly.  \u201cI\u2019ve got cuffs very close by,\u201d the woman said as she attempted a sexy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy partner and I will take a look around,\u201d Selina said.  The woman let them do so as the two women walked down the hall.  The two split up and went to separate rooms.  Jonny walked gingerly inside Leah\u2019s body, careful not to make too much noise in case somebody actually was about.  He slowly entered a bedroom with the shades drawn.  A couple pairs of handcuffs and a feather boa hung sexily from the bedpost.  This place just looked like a fuck palace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny heard the click of a gun.  He stopped.  Looking in the direction of the noise, he saw a very large white male dressed in biker clothes that were too small for him.  His hairy belly bulged out beneath an ill-fitting muscle shirt.  The man looked disheveled and lecherous.  He looked upon Jonny with hungry eyes.  \u201cDon\u2019t you dare even jiggle that ass honey,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2019cause if I even think you\u2019re going for that gun, I\u2019ll blow a hole through those beautiful, bouncy tits of yours, and that\u2019ll be a shame,\u201d he said.  Jonny just chuckled a little bit.  He was sure Selina was occupied elsewhere.  \u201cMy dear man,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cI haven\u2019t needed a gun in a century.\u201d  The man looked puzzled for a minute.  Suddenly, Jonny concentrated, and from his hand shot a giant, swirling ball of energy, dust, and black smoke.  This ball of pure power flew at the man and struck him.  It lifted his big, bloated body off the ground easily and sent him flying out the window with a loud crash.  The man was dead while in mid air, and his lifeless and limp body fell roughly to the ground outside, lifeless.  \u201cI take my boobs very seriously,\u201d Jonny said with a grin to his now-absent assailant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another noise came from elsewhere in the room.  It sounded tiny, like a whimper.  Jonny immediately turned his host\u2019s head in the direction of the noise, only to find a closet door.  \u201cInteresting,\u201d he said as he slowly walked in the direction of the door.  He reached Leah\u2019s hand up and slowly took hold of the doorknob.  Suddenly, he yanked the door open, ready for a fight from whatever was inside.  What he saw surprised him a great deal.  He beheld only a small boy\u2014could not have been more than seven or eight.  The boy had blonde hair and an innocent face, and he bore a Power Rangers t-shirt with great pride.  Jonny stepped back, surprised.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHi there,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d The boy looked up at him, and his face carried the remnants of recent tears.  \u201cMy name is James,\u201d he said meekly as he huddled back into the darkness of the closet.  \u201cHi, James, I\u2019m Leah,\u201d Jonny said, preferring to use the female name that fit his body, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you come on out here,\u201d he said as he motioned for the boy to come forward.  James very slowly stepped toward the light.  \u201cThis is no place even for a brave little boy with a Power Rangers shirt, James,\u201d Jonny said, \u201chow did you get in here?\u201d  James paused.  \u201cMy mommy works here,\u201d James said, \u201cshe said I had to stay in the closet while she worked.\u201d  Jonny took him by the hand and led him out of the closet.  He bent down so that he could look James in the eye.  Jonny looked around and listened for Selina nearby, but noticed no trace of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought for a minute.  One way to endear himself to Selina was to prove that he was a worthy cop, or at least that his present meat suit was.  He smiled as a thought crossed his mind.  \u201cHey, James,\u201d he said, \u201chow would you like to be a big boy and help out a police lady?\u201d  James smiled, \u201cSure!\u201d he chirped.  \u201cAnd help me you shall,\u201d Jonny said as he placed his hand on the small boy\u2019s shoulder, both sets of eyes now glowing bright red.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames began to change, and his form relaxed.  His body first began to lengthen, going from about four and a half feet tall to about five foot seven in a few seconds.  His skin got a few shades lighter.  Jonny watched as the boy\u2019s entire body began to writhe and bubble around, like a thousand tiny little bugs moving around inside of him.  His arms became dainty and feminine.  His legs became long and slender, and suddenly his ass flared out into a beautiful, heart-shaped posterior.  His belly became flat as a board, and suddenly two large, bouncing globes formed on his chest.  Wonderful mounds of flesh surged forth.  His face then began to contort until it was obviously that of a 24-ish-year-old female.  His blonde hair lengthened until it was half way down his back and was a fiery red color.  Suddenly, smoke engulfed the newly-made woman.  When the smoke left the woman, she wore beautiful lingerie\u2014lacy red panties and a bra of the same color that struggled to contain the beautiful breasts that seemed to be trying to break free.  Jonny stepped back and looked at his new creation.  The new woman shook her head a couple times and looked down at herself.  Her eyes widened as she look back up at Jonny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2014what are these!?\u201d she exclaimed as she felt her breasts, \u201cwhat\u2019d the big cop lady do to me?!\u201d the woman said, and tears formed in her eyes.  Suddenly, Jonny stepped in, eyes glowing red again as he placed his feminine hand on the woman\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cYou\u2019re Ruby Redlace, sweet cakes, the hooker from the picture.  Now hike those tits up and act like it,\u201d he instructed.  The woman suddenly straightened up, now suddenly comfortable in her body.  Jonny stepped back and looked on approvingly.  \u201cNo reason the chief ever needs to know you aren\u2019t the real thing,\u201d she said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny suddenly took the woman by the hands and cuffed her.  \u201cGot her!\u201d she yelled out, and Selina soon came running.  She stopped as she beheld her new recruit\u2019s catch.  \u201cThe madam said she was gone, but I thought she was lying,\u201d Jonny explained as he hustled the new hooker out of the room.  Selina beheld the broken window with spatters of blood that the fat man with the gun had gone through.  \u201cWhat happened there?\u201d she asked.  Jonny thought fast.  \u201cWhen I came in a guy was already in here.  When he saw that I was a cop, he dove out the window and caught his belly on a piece of glass that didn\u2019t break right . . . bled out outside,\u201d she declared as the two made their way down the hall.  The madam\u2019s jaw dropped as the two officer walked by her with the woman she had been sure was gone.  They walked the handcuffed woman out to the car and put her in the back seat.  \u201cI\u2019ll give you a good fuck for free if you let me go!\u201d she pleaded just before Selina shut the door.  Selina and Leah stood outside the car for a minute.  They looked at each other.  \u201cNot bad at all for your first day rookie; I\u2019m very impressed,\u201d she said.  \u201cThanks boss,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cOh by the way, when I was waiting to go on in, there was a message from dispatch.  It seems you had a call . . . some kid named Jonny said he had a great time and that he wanted to see you tonight\u2014suggested eight at the boardwalk.  Dispatch actually used the word \u2018kid.\u2019\u201d Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina chuckled and blushed a little bit.  \u201cSend them a message to call him back and tell him I\u2019ll see him at the boardwalk at 8.  Yeah he\u2019s a kid, but he\u2019s really, um,\u201d she paused, blushing, \u201creally really great.\u201d  The two officers got into the car and headed back to the station with the manufactured hooker in their care.             <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny rode back to the station with Selina with James-turned-Ruby-Redlace in the back seat.  The hooker personality had taken over, and the apparent woman in the back offered several sex acts in exchange for letting her go in the few minutes it took them to return to the station.  The officers got out and gingerly removed their captive from the back seat.  Her scantily-clad body garnered a number of looks from passers-by as the threesome walked into the station.  An unnamed officer took the voluptuous prostitute to a jail cell.  \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll start talking soon,\u201d Selina declared as the woman strutted sexily in the direction of the jail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina then turned to Leah.  \u201cOkay rookie,\u201d she began, \u201cso here\u2019s something you have to know about the Mayor.  She\u2019s . . . odd.  It didn\u2019t just start when somebody tried to kill her, but that sure as shit didn\u2019t help.  We\u2019ve kept it from going public, but she\u2019s desperate to find out who did this.  She\u2019s called in the services of someone who is rather . . . well . . . unique,\u201d Selina explained.  \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2018cause I haven\u2019t met her yet.  Just humor the mayor, and humor me, and sit through the meeting . . . it should go until about six o\u2019clock, and then we\u2019ll have you out of here, okay?\u201d she asked.  \u201cSure thing boss,\u201d Leah\u2019s possessed body said.  \u201cOkay,\u201d Selina said, \u201cmeet in the conference room in ten minutes,\u201d she said as she walked in the direction of her office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah walked into the bathroom in the police station and stood before the mirror.  He looked upon his host\u2019s pleasant face.  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, honey, and this is going to be the start of a beautiful partnership,\u201d he said to her.  He felt up his toned belly and bouncy chest, enjoying every moment of his exploration.  Suddenly, Jonny felt a sharp pain run through his borrowed body.  He quickly grabbed the bathroom counter with his host\u2019s hands to steady himself as he felt the searing pain in his head, and his host\u2019s muscles tensed up suddenly.  Jonny\u2019s vessel convulsed and shook for a minute involuntarily, almost like a person who lies in bed and suddenly, and for no reason gets the sense that he is falling, only to realize a fraction of a second later that all is well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d Jonny asked his reflection, a forlorn look on her face.  He took a couple deep breaths and waited for a couple minutes there to calm himself.  \u201cTime to get this dog and pony show out of the way,\u201d he said as he walked out of the bathroom and toward the conference area.  When Jonny arrived, most of the other officers were already present.  The room was a large one with a big table at the front around which people could sit.  Near the entrance of the room were many chairs for onlookers.  This was the sort of place the Mayor might come to address the assembled police force, and the police would sit in the mass of chairs.  Today, though, it would be someone different at the front of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny inside Leah walked in and sat quietly in the back of the room, wedging his beautiful rump into a chair.  The man next to her leaned over to explain.  \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s gone a bit off the deep end and called in some psychic witch Miss Fucking Cleo or some shit . . . Mayor wants it, so we gotta waste our time with it.\u201d  Jonny nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes later, Selina walked up to the front of the room, and everybody quieted down.  \u201cOkay, thank you all so much for coming,\u201d she began.  \u201cAs you know, the attack on the Mayor has rattled us all, and I know you are all working very hard to figure out who is to blame for this and to bring that person to justice.  To that end, I\u2019m very pleased that we have a true professional here today, someone with unique expertise whose help will be invaluable.  It is my pleasure to introduce Ms. Lena Mesmera,\u201d Selina said as she stepped to the side and began clapping lightly for the guest.  The rest of the force got the message and began the obligatory golf clap in unison as the door behind Selina opened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the room stepped an unusual figure.  It was a woman seeming to be about 45 or maybe 47 years old.  She had a very pretty face, though there were a couple lines around her eyes.  Her chest stuck out both literally and figuratively, as two beautiful mounds of flesh hung from it, jiggling as she walked in.  Her general frame was curvy and voluptuous with a wee bit of flab in her belly and a pair of wide, child-bearing hips and meaty thighs.  Jonny could not see it, but her ass was probably something to behold.  All of this beautiful body was encased in a purple dress that was low-cut in the front and showed off the blessed bounty of fleshy riches that sat perched upon this woman\u2019s chest.  The dress was purple velvet and had some beads hanging from it.  It was like some kind of gypsy clothing or something.  Her pants were simple, form-fitting black leather that hugged her beautiful hips and her ass.  Much farther up, the woman\u2019s hair was jet black and ran down much of the way down her back, certainly well past her shoulders.  Somewhat oddly though, a few very defined streaks of white were clearly visible in her hair.  At about 47-ish, the white hair did not seem to fit this woman\u2019s beautiful, curvy body, but it was still pretty.  Her fingers were filled with rings of various shapes and sizes and colors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening sinners and skeptics!\u201d the woman said, a wide-eyed and strange look across her pretty face as she gesticulated wildly.  \u201cToday, we\u2019re going to make a grand journey into the unknown together\u2014you and I\u2014and we shall peer into the world beyond this one.  I hope for the support of the believers among you and for the tolerance of the rest!\u201d she declared.  She shook the hand of Selina, and suddenly her face took on a look of surprise.  \u201cOh my dear it seems you have already been touched by the paranormal\u2014by worlds beyond this one,\u201d she said.  Selina looked rather confused.  \u201cPerhaps I have, but I have no clue,\u201d she said with a laugh.  Lena chuckled back as she sat down, \u201cWell someone certainly knows, my child,\u201d she said.  This strange gypsy woman now had Jonny\u2019s attention.  Just by touching Selina, she could tell something was amiss\u2014that something was off about her.  How could she know that?  The woman sat in the center of the table and joined hands with the other officers at the front of the room.  \u201cDo you have any personal effects of this man\u2014this, officer Brown?\u201d she asked.  Within a couple seconds someone produced Brown\u2019s watch, which he kept in his locker.  \u201cSplendid,\u201d Lena said as she set it before her on the table and concentrated upon it.  The whole room was silent, save for a couple snickers from those who could not keep it together anymore.  Jonny watched intently.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Speak through me!\u201d she yelled.  Suddenly, the lights in the room dimmed.  Murmurs rose from the audience.  This was weird.  The woman at the front of the room began to jerk and spasm about a little bit, just as one of Jonny\u2019s vessels would upon being possessed.  \u201cBrown says he was a tool,\u201d the woman declared as she jittered and jiggled about, \u201che says the true killer is still among us.  Here now!\u201d she said.  Jonny had no way of knowing whether anybody believed any of this.  They probably didn\u2019t; how could they?  But he knew the truth.  And somehow this woman was sniffing around it within minutes of showing up.  Leah\u2019s eyebrows arched in surprise as she beheld the spectacle before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny began to get very intense headache.  The pain seemed to force its way upon his otherwise calm and peaceful mind.  Jonny held his host\u2019s hand to his head in an effort to quell the pain.  Suddenly, he began to sweat.  Within a couple minutes, sweat was rolling off Leah\u2019s head and soaking her uniform as it made its way down to her bountiful cleavage.  Jonny tried to fan himself, but he just kept getting hotter.  Suddenly, a loud growl could be heard.  Jonny looked down to see that the source of the growl was his host\u2019s belly!  \u201cThere you are,\u201d came Lena\u2019s voice.  But the voice was not from Lena in front of the room . . . it was instead from Lena and inside Jonny\u2019s head!  \u201cIIIIII foooounnnnd youuuuuuu,\u201d came the taunting voice of the woman searing her way into Jonny\u2019s mind.  Jonny\u2019s host body began to shake, to tremble.  \u201cLady, you all right?\u201d said the heavy set man beside Jonny.  \u201cYe\u2014yeah I\u2019m . . . . I\u2019m f\u2014fine,\u201d Jonny stammered as he tried to calm himself.  What was wrong with him.  \u201cYou keep telling yourself that, little one,\u201d came Lena\u2019s voice again, still audible only to Jonny.  Jonny stood and tried to quietly make his way out of the room on his borrowed body\u2019s trembling lets.  He wiped sweat from his eyes.  As he closed the door behind him, he began to make his way through the people milling about in the public area, which he had to get through to make it to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny staggered through the station, sick and shaking inside Leah\u2019s body.  Jonny bumped into someone and looked up.  \u201cS\u2014sorry,\u201d he stammered.  The person he had bumped into was Alice\u2014the heavy-set sixty-something receptionist from before.  As Jonny looked into her eyes, he noticed something different.  They glowed a bright purple!  \u201cI hope nobody figures out it was you,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019d be awkward.  Jonny pushed right past her, determined to calm himself.  As he neared the restroom door, someone tapped him on the shoulder.  He shakily turned around to one of the convicts handcuffed and dressed in a jumpsuit looking into her eyes.  \u201cWhat would everyone think?\u201d he asked her, his eyes filled with the purple glow too.  \u201cShut up!\u201d Jonny said as he turned and hurried on.  As small boy crossed his path as he held his mother\u2019s hand.  \u201cBetter hope nobody tells the chief,\u201d the boy said, his eyes unnatural as well, and then he walked on.  Jonny found his way to the restroom and forced his way in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Leah, he staggered up to the mirror and beheld his frazzled visage.  Sweat rolled down the face of his host body.  It looked tired, worn.  \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be in there, are you?\u201d came Lena\u2019s voice again, \u201cNo, no I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d  Jonny examined his body in the mirror.  Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his head, \u201cArrrrrgh!\u201d he screamed.  When he opened his eyes, he saw, not Leah\u2019s reflection in the mirror for a second, but rather Jack\u2019s.  He closed his eyes again, thinking his eyes deceived him.  When he opened the again, it was his current vessel looking back at him, but the reflection had a mind of its own.  \u201cDid I give you permission to possess me?\u201d Leah\u2019s reflection demanded of Jonny, \u201cI have crimes to solve, and I want you out!\u201d she screamed.  Jonny blinked again and looked back\u2014all seemed normal.  \u201cWhat the fuck is happening?!\u201d Jonny called out.  Jonny\u2019s vessel then disappeared in a puff of black smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny reappeared far away on a mountaintop west of town.  It was peaceful here, and one could look out over the city.  Jonny lay on the ground as he slowly regained his strength, recovering from the influence of whatever it was that had forced its way into his mind and so interfered with his ability to keep control of his vessel.  He sat on his knees, panting.  \u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d he yelled to himself.  \u201cGet down here and explain yourself, you old fuck!\u201d Jonny yelled at the top of his host\u2019s lungs.  There was a sudden clap of thunder from above.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bellowed, my child,\u201d said the Old Man\u2019s raspy voice as he now stood before Jonny in his hat and trench coat.  Jonny looked up at him as though he had just survive a fight.  \u201cI did,\u201d Jonny confirmed, \u201cbecause some gypsy bitch has waaay too much power.  I rumbled with her, and she damn near forced me out of this meat suit.  You know how hard it is to kick me out of a body?!  Is there something you forgot to fucking tell me?!\u201d Jonny demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man paused for a minute.  \u201cSo,\u201d he began, \u201cshe\u2019s returned.\u201d        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny crossed Leah's arms underneath her ample breasts. He closed his host's eyes and took a deep breath in and out, getting back his composure. He focused on removing Leah's perspiration and cooling off her body temperature a bit, making her uniform clean once again. He then unbuttoned the uniform top so that Leah's cleavage could breath a bit before looking at the Old Man, who appeared to be in deep thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...can I get an explanation from you please?\" she asked, tapping her foot on the ground in a nervous manner. Whoever that psycho bitch was, she had Jonny scared. And that was something that Jonny definitely didn't like being. \"What the hell do you mean that she's returned?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man looked over Jonny's meatsuit and gave him a strange look, as if he weren't sure what information would be best to share. He then sighed. \"I suppose you have a right to know given given that she's already made her move against you...That 'gypsy bitch' that you spoke to is far from what she appears. Though she gives the outward appearance of being a charlatan and fake at what she does, it is only her strategy to hide in plain sight. You'll be grateful to know that no one at the police station took her seriously, but those who make it their business know exactly what she truly is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is she?\" Jonny asked, still nervous, holding his arms around his stolen chest tightly as if he were scared to give up what he had. the sensation of almost being ripped out from his body was something that he never wanted to experience again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the oldest and most powerful witch in the world. But on top of that, she is also something much more dangerous...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny raised an eyebrow. \"What else could she be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man responded to the question by doing something that Jonny had never seen him do. He smiled. \"She is my daughter\" he said as Jonny's jaw dropped. The Old Man chuckled before continuing, \"I won't bore you on how that happened, but what I will tell you is that she is about half my age, making her somewhere in the 1000s in human years. I can barely remember how old I am, much less exactly how old my only offspring is, so I cannot give you an exact age. She is half human and half...well, me. That makes her exponentially more powerful that the average demon. Luckily for you, you are my alpha demon, making her only about double your strength....I'm afraid that the two of us have always had a little game going on. She always knew what I was and I even took some years to train her and teach her powerful magic. Before I had demons to do my work for me, she was my lovely assistant, helping me to accomplish my goals. Unfortunately, like all children, she entered a rebellious phase after a century or two of blind loyalty. She started to get greedy and try to do my job for me, convinced that she was better at spreading chaos and corruption than I was. It got rather annoying so I disappeared from her life and left her alone to do her own thing. She didn't take to kindly to that and dedicated her life to perfecting the magic that I had taught her, hoping to prove herself in my eyes by taking the reigns from me. Thanks to her abilities, her body ages at an incredibly slow rate and she has nearly unlimited spiritual abilities, allowing her to communicate with souls of the deceased, possess the bodies of others at will while remaining within her main body, and can....interfere with my demons. I believe she demonstrated all of those for you. She also has many other abilities that she has learned over the years, though she likes to keep them hidden and even I do not know all that she is capable of. To be honest, I was under the impression that she was content to live a simple life as a freelance witch, but now I see that she was just biding her time. She has clearly gotten strong enough that she feels she can challenge my authority and has made her first strike against me by striking at you. I am terribly sorry about that, Jonny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded, not for a second believing that the Old Man could ever be genuinely sorry about anything. \"So what do I do about her? Based on some of the things she was saying, it looks like she wants me out of the picture.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be too sure about that. Lena is mischievous and playful above all else. Despite her age in human years, she's mentally about the same age that you are currently, maybe even a little younger. She wants to have fun and not be bored above anything and is playing with you like a shiny new toy. You're the first alpha demon that I've made so she probably finds you interesting. I think you can use that to your advantage and I have no doubt that you can talk your way into her not destroying you. On top of that, you've now been in my presence long enough to get some of my strength. That should get you on almost equal playing field with her. Best of luck...\" the Old Man said before disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Come back you-\" Jonny started before being transported back to the bathroom. \"Bastard!\" He yelled, realizing he was looking at Leah's body in the mirror again. Jonny sighed, feeling incredibly annoyed as he re-buttoned Leah's uniform top and leaving the restroom. He looked around, smiling that all the conversation he could hear was about how much of a fake that woman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you alright, rookie?\" Jonny jumped, feeling his stolen chest jiggle as he turned around to look at Selina looking at him with a worried look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I'm fine, chief\" he said, thinking of a story. \"I...I've just been a bit under the weather recently. I was trying to hide it all day because I wanted to be here for my first day.\" He made himself blush a bit and look down at the ground embarrassed. \"I took some medicine, so I should be good for awhile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled and put a hand on Jonny's shoulder. \"You know, you're really strong for a rookie...I like you, Leah\" she said as her eyes suddenly turned purple. \"I think you'll be lots of fun to play with\" she said, giving Jonny a wink before her eyes became their regular color again. Without skipping a beat, Selina continued, \"Anyway, I really need to get back to my office. Why don't you take the rest of the day to just relax?\" She said, removing her hand from Jonny's shoulder and walking away. Jonny frowned, turning around and heading in the opposite direction. He hoped that was the last he would see of her for a while, but something in Jonny's gut told him that he wouldn't be so lucky. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny took a deep breath. That witch bitch would get annoying very quickly if he didn't figure out a way to deal with her fast. It may be clear that no one in the police force had actually believed in her abilities, but that didn't change the fact that she knew what Jonny was and even what body he was in. Right now his best course of action was to get out of his Leah's body and find a new meat suit that Lena wouldn't know. That way it would take her some time to find him again. On that note, Jonny walked Leah's form back to the locker room he had first found her in and put his hands onto her chest one last time. \"You know, I'll really miss your body. It was a great experience\" he said, giving his stolen breasts a squeeze as he closed his eyes to will himself out of Leah's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown appeared on Leah's face. Something was wrong. Jonny concentrated on leaving his body again, but nothing happened. What the hell was going on? Leah's heart was beating faster now. This wasn't right. Jonny closed his eyes and once again tried to leave Leah's body to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, dear?\" A voice asked. Jonny spun around to see Lena Mesmera sitting down on the locker room bench, her legs crossed. A mischievous smile was on that face was of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did you do to me, you bitch?\" Jonny asked, clearly angry, and even somewhat nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmera just kept that grin on her face as her purple eyes glowed ever so faintly. Jonny felt a powerful ache in his head as he collapsed onto the floor, putting his hand on his head, trying to quell the pain. \"Now now, dear. Is that really any way for such an attractive new officer like yourself to talk?\" she asked, not giving Jonny any time to react. \"I've made things more interesting for you, Jonathon\" she said, calling him by his full name, looking down on him in a condescending way. \"You see, I can tell how much you liked Ms. Brady's body. To be fair, who wouldn't? She's young, beautiful and exotic. She really is a nice catch, you know\" she said with a wink before continuing. \"Anyway, I've done some tweaking with my abilities. You'll find that all of your demonic powers remain in tact, but you will be unable to leave your current host body unless I allow you to. This way, I get to know exactly where you are at all times and I know you won't be trying to avoid my fun. Trust me, dear. Things will be getting fun very soon\" she said, still having that condescending smirk on her face, making Jonny angry. If the pain in his head wasn't keeping him on the ground, he would punch her right in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena snapped her fingers and suddenly, the pain disappeared from Leah's head as quickly as it came. The possessed cop girl stood up slowly, feeling over her body, making sure she was okay. Something felt....strange, but she couldn't put his finger on it. \"Wh-what did you do to me?\" She asked, confused, trying to figure out what was wrong with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena let out a laugh as she looked at the possessed young woman. \"Oh, nothing too bad. I just made it a bit easier for you to blend in\" she said, still grinning as her eyes glowed their faint purple. \"I've fused your host's personality and memories into your demonic soul. As long as you remain inside of her body, which will be until I say otherwise, you will find yourself in Leah's footsteps rather easily. Being her will come as second nature to you and I think you'll find yourself developing a new way of thinking rather quickly as a result. Just be careful, the more you seep into your memories and personality, the more your demonic soul becomes human and permanently fuses to your body. Don't worry though. If I decide to release you from your body you'll be reset back to your normal demonic self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do I have to do to let you release me?\" she asked, clenching her fists angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smirked. \"Let's just say I've left a few surprises for you around this station, dear. Think of them as tests, if you will. Pass all of your tests, and I'll lt you out of this little prison I've put you in. However, if you fail your tests, I will not. You will be lost to your new identity forever. My guess is that it'll take about 24 hours for you to lose yourself completely to your new life, maybe sooner if you over exert yourself\" she says with a grin. \"Oh and don't even think about calling my daddy and having him try to free you. He's incredibly powerful, but demons are weak against magic. He'll be content to watch you try to figure things out for yourself. Good luck, Leah. I'll be watching you very closely\" she said with a wink before disappearing in a puff of purple smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah frowned, looking down at her body and sighing. This would be a long day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena Mesmera reappeared at a table with a purple cloth over it and a large crystal ball sitting at it's center. She placed her hand on the crystal ball and smiled, chanting one of her spells as her eyes glowed brightly purple. Suddenly, Lena could see everything she needed. She reached out her powers touching those who she wanted to use in her tests with her will. Lena would have her fun with the possessed Leah Brady, and if everything went her way, her fathers prized alpha demon would cease to exist, and she would have a new apprentice to train in her ways and use against her father. Speaking of her father....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, may I have a word?\" the Old Man asked, appearing in front of her. Lena smiled, taking her hands off of her crystal ball as her eyes ceased glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi daddy, how've you been?\" she asked, standing up and walking over to the Old Man, giving him a hug. Surprisingly, the Old Man actually hugged back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're playing a dangerous game, Lana. give up before things get out of hand\" he said firmly, letting go of the hug and taking a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena pouted and muttered a spell. Her eyes glowed purple as her body shifted and changed, revealing her true half demonic form. \"I think not, father\" she said in a voice sounding half human and half demon. \"This is my time to prove myself to you. I will do as I please and you will fall. Then, when I am the queen of chaos and you are powerless, I will look you in the eyes and you will see me as deserving of your love!\" she exclaimed, tears in her eyes, one of which was bright purple and the other was blood red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man simply shook his head. \"I am afraid it does not work like that, dear daughter\" he said, choosing his words carefully. \"You know I am incapable of such feelings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to my mother, you old fool! You are just scared to accept that I, you're daughter, have the abilities and the skills to surpass you! You are jealous that I, being only half demon, can learn the ancient magics that you and your kind can never touch! And I will use these very magics, combined with my own demonic power, to show you exactly what I am capable of! Now be gone from my presence, Devil!\" she yelled, summoning purple smoke to wrap around the Old Man and teleport him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Old Man found himself far away, in the house that had once held the demonic spirits of Jonny and his former associates. Was his daughter sending him here supposed to be a message of some kind? He did not know, nor did he care. Lena's skills had improved exponentially since he had left her to learn by herself. The Old Man had to admit that he was impressed, but both he and Lena knew that she was no match for him. even with her magics, the Old Man was too powerful as long as he had his demons powering him. The Old Man knew that was why she had targeted Jonny. Getting Jonny out of the picture would weaken the Old Man, significantly, though neither of them knew if that would be enough for her to accomplish what she wanted. For now, the Old Man simply had to hope that Jonny could fight his way free of Lena's little challenge. Let the games begin. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny walked out of the bathroom and looked about the station as people ran to and fro.  \u201cWell I hope you don\u2019t mind having me in here, Leah,\u201d Jonny said in a nod to his host body, \u201cbecause at the moment it seems we\u2019re stuck with each other.\u201d  As Jonny crawled around inside Leah\u2019s mind, he could tell that one of the reasons she had been sent to her present assignment was that the station was facing a backlog of cases, and the recent increase in the crime wave (occasioned largely by Jonny\u2019s own actions) did not help matters.  \u201cTo the evidence room it is,\u201d Jonny said as he walked Leah\u2019s body in the direction of the dusty, cavernous room below the police station.  He felt more confined than ever as he maneuvered his borrowed meat suit down the halls.  Each step down the long flights of stairs brought a familiar jiggle in his chest has his jello-like boobs strained against the tight police uniform, but Jonny felt an unease in these sensations.  Lena had been right\u2014this body did seem a bit more like home to him, but that in itself was a cause for concern.  After all, bodies were usually a tool to Jonny, and Jack\u2019s pre-pubescent meat suit was the first one Jonny had intended to stay in for any length of time . . . now the Leah woman\u2019s personality would slowly take over and leave him a prisoner in the very skin he\u2019d forced his way into as a means to an end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed woman reached the bottom of the stairs.  Spider webs and dim lighting filled the room as she reached for the creaky handle of a rusty metal door and forced it open.  Stepping into the next room was a new experience.  It was like a giant warehouse below the police station\u2014it was in the basement and so easy to miss.  A makeshift sign upon which was written \u201cEvidence Lock-Up\u201d hung loosely from the high ceiling.  \u201cNothing but the best eh Salina?\u201d Jonny asked with a smile to his body\u2019s absent boss.  He shuffled through the dusty, expansive room past metal shelves filled with various things.  It was all evidence from past crimes, most of it neatly bound up inside plastic bags.  There were guns, bullets, clothes, old circuit boards, labels that read \u201cprosecution\u201d on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny walked sexily (there was no other way for a woman with a body like Leah\u2019s to walk) through the dusty room as he searched his host\u2019s mind for details of the case with which he should begin.  \u201cAt least I\u2019ve still got powers while I\u2019m trapped in this body . . . maybe they\u2019ll do me some good currying favor with the boss while I catch bad guys,\u201d Jonny mused.  Suddenly, something with a bit of a shine caught Jonny\u2019s eye.  He turned and moved in closer to the gleaming thing.  \u201cPretty . . .\u201d he said as he started at the mirror that had given off a faint glow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked into the mirror.  \u201cPretty . . . \u201c he said again, his voice trailing off like that of someone too mesmerized to think clearly.  It was as though the mirror had some kind of hold on him, or on Leah, or both.  As Jonny stared into the mirror, its contents began to swirl.  A purple swirling smoke became evident, and then it began to take a shape.  Jonny stared intensely into the vast swirling mass inside the mirror.  The smoke congealed and solidified, and it formed the shape of a human face.  \u201cWha . . \u201c Jonny said as he stared, transfixed.  The smoke solidified a bit more, and suddenly Jonny recognized the face.  It was Lena\u2019s!  There was the middle-aged, beautiful face of the witch who had trapped him in Leah\u2019s body!  She smiled seductively at him, her eyes glowing purple as her jet-black hair with thin streaks of pure white bounced about on her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for lesson one, Jonny!\u201d Lena said deviously as she simply snapped her fingers.  Suddenly, Jonny clasped his hands over his host\u2019s belly as it gave a loud growl.  Leah\u2019s body just didn\u2019t feel right at the moment.  He held his hands up and ran them over her face, noticing that she was wet\u2014sweat had begun to run down her body.  His knees felt shaky, wobbly.  \u201cWhat\u2019s ha\u2014ha\u2014happening?\u201d Jonny demanded as his host body seemed to rebel against him.  Jonny looked down at his form, a look of panic on his face.  His legs trembled mightily.  Jonny held his hands up just as they began to tremble too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny dropped roughly to his knees, Leah Brady\u2019s ample breasts jiggling roughly as he did.  Sweat poured down his face.  His vessel began to convulse and shake more violently, and tiny wisps of black smoke could be seen creeping out of Leah\u2019s mouth.  \u201cNo no no!\u201d Jonny gurgled as the smoke came more reliably.  It was as though Jonny\u2019s essence were being pulled from inside Leah\u2019s body\u2014yanked out of it.  With one final yank, a mass of smoke flew out of Leah\u2019s mouth and into the swirling mass of magic contained in the mirror Jonny had been looking entranced into.  Leah\u2019s curvaceous body slumped roughly to the ground as Jonny swirled into the void of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny felt as his swirling and writhing essence was pulled through the ether.  He fell and kicked and yelled and screamed, to the extent a swirling mass of smoke was capable of any of those.  The environment Jonny fell into and through was a vast expanse of magic and mysticism.  Clouds of beautiful, powerful, flowing magical energy flew past Jonny\u2019s consciousness as he tumbled like Alice down the rabbit hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this, Jonny\u2019s surroundings became far more familiar as he tumbled toward a vast expanse of green far below, but this time through what looked like a normal blue sky.  Gone were the swirling masses of magic\u2014except for Jonny himself, of course.  Jonny spiraled toward the green earth like a comet, his smoky form writhing about in sheer terror\u2014and it\u2019s hard to frighten a demon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny could discern figures below for a few seconds before he felt himself slam into the earth, or something very near it.  Moments after, he felt solid again\u2014like having a body once more.  His eyes opened.  Above him, he could see a vast and beautiful sky.  Birds flew above\u2014except they actually didn\u2019t.  As Jonny lay on the ground, he could see birds above him, wings extended as they indeed had to be, but the birds did not seem to move.  \u201cWha\u2014\u201c Jonny began, only to notice a voice foreign to him.  He blinked, reopening his eyes only to see that the birds above him were still unmoving against all odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slowly sat up.  He could feel a couple pig-tails hanging down from his head.  He looked about.  Some distance off was a grave-yard with a big marble or perhaps granite vault.  Headstones sat ornately on the ground for some distance around him.  There was precisely no breeze.  No leaves rustled.  No cars drove slowly and respectfully by.  There were cars nearby, but they too were still.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked down at himself.  He saw a dress that hung down from straps perched upon his shoulders.  Jonny stood slowly.  He held up his hands\u2014he was black, or at least his skin was somewhat dark.  The dress was plenty of evidence that he was a woman\u2014a girl, really.  There were no breasts, no curves, or anything like that.  Jonny\u2019s new vessel was short, probably no more than four and a half feet tall, if that.  \u201cWhat the hel\u2014\u201c he began as he looked about and saw that nearby was a sizeable group of people in black suits and dresses.  It was a funeral or something of the sort.  People had tissues and looked sad, though again they were also frozen.  Jonny walked toward them to try to figure out what the hell was going on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was spooky, really.  Jonny felt as though he had been caught in the web of a spider that was just toying with him.  He did not even know what body he was in; he sure hadn\u2019t picked it.  Hadn\u2019t his captor promised him he would be stuck inside Leah\u2019s body anyway?  What the hell was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s my little princess!\u201d came a voice that was scarily familiar.  Jonny spun around to view the source.  Lena Mesmera walked slowly and sexily toward Jonny\u2014her curvy body barely contained by a tight-fitting corset.  Her chest jiggled as she walked.  \u201cYou!\u201d  Jonny yelled, though his young body\u2019s child-like voice made the accusation less than threatening.  \u201cYes, me my lovely little Jonny, or Leah, as you soon will be,\u201d Mesmera said as she came to a stop a couple feet away from Jonny.  \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?!\u201d Jonny demanded.  Lena gave a look of mock pain.  \u201cOh don\u2019t you like our game?  I don\u2019t blame you for now . . . fun starts soon, though,\u201d she said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Jonny yelled.  \u201cThat\u2019s hardly fitting language for a young lady like you, Leah,\u201d Lena said with an arrogant smile.  Jonny paused and looked down at himself.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, \u201cit may not be quite what you possessed, but that\u2019s the very same body\u2014just younger,\u201d Lena said.  \u201cWhat is this?!\u201d Jonny demanded, engulfed by rage in his tiny body.  \u201cIt\u2019s our game, honey,\u201d Lena said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a minute as if to ponder her next words.  \u201cLet me explain,\u201d Lena began, \u201cwhat you did to Leah is really quite cruel.  Think about it\u2014you took her life.  You ripped her away from her family.  You crawled inside her, tore her own mind apart, and forced something else in just to make her a pawn.  That seemed unfair to me, hence our game,\u201d Lena said.  \u201cI decided that, if you want to earn that body, you have to give Leah Brady some of the experiences she never got.  Some you ripped from her\u2014others she just had to miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Jonny said angrily.  \u201cLet\u2019s make it simple,\u201d Lena said, \u201cYou are Leah Brady, age five.  It\u2019s 1998, and this is a memorial for your father, who died three years ago.  This is an annual occasion in which your body\u2019s family gets together to remember William Brady, taken too soon by a drug lord\u2019s stray bullet.  This is Leah\u2019s earliest memory, so it seemed an appropriate place to start you off.  You\u2019ll make your way through this experience and live it as Leah did.  Then you\u2019ll be shuttled, invited, or maybe forced to the next one.  It could be years ahead or only days or months.  In each case, you will be stuck inside Leah\u2019s body to live some experience that Leah missed as a child.  If you want to live her life, you owe it to live the missed parts for her.  It could be a senior prom.  It could be trying out for the swim team.  It could be meeting the man of her dreams of feeling the beautiful kick of a child inside your pregnant belly\u2014an experience Leah is never likely to experience for herself if you stay inside her.  We\u2019ll see if you can survive the game with your own mind intact, Jonny, or if you\u2019ll come out a new woman\u2014eager to use those powers and those big, bouncing tits to help me take down my dear \u2018ol Daddy,\u201d Lena said with a smile.  \u201cAnd if you end up with me, I\u2019ll get Selina and Lisa too,\u201d she said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny\u2019s mind swam with all that might lay before him.  \u201cHave fun, little one,\u201d Lena said as she disappeared in a puff of purple smoke.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Lena had completely disappeared, time began to move again. Jonny felt two arms under his arms before feeling himself rising off of the grounds and cradled in the chest of a very attractive black woman who's face was a mask of tears and sadness. \"It's okay baby\" the woman said, trying to keep herself calm as much as her daughter as she buried Jonny in her chest. Jonny wanted to push himself off of the woman and leave, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. There was something about this feeling that was strangely comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around at the sea of people present at the funeral. Most were black, but occasionally there was a white face or two in the crowd. Jonny tried to figure out who any of these people were, but he had no idea. Leah was too young to have any memories at this point in her life. She didn't know who any of them were either. All of them had a distinct look of sadness and loss on their face. A young boy came next to the woman that was holding Jonny and buried his face in the woman's dress. He was clearly crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jonny's young eyes came to the coffin that was being lowered into the ground.  Suddenly, Jonny became overcome with emotions. Against his will, tears started falling from his eyes. He wiped the tears on the dress of his mother....no, Leah's mother. He was so sad and he had no idea why. What had he done to deserve this? He felt so empty, as if the thing that he had looked up to most of all was ripped away from him and would never be given back. \"Daddy!!!!\" He yelled as he cried, letting all of the emotions he could feel go. Daddy was so nice. Why was daddy gone? Leah's small hands wrapped around her mother's body as the emotions came out. She felt her mother pulling her close and felt comforted but still sad. She knew her life could never be completely happy again without her daddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little girl cried into her mother's chest, a white light blinded her vision. Jonny suddenly snapped back to reality and realized who he was. For a moment, it was as if he had no longer existed, and he was lost in Leah's identity. He looked around. Where was he now. Jonny looked down and saw a bigger body. He was wearing what looked like a school girl's uniform. Leah now had more memories in her head, which told Jonny that it was her catholic school's uniform. Jonny also noticed that she was wearing a very elegant necklace with a cross on it. Tears filled his eyes as he remembered that her mom had given it to her only last year, when she was entering middle school. It had been bought by her father before she was born. He wanted to give it to her himself, but fate had other plans. Jonny sucked the emotions in and looked around the room he was in, trying to figure out what was happening now. She saw several people in black sitting at a table, crying. Jonny recognized one of them as Leah's mother, and a feeling of safety and security came over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked his now 12 year old body to the woman. \"Mom...? What's the matter?\" he asked. Leah's mother held back tears as she looked at her supposed daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's Ty....he....he's gone, sweetie...\" she said. Suddenly, the same feelings of sadness that Jonny had felt at Leah's father's funeral came back to her mind. Tears started to fill her eyes again as she ran away from the room, not wanting to believe what she had just heard. She ran upstairs to her room and locked the door, before running to her bed and burying her face in her pink pillow. Ty, or Tyrone was Leah's older brother. He was the young kid that was next to Leah's mother at her father's funeral. He was now 17 years old. Leah had once walked in on him doing drugs but was sworn to silence, and didn't tell her mother, not wanting to hurt Ty's feelings. Leah kept crying into her pillow as thoughts filled her head. Why hadn't she just told her mom what Ty had been doing? Why couldn't she try to stop Ty from doing it? Why did bad things have to happen to such good people? If only daddy were here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts were uncontrollable. In that wave of emotion, Jonny had found himself once again lost in the life and personality of Leah. He had forgotten everything about who and what he was. All that mattered was the life he was in. As Leah kept crying, there was another blast of white light, returning Jonny's senses to him and moving him to the next pathway on his journey. As this happened, Lena Mesmera watched with a pleased smile on her face. Things were working just as she had planned them to. In every step of Jonny's journey, he would lose himself just a little bit more to Leah's identity whenever she had a rush of emotion, happy or sad. Soon, Leah's soul would completely override Jonny's demonic essence. Lena would have a new apprentice to help her in her plans and Jonny would be worse than dead. He would be completely reprogrammed into a new Leah with all his powers being used in service of her mistress. Lena laughed evilly. she couldn't wait to see where Jonny went next. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lena watched through her crystal ball as Jonny was taken to his next destination, Leah's first time trying out for her high school swim team. It was her first taste of bitter rejection and it motivated her to pushing herself to new limits and paved her way to being the person she was today, or would be today if not for the fact that Jonny was now trapped in her body. Leah's real body was unconscious, laying down on a red couch in front of Lena. The girl looked so peaceful and at ease without Jonny's demonic mind there to take charge. Lena had her under a magical sleep to ensure that she would not awaken. She was needed for Lena's plan at final revenge on her father. Speaking of the devil, she may as well enact the next part of her plan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's eyes glowed purple as she unleashed her magic and suddenly Leah's eyes shot open, glowing bright red as she sat up and stared at Lena accusingly. \"What are you doing with my demon?\" Leah's body asked, with the sound of the Old Man's voice exiting from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled in greeting. \"Nice to see you too, dad. You have your army of demons, so I figured I might try my hand at making my own army. Your alpha demon or whatever he is is my first recruit. He's well on his way to being indoctrinated into my way of thinking\" she said with a grin, holding up the crystal ball so that the Old Man could see Jonny living Leah's life, slowly becoming more lost in her thoughts and personality. Jonny was now on Leah's senior prom, and he seemed to be happily dancing with the boy that Leah once thought she loved. How naive. Once Jonny was done with Leah's real memories, Lena would start to implant false ones of meeting her, giving her loyalty, becoming her apprentice, and soon her soldier would be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release him\" the old man said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena just laughed. \"My, is that worry that I hear in your voice? Surely you can afford to spare one little demon for me. Unless...He's a special one. You know, I could feel his powers as soon as I walked into the room at the police station. This one is not like your other pets. He can absorb and mimic the powers of others.  He can become like you\" she said with a grin. \"But if I have him loyal to me, then it's like having you working for me. That power could be enough to finally tip those scales that are always supposed to be maintained. It could end civilization as we know it and bring the world of man back into the dark ages. And you know how much I preferred those times...so much more simple\" she said. the Old Man in Leah's body just watched, waiting for Lena to continue. \"I know how your powers work, father. You absorb the chaotic energies that your demons bring about and then use those energies to make more demons. It's a never ending cycle of power and yours grows each time you do it, giving you new abilities. you let your demons cause chaos and evil, but in the end, you regulate it so that things don't get out of control. It's all a game for you, but I play for keeps. Currently, I don't know how to kill you and get you out of this game completely, but my powers are strong. Magic trumps demons\" she said, holding out her crystal ball, which began glowing purple along with her eyes as she muttered an ancient language. Suddenly, the Old Man was pulled out of Leah's bod and into the crystal ball, though a different part than where Jonny's essence was. Leah's body passed back out on the couch as the Old Man screamed for freedom. He was trapped like a bird in a cage. Once Jonny was on her side, she would have him take the Old Man's powers and then, they would reset the world to a better time, a darker time. A much more fun time. Screw the scales and balances. Screw demons. All Lena wanted was to have fun and her magics allowed for just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Old Man out of the way completely for now and Jonny now living through Leah's entrance to the police academy, it was time to check up on things back in the city. Lena's eyes and the crystal ball glowed purple as the scene in the ball shifted. Lena watched as the saw Lisa worrying sick for the whereabouts of her master. Lena chuckled. Jonny was paying for the price of not being truthful to his servant and now the poor woman was tearing herself apart trying to find him. Perhaps she should step in?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lena concentrated as her curvy host body began to shake and writhe about.  Selina's eyes opened to reveal a bright purple hue as tentacles of smoke began to crawl out of the woman's mouth.  The smoky mixture of magic and dust slowly emerged from the woman's mouth, as lava lazily pours out from the mouth of a volcano.  Selina's body shook and jolted about from the motion.  Her boobs jiggled inside her police uniform until the last of Lena's essence exited her body and left her curvy form in a heap on the floor where she fell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena's ethereal essence reformed into the full-figured she had been when Jonny first saw her.

She found herself in the kitchen, which was quite contiguous with the great room.  She looked about the place.  \"I can see why he picked her,\" Lena said.

Master is that you?\" the woman called out as she threw open the door from her bedroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show time,\" Lena said excitedly as she waived her hand and both the room and her sexy body began to shift.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lena smiled evilly the room around the two women shifted and changed. The room around the two became older smaller. The smell of a wood-burning stove filled the air as Lisa's house was transformed into an exact replica of the home that she had grown up inside. Lena herself then changed, becoming a bit taller and leaner. Her hair became the same red as Lisa's. In fact, Lena now resembled Lisa quite a bit. Though she was considerably younger and there were enough differences to know that they were not the same person. \"Hello Lisa\" Lena said with a loving smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's eyes went wide as she saw the younger redhead. \"But...that's impossible...you're...gone...\" she said as tears formed in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena just kept smiling. \"I know. I've been gone for such a long time, Lisa\" she said, looking into Lisa's memories as she spoke, making sure that her act would be convincing. \"I missed you so much, little sister\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled through her tears. \"I'm hardly little anymore compared to you...You haven't aged a day, Melody\" she said, eating up Lena's act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lisa looked like she was about to lose her balance the faux-Melody hugged her tightly. \"Lisa...Do you remember the day I left?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded, hugging her missing sister tightly as the tears ran down her street. \"I was thirteen, and you had just turned 21. You looked just like you do now. You went out to celebrate with a few of your friends. None of you came back. No one knew what happened...\" she said, choking up from the memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I know what happened, Lisa\" Lena said, putting her hand on Lisa's face, wiping the tears from her cheek. \"Would you like to know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"No one ever found out where you went. We hoped you were okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you what happened\" Lena said as her eyes glowed bright purple. The glow was reflected in Lisa's eyes as her body stiffened up. Lena laughed as her body and the house morphed back to normal. Now that Lena was in Lisa's mind she had won and there was no need for this act anymore. Lena placed her hand on Lisa's forehead and wiped away the mental alterations that Jonny had given to her. \"How do you feel, Lisa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mind is clearer\" she said. \"I feel like I can think for myself again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's because I've removed the controls that the demon put on you. You are yourself again. Though I've taken some liberties so that you can answer my questions. You won't be hurt, just answer me honestly, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Lisa said, nodding. Her body now relaxed but her eyes retained a purple hue due to Lena's magical control, which was doing little more than keeping her honest and docile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, how do you truly feel about the demon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thoughtful expression appeared on Lisa's face. \"I love him\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quizzical look appeared on Lena's face. \"Really? After everything he did to you, you really love him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"Yes. He may have controlled my mind, but he freed my from my self-imposed torture. He gave me a a purpose. And he was always kind to me\" she said. It was clear that even without Jonny's controls, the emotions that Lisa felt towards him were real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Lena said, looking at the woman in front of her. This could be used to her advantage. \"So you love Jonny. And even without his manipulation, would I be correct in assuming that you want to remain with him? By his side?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Lisa nodded. \"That's correct. I will stay with Jonny no matter what. And I'll do everything I can to help him achieve his goals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you should know that Jonny is working with me now\" she said with a smile on her face. Of course, this wasn't quite true yet. Lena currently had Jonny entrapped in a powerful spell that was in the process of merging his spirit with the young woman who Jonny currently inhabited. Once their essences were completely brought together, the new demon-human hybrid would be trained in powerful magics as Lena's apprentice. They would then be used to kill the Old Man, finally allowing magic-users full control over the chaos magics that demons had control of for so long thanks to the Old Man. \"We are going to kill the king of the demons. And then the real fun can begin. With the Old Man gone, a void will be open. And that void will be filled by the new Queen of Chaos. I'd like that queen to be you, Lisa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Lisa asked, looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled. the simple answer was because she had to ensure that Jonny was susceptible to her control. Being able to fully control Jonny would require a trust between the two of them that Lena did not have. Lisa, or at least the pretense of Lisa's body, would be able to provide that since Jonny had come to love her. That love for Lisa, combined with the sense of right and wrong in Leah Brady's soul would be the ties needed for Lena to control Jonny as her soldier. Of course, Lisa couldn't just be told this. \"Lisa, you said yourself that you love Jonny. He feels the same towards you. I want Jonny to be happy, so I want you to be with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I get the feeling that there is more to it than that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena laughed. \"Oh, Lisa. How smart you are\" she said. \"It's really no wonder that he loves you so much. Here's the deal. If everything is to go as planned, I need you to let me into your body for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You have your own body\" Lisa said, looking Lena up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this body isn't exactly ideal\" Lena said with a frown. \"the body that I currently occupy used to belong to a woman named Kelly. I say used to, because her soul is no longer present within it. It is little more than an empty shell for me to reside in. While I can use my magics, it drains my own soul to do so. If I have a second soul within my form, I can use double the power. I can reach new heights and it will ensure victory over the demons. All I want is that victory. Once I have it, you and Jonny will reign as the kind and queen of chaos.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that drain from my soul?\" Lisa asked, worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena chuckled. \"Good assumption, but incorrect. While I possess you, our souls will be interwoven. The magic will still come from me, but you will be like a battery, keeping my soul alive enough to replenish itself after I use my full power. That's all I need from you, Lisa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why don't you just possess me now? Why do I need to agree to this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question. The short answer is that I'm not a demon so I can't take what I want without permission like they can. The long answer is because I respect you too much to try anything funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled a bit. It was strange being talked to like she was an equal. \"I don't know...\" she said, still unsure if she could trust this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I realized that I never showed you what happened to your sister. Let me clear that up\" she said, placing her hand on Lisa's forehead again. Both womens eyes glowed bright purple as memories entered Lisa's head. Lisa saw her sister and her friends entering a bar to party. Then a bunch of people came to them. They were brought into a back room for some more fun, when suddenly black smoke left the men' bodies. Lisa's sister and her friends were all possessed by the group of demons and then left the bar to continue their fun. Nothing else was shown, but it didn't take much to realize that Melody and her friends were likely discarded after having their souls devoured by the demons that took them for a joyride. \"Now Lisa , are you sure you don't want to help me end this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears had reformed in Lisa's purple twinged eyes. She clenched her fists tightly as an anger burned in her stronger than she had ever felt. \"I'll do whatever you need me to do. Just kill the demons\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled. She had no idea what really happened to Lisa's sister, but the narrative that she created had accomplished its goal of getting Lisa on her side. \"I look forward to working with you, Lisa. Or should I say, As you\" Lena said with a grin. Her body suddenly became consumed in purple flames as her essence flew towards Lisa. Lisa's body shook violently as Lena forced her way into control. Purple energy burned around Lisa's body as Lena's soul was imprinted over Lisa's. Lena had, of course, also lied to Lisa about what would happen after being possessed. Lisa's soul would not be a simply an extra battery. It was being assimilated into Lena's essence. Lisa was ceasing to exist to give Lena access to more spiritual energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, there was no trace of Lisa's spirit left. It was only Lena, and she was more powerful than she had ever been before. Lisa's eyes opened, revealing a bright purple energy where Lisa's hazel eyes had once been. \"Mmm, this will do nicely. Now that I've been supercharged by assimilating a soul, I think I'm rady for the next part of my plan\" she said as she teleport her new body back into Selina's office. The curvaceous police chief was still asleep on the floor and the two crystal balls, one containing the Old Man and one containing Jonny were on her desk, untouched. Lena/Lisa picked up the ball containing Jonny and grinned. Soon, Jonny and Leah's souls would be completely merged. After today, neither Jonny nor Lisa would exist anymore. Jonny's essence would still exist in the form of Lena's new apprentice, Leah and Lisa's essence would still exist as part of Lena. Aside from that the two would be gone forever. The final casualties in Lena's war against the Old Man and his demons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lisa's body transformed into purple smoke and flew into Selina's mouth. Selina's body put up no fight allowing Lena to regain control. The possessed Selina then opened her eyes and stood up, stretching since she was now stiff. \"And now I have three souls to draw power from. That should be more than enough to begin\" she said as she walked to 'her' desk and picked up the ball containing Jonny/Leah. A purple glow surrounded the ball as Jonny's conditioning entered its final phase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Old Man looked off into space for a moment, seeming to be contemplating something in his head\u2014trying to take it in.  \u201cHey!?\u201d Jonny screamed.  He snapped back to reality and looked at Jonny.  \u201cApologies boy, but I must warn the others.  Be careful!\u201d he said urgently as the Old Man walked away in obvious haste and simply disappeared in a puff of smoke.  Jonny stood there on the hilltop for a few moments as the mid-day sun shone down upon him in his curvy, well-endowed vessel.  \u201cJust fucking great . . . \u201c Jonny mused to himself as he glanced about in disgust at the lack of help he had been given.  \u201cThanks for the help dumbass!\u201d he yelled out.  He stood again to await a response.  None came.  Jonny stood still longer upon the vacant hilltop.  Who was this new woman?  Was she a demon?  A witch?  She had seemed to temporarily posses the people Jonny bumped into on the way to the bathroom\u2014surely she could do much more.  Could she posses people without Jonny\u2019s even knowing?  Could she posses the same bodies Jonny did, leaving him powerless inside the meat suits he had sought to control?  All the possibilities troubled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding none of that would be resolved now, Jonny\u2019s voluptuous body disappeared in a puff of smoke and quickly reappeared in the same bathroom in the police station from which he had come.  Jonny glanced around under the fluorescent lighting of the bathroom.  No one else seemed present.  He took a look at the body of Leah Brady, making a couple faces in the mirror and running his hands over his ample chest.  He looked into the reflection in the mirror, addressing Leah herself.  \u201cYou\u2019re mine until I feel like climbing out of you, honey,\u201d he said with a smile as he turned and walked from the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging again into the police station, Jonny began a walk through the main corridor in the direction of Selina\u2019s office so that he could be told what he had to do next.  It was just the middle of the day, after all, and Jonny still wanted to hang around for a bit longer.  Still, the whole experience was new.  Before, Jonny had known he was king of the roost.  Now, every step he took brought the pleasant jiggle of Leah\u2019s breasts, but also the disquieting thought that the next step would bring him into contact with witch\u2014maybe Jonny would not even know this person when he saw her?  Or might the witch actually posses a male body?  Who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeah!\u201d Jonny hard from behind him as he walked.  He spun around to see Selina walking toward him quickly.  \u201cChief?\u201d Jonny answered.  Selina beheld Jonny carefully.  \u201cI ah, I saw you duck out of the meeting earlier . . . you didn\u2019t look so good\u2014you ok?\u201d she asked.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine . . . just a bit light-headed,\u201d Jonny lied.  \u201cWell how about we go get some grub?  You\u2019ll feel better after you get some food in your belly, and consider it payment for a job well done with that hooker today,\u201d Selina said with a smile.  Jonny quickly agreed, and the two women walked out of the police station and got into Selina\u2019s car.  The two made small talk while they headed for the restaurant, and the journey passed pleasantly enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina pulled the car into a small diner and rolled to a stop.  As Jonny got out, he thought that the diner looked like some place out of the 1950s\u2014everything was chrome, there was a Juke Box inside, and pictures of Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis adorned the walls.  Presumably their tunes were the ones that filled the juke box.  Jonny smiled a bit at the charm of the place.  The two women walked in and sat down at a booth, with each marveling a bit at the old-time trinkets that covered the walls and shrouded the whole place in a pleasant air of a simpler time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like this place,\u201d Selina said, \u201cthey have wonderful burgers, and the atmosphere is nice.\u201d  A waiter quickly arrived to take their orders.  \u201cI\u2019ll have a double-decker burger with steak fries and a milk shake,\u201d Jonny announced, and the waiter scribbled it on his writing pad.  Selina looked thoughtful for a moment, and then she ordered only a small order of fries and a diet Coke, and the waiter left.  \u201cWhere do you put it all honey?\u201d Selina asked her companion.  Jonny smiled knowingly.  Leah had a nice body, but Jonny figured he\u2019d eat what he damn well wanted after today\u2019s ordeal and let the real Leah worry about the damage he might do to her diet.  \u201cLet\u2019s just say I can change my look in a jiffy if I need to boss,\u201d Jonny said with a smile.  \u201cHow about you?  You say this place has great burgers, and they you don\u2019t get one?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smiled and blushed a little.  \u201cWell\u2014well I shouldn\u2019t eat a bunch because it\u2019s already 2 and I have, you know, that thing tonight with\u2014um\u2014that guy,\u201d she said nervously.  Jonny\u2019s vessel smiled.  \u201cOh yeah I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a real cutie.  Tell me all about him,\u201d he said.  Selina laughed, obviously blushing.  She paused.  She paused again.  She didn\u2019t know where to start.  \u201cI, ah, well there\u2019s this guy and he\u2019s really great,\u201d she said with a dreamy smile on her face, \u201cum, and I just met him not too long ago, and he took me to the beach at night.  It was the most romantic date I\u2019ve ever been on, and he held me and I fell asleep in his arms,\u201d she explained.  \u201cSounds like a real catch,\u201d Jonny said self-servingly.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Selina said, a hint of reservation in her voice.  \u201cBut?\u201d Jonny asked, sensing one was coming.  Selina paused again.  The waiter brought their food, and the two women began to eat, Jonny tearing voraciously into his burger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s not really my a\u2014\u201c Selina began, and then cut herself off, trying to come up with a more artful way to say what she wanted.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if my friends and family would accept\u2014well\u2014me, and well you know I\u2019m in my forties, and\u2014\u201c she stuttered as she chomped on a fry.  Jonny looked straight into Selina\u2019s eyes.  \u201cDo you like him?\u201d he asked.  Immediately, Selina smiled and nodded vigorously.  \u201cYes,\u201d she said.  \u201cAnd does he like you?\u201d  Jonny pressed.  Selina paused.  \u201cI\u2014I think so . . . he had a great time.  Great enough that he wants to see me again in a few hours.\u201d  Leah\u2019s face broke into a smile.  \u201cThen that\u2019s all you need to know,\u201d she said simply.  Selina thought about it and nodded with a smile.  \u201cYou\u2019re damn right,\u201d she said as she sipped her diet coke.  \u201cOf course I am girl,\u201d Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were suddenly interrupted by a hurried message from dispatch.  \u201cChief,\u201d came the call over the shoulder-mounted communication device, \u201cthere\u2019s a situation at the university in Wilkins Hall . . . you\u2019re close.  Can you check it out?\u201d  \u201cCan do,\u201d Selina said quickly as she wiped her mouth with a napkin and waited for Leah to scarf down the last of her burger.  \u201cGame time rookie!\u201d Selina said as the two women headed to the car.  The two hopped in, and Selina sped the car toward the source of the trouble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sat in the car, his eyes darting about as the engine revved and the siren wailed.  Jonny\u2019s host\u2019s heart beat quickly on her well-endowed chest.  Jonny felt himself become suddenly jumpy, like a rider waiting for a roller coaster to start.  \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just this body,\u201d Jonny thought silently to himself, \u201cbut I sort of like this.\u201d  Within a few minutes, the car arrived at a school not too far from the restaurant.  The campus was situated upon a beautiful set of green, rolling hills nestled into a small suburb that teamed with the life of a college enclave.  Bars and school supplies places, many proudly displaying the school\u2019s logo, dotted the street corners.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women got out of the car and were met by a well-dressed but frantic woman who greeted them and led them in the direction of the trouble.  \u201cI\u2019m Delores Duckworth, head of the Classics Department.  Please come this way,\u201d the frumpy woman said as she shook the hands of the officers.  \u201cWhat seems to be the problem, mam?\u201d Jonny asked, taking the initiative and enjoying his role as an authority figure.  \u201cIt\u2019s Arnold Chubman, one of our professors,\u201d she said as she led the women into an academic building and quickly up the stairs to a row of what seemed to be professors\u2019 offices.  \u201cHe\u2019s been a bit eccentric for a number of years now, weird really, but always a nice man and a fine scholar.  He\u2019s gone a bit overboard and barricaded himself in his office, and he won\u2019t come out,\u201d the woman explained as the three reached the door bearing the strange professor\u2019s strange name.  \u201cArnie, open the door, will you?\u201d the woman called as she tried the handle to no avail.  No sound came from within the office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis office also has a stairway that leads to the roof of the building,\u201d Duckworth said, \u201che may have gone up there.\u201d  Selina paused for a minute as she tried to figure out what to do.  \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, \u201csome of these buildings have an old maintenance ladder or some external access to the roof for safety purposes, so I\u2019m going to go try to find one of those.  Leah, you stay here and try to get into the office.  Call one of the maintenance guys and tell him to bring a key, and the minute the good Dr. Chubworth feels inclined to come out, I want to know about it,\u201d Selina said.  \u201cRight boss,\u201d Jonny said, and with that Selina ran off, jiggling beautifully all the way.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny stood quietly with the old woman.  This whole thing seemed strange.  Why would a tenured professor, a guy who one might think would have his proverbial shit together, suddenly go nuts and barricade himself in his office (or maybe on the roof) and not come out?  \u201cSo can you tell me about this man?  Do you have any idea what might have made him snap?\u201d Jonny asked.  Delores Duckworth paused.  \u201cArnie\u2019s always been a strange bird, and I suppose academia attracts those sometimes.  The last few years, he\u2019s spent all the more time with his nose shoved in his books.  He\u2019ll go into his office and not come out for days\u2014sleep there even.  He never misses a class, but sometimes in the summers he\u2019ll disappear for weeks at a time.  No one knows where he goes,\u201d Duckworth said.  \u201cI think he went off the reservation enough that his wife left him, and he just couldn\u2019t handle it anymore,\u201d she postulated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny mulled this over in his head.  He\u2019d used his powers earlier this very day, he noted, and even a body as beautiful as Leah\u2019s was of limited use if he confined himself to only the human methods of crime-solving.  Being a demon had its advantages.  Leah\u2019s eyes glowed red as Jonny raised his hand.  Delores had her back to the officer at the moment, and Jonny laid his hand firmly on her shoulder.  \u201cDelores,\u201d he began, her eyes glowing red too and her body relaxing, \u201cI\u2019ve got to use some unconventional methods here, and I can\u2019t have you seeing what I do, so you\u2019re going to remember this as a time when I used this beautiful, curvy body of mine to force my way through the door as a part of a heroic effort to save the professor, and you\u2019re going to make sure you tell my boss what I did.  What\u2019s actually going to happen, though, is that you\u2019re going to go to sleep while I do my work,\u201d he said.  \u201cCurvy body . . . door . . . sleep,\u201d Delores mumbled just as her body collapsed limply to the floor of the hallway.  She lay there unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned toward the door.  \u201cAnd off I go,\u201d Jonny said as his vessel disappeared in a puff of black smoke.  He reappeared just a few feet away on the other side of the door to the office.  Jonny looked about the at dusty and crusty old room, filled to the brim with ungraded papers and journal articles and books with yellowed pages.  \u201cChubworth?\u201d Jonny called out.  No answer.  \u201cWhat have you been up to prof?\u201d Jonny asked the absent professor as he rummaged about the cluttered office.  More strangeness abounded.  Jonny looked about and saw strange symbols scrawled on the walls of the darkened room.  He didn\u2019t know what they were, but they looked old.  They looked magical.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden breeze blew through the room, and Jonny jumped.  He saw the source of the air.  An old wooden door in the corner of the room had blown open, and Jonny could see stairs leading up from that door, presumably to the roof.  \u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d Jonny said as he headed for the stairs.  The tiny hairs on the back of Leah\u2019s neck stood up.  Her pulse quickened.  Sweat rolled down her head.  \u201cI definitely picked the right meat suit,\u201d Jonny mused to himself as he slowly ascended the dark stairwell.  Each step brought a creek from the old wooden stairs.  As Jonny climbed slowly and as quietly as he could, more wild writing and symbols could be seen.  \u201cGet out of me!\u201d commanded one big of script.  \u201cBody . . . MINE!\u201d read another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny reached the top of the steps and another old wooden door.  \u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d he said as he kicked the door and it flew open with a loud crack.  Jonny stepped quickly on to the gravel-strewn roof of the building.  This building was fairly tall, and so the wind blew fairly strongly up here.  Leah\u2019s hair blew about in the breeze.  Over toward the edge of the roof, Jonny beheld a second figure, who quickly spun around in surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis figure was male, and he seemed to be in his early sixties.  He had very thick glasses adorning his face, and he was small of stature, probably no taller than five feet five inches.  That said, he probably weighed some three hundred pounds, and a gigantic belly jiggled as he moved, peeking over the top of his pants and barely contained by an old, winkled dress shirt that seemed destined to soon lose the last of its original buttons.  His trousers were tasked with containing the remainder of his gut, having been pulled up so far as to house rolls of belly fat acquired over decades of sedentary work.  The man had a mass of thick grey hair that seemed not to have seen a comb since some time early in the Clinton Administration, and his wild eyes darted about at the surprise occasioned by his new guest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?!\u201d the man called out as if to an intruder.  \u201cThat\u2019s a bit complicated,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just call me Leah?\u201d  he introduced his stolen body, \u201cand I presume you\u2019re Dr. Chubworth?\u201d  The man seemed to relax ever so slightly.  \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s ah, well it\u2019s Arnie.  F\u2014fr\u2014friends, they call me Arnie,\u201d he stuttered.  \u201cHi, Arnie,\u201d Jonny said as he stepped a bit closer, \u201cso what is it you\u2019re doing up here?\u201d he said in a quiet soothing voice that he was thankful this body just seemed to naturally have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie paused, and tears started to stream down his face as he ran his hand through his crazy hair.  \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe me lady,\u201d he cried, \u201cno\u2014nobody\u2019s gonna believe me at all!\u201d he said.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty good imagination, Arnie.  Why don\u2019t you just try me?\u201d Jonny said.  Arnie paused, seeming to ponder the proposal as he wiped his nose with the ruffled sleeve of his shirt.  Without saying anything, Arnie slowly waddled (as a man of his build must) over to a metal air conditioning unit and plopped his considerable girth down upon it.  Jonny very slowly made his way over there two, and sat Leah\u2019s beautiful backside upon the same surface a few feet away.  He looked over at Arnie, who wiped tears from his face as he collected his thoughts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFew years ago . . . I found this book that says it\u2019s got all these rituals for talking to people on other planes of existence.  Creatures.  The dead.  Demons, whatever I suppose,\u201d Arnie started.  \u201cI had read some articles about this sort of thing before, so I thought it was interesting, and one night I went into my attic at home and, and ah, \u2018an I did what the book said to do, you know?  I drew a few symbols, and I lit a few candles and stuff, and I read the script in the book while I sat in the middle of this big circle,\u201d he explained.  Jonny nodded, interested.  \u201cI sat up there for what turned out to be hours and listened into the void, sort of the space between worlds the book said, and I didn\u2019t hear anything at all.  I thought it was a all made-up, maybe somethin\u2019 get a conference talk or an article out of, but nothing real,\u201d Arnie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, as I was about to go to bed and give up, I heard this faint voice,\u201d he explained, \u201cthis woman . . . seemed far away or like a voice you hear only a little bit through a strong wind.  The voice asked me my name, so I told her . . . said she needed my help,\u201d said Chubworth.  \u201cYour help?\u201d Jonny asked, \u201chelp with what?\u201d  \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure at first, but we just talked.  She said she was somewhere she wasn\u2019t supposed to be . . . been marooned somewhere and couldn\u2019t get home, so I felt bad.  She asked if we could be friends, and I said yes,\u201d he said with a slight smile.  \u201cShe told me she had to go and I should come back the next night, so I left that attic, and it turned out I had been up there most of the night, which I didn\u2019t know.  It was getting light out already . . . I went and taught class all day, but I couldn\u2019t think about anything other than this voice.  I couldn\u2019t tell anyone . . . she told me not to,\u201d Arnie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t tell anybody at all?\u201d Jonny asked.  Arnie shook his head vigorously.  \u201cNo, never, ahh, I, um, well, I\u2014so I just went right home after class and, in the evening, after my wife was asleep, I went back up to attic and did the ritual again, and there she was again, the woman\u2014the voice,\u201d Arnie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes passed by, Arnie explained that this ritual\u2014go to class in the morning, come home, talk to the voice alone at night\u2014went on for a couple weeks.  Arnie said the woman was always nice to him and wanted to learn about him.  The woman explained that she had been banished long ago and was stuck in a world that was her prison.  She said she wanted to come back to our world, but that she couldn\u2019t just come all the way back yet\u2014she needed a body.  She wanted to get her body back, and that would take time.  She began to ask Arnie to get things and to do certain magical spells for her\u2014things that would prepare for her return.  Arnie always dutifully did as he was asked.  Jonny thought that Arnie truly enjoyed the companionship of this absent woman, who really seemed interested in him and seemed genuinely kind to him.  Eventually, the woman\u2019s requests of Arnie went to another level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe, um, she said she could maybe start to come back if I would help her,\u201d Arnie explained.  \u201cI thought I\u2019d already been helping her, so I didn\u2019t understand.  I was doing all the stuff she wanted me to do to reconstitute her body.  Then she told me that would take too long and she wanted to try to come back now, at least for a bit . . . said that she didn\u2019t have to use her body, that she could use mine instead . . . temporarily,\u201d Arnie said.  Jonny looked Arnie up and down\u2014his was certainly not the sort of body Jonny would pick, but to each his or her own.  \u201cShe\u2014she asked if she could posses your body?\u201d Jonny asked.  Arnie nodded.  \u201cYes . . . said I had to go mix this concoction to let his posses me, so I did, and then I drank it like she told me to do.  I looked in the mirror after I did it, and I didn\u2019t look or feel any different except for this little bit of a purple glow in my eyes,\u201d Arnie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny immediately took notice.  He\u2019d seen the purple glow before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI stood in the attic and looked into the mirror . . . suddenly it felt like I was being watched.  It was like something or someone was there with me, and I blacked out.  I woke up an hour later feeling as well as I\u2019d felt in years.  I was in my office when I woke up.  I don\u2019t know what she did while she was inside my body, but I felt great after.  She even wrote a note and put it in my pocket\u2014\u201cthanks Arnie, back soon\u201d\u2014I think it said,\u201d he explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie went on to explain how this woman possessed his body for a brief time at first\u2014often for a few hours at a time during the school year.  Arnie was sort of asleep as long as he was possessed, though he would get little glimpses here and there.  She apparently took his body to a number of occult stores in the area and also to several recreational things\u2014restaurants, movies, even a couple strip clubs.  She would leave notes thanking him every time, and he would destroy them so that his wife would never ask questions.  Arnie felt great every time after she left.  Then, as the possessions continued, they got longer\u2014much longer.  They went from a few hours at a time to a couple days or even a week at a time.  Each time, Arnie got only bits and pieces, and sometimes quite few of those.  No one ever said anything about Arnie\u2019s acting weird or anything, and Arnie enjoyed the respite from daily life.  Having her inside him just felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen she stopped coming one day,\u201d Arnie said sadly, \u201cshe was gone.  I would wait for her to come, but she never did.  One night in August about 2 years ago, I was sitting with my wife Joanna on the porch . . . she had made chocolate chip cookies.  A man built like me shouldn\u2019t have those, but I love them,\u201d Arnie said.  \u201cAnyway, we were sitting on the porch swing eating them, and suddenly my wife, my Joanna, she looked up at me and said \u2018It\u2019s been nice getting to know you in person, Arnie,\u2019 and suddenly her eyes glowed this bright purple color, and she passed out.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the woman from before possessed her body?\u201d Jonny asked.  Arnie nodded as his pudgy little hands clenched into fists.  \u201cWhen my wife woke up, she thought it was early June!\u201d Arnie said, barely containing his anger, \u201cthat woman had possessed my wife\u2019s body for literally months!  I was prepared to have the woman jump into my body, but my wife never asked for this . . . she thought she\u2019d gone nuts because she didn\u2019t remember much of anything\u2014just bits and pieces\u2014from the last three months.  She damn near had a nervous breakdown!\u201d Arnie said.  \u201cAfter that, I looked through all the books I could find to stop her from possessing even my body . . . I didn\u2019t want her in me anymore, but I couldn\u2019t stop her.  She started to posses me again.  She\u2019d leave notes in my pockets too\u2014\u2018Aren\u2019t you enjoying the game you fat little bastard?\u2019  or something similar,\u201d he said, \u201cand she\u2019d stay inside me for weeks at a time . . . started using my body to commit petty crimes, and my relationship with Joanna grew worse,\u201d he explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie\u2019s life had spiraled out of control from there.  His wife distanced herself from him\u2014apparently he had said and done some terrible things while the woman\u2014who Jonny assumed was Lena\u2014was inside him.  Arnie\u2019s resistance angered Lena, and in retaliation she would use his body in ever-more unsavory ways.  Arnie would sometimes wake up in other cities or even in police stations, having been arrested while possessed.  Lena had wanted a body to experience the world in while her own body could be recreated and readied for her to occupy it, but she\u2019d taken her time with Arnie too far.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood and paced around.  \u201cI believe you, Arnie,\u201d he said as he headed toward the door that led back down to the office, \u201cnow let\u2019s go back down and see if we can get this handled.\u201d          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I promise that I'll help you get this whole thing fixed. I know you're telling the truth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat professor looked at the possessed young police woman with doubt in his still teary eyes. \"N...no...you can't help me...no one can...!\" he exclaimed, backing away a little bit more until he found himself on the edge of the rooftop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked straight into Arnie's eyes, trying his best to show him that he meant to help him, which he genuinely did want to do. Jonny would bring Arnie to Lisa's house so that he could recuperate and tell him more about Lena. If he was lucky, Jonny might even learn a way to stop her from what he could be told. But first he had to make sure that Arnie didn't do anything stupid like jump off of this rooftop. \"Arnie. Look at me. Do I look like I think you're crazy?\" he asked, bringing out as much of Leah's innocence and trust as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnie looked at the supposed agent of law and order for a brief moment and then smiled just a little bit. \"No...you don't...\" he said as he took a few steps away from the edge of the roof. He was about to extend his hand to take Leah's when his eyes began glowing purple and his small, nervous smile became an evil grin. \"Well...I see you've found my fat little friend, haven't you? Well done Jonny!\" Arnie exclaimed, now in Lena's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Jonny exclaimed in shock. How had she managed to possess his body that fast? Arnie's fat form didn't even so much as shake as she took over. It was as simple as his eyes changing color....Jonny had to admit, the amount of power that this being had was starting to make him a little bit nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Arnie just laughed more with Lena's voice coming out of his mouth. \"I know what you're thinking Jonny. I can see right into that demonic mind of yours. It's a good idea, but sadly it is destined to fail. Better luck next time, cutie\" she said, blowing Jonny a kiss before she turned around and ran with Arnie's fat body, jumping off the roof in what looked like a canon-ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The fake Leah exclaimed. She ran to the corner of the roof and looked down, seeing Arnie's body on the pavement below in a pool of blood. She cursed under her breath as the roof door was kicked open by Selina, who was holding her gun at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" She asked, her face serious as she was in job-mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny thought for a second before coming up with a believable story. He made Leah's eyes teary and ran to Selina, hugging her tightly, feeling the older cop's breasts pressing against her own. \"Selina! Thank goodness you're here! It was terrible! I...I tried to talk him out of hit, but he...he just jumped from the roof...\" he says in between tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled a little as he felt Selina hug him back tightly. \"It's alright Leah....stuff like this happens to the best of us. It just comes with the job. I wish I could say it gets easier as you get older, but it doesn't. Unfortunately, part of our job is getting used to tragedy\" she said kindly as she released Leah from her grip and smiled at the young woman that was reminder her more and more of herself when she was a rookie.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two women slowly made their way back down the stairs to Arnie's cluttered office as Jonny dried tears from his host's face.  Most of this was for show, of course, but maybe being inside Leah's body genuinely had forced some of her emotions upon its inhabitant, to say nothing of the fact that Jonny did feel the situation was tragic.  He had gotten used to casualties as a cop, and as a demon they were all the more common, but Arnie really did seem like a nice guy.  The fear also threw him--what did this new player want?  Why had Lena chosen to posses Arnie, and what would she do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women made their way back to the police car, informing the department head along the way that Arnie would not be returning to work and that she probably should take the back way out of the building when she left today.  Selina immediately called for the coroner to come and get Arnie's remains.  Of course, as far as she knew, there'd been no crime . . . if she only knew.  \"Are you going to be all right?\" Selina asked.  Jonny sniffled again as Selina started the car up and headed back to the station.  \"Nothing in training prepares you for that . . . seeing one go up close like that.  He did seem like a nice guy . . . but now he's gone,\" Jonny said.  Selina paused like a parent searching for words to comfort a child.  \"You did all you could do,\" she said simply, \"and you did it wonderfully.  The woman from the school made sure to tell me how great a job you did, and that is all that can be asked of you.  You didn't make him jump, and you have to know that his problems were not your problems.  Whatever made him do what he did was there long before we showed up,\" she declared earnestly.  \"Damn . . . this chick really is good,\" Jonny thought to himself, \"in the old days, only my bar tender would have given me advice like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car arrived back at the station, and Selina killed the engine.  The two sat quietly in the car for a moment.  \"It's getting to be about 4,\" Selina said, \"I've got a couple more hours of work, but why don't you take the day off. You've seen a lot and accomplished a lot on your first day, Leah,\" she said to her possessed companion.  Jonny nodded solemnly.  \"Are you sure?\" he asked.  \"Yeah,\" Selina said, \"you've earned a couple hours of extra rest.  Get your mind right,\" she said.  Jonny thanked Selina and exited the car.  He used his host's memories to find her own automobile--an old cop car the lights and siren of which had been removed.  The police logo had been removed in accordance with a local law preventing non-police cars from being adorned with the logo, but Jonny could see it had been present at one time.  \"You certainly do love your job, babe,\" he said to his host body as he maneuvered into the seat of the car and buckled his safety belt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny mused at the jiggling of his breasts against the seat belt and as they were jostled about by pot-holes, which Jonny actively tried to hit as he drove his host's voluptuous form through the streets toward an abandoned building on the outskirts of town.  The car rolled to a stop next to a warehouse that had not been used in years.  \"Looks like a good place for a heart-to-heart,\" Jonny said as he exited the car.  It was about 5:30 now, and the sun had just begun to hang a bit low in the sky.  Jonny walked toward a big warehouse with walls of rusty sheet metal.  He shimmied his way through a hole in the wall and emerged into a great dark room.  Old machines--metallic monsters, skeletons of a bygone industrial era--littered the dusty floor of the giant room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably haven't made a car in here since just a bit after my time,\" Jonny mused to himself as he walked about a little.  He spied an old wooden chair illuminated by some light that shined dimly through a broken window and walked toward it.  He slowly and gingerly sat Leah's bubble butt upon the creaky old chair.  He closed her eyes and concentrated.  \"Here goes,\" he said, using his host's voice for the final time, at least for now.  After a couple seconds of concentration, Jonny's host began to shake and convulse.  As before, her chest jiggled, and her arms and legs let loose a spasm a second as her body seemed overtaken by a seizure.  Gargles and grunts escaped her mouth as her eyes sporadically shifted from a demonic red to her ordinary shade of green.  Suddenly, Jonny, inside his original Jack body, was thrown from Leah's curvy meat suit like a child thrown out of a car seat during a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny landed roughly on the floor of the old factory, the wind knocked out of him.  \"Aw shit,\" Jonny coughed, \"what a ride,\" he mused as he rolled from his back on to his belly and slowly and gingerly stood up, dusting himself off slowly.  Jonny looked down at himself, his male form pale, skinny, and somewhat sickly compared to that of the woman he had so recently inhabited.  \"Not the fanciest, but kind of like an old shoe,\" Jonny said to himself with a smile, chuckling as he heard Jack's voice come out of his mouth again.  Almost as an afterthought, he turned around and beheld the body of Leah Brady unconscious on the floor of the dusty old factory.  She had fallen roughly from the chair, and the force of having a demon inside her had left her unconscious.  He walked up to her and looked down at her sleeping form.  \"Quite a ride honey,\" he said to her with a smile.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned around and shuffled about the place.  He wanted to wait for Leah to wake up.  He had some things to do to cement his hold on her.  After what seemed like way too long, Jonny heard a noise behind him.  He spun around quickly and saw Leah, lying in a heap, stir slowly in the darkened room.  \"'Bout fuckin' time,\" Jonny said quietly as he slowly approached the woman.  She groaned and climbed to all fours and then slowly sat on the chair.  \"Wha--\" she began as she held her hand to hear head.  \"Morning sleepy head!\" Jonny said with a pleasant smile as he approached the woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah held her head and slowly woke up.  She sat limply and sloppily as she leaned back in the chair and groggily glanced around.  \"Wha's hap--who--you . . . ah . . . you're--.  I'm . . . where?\" she mumbled.  \"Struggling a bit my dear?\" Jonny said as he stepped closer.  Leah looked up at him, and her eyes suddenly focused, at least a little.  \"You're the kid from this morning,\" she said tentatively as she still tried to figure out why she found herself where she did.  \"Bingo!\" Jonny yelled, \"or at least partial bingo.\"  Jonny stood before the disoriented woman and tried to come up with a way to explain what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm also a good deal more than that, I'm afraid,\" he said.  \"You see, I'm a demon with powers beyond your comprehension, and I've spent recent times riding around inside this boy named Jack--the unassuming but delightful specimen you see before you.  I nearly killed the Mayor recently, and more bedlam will follow.  I've just concluded the most wonderful day having jumped inside your body, Leah, and let me tell you it was fun.  Your curves are the stuff dreams are made of . . . I'm sure I'll have the pleasure of being inside you again,\" Jonny concluded.  Leah blinked a couple times as she tried to understand all of this.  \"My--my body?\" she said.  Jonny could see this was going to take too long if he did it this way, so he decided to speed things up a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny quickly closed the distance between the two and placed his hand firmly on Leah Brady's thigh.  His eyes glowed red as he concentrated, and hers followed suit.  \"Here's the deal,\" Jonny began, \"I'll need a woman in place at the police station, and I need you to be that woman.  You're going to go about your job and follow orders as you normally would unless I tell you to do otherwise.  If anything with that crazy Lena woman happens, or if anything else I might wish to know about comes to light, you're going to get in touch with me here,\" Jonny instructed as he wrote down his phone number and placed it in the enthralled officer's front pocket.  \"And as to today, you will not remember the details . . . today was a giant blur, and you're not sure what happened.  It scares you a bit that you can't remember . . . what did happen anyway?  And why can't you recall?  You will not remember this conversation or being my servant, nor will you remember the fact that I possessed your body unless you are in close physical proximity to the body I am now in.  Got all that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer nodded sleepily.  \"Follow orders . . . report to you . . . body . . . scared.\"  \"Close enough,\" Jonny replied as he stepped back and his eyes returned to normal.  Hers did too.  Jonny stood for a minute as he looked down at the woman.  \"If you'll pardon me, my dear, it's about six thirty, and I need to get ready for my date with your boss,\" Jonny declared as he disappeared in a puff of black smoke.  The officer would not awake fully for another several minutes.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny puffed back into existence as a cloud of black smoke suddenly appeared at Lisa's house.  Jonny stood for a moment as he looked about in the the darkened room in which there seemed to be no one else.  Jonny now had an in at the police station, or really two--his relationship with Selina was going well, and Leah was a constant servant for him whether she knew it most of the time or not.  If he really needed to, he could very quickly simply jump into her body to keep a closer eye on things at the station.  \"Lisa?\" he called out.  After a few seconds, no answer came.  Jonny was surprised at this.  Where would she be?  He walked into Lisa's bedroom--the one in which the two of them had enjoyed such an amazing night.  \"Lisa?\" he called again.  Still no answer.  Jonny entered the room and flipped the light switch on.  He made his way to a full-length mirror and beheld the Jack body that he had made his own vessel.  \"Aren't you glad I took over--you've gotten a lot more action since I jumped into you,\" Jonny said to his now-absent host with a smile.  He concentrated briefly, and suddenly the ordinary street clothes adorning his meat suit were replaced with nice shiny black shoes, dark pants, and an elegant button-down maroon dress-shirt.  Jonny looked down at himself as if contemplating his borrowed body and conjured wardrobe.  \"Here goes nothing,\" he said as he disappeared in another puff of black smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome miles away was an impressive boardwalk with all the classic trappings of the location--a beautiful ocean view and a shoreline dotted with the lights of restaurants, arcades, clothing stores, and all manner of maritime merriment.  Not long before eight, black smoke filled a dressing room in one of the shore's many clothing stores as Jonny smoked into existence.  He looked around in the small room in which he was alone--it was no bigger than a phone booth.  He eyed his well-clad vessel one last time in the mirror before stepping out in his dress clothes and heading for the door of the store.  A saleswoman eyed him strangely as he strolled by, as she had not seen him go in, and that particular store did not sell the sort of clothes he was wearing.  Jonny didn't even slow to acknowledge the woman, and he walked like he owned the world into the serene evening by the ocean.  He made his way through the clusters of people and came to a giant welcome sign that indicated to visitors that they had now reached the boardwalk itself.  Jonny found a bench nearby and sat himself down, waiting and seeming outwardly patient while tiny butterflies fluttered about inside his belly.  He watched the people walk about--couples hand-in-hand, families, young men who had come to the majestic boardwalk hoping to begin the night single but not end it that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting on the bench for a few minutes, Jonny heard a voice behind him.  \"I'm looking for a hunky young man around here . . . seen one?\" Jonny turned in the direction of the voice and saw a smiling Selina.  She damn near knocked him over . . . she was beautiful.  Selina wore a form-fitting red dress that came down only to her upper thighs, exposing her tanned and toned legs.  Her gorgeous backside was also prominently featured, and the dress hugged her every luscious curve up to and including the wondrous globes hanging from her chest.  She wore a necklace with a jewell nestled between her jaw-dropping breasts, and her hair was pulled back and ran down to well below her shoulders.  She smiled giddily at Jonny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow . . . \" Jonny said as he approached Selina, \"just--um, yeah . . . wow,\" he stuttered, obviously nervous.  The smile dropped from Selina's face.  \"Don't you like the dress?  I mean--well--I've never worn it before but I really wanted to look pretty for you but I can change if you--\" she began, distressed by Jonny's speechlessness.  \"No no no not at all,\" Jonny cut her off, taking her hand in his, \"no no don't change.  You look stunning,\" he said with a nervous smile, and she smiled back.  The two peered into each other's eyes for a minute or two until Jonny broke the silence.  \"So . . . um, dinner?\" he said.  \"Yeah, sure, dinner's good,\" she replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked hand-in-hand toward a place farther down down the boardwalk in the dimming light of the evening.  \"Does this work?\" Selina asked as the two came upon a very nice seafood restaurant.  \"This looks great,\" Jonny said as the two entered.  They were seated in the restaurant's third floor--it was a roof-top dining area that was really beautiful.  It was adorned with candles and very nice settings of various kinds, and the fact of being on the roof gave diners a great view of the water and of the other sights down the boardwalk.  Jonny and Selina ordered, and their food came soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\" Jonny said as he munched on some shrimp.  Selina paused, as though not sure how to answer.  \"Well, it was good . . . weird.  Good though,\" she said, \"I'm afraid we're not much closer to catching whoever tried to take out the mayor.  This lady came in to help us, but she only spouted nonsense.  I did meet a new recruit today who busted a fugitive within hours of starting,\" Selina said with a smile.  Jonny smirked a little, knowing that the hooker was a fake, and the \"officer\" was merely a vessel for Jonny's demonic essence.  \"Well the recruit's off to a good start,\" Jonny declared.  Selina smiled, \"Yeah, yeah she really is.\"  \"Anything else?\" asked Jonny.  Selina paused.  \"Well, and this is one of the ugly parts of my job,\" she began, \"there was this call about this guy . . . nice guy it seemed.  He was a professor who was acting weirder than usual, and me and the new woman went to calm him down and, and he . . . \" she said as she visibly struggled to hold back tears.  She took a break for a moment and simply looked back up at Jonny.  \"Well I'll just say I'm glad you're here . . . been feeling better since you came,\" she beamed.  The two ate in peace and made small talk along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up for a walk?\" Selina asked as she took Jonny excitedly by the hand and pulled him toward the boardwalk.  \"As long as I've got a beautiful lady on my arm, sure,\" Jonny said with a smile.  Selina took Jonny by the arm, and the two walked down the boardwalk in the breezy dark of the night.  The waves crashed not too far off as they walked, and eventually the lights and celebratory buzzers and other sounds of the boardwalk gave way to a pleasant solitude, or at least nearly so--only a few other people were around, and most were on the way home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do today?\" Selina asked.  Jonny pondered for a moment.  He had to come up with something better than admitting he'd possessed Leah and used her body to learn his way around the police station . . . that would be awkward.  \"Oh well I had a good time walking around and seeing the city,\" he said.  The two walked and chatted more and soon approached an area where they were alone.  A giant dock jutted out from the boardwalk and stood above the crashing waves of the ocean.  The two strolled out leisurely on to the dock as the wind rustled through Selina's flowing hair.  They reached the edge of the dock and and peered out upon the water.  Selina peered over the wooden railing of the dock down into the water.  \"How far down do you suppose it is?\" she asked.  Jonny looked down too.  \"I don't know,\" he said, \"probably no more than 20 feet or so, but it is dark,\" he said, somewhat surprised at the question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny felt feelings flailing about inside his barely pubescent body.  His heart quickened.  He became nervous.  Maybe it was some tiny remnant of Jack's consciousness, or maybe Jonny himself honestly didn't know exactly how to handle this beautiful woman on his arm.  Selina moved in close and put her arm around Jonny, leaning her head on his shoulder.  The waves crashed as the water moved about below.  \"I love the water; don't you?\" Selina asked.  \"Yeah,\" Jonny responded, trying to play it cool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Selina made a move.  Jonny felt a pressure that began under his legs as they came off the ground with Selina's arm under them.  Her other arm was up by Jonny's shoulder as his whole body was lifted off the ground.  Selina struggled to lift Jonny a little bit, and he may have heard a couple bones in her back crack as she lifted him.  \"What the hel--?\" he started.  Selina struggled to hold Jonny in her arms for only a couple seconds.  \"Eventually we'll tell our kids about this part,\" she said as she tossed Jonny over the side of the dock and he tumbled toward the water below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhhhh!\" Jonny yelled as he fell and suddenly entered the water, belly first, with a splash.  He was plunged into a murky and dark world of tiny particles of dirk kicked up from the sea floor.  He opened his eyes and could not see more than a couple feet in front of him.  His feet quickly found the sea floor, though; he wasn't very deep in the water.  Within a couple seconds of landing, and still submerged, Jonny detected another entry as a giant cloud of dust kicked up in front of him.  Fumbling around, Jonny found the ground and stood, his upper body rising above the water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in a state of shock, Jonny rubbed his eyes and slicked his messy hair back.  \"What the hell?!\" he yelled out as a smile crept across his face, his tone a mix of irritation and infatuation.  Selina stood up too, just a couple feet from Jonny.  Droplets of water glistened in the night and caressed her wonderful, curvy body.  She smiled broadly.  \"The last thing a woman like me wants to do is be predictable,\" she said sexily.  The two looked romantically at each other.  Jonny moved in slowly, his hands and arms under the water.  Suddenly, he reached around behind Selina and grabbed forcefully on to her luscious, curvy ass as he pulled her close.  She jumped and yelped a little, but not in a way that suggested she minded.  \"Same here,\" he said as he moved closer to her.         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny moved in and pulled the buxom woman into a passionate kiss, the water glistening as her chest heaved with gasps of excitement and pleasure.  As the two parted their kiss, Selina smiled as she breathed heavily.  \"I'm thinking you didn't learn that in school,\" she said as a sexy smile spread across her face.  Jonny breathed heavily too, \"If you'd been one of my teachers, I'd have paid a hell of a lot more attention,\" he exclaimed.  Selina laughed hardily, her breasts bouncing as she did, \"That was good,\" she chuckled.  The two stood there in the glistening water under the dock in the night and looked into each other's eyes.  \"So, um,\" Selina began after a few minutes, \"what will Lisa think of this?\"  Jonny stopped.  He had not considered that up to now.  \"Do we have to tell her?\" he asked.  Selina paused.  \"Well, no, but at some point it will become hard to hide . . . young man like you jetting off during the day to parts unknown . . . she'll ask questions,\" Selina concluded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" Jonny said, \"I think we can cross that bridge when we get to it,\" he said as he stole another kiss, this one a light peck on Selina's lips.  The two slowly made their way toward the beach, trudging through the water with their hands intertwined.  Once out of the water, they stopped.  \"So, where do you think we go from here?\" Selina said, intending the question to be more existential than literal.  Jonny smiled and looked down for a moment in the night.  \"Well I think Lisa's got some things for me to do with her for the next 2 or 3 days, so how about I call you when she tells me I can have some time to myself?\" Jonny suggested.  Obviously, this was a lie because there was nothing specific planned, but Jonny genuinely did not want Lisa to get suspicious, and it would perhaps be useful to give himself the space to do what he wanted, whether that was possessing Leah and hanging out with Selina covertly or doing something with Lisa elsewhere.  \"That works all right,\" Selina said.  The two embraced and kissed each other good night again, and then Selina wiped some water from her eyes. \"So I'm likely to get water all over the car . . . guess I didn't think the ocean thing all the way through,\" she said with a laugh, \"sexy though huh?\" she said.  \"Damn right,\" Jonny said happily.  Selina trudged off and was soon out of sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Selina was gone, Jonny paused for a moment and concentrated.  Suddenly his eyes glowed a familiar red, and the dripping water disappeared from his body, leaving him dry again.  \"Things are getting interesting,\" Jonny said to himself as he pondered his evening.  With that, he disappeared in a puff of smoke, leaving the beach empty again.  He reappeared moments later in Lisa's living room.  Looking around, he saw no one.  \"Lisa?\" he called out as he entered the kitchen and glanced about for her.  \"Master, I'm here,\" came a woman's voice--Lisa's.  Jonny looked into the kitchen and saw Lisa sitting at the table.  She looked glum.  Jonny walked closer and saw that Lisa had put on a simply stunning dress.  It was a green silk dress with straps that hung tightly over her shoulders.  The neckline of the dress was rather generous, accenting Lisa's curves by shoving her jiggle-prone boobs right up under her chin and leaving not much of them to the imagination.  Her belly had a little bit of flab around it that came with middle age, but she had a gorgeous backside, and the dress came down to about her mid-thigh.  Of course, her fiery red hair dangled down from her head.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis vision of beauty sat quietly at the table, smiling a bit as Jonny came in.  Jonny slowed down as he beheld an unusual sight.  Two plates sat upon the table, one with food still on it.  Candles were lit too.  The food that was still there looked as though it had been there awhile.  \"Lisa, what's this?  Did you make dinner?\" Jonny asked.  Lisa smiled weakly.  \"Yes, yes I did.  I--I tried to call you, and then I called Selina's cell, then her home, and I tried her office too, but nobody could find her.  Or you.  I figured I would surprise you when you came home--figured you would be home some time early in the evening . . . it's 11 now,\" she said simply.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jonny began, \"oh well sorry about that but Selina and I were real busy and I guess I should have checked in with you . . . didn't know you were going to make me dinner.  What's the occasion?\" Jonny asked.  Selina opened her mouth to answer, but Jonny cut her off.  \"'Cause see we had all this stuff to do about the Mayor thing, and she let me watch her interview people and talk with the other police, and there was this weird professor guy, and Selina even let me ride in her car and use the siren.  She let me make the doughnut deliv--\" Jonny rambled on, most of it lies anyway.  Lisa decided she could wait no longer; she had to interrupt.  \"I'm pregnant you jackass!!!\" she yelled at her master.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny immediately stopped.  He was dumbstruck.  Pregnant?  As in . . . having a baby?  That sort of pregnant?  Was there any other sort at all?  Some other sort of pregnant?  Pregnant--the thing where the belly gets bigger?  That one?  Wow.  Could that even happen?  Jonny was a demon, so didn't he shoot blanks anyway?  What the hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time this and other thoughts had passed through Jonny's mind and he came back to reality, he looked up and saw that Lisa was gone.  She had run off, but Jonny could hear her elsewhere in the house.  Jonny took very slow steps.  \"Um, Lisa?\" he called out as he made his way in the direction of the sounds.  He entered Lisa's bedroom--the one they had shared.  He heard the noises coming from the other side of the bed.  Jonny slowly made his way in that direction and saw the beautiful  woman down on her knees on the floor with her face to the ground and her body shaking.  She seemed to be crying.  He walked up and put his hand gingerly on her shoulder.  \"Lis--Lisa sorry you know I didn't mean to be mean or anything I just--well, wow is all, you know?\" Jonny said.  He slowly took Lisa's hand and helped her up, and the to sat on the bed.  Jonny looked at Lisa's face and saw that she had been in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a deep breath.  \"I hadn't been feeling great the last couple days, so I made an appointment at the doctor today while you were gone.  I was there all day.  They did a whole bunch of tests and things, and they couldn't find anything that might have been causing how I felt--stuffy, bloated, achy, tired, all sorts of stuff.  At the end of al the tests, the doctor was about to send me home and just tell me to rest it off, but the thought he'd run one more test and, sure enough, he said there was a baby,\" Lisa explained still crying a bit.  \"And and and well I got real emotional,\" she continued, \"'cause I didn't expect it, and I didn't plan to have another kid.  I'll be 45 tomorrow!\" she exclaimed, \"I don't know if my body is made for having kids anymore, so you know I just wanted you around.  You make me feel better.  Then I couldn't find you . . . \" she said, crying harder again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny wished he knew what to say.  He didn't, so he just too k the beautiful woman in her arms and held her, kissing her lightly on the cheek and saying he was sorry.  \"We're going to be ok--we'll make it through this,\" he said.  \"We will?\"  Lisa asked.  We will,\" Jonny declared.  Lisa seemed reassured.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . . . so pregnant huh?  Your boobs'll get bigger right?\" Jonny said.  Lisa looked up and smiled a bit.  \"Well, they should, but I don't think that happens until later you horny little man,\" she said, a grin on her face.  The two looked at each other for another minute, and Jonny kissed Lisa on the lips.  \"So you really think it's going to be ok?\" Lisa asked.  \"Yes,\" Jonny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late.  I'm going to get ready for bed,\" Lisa said as she stood up and headed for her walk-in closet, presumably to put on a nightgown.  \"I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow . . . ultra sound.  I want you to go with me, please?\" she said.  \"I'll go,\" Jonny said as he lay down in the bed.  Jonny didn't know what to do.  He didn't even know demons could have kids.  What would it be like--the kid?  What would it be like for Lisa to carry around the offspring of an alpha demon inside her middle-aged body?  Could she take it?  Could Jonny take it?  Who knew?  Lisa crawled into bed, and Jonny snuggled up to her from behind and put his arms around her, his hand on her belly, and her hand on his hand. The two drifted off to sleep.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two lay in bed together as the night rolled over them and shadows crept across the silent house.  Lisa had trouble getting to sleep, and even in her sleep she tossed and turned.  Strange visions and feelings assaulted her slumber as the immensity of what now confronted her fell upon her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lisa's eyes shot open.  She had been breathing heavily, and her heart raced in her well-endowed chest.  She felt sweat roll down her forehead and reached up to wipe her fiery red hair from her eyes.  Lisa was confused, and she looked about the room.  \"Wha--\" she began, as she noticed that Jonny was not in the bed next to her.  Where had he gone?  She looked the other way, this time toward the window, and she saw the bright light of the sun as it hung low in the sky.  Streaks of pink ran across the clouds and cast a sort of reddish glow everywhere outside.  Lisa wiped the sleep from her eyes and glanced at the clock.  It read 5:47 PM.  \"PM?,\" Lisa began, \"what the hell happened?\" she said to herself.  She had gone to sleep at the normal time the night before . . . at least she was pretty sure it was the night before.  How could she have slept so late?  Why didn't Jonny wake her up?  Where had he gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa moved suddenly to get out of the bed, setting her feet on the floor and moving to stand.  Suddenly, she stopped.  A sharp pain tore through her stomach.  She held her hand to her belly and looked down.  \"Oh my god,\" she said as she looked down and saw herself.  She was not dressed in the nightgown she had gone to bed in.  Rather, she saw her jiggle-prone boobs peeking out of the tops of a very tight-fitting black dress, one with a low-cut top that left little of her chest to the imagination.  It was lacy and black in color.  The notable thing, though, was not the sexy little black dress, or even the boobs, which were admirable by any standard.  Lisa looked down and saw a giant bulge in her belly.  \"How the hell--\" she began as she ran her hands slowly across her bulging stomach.  It was as though she had swallowed a couple basketballs. \"I'm not supposed to be this big already,\" Lisa said as surprise, fear, and confusion gripped her, \"I just found out yesterday . . . baby shouldn't be here for months,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise was suddenly audible outside the bedroom door.  Lisa's head jerked up and in that direction.  She slowly and gingerly stepped forward, as silent and careful as she could be given her bloated body.  She felt the jiggle of her belly and boobs as she snuck up to the doorway and listened.  It sounded like laughter and conversation . . . mostly female voices, and some of them sounded familiar.  \"Get into me next please?  I've been waiting all night, and I want you in me!\" said one of the women.  \"And can you make me addicted to chocolate for at least a couple weeks . . . my husband likes curvy women, and I'm hoping some of the extra weight goes right to my tits,\" came another voice.  Then a third voice chimed in.  \"Can you jump into my pool boy and fuck me?  He's sexy, but he tells me I remind him too much of his mother,\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, please, all in good time . . . I've got plans for this city yet, and I'll be happy to help you all once I begin the next phase of my plan,\" came a familiar male.  It was Jonny!!!  Surely he could help . . . if he couldn't, then who could?  Lisa quickly bounded out of the darkness of her bedroom and into the light of the living area.  After a few short seconds of walking, bounced her curvy body into the living room, where she saw a bunch of people sitting together on the couch, mostly women, but some men.  The women were in various stages of undress, though a couple were fully clothed.  Lisa looked them over.  There was Amanda Long, a woman of 32 known for her toned body and relentless fitness regimen.  She had blonde hair and a pretty smile.  Apparently her husband liked women with a bit more junk in the trunk, as well as in the chest, because hers was the voice that asked Jonny to make her addicted to chocolate.  At the moment, she leaned over Jonny sexily with her arm around Jonny as she smiled like a little schoolgirl at him.  Amanda was quite familiar to Lisa; it turned out that Amanda was a partner of a major accounting firm in the city known to handle the auditing of the government's books.  They were heavy hitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw another face she recognized--that of Beverley Bivens, a woman aged 43 years Lisa had met in law school.  Beverley had black hair and a curvy, voluptuous body that had made a couple concessions to age.  She had never had any children, as her work had prevented it.  She had a loveless marriage with a man fifteen years her senior who spent much of the time out of the country on business.  It turned out that the curvy cougar Beverley harbored rather intense feelings for her pool boy, because she had been the one who asked Jonny to posses him and use his body to fuck her.  Today, Beverley wore tight-fitting yoga pants, but no top at all.  Her bouncing breasts were barely contained by a lacy red braw, and she shoved her boobs about as close to Jonny's face as she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other women in the room included Janet Rife, who ran the city's health department and was 37, as well as Linda Glass, a woman of 39 with a Harvard MBA and the task of managing the retirement plans for city workers by investing properly in various mutual funds, stocks, annuities, etc.  There were also a couple other women Lisa did not recognize.  Both of them were dressed in skimpy bathing suits.  The strange thing was that no one seemed to find any of this odd--people at Lisa's house in the evening with partially naked women just walking around in polite company caused not even the slightest pause.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw a man she recognized too--Jackson Stevens, a 64-year old bald man with a bulging gut and short stature.  He was a lawyer with the firm that Lisa used to work for.  He'd been assigned to the section that handled securities litigation and had risen through the ranks to partner and ended up running that particular section of the firm.  He made several romantic passes at Lisa without success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of all of this was Jonny himself.  He sat cooly on the couch with a suit--dark in color, but comfortable.  The women hung over him giddily, and the men leaned in to hear whatever pearls of wisdom he might impart.  As Lisa stepped gingerly into the light and approached the onlookers and Jonny, one of them looked up.  \"He sexy,\" Beverly Bivens said with a smile as her breasts jiggled delightfully.  Jonny looked up too--a smile spreading across his face as he saw Lisa.  \"Hey honey,\" he said.  Lisa tried to fake a smile.  \"Hey everybody,\" she said as all the assembled people greeted her.  \"Jonny,\" Lisa began, \"could I borrow you for a moment,\" she asked, injecting some urgency into her voice.  Jackson Stevens pried his eyes away from Lisa's curvy, pregnant body for a minute and placed his hand on Jonny's shoulder.  \"Buddy,\" he said, \"when a woman who looks like that demands your presence, get your ass over there,\" he said with a smile.  Jonny smiled back.  \"Indeed, Jack,\" he said as he stood up and made his way toward Lisa.  The women seemed disappointed as he left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up to Lisa and lowered his voice.  \"What's up, Lisa?\" he asked.  Lisa didn't know how to articulate what she was feeling.  She looked down at herself, at her bloated belly barely contained by the skimpy dress.  \"I--\" she began, \"I don't know what's happening to me,\" she said as she motioned to her bloated middle and struggled to hold back tears, \"my body, I--I just don't understand,\" she said, giving Jonny a look that indicated her distress.  Jonny leaned in and gave Lisa a big hug and a passionate kiss on the lips.  \"Lisa, you're pregnant,\" he said, \"I know it's no fun . . . I've been pregnant women before, but this is what's supposed to happen.  Everything's gonna be fine,\" he said.  \"I've got to get back our guests . . . we're planning the baby shower,\" Jonny declared as he headed back into the living room while Lisa was left there, quite unsatisfied and not feeling better at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood there and mulled this over in her mind.  \"Why don't I remember anything between going to bed with Jonny and waking up very pregnant a few minutes ago,\" Lisa asked no one in particular, still somehow begging for an answer, \"did somebody posses me?\"      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Lisa heard a noise from upstairs.  It was a sort of loud thud, as though someone had dropped something or fallen rather ungracefully.  Lisa walked away from the living room and toward the stairs.  She grasped the banister sternly as she maneuvered her bloated body up the stairs slowly.  She had to stop and take a breath a couple times as she ascended the stairs.  She'd never had to do that before--presumably the pregnancy was to blame.  Lisa reached the tops of the stairs a couple minutes later, huffing and puffing and beginning to sweat.  She began the long walk down the hallway, past the home theater she'd had put in a few years ago, and also past a home office she had used before Jonny came into her life.  More thuds could be heard as Lisa came closer to one of the many upstairs bedrooms--they were louder as she got closer.  She slowly approached the door she thought was the source of the noise and put her ear to it, trying to get some sense of what the hell was going on before she took the plunge and stepped in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she heard surprised her.  \"I can flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,\" came a female voice from behind the door, followed by another thud.  The voice seemed to be that of a grown woman, yet filled with total, unadulterated joy.  Lisa listened a bit more.  \"I'm Ssssssssssssssssssssuuuuuuuuper Lady!!!!!\" came the voice again, \"and I can fly like an airplane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" the woman behind the door said, and then there came another loud thud sound.  Lisa slowly turned the door knob and stepped into the room.  The room was a big one--it had high ceilings and a balcony at the far end of the room.  The view to the outside was beautiful, but the door had a number of different child safety locks on it, as one might use to keep a young child from opening a door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa glanced around the room.  The place was a mess.  The bed looked as though it had not been made in days.  Toys--lots of toys, everything from Power Rangers and Iron Man figures to Barbie Dolls and tea sets--were strewn all about the floor.  Off in the corner was a set of army men in such numbers that it looked like somebody was trying re-enact Gettysburg with them.  \"What the hell?\" Lisa started, and then she looked over in the corner of the room.  In the corner sat a small plastic table that seemed to be pink.  It was surrounded by a number of small plastic chairs, and the table was covered with cute little plastic cups and plates.  There were also plastic sugar holders and salt and pepper shakers, and, rather notably, there were plastic tea kettles.  \"A little girl's tea party set . . . like the one I had when I was little,\" Lisa mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this cute little table sat a person Lisa did not expect to see there.  She was way to big for the little children's tea set--she looked like a fully grown woman.  This woman had blonde hair, and Lisa figured from what she could see of the woman that she was in her early forties.  She wore a wedding ring on her ring finger.  This woman seemed to be having a tea party with this little bunch of children's toys all by herself.  She would take the pink plastic tea kettle and seem to pour something into one of the tea cups, even though there was no actual tea involved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa approached, the floor creaked a bit under her bloated body.  Suddenly, the woman looked up at her through wide eyes.  A better looked at the woman's face seemed to confirm her age--early 40s and with pretty blonde hair.  She wore pants that seems to be the bottom part of a set of scrubs, as a nurse might wear.  Lisa noticed that the strange woman didn't have a top, or at least almost not.  The woman appeared to have a fairly impressive set of breasts adorning her chest.  They bounced and jiggled as the woman stood up excitedly.  Still, she wore no bra.  Instead, it looked as though she had gotten lazy.  Instead of a bra, the woman seemed to have taken her top and simply tied it around her cleavage just to hold it in place.  This was weird indeed.  \"Wanna play tea party?!\" the woman asked, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea party?\" Lisa asked.  \"Yeah!\" the strange woman said with a wide-eyed smile.  \"Can we pretend it's my house, 'cause I want to pretend it's my tea party, and you can be my friend Lisa, and we can have tea together!  Wanna play?!\"  Lisa stood there, puzzled.  \"Why the hell is a woman your age playing tea party?\" she asked, \"and why don't you have a bra.  You're what--my age?\" Lisa asked.  Suddenly, the woman's expression changed.  The smile quickly fell from her face, and tears seemed to well up behind her eyes.  She dropped a plastic tea kettle she had offered to Lisa.  \"IF I'M INSIDE A LADY I WANNA HAVE A TEA PARTY!\" the woman suddenly screamed at the top of her lungs, shaking the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a couple steps back, holding her hands up defensively. \"Okay okay, have a tea party if you want, you--wait--inside a lady?\" Lisa asked.  That was a strange phrase, and it was the sort that a very small number of entities would probably use.  Suddenly, Lisa was distracted by a noise on the other side of the bed.  She quickly shuffled over to see the source of the noise--it sounded like someone moaning in pain.  What Lisa saw floored her even more.  It was a woman lying sprawled on the floor in a tight-fitting skirt and suit top and a silky white shirt.  The woman stirred and put her hand to her head as if to sooth pain.  \"What the hell happened to me?\" the woman asked.  The woman had a fit and toned body.  Unlike the crazy lady holding the tea party across the room, this woman was African American.  She was quite beautiful and seemed to be a decade and change younger than her less sane, tea-obsessed counterpart.  She was probably in her late 20s or early thirties.  The woman slowly stood and seemed to be in pain.  She had large breasts perched beautifully upon her chest, but her arms, belly, and legs were toned--this woman worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" came the call from the crazy braless blonde lady as she bounded over excitedly, causing a mighty jiggle in her chest, \"Do YOU wanna have a tea party with me?!\" she asked as she offered the tea kettle to the confused black woman.  \"Honey, are you nuts?!\" the woman asked, \"how did I get in this room?\" she demanded angrily.  The blonde dropped the plastic tea kettles and hung her head.  Tears began to come from her eyes and down her cheeks.  \"Why doesn't anybody wanna play tea party with me?!\" she demanded in distress.  the black woman looked at her like she had four heads.  \"Off your meds, honey?\" she asked as the half-clothed blonde sobbed and Lisa stood and watched the spectacle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde stood there and cried for a few seconds. The wiped her nose and her eyes with her make-shift bra--a top tied around her boobs.  She stood silently and looked down for a few seconds.  When her eyes turned upward, a strange smile made its way across her face.  Her eyes were eerily fixed upon the black woman.  \"I know how to make you play,\" the blonde said.  Suddenly, she closed the distance between herself and the second woman.  She walked right up to her and grabbed her by the head and pulled her close into what looked like a passionate kiss.  Lisa's jaw dropped as she saw black smoke crawl out of the blonde woman's mouth and force its way down the throat of the younger black woman.  Both bodies shook and jiggled and gargled as the transfer happened.  Lisa had seen this before whenever Jonny possessed someone new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" Lisa said as the transfer ended and the blonde woman's body fell to the ground like a rag doll.  The black woman stood there with a blank look on her face.  It was as though the woman's mind and soul could not deal immediately with having something new controlling her body and needed to reboot.  A minute or so passed as Lisa stood and watched.  \"What the hell are you?\" she asked the demon's new vessel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, the black woman looked up, a strange smile on her face.  Her hands made their way over her toned and fit body as she looked down at herself.  She looked around the room silently.  \"I said what are you!?\" Lisa demanded.  The woman turned and looked at her, smile still on her face.  She didn't say a word.  Instead she slowly made her way toward Lisa, eyes fixed on her.  She came closer.  Still she said nothing.  She looked down at Lisa's middle.  Lisa followed suit.  She looked down at her bloated, pregnant belly barely contained by the lacy black dress.  Her stomach had been totally normal when she went to bed, but now she looked like she was 8 months pregnant.  Without saying anything, the black woman reached her hand out and set it firmly upon Lisa's pregnant stomach, smiling broadly as she did.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Lisa's eyes shot open.  She was breathing heavily and sweating in the dark of the night.  She looked frantically to her left and saw Jonny slopingly peacefully next to her.  She quickly got up and ran as silently and quickly as she could into her large bathroom and closed the door.  She flipped on the light and quickly brushed the hair and sleep from her eyes as she took a look at herself.  She leaned in close to the mirror and beheld herself--she looked normal.  She blinked a couple times.  Her reflection did the same.  The looked farther down, tearing open the silk nightgown she had worn to bed.  She was not wearing a bra, so her large, generous boobs swung free, bouncing and jiggling on her chest.  The cold of the early morning blew through the room, hardening her nipples as she ran her hands over her curvy body just to make sure everything was in order.  It seemed to be.  She put her head in her hands and thanked god silently for the fact that it had all been a dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then turned sideways and beheld herself in the mirror.  Her naked breasts stuck out from her chest beautifully.  She put her hand on her belly and examined herself, feeling about her stomach.  Gone was the bulge.  Gone was the massively pregnant belly--Lisa wasn't any more bloated or any bigger than she had been when she went to bed.  She exhaled a massive sigh of relief as she took all this in.  \"Oh thank god,\" she said, \"it was just a bad dream . . . I'll go to the doctor tomorrow and everything'll be fine . . .  all a dream,\" she reassured herself as she turned the light back off and headed back into the bedroom.  She closed her robe back up and climbed into bed next to Jonny, closing her eyes and falling back to sleep.  It was 4:02 AM, and the hours to come would bring the doctor visit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon shone though the bathroom window, high up on the wall.  A few small beams of light pierced the darkness of the room and landed upon the very mirror in which Lisa had examined herself.  As the light crept through the window and across the room, a reflection of Lisa still stood at the mirror--in the mirror, in fact.  It was Lisa as she had been when she stood before the mirror a few minutes ago, but she'd gone back to bed.  This Lisa stood inside the mirror, her nightgown open revealing her generous chest.  She looked down at her voluptuous body, examining it and feeling herself for the first time.  A smile crept across the face of the silent visage, and her eyes turned a pitched black just before she disappeared from the mirror.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa woke up her eye, to the bright sunlight and sat up in bed with a warm smile on her face. Lisa knew that she hadn't been able to sleep well last night, but she could barely remember the reason why anymore. All she knew was that her appointment with the doctor was in a few hours and that she had to get ready. Lisa looked down at Jonny's sleeping body and gently kissed his cheek before be turned in his sleep. He looked so peaceful, not at all like the vicious demon that Lisa knew he was on the inside. Lisa debated waking him up, but decided against it. He deserved a few more minutes of sleep. She gently got off the bed and went into the bathroom, dropping her nightgown onto the floor as she turned on the hot shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, Lisa examined herself in the mirror, smiling at her reflection in a content way. She was a beautiful woman who had aged very well, had a lover who was nearly all powerful, and was now going to have a second chance at being a mother. Could anything go wrong? Suddenly, Lisa's reflection appeared to laugh and Lisa jumped back, startled. When she looked back at the mirror it was just her surprised face again. Lisa frowned. Was this a side affect of her demonic pregnancy or was she just tired? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's either, honey\" her reflection said, causing Lisa to jump in shock. She should really be used to things like this happening around her since, Jonny came into her life, but something told Lisa that this was just one of those things she'd never really be able to adapt to. She was, after all, only human. \"Oh honey, don't kid yourself\" her reflection said to her, \"you're far from human now that your carrying Jonny's little package.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Lisa asked her reflection in a quiet voice, not wanting to wake up Jonny. Her reflection smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm you, Lisa. Or at least a part of you. You see, you're carrying a baby that is incredibly powerful. The child of an alpha demon and a human. Because of that, there's a bit of a power build up in your body right now. As your child grows in you, it will only become stronger. Your subconscious mind created me using the small part of your baby's power that you can currently access. I'm you in every way, but I know how to handle a demonic pregnancy. You'll face challenges in this that you will need help with, trust me. I'm that helper. Consider me a built in nanny for when things get too out of hand. for example, when your child decides it's too cramped in your body and decides to hop right out of there and into the nearest available meatsuit, you'll be begging me to help calm the situation. Remember your dream last night? That was a vision of what things will be like once the baby can access even a fourth of it's power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa frowned. She remembered enough of the dream to know that what her reflection was saying was right. \"How did you end up in my bathroom mirror?\" She asked, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Lisa shrugged. \"After you had the dream, you came in here. You were a wreck with worry so I guess you subconsciously ejected me and I got stuck in here. It's not so bad, but I'd really rather be back in the back of your mind so that I can help you when you need it. Please let me out?\" She asked, putting her hand on the edge of the mirror. Lisa frowned, unsure what to do. She wanted to raise her baby by herself, but this did seem like it would be helpful when things get too stressful. Lisa had to admit that Jonny wouldn't be home all the time, and the baby may even prove too difficult for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll only take me over if you absolutely need to?\" Lisa asked, still having a nagging feeling that this wasn't safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of her reflection glowed purple suddenly, causing Lisa to be a little taken aback. \"Of course, honey. Why would I lie to you? I'm you\" she said with a grin on her face, putting her hand on the edge of the mirror. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny groaned as his eyes fluttered open slowly.  He looked around and saw the thin, delicate light of the morning peeking through the window to Lisa's bedroom.  He glanced at the clock, which ready 8:04 AM.  He sat upright and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.  He glanced over to the spot next to him, seeing the beautiful red-head lying next to him, her breasts exposed and rising and falling gently with her breathing--her gown had fallen open.  Jonny smiled at her as he looked her over, and he leaned down and planted a kiss on her cheek.  She stirred just a little bit but no more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny got up and walked quietly across the room toward Lisa's bathroom. As he did, he stripped off his underwear, leaving his host body entirely naked.  As he stepped into the bathroom, the cold tile of the room sent tiny shivers through his young, thin host, and tiny goosebumps forming on the young man formerly known as Jack.  Jonny walked over to the walk-in shower and reached inside, turning on the warm water and letting it free from the shower head above.  After waiting a few seconds to make sure the water was warm, Jonny slowly stepped in, letting the massage-like pattern of warm, refreshing water wash over his body.  This was precisely the sort of nice warm shower that would undue the stress-related tension and knots that accompanied a hard day.  Jonny glanced around the shower as the steam rose up from the floor, creating a sort of haze--a fog that filled the small room that was the shower.  It was small only in very general terms, but it was actually pretty big for a shower.  One could walk around in it, much like a big walk-in closet.  There was even a bench over by the wall complete with water-proof cushions one could sit upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny began to zone out as his mind wandered.  What would it be like to be a father?  What would the baby be like--would it have powers?  How soon could those powers be used?  What would be the effect of that on Lisa, whose body and soul were still very human?  Perhaps most importantly, what would the Old Man think of this, and how soon could Jonny expect a visit from him?  Jonny did not imagine he would be overjoyed at the prospect of a demon--particularly his alpha demon--having a child with a human woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny suddenly leapt nearly out of his skin as he felt a hand placed firmly on his shoulder from behind.  He jumped with surprise as he looked back, fully ready to summon his demonic energy to blast somebody to kingdom come.  What he saw settled him.  Lisa's pleasant face smiled at him from behind.  \"Didn't mean to scare you,\" she said as she leaned in close to him, looking down on him a bit because she was the taller of the two, \"but I did hope I could join you.\"  Jonny turned around and beheld Lisa.  She really was beautiful.  Tiny points of light danced across her shining skin as the water droplets fell upon her beautiful, voluptuous body.  Her hair became drenched with water within just a few seconds as the water fell upon her.  She leaned in close to Jonny as a beautiful smile came across her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a minute.  Jonny looked back into her eyes.  \"I'm sorry I seemed angry yesterday,\" she began, \"it's just stressful, you know?  I didn't mean to yell at you . . . you didn't know you had any reason to be there, and--\" she began.  She suddenly stopped as Jonny reached his arms around her body and pulled her in suddenly for a passionate kiss, and Lisa moaned with pleasure during the kiss that lasted a good fifteen or twenty seconds.  When Jonny released her, she smiled longingly at him.  \"So I take that to mean you don't hold a grudge?\" she said with a slight laugh.  Jonny smiled back.  \"Yeah, you could say that,\" he said as he chuckled and caressed Lisa's back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's on your mind?\" Jonny asked.  Lisa paused.  \"Ummmmmm,\" she said, \"that I'm going to have to go back out and buy maternity clothes again at some point,\" she said as she began to crack up, \"I didn't figured I'd be doing that at my age,\" she said.  \"You don't have any left from when you had your son?\" Jonny asked.  Lisa shook her head.  \"I threw them all out.\"  \"Oh well,\" Jonny said, \"that can be addressed.\"  Lisa stepped back a tiny bit as her mind ticked through a list of thoughts while she grabbed the soap and began covering her body with it, which Jonny thought was a shame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well . . . also pondering the fact that I should probably start doing Yoga or something . . . pregnant women do that I think . . . keeps their bodies in shape.\"  Jonny chuckled.  \"I've had quite a bit of experience with your body . . . trust me you need no help.\"  Lisa blushed a bit.  \"I'm my own worst critic,\" she explained.  \"I don't know exactly how we're going to explain this to the world,\" she said, \"I mean, we'll have the appointment today, and I figured we could explain your being there by saying you're my nephew or something . . . there for emotional support.  But my friends and family are going to want to know who the father is, and I can't very well say, 'Well see my boyfriend is actually a demon inside the body of a college student, and he made me his slave, but then I fell in love with him, and now I drive him around and help him spread mayhem and bedlam across the city.'\"  \"That is a bit of a mouthful,\" Jonny confirmed, \"we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought still more.  \"Last time I was pregnant, I got put on bed rest for I think the last six weeks . . . I'll be of no use to your plans if that happens again,\" she said, disappointed at the thought.  Jonny paused for a moment.  \"Well maybe I'll posses some pregnant woman and we can hang out in your room and stuff our faces with chocolate.  I'll make us a couple new slaves so we don't even have to get out of bed,\" he said playfully.  Lisa laughed.  \"You've got an answer for everything, don't you?\"  \"Pretty much,\" Jonny answered.  He had to pretend he knew what the hell he was doing.  The last thing Lisa needed was her master admitting he was nearly as lost as she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" Jonny said, \"I've got some important work to do,\" he declared as he moved in quickly and kissed Lisa lovingly as he began to thrust his erect member into her vagina.  Lisa moaned with pleasure as she struggled to take a breath.  \"Well my your are excitable,\" she said happily.  \"The worst thing that could happen is I get you knocked up, and I'd say that ship has sailed,\" Jonny declared.  The two began an episode of erotic fun there among the water and steam as the condensation and heavy breathing obscured them behind the foggy windows of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite a while of making love, the two stepped out of the shoer, opening the door and letting the steam spill out into the rest of the bathroom.  Jonny emerged from the misty chamber like a conquering hero, and Lisa just smiled as she walked a bit gingerly into her bedroom.  \"A damn fine way to start the day,\" Jonny declared as he strutted about.  A check of the clock revealed it was now 10 AM as Jonny walked into the bedroom and materialized some clothes on his host body.  Lisa put on a pair of lacy red panties and fastened a smiler bra around her beautiful, bouncing chest.  She seemed to struggle just a little to accomplish the latter just a little bit.  She pulled a silky pink blouse out of the closet and put it on, fastening the buttons down the front, leaving the low-cut collar wide open to expose her wonderful cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa next grabbed a pair of jeans out of the dresser and pulled them up over her sexy thighs and around her luscious ass.  She fastened the jeans around front, though it seemed to Jonny she had to inhale and struggle just a bit to get them buttoned.  Jonny didn't say anything about it.  Lisa fluffed her hair and put on a couple rings she always wore.  \"Appointment's at eleven,\" she said, \"and we have to get there and check me in.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of puttering around, Jonny and Lisa walked out to the car and got in.  Lisa brought the car engine to life and drove off in the direction of the hospital--where her OBGYN rented space for her office.  Jonny's heart started to beat fast inside his host body.  Maybe it was the remnant of a natural human instinct that no demon could entirely drive out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, they had arrived and walked up to the reception desk.  Lisa gave her name and was told to head to the appropriate floor and the right room.  Jonny followed close behind.  The two walked into the waiting area and sat down in a couple chairs with other patients, and Lisa began to leaf through a magazine as Jonny tried to calm his nerves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

Other women sat in the waiting room--mostly with their husbands.  Most of them looked somewhat strangely at Jonny, as he was the only fairly young man in the room accompanying a 40-something woman.  Jonny felt their eyes and their judgment upon him as he waited quietly and tried to find something else to occupy his mind.  \"Lisa?\" came the voice of a receptionist.  \"Thank God,\" Jonny said as he quickly stood up, relieved to be leaving the prying gaze of the other expectant mothers in the room.  Lisa looked suddenly at Jonny a bit surprised, but she smiled pleasantly as the woman took them both behind the reception area and into the doctor's office.  \"She'll be with you soon,\" the woman said pleasantly.  \"Thanks,\" Lisa said as she sat down in a chair to wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny glanced nervously about at the sort of posters one might expect on the wall of an OBGYN's office--diagrams of the female reproductive system, the various parts of a fertilized egg, and other similar displays.  \"What's wrong?\" Lisa asked calmly.  Jonny looked back at her, uncertain of what to say.  He paused.  \"I enjoy female bodies a great deal,\" he whispered, \"I've enjoyed spending time inside them for quite some time now, but I never developed any particular interest in the particulars of how they work.  Boobs bounce.  Asses jiggle beautifully.  That's all I need,\" Jonny said uncomfortably.  Lisa smiled and chuckled a little.  \"A bit hot under the collar, are we?\" Lisa said playfully, \"you know ever woman you've possessed has that fancy equipment on the diagram, right?\" she said with a slight smile.  \"Yeah, yeah I know, but I never possessed a woman on account of her beautiful uterus if you catch my drift,\" Jonny said.  Lisa shook her head, continuing to chuckle but deciding to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" came the voice of another woman as she opened the door.  Jonny looked up.  Through the door stepped a beautiful woman.  She had long black hair cascading down from her head, and that black hair framed a beautiful face with full lips and skin that was slightly tanned, as though this woman was of Mexican ancestry.  This woman appeared to be about 30 years old, and Jonny could see she had a beautiful figure despite the fact that her white medical coat covered up some of the fun parts.  A beautiful set of breasts pushed out from her chest, straining against a red blouse she wore.  Farther down, Jonny beheld a set of wide, child-bearing hips down from which there stretched a long set of legs complete with full, meaty thighs encased in tight black pants.  \"Hello, I'm Rosa Flores,\" set the Latina vision before Jonny as she shook Lisa's hand, \"and you must be Lisa,\" she said, a tiny hint of a Mexican accent in her melodious voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Lisa said as she smiled pleasantly back at the doctor.  \"Who's this strapping young lad?\" the doctor asked.  A look of slight panic crossed Lisa's face.  \"Um, this is--ah--my nephew Jonny.  I promised my sister I'd take him shopping for a bunch of student gear from the university clothing store, but I made him come with me to the doc's first, so here he is,\" she explained.  The doctor smiled.  \"Well it's good to see a young man like yourself willing to step into this ocean of estrogen and give your aunty a hand,\" Flores said with a smile.  She then turned to Lisa.  \"If I could get you to come up here on the table, that'd be great,\" she said, and Lisa stood and walked over to a cushioned slab, a sort of bed-like thing that allowed doctors to get a better look at patients.  Lisa jumped up on the thing and sat down.  The next few minutes involved the doctor going through the important (but essentially boiler-plate) formalities of a medical examination.  Lisa was told to stick out her tongue and say \"aaaaahhhh\" and was bopped on the knee with an instrument designed to test reflexes.  The doc placed a stethoscope across Lisa's bountiful and beautiful chest to measure her heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, everything seems fine so far, but let's have a look inside, shall we?  Lie back please,\" said Flores, and with that Lisa lay back on the cushioned slab.  \"Let's see that belly,\" Rosa said politely as Lisa pulled up her shirt and revealed her bare stomach.  The pregnancy was not visible yet; her stomach protruded no more than Jonny had expected.  \"This'll be a bit cold,\" Flores said as she took a tube not unlike those that held toothpaste and from it squirted a jelly-like blue fluid on to Lisa's stomach.  Lisa jumped a little bit and squirmed as Jonny held her hand.  \"Sorry, I know it's cold . . . wish we could fix that,\" the doctor said.  Flores then took a medical instrument with a long cord attached to the end and began to rub the instrument about Lisa's exposed stomach.  The cord led to a monitor on which some somewhat grainy images began to appear.  These seemed largely like dots and static to Jonny, but he presumed the doctor could interpret them.  Strange, rhythmic tones also groaned out of the machine; they sounded like muffled tones a sub's sonar would pick up.  Lisa looked nervously down at Jonny and then to the strange machine.  Jonny smiled back at her as he held her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny then nervously looked over at Dr. Flores, her eyes fixed upon the machine as she guided the wand-like instrument around Lisa's stomach.  Jonny watched Dr. Flores closely as she stared at the screen.  \"Um,\" she began, a noticeable frown crossing her face, \"there seems to be a pr--\" she began, but Johnny acted quickly.  He stood and concentrated in a single act; he felt the pressure and the demonic power swirling and building within him, and he quickly thrust his hands outward, and from them came a red orb that expanded and enveloped the room like a shockwave, catching both Lisa and Dr. Flores in its wake at once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned around and looked at Lisa.  She was catatonic, her eyes open and glowing a vibrant red as she gazed up dumbly as the ceiling.  He then looked to Dr. Flores, whose eyes were similarly glazed over and red.  Jonny walked over to the sexy Latina, standing in front of her as she stared blankly back.  \"Tell me what you were going to say,\" he said flatly.  The doctor obliged.  \"The baby is developing oddly . . . looks normal on the outside, but the inside of the baby is just a swirling, shifting mass of something the machine doesn't know how to read.  I've never seen it before, and the baby's heart is beating fast enough that most people would be dead if it happened to them,\" the woman said in a monotone voice.  \"Anything else?\" Jonny asked.  \"No,\" the doctor replied.  Jonny paused for a minute.  \"Here's the deal,\" he began, \"you're going to tell Lisa that everything is fine and that nothing is amiss, but that, because of her age, you want to see her back in a few weeks to begin appointments that will happen throughout the pregnancy to track her progress and the baby's.  Next time we're back, you and I will have one of these delightful conversations again, all right?\" Jonny said.  \"Yes, Master,\" the woman said.  Jonny walked over and sat down, concentrating again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple seconds, the eyes of the two women returned to normal.  \"Well it looks like you've got a perfectly healthy baby in that belly of yours,\" Flores said as she replaced the instrument and wiped the jelly from Lisa's stomach.  Lisa smiled at the news, \"Good,\" she said.  \"Women don't usually have kids at about 45,\" Flores said, \"so just to make sure you're in tip top shape, I want to see you back here in a few weeks.  My secretary will call to set up an appointment soon, okay?\" she said.  \"Sure thing,\" Lisa answered as she stood up and she and Jonny headed for the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That went well,\" Lisa commented as the two of them walked to the car.  \"Yeah,\" Jonny responded as genuinely as he could.  A thousand thoughts swirled within him.  What did it mean that the baby's heart was beating too fast?  What did it mean that its internal organs seemed to be something the machine had never seen before?  Did the machine screw up?  Would Lisa be okay?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Jonny arrived at the car.  Jonny paused and looked back at the hospital.  \"What's wrong?\" Lisa asked.  \"Just thinking,\" Jonny replied, staring off for a bit.  He then drew breath and turned to Lisa.  \"You head on home . . . I've got to go take care of something.  I'll be back not long after you are,\" he said.  \"Promise?\" Lisa asked.  \"Sure,\" Jonny said.  \"I'm going to call someone about yoga lessons during the pregnancy, okay?\" Lisa said.  Jonny nodded.  Lisa got into the car and drove off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood for a couple minutes and contemplated the slow, predictable hum of the hospital, all the doctors and nurses and paramedics scurrying about within it--a life so ordered.  The Old Man would probably not like that Jonny had gotten Lisa knocked up, and he'd probably hear about it soon.  Perhaps a little mayhem would feed the Old Man and act as something of a peace offering if he came to see Jonny.  The demon walked back toward the hospital and stepped through the double doors.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny entered the hospital again as the air conditioner blew down intensely upon him and the smell of rubbing alcohol and disinfectants of all kinds assaulted his nostrils.  Jonny beheld the squeaky-clean innards of the hospital--white tile floors, off-white walls, a reception desk staffed by two plump octogenarians with pleasant smiles, and a gift shop filled with get well cards and trinkets for one's bedside table, and all of that was just right in the door.  \"The one good thing about being a demon is that any time one of my bodies expires I can just find another . . . better than being stuck in a place like this,\" Jonny thought to himself.  Jonny walked in the direction of the reception desk and glanced about, not sure where he wanted to go.  A plaque on the wall revealed the locations of certain major locations in the hospital.  The maternity ward was the top floor, and next down was the psych ward.  There was also a trauma unit, and a few other places.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we help ya sonny?\" came a question from one of the elderly receptionists.  Jonny looked toward the old man with a smile.  He was probably well into his eighties, and he plopped an overweight body comfortably upon a cushioned chair as he looked up through thick glasses.  He wore a hat that read, in big gold letters, \"Korean War:  1950-53.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure what I'm looking for,\" Jonny began as he looked around to try to get his bearings.  Then, he saw something that caught his eyes, or rather someone.  The woman Jonny saw was one Alice Bowers--a 53-year-old janitor who strolled through the halls of the hospital with the confidence of a general atop a striding horse.  Janitorial work was perhaps not the most prestigious work, but Alice worked very hard at it and had been doing so for thirty-five years.  She knew every nook and cranny of this hospital, could fix anything, and was rarely surprised by even the most unusual  patients; indeed, she'd seen it all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was not a particularly womanly woman, nor was she refined or a classic beauty of any sort.  In fact, she stood at only about five feet four inches tall and was approximately 250 pounds.  She had somewhat dull brown hair and pale skin with blotches of rosy red in a couple places.  Her frame was rather rotund; her boobs stuck out before her and jiggled as she stepped, as did a big belly and a set of big, meaty thighs.  This woman's entire body was, today at least, contained in a blue one-piece suit, such as the one a mechanic might wear.  The suit was stained with a couple splotches of grease, and a small patch near the woman's right boob announced her name--\"Alice B.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found what I need . . . thanks,\" Jonny said as he looked at the old man at the reception desk and set of in the direction of the plump waitress as she waddled toward parts unknown.  Jonny walked quietly in the direction of his target, dodging a few other people in the hall as he traversed the shiny tile.  Alice then turned to the right and opened a door, stepping into another room.  Jonny walked up to the same door and beheld a plaque.  \"Maintenance Closet\" it said.  Jonny slowly opened the door and poked his head in.  What he saw was a messy, cluttered room with dingy floors and ugly green tile walls.  The room was actually somewhat large, and it extended a fair distance back from the door.  The place was filled with a mess of tools, as wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and the like littered the work benches along both of the side walls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple greasy pieces of machinery sat upon the messy concrete ground off to the side of the workbenches and right next to the walls.  Perhaps they were pieces of a malfunctioning boiler or air compressor or something like that.  Jonny stepped gingerly into the room as the plump, grease-covered Alice tinkered with something at the other end of the tool room.  As Jonny stepped in, he inadvertently kicked a small box of bolts which Alice had left sitting on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small clang of falling metal disturbed the silence of the small room.  Suddenly, Alice spun around and looked in the direction of the noise.  Her eyes quickly fell upon Jonny, and a look of suspicion crossed her face.  \"Who are you?\" she demanded, \"You're not supposed to be in the janitor's closet,\" she declared as she spun the rest of the way around and face Jonny squarely, though from a distance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yeah, yeah that's true, and I am sorry about that,\" Jonny said.  Alice's expression softened a little bit.  \"Fair play, I'm not supposed to be in the janitor's closet,\" Jonny conceded, \"but, you know what?  Truth be told, I'm really far more concerned about being inside the actual janitor,\" Jonny said as a strange smile crossed his face.  Alice's face took on a look of confusion, and she tilted her head a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Jonny began bounding across the cluttered room and over the tools and spare parts that littered the floor.  As he approached the overweight janitor, Jonny jumped toward her and propelled himself through the air toward the woman as her eyes widened with fear.  As Jonny sailed through the air, his vessel began to dissolve into the swirling mass of black smoke and mist that was his natural form.  The wispy mass began to force its way inside the terrified body of the fat woman.  Alice Bowers flew against the brick wall as she full intensity of the invading essence hit her.  Her plump, awkward body began to shake and writhe and jiggle about as the darkness of the demon enveloped her.  She gagged and choked and tried to scream, but to no avail.  Her boobs and belly bounced around as she sank limply down the wall and plopped her pudgy ass on to the concrete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, all the jerking and jiggling stopped.  Alice's body sat in a bit of a heap on the dirty floor of the janitor's closet, the janitor herself forever changed.  Her head hung limply downward as her mouth hung open and her eyes were closed.  Suddenly, her eyes shot open, and a strange smile crossed her face.  Alice began to look around the cluttered, long room.  Jonny, now in control of Alice's body, grunted a bit as he got to all fours and prepared to get up.  His new body's breasts dangled down in front of her, and Jonny made sure to not said dangling with some pleasure before he moved to stand again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jonny stood, he could tell this body was different.  The weight distribution was different.  It was one thing to possess a woman who was not built like a toothpick, but this woman was just fat.  Her belly shook--her whole body did, really, as Jonny straightened up.  Jonny moved his pudgy hands around his rotund body, feeling his new belly, boobs, and eventually a face complete with a double chin and a homely appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I\"m allowed in the janitor's closet now,\" he said with a smile in a voice that was foreign to him.  He began to slowly walk toward the door of the little room, feeling the unusual jiggles of his new meat suit.  He reached for a door handle and pulled the door open, stepping again out into the sterile whiteness of the hospital, with a new body and nefarious plans.     </span></div></div>",

There was a workout room on the first floor that was used by some of the residents. Inside, Leah was working out. She always would do her morning workout routine before she left for the station at 8. When Jonny's mist entered, she was running on the treadmill. Jonny just watched as his ex host continued run. He could watch her all day. But, he needed to be her today. Leah soon hit the stop button and walked over to grab her water bottle.  She soon glanced into the mirror and said \"Time to rock it today girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny, still enjoying the show, chuckled to himself as he rematerialized behind her. \"Time for us to rock it today Leah\" as he put his hand on her shoulder. Before Leah even realized what had occurred, Jonny had already taken full control by entering through her nostrils. It didn't take long at all since she was already under Jonny's power. \"Leah\" then cracked her neck and stretched her shoulders. \"Tight fitting clothes are the best feeling clothes\" Jonny commented in his feminine voice feeling his new weight on his chest restrained by a lime green sports bra. He then glanced down and felt his strong, muscular, defined legs covered by yoga pants. \"It feels good to be back.\" After a a long squeeze of his firm butt, Jonny decided he might have a go out a workout. He soon walked over to the bench press, hips swaying, and laid down. As a human, Jonny had been somewhat fit and benched many times before. However, bench pressing with a bubble butt what a new experience. \"Leah\" grunted and shifted trying to get in position that her host was accustumed to. \"And I thought sitting was hard. This is thing Is going to take some getting used to.\" Jonny glanced down and saw two large bounds protruding from his chest. He smiled and said \"at least when they say bar to chest, I don't have to go very far. Jonny soon lifted the bar they had an excess of 400 pounds on it with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his workout, \"Leah\" then turned into mist and reappeared in her room. Jonny quickly disrobed his fit body and stood in front of the mirror. He cupped his chest twice and stepped into the shower. After 10 minutes, Jonny then redressed himself in his crisp new police uniform. \"Leah\" needed to see Selina. </span></div></div>",

He blew himself a kiss and grinned before disappearing in a puff of black smoke. Not even a second later, the apparent Leah appeared in an alleyway only a block away from the police station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck! How you do that!\" A homeless man exclaimed. He was holding a half drank bottle of whiskey in his dirty hand and pointing at the possessed police officer as if she were the devil himself. If only he knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Leah's eyes glowed bright red as she grinned seductively. The man's eyes did the same as his body relaxed. The bottle of whiskey fell onto the ground, shattering into several small pieces as the whiskey split out onto the ground. \"You really shouldn't drink so much. It's bad for your brain cells\" she said ,looking into the man's mind and seeing his whole miserable life. He was addicted to so many drugs that even he didn't know all of their names. He scared away his family and now had nothing to live for except drinking alcohol and watching the pretty girls pass him by on the street. \"You are a sad, sad excuse for a man\" the demonically possessed Leah continued, matter-of-factly. \"So I think I'm going to change that\" she said, still grinning as she wiped away all of the memories from his pathetic mind, leaving him as a blank slate, Leah's fingers snapped as the man's clothing burned away in black flames, leaving him as naked as when he was born a long, long time ago. His mind was as empty as that time too, if not emptier. \"You don't even remember this now, but you loved watching those pretty girls so much, I think I'll make you one. This way you can give more to the world, you filthy fool\" she said, snapping her fingers again as the naked middle aged man shifted before her eyes into a naked young woman, around the age of 17. She was Asian and long silky black hair fell from her head, reaching almost her ass. She snapped her fingers again as a short black skirt and white tube top appeared on the girl's shapely body. \"Your name is Sakura Yagami. You're new to this country and don't know anyone. All you care about is getting a good fucking and being paid handsomely to do it. You're an expert of the sexual arts and the language barrier does little to stop you from seducing men...and even women. You're on your way to get a job as a waitress for the Warehouse at my request. Understand, Sakura?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, light came to the young woman's eyes and she flashed a smile bowing politely. \"Yes! Tank You Miss Reah!\" she exclaimed, clearly having problems pronouncing her Ls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah chuckled a little.  \"Great. Then get out of this alley and get that job! I expect you to make the warehouse a lit of money!\" she said, patting the Asian's ass as she walked away, heading to her new life. Leah's smiled as the watched her new creations ass swaying with every step she took. \"I think I'm getting better at this each time I do it\" she said with a grin as she walked the block into the police station. She went to the front desk and talked to the man who always sat there, with a board look on his face. \"Hey Frank!\" she exclaimed, happily, like how Leah always greeted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a huge smile came to the man's face. \"Hey Leah\" he said, trying not to look at Jonny's stolen rack. The real Leah was too modest to flaunt her beauty, but Jonny didn't care. He arched his back, pretending to crack his back while also giving Frank a better view of his cleavage. \"What...what can I do for you today?\" he asked, his face getting read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny flashed Leah's best smile. \"Wellllllllll, I REALLY need to see Chief McCarthy. Can you make that happen, big boy?\" he asked, making sure to sound very....persuasive with his stolen voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...no problem...Leah...\" the obviously aroused Frank said, pulling out a phone and muttering something. He waited a few seconds before hanging up and looking back at the supposed Leah. \"She...she'll see you now\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Frank! You're my hero!\" Leah's body exclaimed happily, giving him a kiss on the cheek before continuing on her way as the scarlet faced Frank watched her walk into towards Selina's office. Once she got there she knocked on the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Selina said from inside her office. A grin appeared on Leah's face as she walked inside the office, closing the door behind her. She was about to say something when she noticed Selina's eyes.....they were glowing purple. \"Welcome to my office, Leah...or should I say Jonny? It's time for us to have a chat\" Selina said, with Lena Mesmera's voice coming out of her mouth. </span></div></div>",

As much as Jonny hated it, his only option was to run away. He concentrated on leaving Leah's body. Instead of his smoke form leaving the young policewoman's body, her body shook violently. Jonny couldn't make himself leave and his stolen body was now in pain from trying. Jonny tried again, but was only met with more pain. He tried to teleport away but it had the same result as his attempts to leave. The next thing he knew, Jonny was on the floor and his stolen body was sweating from the effort that he was exerting. He slowly stood up, feeling light headed. Selina's possessed body kept smiling, as if she were watching a cartoon on TV. Her eyes continued their purple glow. \"Are you done trying to run away, Jonny?\" she asked, Lena's voice leaving Selina's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny breathed deeply and looked at the door behind her. The possessed Selina snapped her finger and the door locked. Jonny sighed. he closed his eyes and tried to contact the Old Man, but it felt like there was some kind of a wall preventing communication. \"Okay\" he said in Lena's voice, deciding that the only thing to do was to go with this. \"What do you want, Lena?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Selina's face turned into an malicious grin. \"I'm glad that you're so willing to hear my out, Jonny\" she said politely, as if she hadn't forced the demon into this. \"I'd like to enlist you to work for me. You're a powerful demon and the Old Man has you on a leash. I can cut that leash. In exchange for serving me and fighting against the Old Man, I will give you more power than even you can imagine. Imagine combining that demonic energy of yours with magical knowledge. You would be unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny bit his lip. The power was tempting, but right now he didn't have a lot of reasons to trust this...being. He didn't know who she was or why she was fighting against the Old Man, but he knew that this would not end well. Right now, he just wanted to be back with Lisa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that gives me an idea\" Lena said with a grin, knowing what Jonny had been thinking. She placed her hand on Jonny's stolen body and grinned. Jonny winced in pain as Leah's form shifted and altered, becoming an exact copy of Lisa. \"You took this poor woman and warped her mind. You made her give up her entire life in order to be your loving slave. As a result, she has done everything that you have ever asked of her unquestioningly. You have grown used to being the one in charge of a slave. Let's see how you like the table being turned\" Lena said, placing Selina's hand on top of the Lisa duplicate's head. </span></div></div>",

It shook and jiggled while Jonny tried to maintain some semblance of composure, but it was no use.  Jonny fell to the ground in a heap, his body's wondrous boobs jiggling mightily as he did.  He tried to keep some sense of what was going on around him, but Jonny's vision quickly blurred, and he fell to his side and began flopping about like a fish out of water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed up at the blur that was Lena as his mental molecules were torn about and scrambled.  \"You'll soon use that body to serve me,\" Lena promised.  Suddenly, Jonny saw a second figure, a blur really, out of the corner of his eye.  It poofed into existence in a cloud of black smoke, not unlike the one that followed Jonny when he went some place.  Jonny squinted and tried to see through the searing pain that ripped apart his mind.  It was the Old Man!  Jonny squinted through the pain as he saw the figure of the old man run at a furious pace toward Lena, currently controlling the body of the beautiful Selina.  The Old Man's form dissipated into a cloud of swirling smoke just in time to force its way inside the curvy cougar.  Selina's body jerked and spasmed, and she grunted and gargled and even screamed.  Her tits bounced around, and she fell to her knees, her eyes seemed to turn a pitch black, only to then immediately turn a glowing shade of purple, then to black, and then to purple again.  It was as if the Old Man were having trouble maintaining control of Selina's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\" Selina yelled, the Old Man's voice escaping her lips, \"I can't keep control of the body for long!\" Jonny had almost no strength left.  His vision blurred, and his host body could move only very slightly.  He closed his eyes as sleep began to take him.  Suddenly, a vision appeared in his mind.  It was Lisa!  The curvy figure of the buxom red-head approached him out of the darkness.  She smiled down at him as he lay on the ground.  \"Come home to me,\" she said.  And with that, Jonny blacked out.         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny's eyes fluttered open as he came back to the world.  Brightness filled his vision as he adjusted to new surroundings.  He quickly put his hand to his head as he took in a splitting headache as though his mind had been the bug to Lena's proverbial windshield.  Jonny felt curly hair in his hand and pulled some into his field of view--red still.  He must still be in the Lisa body that Lena had crafted for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny's eyes wandered downward, and he beheld a wondrous pair of breasts encased in a dress of tight, form-fitting black leather that shoved his boobs right up under his chin.  \"Lena's got good taste,\" Jonny declared as he took in his buxom, his beautiful cougar body.  Despite his admiration for his curves, Jonny felt as though he had been hit by a train.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you were up,\" came a woman's voice from Jonny's side.  His head jerked to the side, and he beheld Lisa as she smiled at him.  Jonny lay sprawled upon a bed, and Lisa had bent down to her knees to put herself near Jonny's eye level.  Jonny smiled back weakly.  \"If there's one thing that can get me up, it's you,\" he said slyly, the sexy innuendo lost on no one.  \"I must say you look familiar,\" Lisa commented as she stared at her own double, \"care to explain that?\"  Jonny paused.  \"Well,\" he began, \"I had to sneak into a bar, the sort of place Jack's body wouldn't do me any good, so I had an idea.  I decided I had to shift into the most jaw-droppingly sexy woman I could imagine,\" he said, and before he could say more, Lisa broke out in laughter.  \"Even when you can barely move, you can't stop flirting, can you?\" she asked.  Jonny smiled back.  \"Never,\" he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny adjusted his head a bit and looked upon what seemed to be unusual attire.  Lisa had her knees on the floor and was bent down to be about eye level with Jonny as he lay on the bed.  \"Are . . . are you wearing a bathing suit?\" he asked.  Lisa smiled a bit.  She appeared to be about ready to say something, a voice was heard from the door.  \"Glad I made it in time, Jonny,\" it said.  Jonny looked to see the Old Man himself standing in the door.  The Old Man smiled down at his creation.  \"I just barely managed that,\" Jonny said with a weak smile in response.  Jonny paused for a moment.  \"What happened to Leah?\" he asked, quickly remembering the woman he had possessed before Lena molded his body into a copy of Lisa's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man paused before responding.  \"I pulled you out of her while you were unconscious . . . her rather wonderful body is very tired and resting at home.  She'll awaken in time, not sure what she's been doing of late.  I'd advise you to keep her body close at hand.  It may be useful again,\" the Old Man said.  \"Duly noted,\" Jonny said.  The Old Man came into the room, stepping more into the light and setting himself gingerly upon a chair opposite the bed.  It was a sort of casual move that Jonny had not expected of the Old Man.  \"Jonny,\" he started, \"that was a near miss today,\" the Old Man declared, \"and to make sure it doesn't happen again, I'm going to be taking a bigger role in this fight from now on.  I don't think you have the strength to beat Lena alone, at least not without some help first,\" he said.  Jonny was surprised.  The Old Man had always been a sort of absentee boss.  He usually didn't take a big role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, all right,\" Jonny said, a bit taken aback, \"what are you going to do?\"  The Old Man paused for a moment.  \"First, I'm going to find a body.  The rest, I'll get to later,\" he said, as he disappeared in a puff of black smoke.  Jonny lay there for a minute as he contemplated how the Old Man's greater involvement was going to change things.  He glanced over at Lisa, conscious of the fact that he was still in a copy of her body.  Lisa smiled back at him.  \"I'm not sure what this is going to mean,\" Jonny said.  \"Me neither,\" Lisa said, \"but there are certainly going to be some changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two passed a couple minutes in quiet contemplation of the situation.  Then, Lisa spoke.  \"You asked about my bathing suit?\" she reminded Jonny.  Jonny nodded.  \"I didn't have any other clothes that fit really well,\" Lisa said as she scooted back from the bed and stood.  As she did, Jonny beheld a body that was undeniably sexy and beautiful, but also chanced.  Lisa's curvy form remained.  Her sexy legs and thighs, her big bouncing boobs, her wonderful, round ass.  Her belly, though, was different--bigger.  It looked as though Lisa were carrying a beach ball around inside her belly. She seemed to be about six months pregnant.  She smiled as she turned to the side to show off her rather large baby bump.  Lisa caressed her sexy belly as she smiled at Jonny.  \"I woke up this morning like this.  Are you excited, Daddy?\"    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny walked back into the house, the little gears turning wildly in his head.  Selina would pick him up the following day, take him to the event, and there mayhem would ensue.  Jonny had to think long and hard about whether to allow Lisa to come; this could get dangerous.  If his plan worked, it was not entirely clear that his Jack body would survive that night.  He walked confidently back into Lisa\u2019s house and found her in the kitchen cutting up some tomatoes on the big island in the kitchen\u2019s center.  She smiled widely when she saw Jonny again.  \u201cWould you like one, Master?\u201d she said as she sliced the produce on a cutting board.  \u201cNo thanks.  You made really good pancakes this morning,\u201d he said, \u201cand last night was amazing.\u201d  Lisa just beamed.  Soon the sound of cutting slowed, and Lisa set the knife to rest on the cutting board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, may we talk please?\u201d she said as she looked earnestly at him.  \u201cWe can,\u201d Jonny answered.  Lisa walked up to Jonny, who stood pleasantly awaiting whatever it was she had to say.  \u201cUm, before Selina came you and I\u2014we\u2014we were talking about something in the other room and, uh,\u201d she stumbled verbally, looking down as if nervous or unsure about her words, \u201cso I would like very much to, to, to finish what we were talking about in there because I think this is very important to me and I hope to you and, well, I know you\u2019re busy, Master, but I would be very very happy if you would maybe listen to me while I tell you some things that I\u2019ve been thinking and feeling and be patient while I ramble because I probably will but these things matter a lot so now, or maybe later if now is no good, maybe you could find some time in your schedule to listen to me while I tell you a couple things that I think are important to, um, me,\u201d Lisa finished that whopper of a speech, so nervous that she looked up at Jonny for just the last 3 or 4 words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood for a moment.  \u201cUh, sure, now . . . now\u2019s good,\u201d he said.  \u201cOh good, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very very good,\u201d Lisa said with a wide smile, relief apparent in her voice.  She seemed giddy like a school girl.  She stepped closer to Jonny and took both his hands in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she started, taking a very deep breath, \u201cI have these certain kind of feelings, well, um for . . . for you, and you see I think you\u2019re just about the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met.  You see, last night was really very special for me, and I would like to do that sort of thing with you a bunch more times if that\u2019s all right, but I think I really really deeply care about you because the sex last night was bested only by the fact that I got to wake up next to you this morning and make you pancakes in bed,\u201d she said with a huge smile across her face and her cheeks blushing, \u201cand I loved making you pancakes and I loved how happy you and I seem to be when we\u2019re together even if it\u2019s \u2018cause you need to compel a police officer to steal evidence from a drug trial.  And, when you kissed me on the lips this morning there were these, um, these things in my stomach, the little things with wings . . . butterflies?  Yes, I think that\u2019s it, butterflies in my stomach when you kissed me, and I like butterflies very much, I really do, and I would like to feel the butterflies with you more often, so I thought that, um, maybe . . . you know, if, maybe you like spending time with me too, there\u2019s this new restaurant that just opened, and it\u2019s on the roof of this beautiful building down by the beach, and it\u2019s called \u2018Cielo,\u2019 which I think means \u2018sky\u2019 \u2018cause it\u2019s a skyscraper where the restaurant is, and thought that, if you like food and I like food that maybe you would like to take me there tonight after I get off work because that\u2019s usually when I eat, but we could go there any time you might like to I think it\u2019s open a bunch of different times and I want to try it, but the important thing is that I want you there when I do, but I would really really be very happy if you would be willing to go on a date with me,\u201d she said, seemingly all in one breath, and looked up at the waiting Jonny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, wow,\u201d Jonny said, not sure he could possibly have possessed someone with big enough lungs to get all that out at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at him with baited breath, like a woman waiting for the last few lotto numbers to be announced.  \u201cI want to go out on a date with you, and I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re younger than me; you can rip the soul clean out of anybody who dares to say anything about the age difference.  You can even posses any body you want to for the night; I don\u2019t care whose it is though we should probably keep your Jack body around for your plan to work, but I want you and I to see if this thing that the two of us are could become . . . something important,\u201d she said, nearing tears at the cathartic release of all that emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot for Jonny to take in.  He could take in entire human souls, but that was nothing compared to this.  He took a deep breath.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny thought long and hard over this proposal that Lisa was giving him. He truly did not know what he wanted right now. On one hand, Lisa was very beautiful, incredibly smart, and had already proven her devotion and loyalty to Jonny, which in all fairness deserved to be repaid in some way. However, on the other hand there were several factors that would prevent something like this from working. For one thing, there was a gigantic age difference between the two. Not only was Lisa old enough to be the mother of Jonny's body, but Jonny was almost a century older than Lisa was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that Jonny was a demon and Lisa was just a human. Jonny had a feeling that the Old Man didn't exactly have it in mind for Jonny to get into a romantic relationship with a human who's soul he hadn't eaten. The Old Man may see Lisa as a distraction that had to be removed, and Jonny did not want any harm to come to her, not only because he needed her but because he had come to care about her in some way. Jonny briefly toyed with the idea of making Lisa herself into a demon, but then tossed that idea aside. He had already created one other demon and that was already creating some issues. If Jonny made another, then there would be some overcrowding in the area. As great as chaos was, it had to be a controlled chaos, and having three demons in one town would certainly not be very controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was also the fact that this may not even be the real Lisa feeling these feelings. After all, when Jonny first met Lisa at the Warehouse, she wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. He had fiddled with her mind to make her this way and the feelings she was having were more than likely an unplanned result of that mental tampering. Still, Jonny had given her enough free will to have her own autonomy, which meant that this was probably at least partly her actual feelings and her actual decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, was that Jonny had not been in any kind of relationship with a woman since he was ripped away from his human life and turned into a demon. He still felt some residual connection to his former wife, even though she almost definitely remarried after he had been missing. At that time, she was pregnant with Jonny's child, which meant he had a grandchild running around somewhere out there in the world. However, Jonny had no connection to that child besides for his bloodline, which meant nothing as a demon. His former life was long gone, and Jonny saw no harm in living for the moment. Like the thought before, Lisa did deserve a reward for all her hard work. And maybe it would be enjoyable to lighten up before his plans went into affect tomorrow night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just smiled at Lisa, who was waiting patiently for her answer. \"Lisa....you are a truly incredible woman, and I am lucky to have you at my side during this busy time for me. It would be my honor to go on that date with you. ...but you're right. I certainly cannot go like this\" he said, before closing his eyes and concentrating. Jack's body, grew and aged gaining muscle as it transformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked over the changed form in shock. \"Master...? Is that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled. \"Based on what I remember from my old life, this is the real me\" the man said, now being much closer in age to Lisa. \"If we're going to give this a try, I want you to see the real me. Or atleat, what the real me used to be. Now go get dressed and take me out to dinner. You're buying\" he said as Lisa smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"right away, Master!\" she happily exclaimed before leaving the room. </span></div></div>",

He got into Lisa's car with a smile on his face.  \"Fell better, Master?\" she asked.  \"I do,\" he said as he felt the pure energy rushing through his veins and thoughts of conquest rushing through his mind.  He pondered for a few minutes as he sat there in the car.  \"Something wrong, Master?\" Lisa asked with a worried look on her face.  \"There is,\" he said, \" . . . not enough fun in my life,\" he said, and Lisa smiled, relieved.  \"I mean, what's the point in having demonic powers if you don't use them to fuck around occasionally?\" he asked as he leaned back in the seat of the car.  \"Lisa,\" he said, \"take me to the Genie's Bottle,\" he commanded, and she turned on the car and set off in the proper direction as instructed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny knew from his host's memories that the Genie's Bottle was a wondrous place filled with hookers of all kinds.  It was called the Genie's Bottle because it was the sort of place men went to make all their wishes come true--and go they did.  There were all sorts of theme rooms and costumes for the ladies of the place to wear as they entertained and comforted patrons, and just about every fetish could be indulged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place, Master? Will you accomplish much of your plan at this place?\" Lisa asked, obviously being unfamiliar with the building's purpose.  \"Oh I plan to accomplish plenty.  You wait in the car,\" Jonny said as he exited the Suburban and headed for the door of the Genie's Bottle.  He strolled in through a display of shiny beads that one walked through immediately upon entering the door.  As he looked around, much of the room was dark, but there were pictures of beautiful, sexily-dressed women all over the walls.  They had various costumes--personals they inhabited to turn men on.  Some were nurses.  Some were cops.  Some were housewives, and the list could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a bit young to be in here to me kid,\" said a voice from the counter in front of Jonny.  As he turned his gaze to the speaker, he beheld a woman of about 30.  This woman had blonde hair cascading down from her head.  She sat behind large desk, as a receptionist would.  \"Looks can be deceiving.  Wouldn't you agree--Courtney?\" Jonny asked as he glanced at the woman's name tag, pinned, as it was, upon a blouse that struggled to hold in a very impressive set of tits that she clearly liked to put on display.  A lacy black bra could be seen under the thin blouse as it too tried to win the fight for control of this woman's unruly chest.  \"Sure,\" the woman said, \"but I know an underage kid looking for a good time when I see one, and I know that federal agents have a habit of following close behind, so why don't you come back when you ain't jail-bait for all of us?\" Courtney said as she dawned a sexy smile and scooted up until her boobs were just a few inches from Jonny's host's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just smiled back.  \"Oh my dearest Courtney,\" he said with a pleasant smile as he suddenly lunched forward and placed both his hands on the woman's cheeks, and his eyes began to glow red.  Hers followed.  \"Courtney,\" Jonny said, \"I'm going to get some ass today before the police chief shows up at my house, and I'm going to get said ass from this fine establishment.  You are going to wake up from this encounter and immediately realize how tired you are, and you will fall asleep right here in your chair and not awaken until I have done what I have come here to do.  Got it?\" Jonny said.  \"Yes, Master,\" she said groggily.  Jonny released the young woman, and both sets of eyes returned to their normal colors.  The woman sat there for a minute and shook her head a couple times, as if to dust off the intellectual cob webs that Jonny had installed.  She took one look at Jonny and seemed to realize again that he should not be there.  Courtney moved to get up from her seat, but then she immediately fell back into it, and the chair rolled backward as the woman's head slumped back and hung awkwardly over the side of the chair.  Her boobs rose and fell with a pleasant and predictable rhythm as she slept, the only noise the sound of a small fan she had perched on the desk near her.  \"That's a good girl,\" Jonny said approvingly as he tuned his attention to a long hallway to his right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jonny stopped at the first one.  The door bore a picture of 2 items--a ruler and what looked like an apple.  Jonny grabbed the door knob and stepped into the room, not entirely sure what he expected to find.  What confronted him inside the room was a classroom.  The room was fairly large, and the walls were adorned with a map of the United States, a map of Europe, a poster-board size version of the US Constitution, as well as seemingly obligatory pictures of JFK and the second Roosevelt.  Several student desks were set in rows upon the tile floor, and there was a blackboard at the head of the room.  What Jonny presumed was supposed to be the teacher's desk was large, wooden, and sturdy.  On the desk there sat a couple pencil holders and some sheets of paper with writing scrawled across them.  The back wall of the room contained a second door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked about for a minute, unsure what was going on.  Suddenly, the door at the back opened.  Into the room stepped a woman that must have been every middle school young man's dream personified.  The woman appeared to be about 28 years old.  She had jet black hair running straight down her back.  She was clothes (marginally) in a suit with a jacket with 2 buttons in front, both of which were fastened.  The jacket was waging a war with the bouncing, jiggling masses perched beautifully upon this woman's chest, seeming to surge forth and jiggle some more very time she stepped.  Under this black jacket was a white blouse--very thin--with the top few buttons left undone to show off a blessed bounty of boobage.  Her milky white skin had upon it beads of sweat, and a black lacy bra took her breasts and essentially shoved them right up under her chin.  Farther down was a very toned belly that peaked out from under the jacket, and the blouse was tied up in front of her instead of being tucked in.  The skirt fit very tightly around a set of toned but meaty thighs, and her turn to the side revealed a lovely and full ass.  High heels gave her a nice sexy walk, as a devious smile crept its way across her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Molly Mounds,\" she declared, \"Let's start with an anatomy lesson, little boy,\" the young woman said as she strutted sexily toward Jonny, reaching around behind him and grabbing by the ass, pulling him to her, and pulling him into a passionate kiss.  Jonny reached his own hands and felt the wondrous ass of his companion, giving it a beautiful squeeze.  As the woman kissed and groped Jonny's body, Jonny's eyes glowed red just the tiniest bit as his powers kicked in.  Jonny felt his mind fill with details of the life of the woman who had forced herself upon him. Pictures of her childhood--her first kiss, her family, her turn to a life as a prostitute, filled his mind.  She broke the kiss, Jonny stepped back.  The sexy look stayed upon Molly's face as she advanced toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jonny got an idea.  He wanted to play a bit.  His eyes glowed red momentarily, and then his young body began to shift.  Jonny's young teenage body began to grow.  His height increased by probably five inches, though he wasn't tall to begin with.  The hair on his head lengthened into a free-flowing mass of long black hair.  What little muscle tone there was on his body disappeared.  His thin, pale belly bubbled and writhed about as his belly plumped up.  A couple layers of extra fat were added, straining against the confines of his small, buttoned-up shirt.    Two beautiful, bouncing hills of flesh surged forth from his chest.  The same general process repeated itself below--his thin white legs beefed up, and some wonderful bounce made its way into his ass.  His hips widened into a lovely pair of womanly hips fit for bearing children.  His hands became small and delicate as his fingernails lengthened a bit.  His face aged--probably to the point of being about 40 years old and fairly pretty.  Where there once stood Jonny, there was now a curvy, middle-aged woman--a real soccer-mom type.  Jonny's clothes were the last to change.  His ordinary small men's shirt was replaced with a black dress with straps that went up over the woman's shoulders.  The front of the dress ended just a few inches below the woman's chin, and the bottom of the dress ended just below the knees.  Conservative, flat shoes adorned the new woman's feet, and a golden necklace appeared around her neck with a cross hanging at the end.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly Mounds's jaw dropped open, her face a mix of amazement and horror.  It was her mother!  \"Allison Marie Grimes!\" Jonny screamed, using Molly Mounds's real, given name, \"what have I told you about dressing so provocatively?!  The good Lord gave you that body to bear children, not to sell yourself to the highest bidder and sully His creation!  You should be ashamed of yourself, young lady!\" Jonny yelled.  Allison's mother had been a very religious woman--authoritatively so.  She dressed properly and conservatively, forcing her young daughter to do so as well.  Every infraction in this life was said to carry divine retribution in the next.  Every Sunday was spent at church in all manner of functions.  Every meal began with a prayer.  This regimen was one Allison soon found herself unable to follow, so she had run away from her domineering mother 15 years earlier and not seen her since--until now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M--Mom!\" the frightened woman stammered as she tried to cover her bulging chest without much success.  \"Wha--how--what's happening to me!?\" she demanded, thinking she was going crazy.  \"The Lord has led me to you,\" Jonny said, \"and he sews your punishment now,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison sunk back frantically as tears streamed down her face.  How could this be happening?  Jonny just smiled internally as his prey squirmed.  It was nice being at full strength again.  \"Allison, my dear Allison,\" he said.  The crying woman looked up and wiped a mess of tears from her eyes.  The demon who looked like Allison's mother stepped slowly toward the cowering young woman.  \"You're so . . . . boring!\" Jonny screamed as he bent down to her.  Allison tilted her head, looking sad, scared and confused.  \"What do you mean--boring?\" she sobbed.  Jonny's eyes glowed red again as he laid his hand firmly upon Allison's belly.  \"Allison, you're no fun,\" he said, \"I think I'd rather talk to Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Allison's eyes glowed red, and her body shook and shuttered a bit as Jonny's desire took effect.  Allison's innocent, scared personality was immediately overcome by the hooker-teacher alter-ego that she herself had created--Molly Mounds took over.  \"What's the matter . . . haven't had a good fuck.  You just need to show off your tits a little bit more honey,\" she said as she reached up and grabbed Jonny's boob, sending a shot of pleasure through his middle-aged female body.  \"There's my girl,\" Jonny said with a smile as he saw the Molly personality dominate inside Allison's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stepped back and concentrated as his body shifted again.  Within seconds, he had returned to his ordinary male form and had advanced upon the sexy Molly Mounds, who lay upon the floor.  He put his hands on her cheeks as his eyes reddened again, and so did hers.  \"You're going to be my plaything, Molly, and you're going to love it,\" he declared.  As his powers subsided, Jonny looked happily upon his new creation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple seconds later, Jonny and his new slave exited the room and began to walk farther down the hallway as Jonny sought his next conquest.                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few doors down, Jonny came upon another room.  This one was marked simply but effectively by a red cross, as on medical equipment, that adorned the door.  Molly stayed close to him, watching her new master with great attention.  \"Ooohhhh,\" she said, excited, \"you suppose that's a doctor's office?  I want to get more familiar with the master's body; can I come?\" she asked.  Jonny chuckled.  \"I think only two people per room is the idea, but you'll get plenty of time to do whatever you want with my body,\" he said.  Molly smiled widely.  \"Wait here,\" Jonny said as he opened the door.  He stepped into a dimly lit room that had the look of a doctor's office.  The place was fairly small with a couple of chairs off in a corner, a scale in another corner, and a small sink above which was a medicine cabinet by the far wall.  The counter surrounding the sink was adorned with various things--cotton balls, rubbing alcohol, and a plastic but secured container for used needles.  \"Ain't seen a place like this since I was alive and had just one body of my very own,\" Jonny chuckled as he walked in and sat down at the foot of another prominent feature--a bed-like platform that inclined slightly with a leather cushion atop it.  This was little more than an uncomfortable slab in the room, but, if patients had to lie down, this would work in a pinch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jonny sat down on it, the door at the opposite end of the room opened.  Into the room stepped a woman who was a vision of beauty unto herself.  This woman appeared to be about 32 years old.  She was of Asian descent, with long black hair running down her back.  Her eyes were big and green, and smooth, beautiful skin with a slight yellow hue covered her whole body.  She strutted into the room and beheld Jonny with a look befitting a tigress who had just found her prey.  This woman had a toned, sexy body indicating strenuous exercise on a daily basis, but her chest was a thing of wonder--two wonderful, fleshy mounds bulged out of her chest and jiggled beautifully as she walked.  Her wide hips swayed from side to side with each step, leaving Jonny to imagine the beautiful ass that must have been attached to the back of the vision of a woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name Nurse Emily Chen,\" the woman declared with an awkward smile, speaking English in a way that suggested she was a bit new at it, \"Show me where pain make hurt,\" she said with a sexy smile as she shoved her wonderful boobs, which seemed to be trying to crawl out of a very tight-fitting, sexy nurse's uniform, into Jonny's face.  Jonny smiled pleasantly back at her as he wrapped her arms around the woman's body and pulled her close.  The shoved him roughly and quickly back down on to the bed-like thing he had sat down on, and she climbed atop him and sat down, her ass perched wonderfully upon the thin, small body of a very happy demon.  She leaned in close to him.  \"Nurse Chen make all better,\" she said as she began to kiss him passionately while her hands made their way down to his stiffening member.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny did as he had done before--used the time getting down and dirty with the Asian nurse to peer into her mind.  He saw her memories, her dreams, her deepest desires like visions that passed by outside a bus window but yet were seared into Jonny's brain.  He smiled deviously as he found a memory he thought he could exploit.  \"What wrong?\" said the nurse as she, \"big boy ready to make fuck now?\" she asked.  Jonny just smiled back, as he had something a bit different in mind.  His eyes glowed red for a brief moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Chen's jaw dropped at the visual.  She sat perched atop Jonny's body as the changes began.  First, Jonny's body lengthened.  He went from being probably five feet five inches tall to nearly six feet.  First his legs stretched out, and then his torso.  His clothes were yet to change, so the alterations in his body simply stretched them out, to the point of ripping his shirt to shreds and nearly bursting his pants apart.  Second, Jonny felt his body age.  He started at about 18 and aged to 25, and then to 30, 35, 42, and eventually 49 years old.  Part of the aging process was that Jonny's hair line receded, leaving a bald patch on top with only a few wisps of hair sticking out and an unshaven face with a couple missing teeth.  Patches of grey appeared in his ragged beard.  Jonny smiled a sort of toothless, red-neck grin as he felt the changes continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to the side as a tattoo of a patriotic-looking bald eagle appeared on his arm with the letters <br>\r\n\"USA\" scrawled beneath the majestic creature.  The changes seemed to slow for a second. Nurse Chen still straddled the changing and shifting body of the lecherous, ambitious demon.  Her jaw hung open, and her pulse began to quicken.  Her breathing sped up as she began to panic, yet she seemed frozen in place, unable to leap away from this--this, thing.  Jonny heard a loud growl in his stomach as other parts of his body began to writhe about and shift.  \"Big finish honey,\" he said to the hooker, his voice a raspy, aged mix of whiskey and cigarettes.          Jonny looked to the side as suddenly his arms began to swell up with blubber.  Jonny smiled lecherously as the writhing and swirling about within his changing body continued downward.  A warmth enveloped his mid-section as his belly fattened up, a hefty beer-gut forming on his formerly flat stomach.  His thighs too inflated farther down.  As a final measure, Jonny's now-shreaded shirt and pants were replaced briefly with swirling black smoke.  When the smoke disappeared, Jonny wore a white shirt from which the sleeves had been torn, revealing blubbery, hairy arms.  His business-casual kakis were replaced with beat-up blue jeans coming apart at the seems as the struggled to contain his new gut and fattened legs.  Big, heavy work boots appeared on his feet, partially covered with mud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny lay upon the gurney for a few seconds.  The supposed nurse huddled over in the corner and cried.  She had seen enough of the transformation to be both amazed and frightened, reduced to a sobbing shut-in in the corner.  Jonny slowly sat up, weighed down a  bit by his new blubber-filed middle.  He stood from the cushioned slab on which he had been lying.  \"Long time, no see girl,\" he said with a strange smile to Nurse Emily Chen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who stood before the sobbing nurse was Hank Malone--an ugly, sickly slob of a landlord who had known the nurse years before.  Nurse Emily Chen, Jonny knew from his powers, was really Darla Sucio--the daughter of Chinese immigrants who had put her up for adoption, whereby she was scooped up by a white-trash American family on the hunt for a tax deduction in the rather middling, unsophisticated environment in Western New Jersey.  The young Darla grew up looking different from the people she thought of as her parents and her friends at school.  Her parents paid little attention to her, and she was the butt of jokes at school.  Her curvy body and impressive chest, with which puberty blessed her, came to be her way out when they showed up in the middle of high school.  She had fled home to the city in which she now found herself and, ten years before, she had found a small slum of an apartment that Hank owned. The lecherous Hank provided her with lodgings in return for sex, but he became increasingly controlling, domineering, and demanding.  Darla soon left and soon found her salvation--ironically in hooking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank just go away please please please don't hurt me!\" she begged, looking up at Jonny's new body for only a couple seconds at a time, but now speaking perfect English, albeit with a Jersey accent.  Jonny lumbered over and bent down, laying his hairy, pudgy hand on her shoulder.  \"You're cute, girl,\" he said, \"but let's hear from Nurse Chen,\" Jonny commanded.  The woman's eyes glowed red for a few seconds, and she shook her head as if dispensing with a haze.  \"You want fuck now sexy boy?\" she said, her Asian accent now back, \"Let nurse make better,\" she said with a cute, erotic smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny smiled.  \"Come with me,\" he said as he turned to walk out out of the room with his new acquisition.  As he approached the door, Jonny shifted back into his Jack body as the nurse followed close behind.  Eager to get more women, he stepped back into the hallway where he and Nurse Chen joined the ever-so-sexy Molly Mounds in search of the next room.          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny strolled into the hallway, a growing cadre of big-breased women jiggling about delightfully behind him as he strolled through the plethora of choices and fantasies he could indulge.  The women snuck about as if they feared being caught by unseen forces, but they could barely hold it together as they tiptoed about and took turns poking each other's breasts.  Occasionally a moan would escape the lips of one of them.  Jonny just smiled.  \"My girls . . . \" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny then saw something interesting on the wall next to one of the nearby doors.  It appeared to be a simple outline of a home.  The house was simple enough and had an idyllic white picket fence outside.  The home had a window, and through the window Jonny saw the face of a smiling woman as if she were looking out from the house with joy in her eyes.  \"Interesting . . . \" Jonny mused as he examined the depiction.  \"You girls wait here,\" he said to the two just behind him, \"another will join you soon I think,\" he said as the two women already behind him nodded giddily at the prospect of the expansion of their ranks.  Jonny reached down and grabbed the door knob and turned it, stepping into a world where dreams came true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny entered and closed the door behind him and looked about a bit.  The place appeared to be a living room--one with a TV as its focal point and a table with some magazines on it.  Right behind the table was a large, fluffy couch with some pillows positioned upon it, and on each side of the couch was a large love seat, equally well-appointed.  Jonny stepped in a bit more.  Farther in was a kitchen area which was behind and yet sort of merged with the living area.  It had an island in its middle and also a stove and an oven.  White cupboards held presumably all manner of plates, pots, and pans, and a refrigerator seemed to preside over the whole kitchen.  Another doorway on the opposite end of the kitchen led to another area--one Jonny could not see.  In all, the scene before Jonny looked like a kitchen and living area for a fairly normal upper-middle class home.  It was fancy, but not pretentious.  \"This is a new one,\" Jonny said as he walked about and took a look around to see if he was alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry I didn't hear you come in,\" came a woman's voice.  Jonny spun around to see the direction from which it had come.  The image that confronted him was one of immense beauty without being trashy or overly sexualized.  The holder of this voice was a woman who appeared to be about forty years old.  Long dark hair cascaded down from her head and ran a chunk of the way down her back.  The woman had a pleasant smile as she walked into the room.  This middle-aged woman appeared to have a full and voluptuous body, with a wee bit of extra blubber filling out her every wonderful curve.  The woman's breasts jutted out beautifully from her chest and jiggled slightly with her every step.  Jonny watched lustfully as her breasts seemed to struggle to burst from the confines of her tight-fitting top as she walked; her clothes seemed to barely keep her boobs at bay.  Farther down, the tiniest bit of extra skin was visible as a small pouch in her lower belly--a concession to age, but a cute characteristic nonetheless.  Her upper body sat fittingly on a set of wide, child-bearing hips that swayed side to side as the woman walked.  Her thighs shook just a little bit as she walked.  \"I'm Beverley,\" the woman said, \"are you a friend of one of my daughters?\" she said as she turned around, giving Jonny a partial view of her lovely, curvaceous ass.  This woman was not dressed like a hooker--somewhat strangely.  Instead, she wore a button-down blue dress shirt that hung open in the front.  The shirt came down to just above this woman's ass, which is what gave Jonny the lovely view when she so kindly turned around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder this sexily but tastefully unbuttoned dress shirt was a black one-piece swimsuit.  It fit tightly upon the woman's curvy, full body and struggled to hold in her chest.  \"Lauren said some people would be coming over,\" Beverley said, \"forgive the clothes . . . I'm doing a bit of baking just before I jump in the pool for a bit,\" the sexy woman said as she tended to something in the oven.  She looked into the thing and smiled broadly.  She then turned around and grabbed an oven mitt out of a cupboard and opened the oven.  Reaching in with the mitt, she then pulled out a metal tray filled with what seemed to be cookies.  She smiled as she inhaled the aroma of fresh-baked cookies deeply.  Her breasts rose mightily as her lungs filled with air.  She looked over at Jonny with a smile.  \"I love to bake,\" she said as she set the pan on the counter.  She then grabbed one of the still-warm cookies and placed it in her mouth, chewing it up.  \"I really shouldn't do this,\" she said, \"they go right to my hips.\"  Jonny thought the woman's hips were pretty sexy, cookies or not.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you one of Lauren's friends?\" Beverley asked as she began to come closer to Jonny.  Jonny was a bit surprised by all this.  \"Um, yeah . . . yeah Lauren's a friend of mine,\" Jonny said, unsure of himself as he sat gingerly down on the couch.  Beverly approached him, sitting down next to him and setting her hand firmly upon Jonny's leg.  She looked over at him and smiled.  Jonny smiled back pensively.  \"Lauren's been going through a tough time since her father left . . . she needs a strong man in her life,\" Beverley said, \"every woman does,\" she declared as she looked right into Jonny's eyes.  Jonny swallowed hard, feeling suddenly a bit nervous. Maybe it was some engrained feature of his Jack body that no amount of magic could excise.  \"So what were you planning to study for . . . think it was anatomy right?\" Beverley asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny decided to play along.  \"Yeah, we have that final coming up next week,\" he answered.  \"Well,\" Beverly began, \"anatomy is a subject I've got some familiar with,\" she declared as she leaned in close to Jonny's ear and whispered sexily to him.  Beverly then got up briefly, just long enough to reposition herself to the point of resting her gorgeous, curvy form upon Jonny's lap and facing him.  Straddling Jonny's waist, she got a few short inches from his face, and the wonderful mounds hanging from her chest bounced and jiggled at just about Jonny's eye level.  \"For example,\" she began as she reached down and grabbed Jonny's hands sternly, \"these are called tits, and I must say most men are quite taken with mine,\" Beverley declared as she placed Jonny's hands on the gorgeous mounds dangling from her chest.  Jonny smiled widely as he squeezed tightly, and a moan of pleasure escaped Beverley's lips as she arched her back in pleasure.  Jonny then moved his hands around behind Beverley, running his fingers through her long dark hair and then down to her lower back.  Jonny took a firm hold on Beverley's curvy ass, and she moaned again.  \"That would be my ass, you sexy little boy.  My daughter should have told me about you,\" she said with a sexy smile.  Suddenly, Jonny pulled Beverley forward, and he rested his chin on her wondrous chest as she pulled her into a passionate kiss that seemed to last forever.  Jonny and Beverley closed their eyes and let the waves of pleasure wash over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jonny opened his eyes, they glowed a bright, fiery red, and so did Beverley's.  Grabbing the sexy mother by the ass, Jonny began to lay out the rules.  \"I've got a busy day planned, so here's the deal:  whatever your past life was, whoever you were, whoever you fucked when you weren't fucking customers, whoever ran up to your gorgeous ass screaming 'Mommy!  Mommy!,' you are now Beverley,\" Jonny said, \"and you will join me in my quest to control this city.  You will do what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it, and you'll consider me your master.  Your life without me was empty and pointless, but I have given that sexy ass of yours a reason to be.  Got it?\" Jonny said.  The entranced Beverley sat there with a blank stare on her face as her eyes blazed with the fire of Jonny's powers.  \"Master . . . \" she said with a small nod.  \"Good,\" Jonny said as he released his new acquisition, and both parties' eyes returned to their normal color.  Beverley shook her head a bit, as if shaking off a daze.  She looked at her new master and smiled.  \"Time to go meet your sisters,\" Jonny said as the two got up.  Beverley followed Jonny giddily as he walked to the door and threw it open, where Molly and Emily waited eagerly for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stepped out of the room with Beverley in tow and closed the door.  Molly and Emily beheld her with smiles before they immediately began to throw themselves upon her and begin stroking her and poking her wondrous body.  \"You've got tithes too!\" Molly exclaimed, \"all the better to please the Master!\"  \"Girls, this is your new big sister,--Beverley--and I expect you to listen to her,\" Jonny commanded them.  They both nodded vigorously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, the foursome walked out of the building and arrived back at Lisa's car.  \"Master?\" Lisa asked, surprised at the women following him.  \"New converts!\" Jonny answered quickly as they all piled into the car, \"Back to the house, Lisa!\" Jonny commanded as Molly Mounds jiggled her gorgeous ass into Lisa's front seat.  Emily Chin and Jonny sat in the back, with Beverley perched beautifully on Jonny's lap.  He used his hands to caress her beautiful form, and occasionally a moan of pleasure would escape her lips as he cupped her boobs.  Lisa cast a weary eye into the rear view mirror as the now-expanded caravan rolled toward Lisa's home to await Selina's arrival.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a couple minutes, he decided he knew how he wanted to attempt this new endeavor.  He walked in to the kitchen where there was a pot of coffee on.  Lisa and Selina looked to him as he came in.  \u201cHow about you ladies go enjoy yourselves, and I\u2019ll bring the coffee in when it gets hot enough.\u201d  Lisa smiled pleasantly at this, \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice young man,\u201d she sat as she rubbed Jonny\u2019s shoulder affectionately.  \u201cThanks a bunch, Jonny,\u201d Selina said as she and Lisa tuned and headed into the living room.  Jonny waited patiently there in the kitchen for the coffee to come to the right temperature.  The minutes ticked by as Lisa and Selina made small talk in the living room.  Jonny would occasionally peak his head around the corner to make sure all was well.  After a few minutes, the coffee was properly heated, and Jonny removed the coffee pot from the machine, pouring two cops, as was fitting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then bent down and held his hand over one of the cups, mumbling a few ancient Latin words and concentrating intently.  After a couple seconds of this, a few wisps of red smoke seeped from his hand and into the cup.  Jonny smiled, taking the unique mixture in his right hand and the other cup in his left.  He emerged from the kitchen with both cups on saucers and made sure to set the special one before Selina and the other before Lisa.  \u201cThanks so much,\u201d Lisa said with a smile as Jonny sat down.  Selina nodded politely as she took her own cup.  She took a big swig of the coffee and then addressed Jonny.  \u201cSo Lisa tells me that she\u2019s a friend of your parents\u2014known them for years.  Are you in college?  A boy your age ought to be in college,\u201d she said, ever the helpful and upright public servant and role model.  \u201cWell, I was,\u201d said Jonny, \u201cbut then that didn\u2019t work out so well.  I guess\u2014guess something got into me,\u201d he said with s slight ironic smile, which Lisa returned.  \u201cSo now I just sit here and take steps to enact my plans for world domination,\u201d he said with a laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I hope you decide to go back and finish your studies . . . boys your age are so impressionable, and you\u2019ve got to have a good work ethic and good role models,\u201d she said as she took another sip of her coffee.  \u201cOh I plan to have a lot of friends in high places pretty soon,\u201d Jonny said knowingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation then turned to business.  \u201cWell,\u201d Lisa began, \u201cso about the Senator\u2019s speech, I think we\u2019ve nailed down a lot of stuff already, and we\u2019re just dotting the I\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s, so let\u2019s run through.  Ah, so we\u2019re doing it at the law firm tomorrow night on the rooftop\u2014or at least that\u2019s where the main festivities will be.  The Senator will speak at 7 PM, and you\u2019ll have men in place at least five hours before?\u201d  Selina shifted in her seat.  \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had some threats, but we are confident that, between my men and the FBI who will be temporarily under my command, we can protect the place like it\u2019s Fort Knox.  You\u2019ll be there I presume?\u201d  \u201cI will,\u201d Lisa said, \u201cthe partners insist.\u201d  \u201cAnd you\u2019ve checked with the caterers already?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Selina began, \u201cand the Mayor insists that I be on point to glad-hand everybody, to shake hands and kiss babies instead of just doing my normal security thing, which she says my men have to handle.  She\u2019ll probably be shoving so many brownies and dinner rolls down my gullet that I\u2019ll need to spend the next week running twice as long just to work off the added belly fat,\u201d she said with an annoyed smile.  She took another swig of coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina sat at the table, but her face began to slacken.  Her eyes started to droop just a little bit.  She quickly shook her head as if to shake of a haze.  \u201cSo yeah we\u2019re not here to talk about my weight regimen,\u201d she said, \u201cum, so um, yes, the\u2014the\u2014yeah the Senator,\u201d she said as she struggled to focus.  Jonny knew it was working.  \u201cSo the Senator should, um, he should, I\u2014I think she\u2014he\u2014yeah he should ar\u2014arri\u2014he should get there at like, like I think 6,\u201d she mumbled as she held up two fingers.  Jonny laughed.  \u201cOh we\u2019re really cooking now,\u201d Jonny said with a laugh as the officer became more disoriented.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina leaned to the side all of the sudden, like she was drunk or something.  \u201cWhas happen ta mm\u2014me?\u201d she slurred, \u201cS\u2014somethin \u2018swrong,\u201d she said as a look of clear panic came over her eyes.  \u201cI would stay sitting, officer, really,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cWh\u2014why dyou wan me ta sit down?\u201d she mumbled.  \u201cWell I quite like your body,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cand I\u2019m about to take it over, and I do quite fear that, if you stand, you will immediately fall upon the beautiful, luscious ass of yours and damage it,\u201d Jonny laughed.  Selina immediately stood but was obviously struggling to do so.  \u201cWhat doya mean take ma body\u2014ya cannot have my ass\u2014er\u2014er ma body either, \u2018cause it smybody!\u201d she shouted just as she fell to the ground in a heap with a loud thump.  Her full and gorgeous chest jiggled with every impact, and she fell face-down to the floor, meaning that her wonderful and full ass was safely sticking up in the air for Jonny to stare at, which he did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did hope she would stay sitting,\u201d Jonny said as he shook his head, \u201cturn her over.\u201d  Lisa bent down and grunted and struggled as she rolled the unconscious officer over to her back, thus putting her boobs on display now.  Jonny was happy with either view.  \u201cWhat are you going to do, Master?\u201d Lisa asked.  Jonny stood.  He took a deep breath, sucking air into his thin, pale body.  He rubbed his hands together as though preparing for something.  \u201cWell,\u201d he started, \u201cI have the ability to send copies of myself into other people, but I must say I\u2019ve never done it.  I think it will be quite arduous, and it should require enough concentration that I don\u2019t want the body I want to copy myself into to be moving about . . . that might get messy, hence the wee sleeping spell I put on our dear lady friend here,\u201d he explained.  \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, Master,\u201d Lisa said.  \u201cI know,\u201d Jonny answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paced about and unbuttoned his shirt, slowly removing it.  He walked bare-chested over to where Selina lay on the ground unconscious.  \u201cStand back,\u201d he ordered Lisa, and she did.  He knelt down on the floor and put his hand firmly on Selina\u2019s belly, and he concentrated.  He focused and focused and focused again.  The minutes ticked by.  Quiet fell upon the room.  Ten minutes.  Then fifteen.  Then twenty.  Jonny began to sweat.  Inside his stolen body, he tried to stay focused as the perspiration poured off him even though the house was cool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hand still on Lisa\u2019s belly and his concentration at its peak, Jonny suddenly began to shake and convulse.  His thin, pale body seized about, his muscles tensing up and writhing and shaking, just like the bodies of other did when Jonny possessed them.  Suddenly, all of that stopped, and Jonny sat still.  He bent over above Selina\u2019s open mouth, and he coughed.  Out of Jonny\u2019s own body came a tiny wisp of red-grey smoke that quickly forced its way into Selina.  Her body received the substance with a quick jolt, jerking once or twice and then becoming still again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was weak, and tired.  \u201cSo that\u2019s how that works,\u201d Jonny said as Lisa ran over to him and helped him up.  \u201cMaster, you\u2019re weak!  What\u2019s wrong?  Did Selina hurt you?!  I can kill her while she sleeps if you wan\u2014\u201c  Jonny cut her off.  \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never done the cloning thing before.  Apparently it works by moving some tiny piece of me into someone else.  Splitting your own essence in two is messy business.  Now help me to the bedroom.\u201d  Lisa did as instructed, propping Jonny up on her shoulder and walking him gingerly to her bed.  He shuffled in, obviously drained, and lay upon the bed, sweating and tired and shaking.  \u201cShe\u2019ll wake soon, and she\u2019ll be ours,\u201d Jonny declared as sleep took him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or two ticked by.  \u201cMaster?\u201d came Lisa\u2019s voice, seemingly from a distance.  \u201cMaster?\u201d she said, louder now.  Jonny\u2019s eyes fluttered open in the darkness.  Lisa sat on the bed in front of him.  \u201cSelina is awake,\u201d she declared, \u201cand she is . . . strange.\u201d  Jonny was groggy.  \u201cBring her in,\u201d he commanded.  Lisa disappeared from the room.  A couple minutes later, Jonny heard the two returning to the room slowly.  The shadows of the two of them were visible on the floor, and one of them seemed very uncertain in her steps\u2014she had to be helped by the other.  \u201cStop playing with those!\u201d came Lisa\u2019s stern voice, \u201cnow you\u2019re about to meet the Master, so behave yourself.\u201d  Jonny heard a slight giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women then appeared in the doorway.  Lisa had taken Selina by the hand and was walking her into the room slowly.  Selina took baby steps, and Lisa then flipped on the lights.  Jonny beheld his new ally.  Salina\u2019s shirt was mostly unbuttoned, and her breasts were barely contained within her bra.  She had a look of wide-eyed amazement on her face, but she tried to straighten up and act right as soon as she saw Jonny.  \u201cHow does she handle?\u201d Jonny asked, using the same sort of language with which one would ask about a car.  Selina answered, \u201cShe . . . she shakes, wobbles\u2014jiggles a fair bit.  These will take some getting used to,\u201d she said as she motioned toward the mounds on her chest but then quickly had to grab for Lisa again to avoid falling over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked annoyed.  \u201cIt\u2019s ok, Lisa,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cthe clone\u2019s only been in her body for a few minutes, so there\u2019s going to be a learning curve . . . a bit like a baby figuring out how to walk.  If I\u2019d never been a woman, boobs would fascinate the hell out of me . . . actually I\u2019ve been several, and they still fascinate me,\u201d he said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelina,\u201d Jonny said.  \u201cYes?\u201d she replied.  \u201cWhat can you tell me about the security for the Senator\u2019s speech tomorrow?\u201d  Selina paused.  \u201cWell, I think this body thinks she has everything planned out well . . . there has been an increase in threats recently, however.  A Russian mobster named Chilinkov plans to order a hit on the Senator tomorrow, but she believes the cops are ready for the assassin to strike.  Selina wants to stop the assassin publically so that the police get the credit and a big budget increase next year,\u201d the possessed chief declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed.  \u201cWell we can\u2019t have that, now can we?\u201d he said.  He thought for a minute.  \u201cI want you to leave a hole in security so that the assassin gets in.  I want mayhem, and I\u2019m counting on your to deliver.  I\u2019ll be there watching.  Got it?\u201d  Selina nodded.  \u201cLisa, our new friend here can barely walk around in that body; she\u2019s in no shape to drive.  Take her car and drive her back to the station, and then take a cab back here.\u201d  \u201cYes, Master,\u201d Lisa said as she escorted the officer from the room.  Jonny lay in bed.         <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny laid in bed, thinking about his plans for a few minutes, when he suddenly felt a familiar chill. He sat up in the bed and looked around the room, immediatly noticing the new figure standing in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling rather tired, are you?\" The Old Man asked, stepping out from the shadows he had appeared in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny nodded. \"Who knew splitting my essence in two would be so taxing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man Chuckled. \"Your former companion Cal, had figured that out as well. He has now done it enough that there is no pain whatsoever but that pain only increased until he got to that point. His demonic essence is split beyond repair. He has so many clones that he can barely keep them under his control. Not like that's important though. 20 Cals is perfect for chaos\" he said with a little chuckle again. \"However, you are far more important to my plans than he is. So I would suggest that you leave this as your only clone. You need your powers at their maximum potential\" the Old Man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny once again nodded. \"I get that...trust me, I have no intention of putting myself through that again, but I felt that this was important enough. The human I put it into will be my most powerful asset in spreading the chaos that you want. My instincts are telling me that much\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Old Man nodded in response. \"Yes, Selina McCarthy will do quite well for you. She is a powerful woman who will give you unprecedented access to this city and it will make your job much easier. However, I must advise you to keep your clone on a short leash. It will not develop any of your special abilities and will always have a bond of trust and loyalty with you as its originator, but it will also develop its own identity. It may have your memories, but it is not you. Consider it like a son to you, or a daughter. It is a child based off of you, but will soon mature and find its own self. Make sure you are there to guide it as it does. If you treat this situation correctly, your clone WILL be your greatest asset. Greater than Katie and greater than Lisa. It will know you and your desires better than anyone else ever can. It will be your best friend, perfect lover, a superb partner in crime. Do not screw this opportunity up, Jonny\" he said before disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed and laid back down in bed. The Old Man just told him that he essentially now had a child to take care of. A child that had his mind and personality and the body of a 44 year old sexy woman. A small smile formed on Jonny's face. This would make things incredibly interesting for him moving forward. This clone would certainly be a lot more fun to have around than another soulless or controlled slave. Not that Lisa had done anything wrong, but as the Old Man said, no one would know him better than himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just looked up at the ceiling as he contemplated what the future would hold for him. His situation really was incredible. He was a century year old demon possessing the body of an 18 year old college kid who had not one, but two incredibly beautiful women ready to carry out his every whim unquestioningly. Lisa was completely under Jonny's mental manipulations, making her his willing servant for as long as he saw fit. She was incredibly smart, and Jonny already saw that Lisa had a lot of potential. Not just in the bedroom, too. There was a chemistry between them that part of Jonny was tempted to explore further and he knew that Lisa would be more than okay with that, should he decide to pursue it. Who knows, maybe she'd make his life easier and be the one to make the first move?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, the sexy meatsuit that formerly belonged to Selina was now occupied by a clone of Jonny that he ripped out from his own demonic essence. She now knows everything that Jonny knows and knows exactly what to do for Jonny's benefit. Not only that, but Jonny knew that there was a powerful connection between them. He could feel, very deep down, everything that she was feeling since they were at least partially connected. Jonny also wanted to explore that relationship more. If they were similar enough to remain connected, but became different enough to be individuals what kind of relationship could that develop into? Would they be best friends? Siblings? Father-daughter? Lovers? This all remained to be seen. At least for the moment, his clone was too similar to him for anything like that to happen. Still....this got Jonny thinking. What exactly had he made by splitting his essence into Selina? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clone-possessed Selina stood in front of the mirror, simply staring at her nude reflection in what could best be described as awe. The bathroom was located in the back corner of Selina's office and was a private stall just for the chief's personal use so it was guaranteed to be a nice, quiet place for the clone of Jonny to really get to know his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour ago, the apparent police chief had returned to the station, and walked rather clumsily to her office, saying some awkward hellos to her officers as she struggled to make her way into her office and lock the door behind her, ignoring the worried looks that her staff was giving her and explaining her behavior away by telling them that she was feeling a bit under the weather, but would be fine after having some time alone to rest up while she worked on planning the gala. She remembered how the old Selina had often worked while she was sick, feeling that someone of her responsibility didn't have the right to call in sick and used that precedent to her advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safely in her office, the new and improved Selina took her time, unbuttoning her shirt to allow her chest to breathe. She grinned as she groped her lovely assets and giggled with a schoolgirl like glee which sounded a bit out of place coming from such a grown and mature woman. She put on her computer and tried to actually get some work done for a little, but just couldn't concentrate on it. She was too disoriented. \"Screw it...\" she said with a sigh as she stood up from her computer and stretched out, cracking her back. \"Might as well just get used to this body now and save the time later\" she said with a sly grin as she slowly peeled her clothes off, leaving them scattered on her office floor as she entered her private bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now, after taking the time she needed to personally get to know her gorgeous body, that the clone of Jonny was finally able to feel natural in his flesh. \"I guess a little exploration was all I needed for comfort, wasn't it?\" he asked his reflection in Selina's sultry voice as he gave his breasts a squeeze and grinned at the face looking back at him in the mirror. Things certainly felt less awkward for him in this body now, but it was still a bit awkward. While the clone had all of Jonny's memories, he knew that he wasn't Jonny and had none of his originator's abilities. He couldn't even leave the body he was in since he wasn't even a demon like Jonny was. On top of that, he also had all of the memories of Selina McCarthy and remembered every detail of her life as if he was the one living it. Though any demon could read the memories of their host bodies in a similar fashion, something told the clone that they couldn't do it in even close to the same detail that he was able to do it. It was as if he was both Jonny and Selina while being neither of them at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" the clone asked, placing Selina's hand on the mirror in front of her and seeing her reflection do the same. She frowned, not being able to give herself a proper answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jonny Macks....\" she said to herself with a frown. That name didn't feel right to herself. Calling herself that felt like a slap in the face to the original Jonny. Besides, she was far too much like Selina to go by that name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Selina McCarthy?\" she asked, trying again. That sounded much more natural coming from her full lips, but why wouldn't it? That was the name her body was being called for over three decades. She smiled at her reflection, knowing that she was already used to her body as if she had been living those years herself. It just took some time for her to get used to riding this bicycle of a body without the training wheels on. \"I guess I'm Selina after all\" she said with a reassured smile as she stuck a sexy pose with her body. \"I'd better get used to thinking of myself that way too\" she said, feeling up her body one last time before closing her eyes and regaining her composure. She may have used that sick excuse, but time was starting to pass and her officers would be getting worried if their chief didn't start giving them instructions soon. Of course, she'd have to cover herself up first....what was she thinking getting undressed like that during her work day? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, the now much more confident Selina McCarthy, exited her bathroom and began redressing herself in her uniform. </span></div></div>",

Of course, she wouldn't actually find that replacement for the evening. When the time of the gala came, there would be one less cop guarding the mayor, leading to the whole in security that Jonny was looking for. Chaos would reign and the police would lose out on their budget increase. Selina briefly thought about how her old self would never have even considered something like this and laughed about that. The old Selina was dead, and had been dead since Jonny put the new one into her shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jonny-clone that was now inhabiting Selina's sexy body had completely overridden the soul of the old Selina. There was only one being inside of her body, and that was Jonny's clone. Just as Selina was hanging up her phone, a puff of black smoke appeared in front of her desk. Suddenly, Jonny was standing right in front of her. \"Hey there!\" Selina exclaimed, with a smile appearing on her face. \"I was just thinking about you\" She said, extending her hand, which Jonny took in his, a similar smile on his young face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What about?\" He asked, sitting down in the chair across from Selina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't thinking about you per-se. I was thinking about me....which means I was thinking about you\" she said with a smile. \"I think the old Selina is gone forever. I can't feel her soul in my body anymore. I suspect that I've completely erased and rewritten her soul into me. I feel completely at home in my body now, able to maneuver through all of my memories and personality as if I've been living this life forever. Of course, I still have your memories too, but they've seemed to fade into the background a little. I know that I'm your clone and I feel connected to you, but Selina is my primary identity. I think of myself as her, but trust me when I say that I'm much more fun than I used to be\" she says with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled. \"That's good to know, Selina\" he said, liking that his clone was so accepting of her new life. Calling her Jonny also would have gotten very confusing and annoying very fast. \"So, how's security looking for the gala?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit more lacking than it was a few hours ago. I've taken away one of the best cops that I had initially assigned, and that should provide enough of an advantage to the mob so that they can get through and do what they have to do. By the way, I was doing some digging and I found some very interesting information for you\" she added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell\" Jonny said, putting his feet up on the desk and resting his hands behind his head, making himself comfortable. Normally someone coming into Selina's office and acting with this much authority would get Selina annoyed, and still did, but she could tolerate it from Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have an inside man in the mob who reported back to me before my last phone call. The Russian is going to be sending a team of assassins to get the job done. They're lead by a ruthless killer-for-hire known on the streets as the Angel of Death. She's known for being the best there is at killing, stealing, and any other sort of crime. She's been able to get away unharmed and unseen from every crime her name has been linked to. We know nothing about her besides her nickname. If you were to take over her meatsuit, you can use her impeccable skills to create an untold amount of chaos, and also have access to ALL of the underworld in the city. That way, I'll be here controlling the law, and you can be there, controlling the underworld. We'd make a great team, wouldn't we? Even if you don'w want to possess her, you can make her one of your slaves. She'd be an enormous asset.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked at the floor, pondering this potential change of plans. </span></div></div>",

Find me somebody who should be at the gala, somebody who would be expected to be there.  The thing is tomorrow at 6.

Selina smiled.  \"How could I not?\" she said as she reached up and grabbed the mounds protruding from her chest.  With that, Jonny disappeared in a puff of smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stood in the office for a moment and pondered the assignment she'd just been given.  She had to find the master a body.  She glanced at the clock and saw that it was nearly midnight--the master would have gone home to bed now.  She had to find somebody he would like . . . this assignment was a preliminary one, the prefatory one before the big day tomorrow evening, but she couldn't fuck it up, or the master would never trust her or give her anything big again.  One never gets a second chance to make a first impression, after all.  She walked to the door of her stately office and opened it. \"Martinez!  Get your ass in here!\" she yelled out into the busy hustle and bustle of the station, a chaotic hum that continued despite the late hour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes, a face appeared at Selina's door, the face of a man of about 30 and clean-shaven, dripping with sweat but eager to please his curvy boss.  \"Yes Chief?\" he said.  \"Martinez,\" Selina began, \"I'm about to head out for the night--gotta be in tip top shape for the thing tomorrow, but I need to talk with some people.  Get me a copy of the guest list for tomorrow, will you?\"  Martinez nodded dutifully and jetted off to places unknown to procure a copy of the list.  Selina marigold at the respect her voluptuous, middle-aged body commanded.  \"The master is a fine judge of meat suits,\" she marveled.  Within a couple minutes, Martinez returned with a piece of paper in his hand, which he gave to Selina.  \"Will there be anything else, Chief?\" he asked.  \"No, just make sure you're well-rested for the thing tomorrow.  I'm headed out,\" Selina said as she stepped through the door.  She made her way through the station and out to the car, which she drove home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Selina walked up the stairs to her apartment, she felt the persistent jiggle of her chest with every step.  She quite liked it.  After fumbling with the keys for a minute, she had entered the apartment, finding it to be well-furnished but kind of messy.  \"Justice never sleeps . . . apparently it also rarely cleans,\" Selina said with a chuckle as she found a couple empty pizza boxes and dirty clothes strewn about an apartment that was large and open with walls of exposed brick and hardwood floors.  Selina made good money--not as much as Lisa, but plenty.  That said, she was so devoted to her work, though, that she only sometimes found time to clean, and she didn't make it a priority.  That was likely to continue despite the fact that Selina's body was now under new management.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina tossed her keys on the counter and slowly unbuttoned her tight-fitting top, tossing it aside where it landed on the back of a chair in the dining area.  Selina's boobs jiggled a bit more as the lacy black bra struggled to contain them.  She kept her pants on, and they continued to accentuate her meaty thighs and curvy ass.  She ambled into her bedroom where she plopped her curvy form upon the bed, where there was an open Mac laptop.  Lying on her belly, Selina pulled the list out of her pocket and woke the computer up.  \"Let's see what Martinez got for me,\" she said as her eyes scanned the list.  The names of the city's elite filled the list and Selina's mind.  Glancing over the paper, Selina saw some names she recognized and others she did not.  Either way, research never hurt, hence the computer at the ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo names jumped out as Selina scanned the names of heavy-hitters in the city.  The first was that of Amy Wilkins.  This young woman was 18 years old and known in the city's social circles for 2 things--the size of her bank account and the size of her chest, each one being the result of somebody else's generosity.  See, Amy was not the brightest bulb in the proverbial box.  She had been in trouble in school but managed to stay in, one assumed, because the men in the school's administration enjoyed having a body like that strutting through the halls.  Her blonde hair, blue eyes, and beautiful smile purchased her just enough favor with the right people.  A toned belly and beautiful ass did not hurt either.  She had hoped to attend college and began stripping to fund her attendance.  She'd been sexily dancing one evening at an upper-class strip club (or gentlemen's club, as was the politically correct term assigned by the well-paid patrons) at the age of 17 when she caught the eye of one Conrad Goldworth, a casino magnate, aged 78 years.  Three months, a boob job, and two parental consent forms later, the two were married, and a trust fund was soon established with young, ditzy Amy as its beneficiary.  Selina scrolled through Amy's Facebook profile and found strewn about it pictures of expensive cars, a palatial house, and gaudy jewelry.  Along with these images were posts with more stupid questions and misspelled words than she cared to count.  \"You've certainly found yourself a dumb bitch, Conrad.  Enjoy her before she forgets to breathe you old fuck,\" Selina said to the young woman's absent rich husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second name that jumped out was Yana Stukovic--a Ukranian-born bombshell.  She had jet black hair and a beautiful face with a smile that would (and did) light up a room.  Yana had been in the US for only about four months, and every sighting of her involved her on the arm of a different rich man several decades her senior.  She herself was only 25.  Her breasts jutted out beautifully from her chest, and her belly was toned due to her constant exercise.  Selina's informants had told her that she was a very high-end escort, hence the revolving cast of older men she had been seen with.  She was probably hoarding money some place to try to get out of her present profession.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina mulled these two over in her mind.  Both of these bodies--these woman--were exactly the sort of people from whom one would expect nothing special.  They would attend tomorrow night's ball as arm candy for rich men who expected them to shut up, look pretty, and bounce their boobs at the proper time.  The master could blend in if he wore one of them; women like them would be all over a ball like this.  The master often went for older women--ones with the class, sophistication, and accomplishment that attended age.  A couple lines around the eyes could be sexy.  Women with a bit of meat on their bones could be sexy.  Still, Selina thought, perhaps the master would applaud her for picking something a bit different this time.              </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina awoke the following morning and bounced her lovely body into the police station, hips swaying and tits jiggling the whole way, for she had found a meat suit to please the master.  She sat down in her chair with a smile on her face as she lay the list upon her desk with a name circled in red--the name of Amy Wilkins.  \"Little MIss Tit Job it is,\" Selina mused as she inhaled mightily.  \"MARTINEZ!\" she yelled, and soon the fresh-faced young officer appeared in her doorway.  \"Yes Chief?\" he said, eager to serve.  \"I've got to speak to one of tonight's guests.  Get me Amy Wilkins's address, will you?\"  Martinez smiled.  \"Wilkins?  The one with the big boo--I mean . . . ah . . . the one with the wealthy husband and admirable philanthropic inclination?\" he said, trying to cover himself.  Selina only laughed.  \"Yeah, that's the one,\" she said.  Martinez disappeared and within a couple minutes returned with a second sheet of paper.  \"Here it is,\" he said as he set it upon his boss's desk, \"we pulled her over recently, and the license had the address,\" he declared proudly.  \"Well-done, nobly sleuth,\" Selina commended him with a chuckle.  \"Need a uniform to go with you chief?\" Martinez offered.  Selina thought about it.  This might get messy, and she didn't have powers like the Master had, so the last thing she wanted was for some mere mortal to see this unfold and blow their cover.  \"No, I think this requires a personal touch,\" Selina declared.  Martinez left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina left her office and headed for the car.  As she rolled through the streets of the bustling city, she made a special effort to hit the pot holes, figuring what was the point in having such wonderful breasts if one did not elicit every possible jiggle and bounce from them.  Who could argue really?  Soon, however, the streets smoothed out, and the houses grew bigger, to the point of becoming, well, mansions really.  Multiple gardeners would tend a single well-kept lawn, and single houses (rather than entire communities) would be gated and complete with their own security guards.  \"Little Miss Tit Job seems to have married well,\" Selina remarked.  She looked down at her own boobs as the bounced slightly with the drive.  \"When are you girls going to buy momma a big house?\" she said with a laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of driving about the playground of the rich and famous, Selina arrived at what she was quite certain was the right address.  She pulled the car down a long driveway and got out, looking up at a palatial house.  Beautiful white stone covered the outside, and statues adorned the well-kept yard, giving a sort of classical mood to the place.  \"Damn,\" Selina said as she beheld the towering structure.  She slowly stepped up to the door and rung the bell.  After a few seconds of eating, she could hear movement on the other side.  One by one, chains came undone, and locks clicked open, and then the door swung aside, revealing a beautiful woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was surprised--the beautiful woman was absolutely not Amy Wilkins.  This woman appeared to be about 35.  She had beautifully tanned skin, probably indicating Mexican ancestry.  She had long black hair cascading down from her head and a pleasant face with a broad smile.  Looking at her, Selina beheld a wondrous pair of breasts and a curvy, voluptuous, and yet also toned body.  This woman had a nice set of wide, child-bearing hips and probably a beautiful ass perched majestically behind her.  \"Hola, si, may help you por favor?\" the woman asked.  Mexican ancestry indeed.  \"Well I think so,\" Selina said pleasantly, \"I'm looking for Amy Wilkins.  Does she live here?\"  \"Oh si . . . yes, ah, Miss Amy in house, please come,\" the woman said as she guided Selina into the majestic home.  Entering the house, Selina looked around.  Shiny white marble covered the floor, and voices and footsteps echoed through the cavernous rooms of the giant house.  \"My name Carmen,\" the woman said kindly, and Selina introduced herself in return.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked into the home, a second woman appeared.  This one was a curvy blonde looking to be about 40.  \"Oh . . . you got door,\" she said, \"I--I go back to water plants,\" she said upon seeing Carmen had things under control.  From the sound of her accent, the second woman was likely German.  Carmen looked at Selina and began to explain.  \"That is Lidya . .  . ah, she other cleaning lady.  Master have many women in the house, many from many different country, different place.\"  Selina nodded, understanding.  Carmen soon walked off, presumably to get Amy.  Selina waited for a few minutes before the click-clack of shoes could be heard again.  Carmen returned, this time with Amy close behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy really was beautiful.  She was 18 and blonde with a toned body, her belly flat as a board with boobs that could give a gay man the boner of a lifetime.  Today, this beautiful package was wrapped up in a tight-fitting outfit that appeared to be spandex, accentuating every beautiful curve.  \"So, like, I'm Amy.  I don't think I know you, but hi,\" she said as she greeted Selina.  Selina's first thought was thank God this woman had boobs worth looking at, 'cause she seemed pretty stupid.  Carmen left them both.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Miss Wilkins,\" Selina began, \"I wanted to talk to you about the gala tonight, and I thought there might be a place where we could talk in private,\" she said.  Amy looked confused.  \"The gal--oh yeah!\" she said, excited, \"the thing!  Yeah I bought myself a new dress for that . . . really shows off the girls,\" she said as she motioned to the mounds on her chest.  \"Well I'm glad the mighty girls will be well-tended,\" Selina said with a chuckle, \"now if we might speak,\" she said.  Amy ushered her into a bedroom, the one she shared with her aged husband.  \"I don't think any of the maids are in here, but there is this kinda short, pudgy one from some place weird . . . could be somewhere,\" Amy said.  \"I'm sure we're alone,\" Selina began.  Amy turned to look at her.  \"Well tonight is promising to be a special evening,\" she started, \"and I wanted to make sure you had everything you need--WHAT IS THAT?!!\" Selina called out as she pointed to another corner of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned.  \"What's wha--\" she began, and suddenly Selina took out a stun gun and shot Amy in her beautiful, round ass with it.  The buzzing of the electricity singed the air as the buxom blonde shook and convulsed before falling to the ground with a thud, not entirely unlike a vessel reacted during the course of a possession.  \"Fell for that one . . . dumb bitch,\" Selina remarked as she put the gun away and beheld the curvy woman passed out cold on the ground.  Selina slowly bent down and grunted and pulled the unconscious Amy to a nearby chair, sweating by the time the job was done.  \"He couldn't have shoved me inside a body-builder,\" Selina remarked, \"it had to be a middle-aged cougar woman with a slowing metabolism and boobs the size of melons,\" she said with a chuckle.  There Amy sat, her body relaxed and unconscious as her head hung limply forward, her eyes closed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina tried to put the excitement aside and concentrate.  If this part didn't work, it was all a waste.  See, a clone has a connection to its maker, and Selina tried to tap into that connection.  She needed to now.  She closed her eyes and slowed her breathing.  She concentrated.  \"Master . . . your vessel is ready,\" she said inside her mind as she reached out to his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there appeared in the room a puff of black smoke.  The adolescent body the Master had inhabited stood in the dark room with the two women.  \"You rang?\" he said.  Selina smiled.  \"I have found your body master,\" she said excitedly, like a young child showing a parent a new work of art.  The master paused and beheld the unconscious body of Amy Wilkins.  He looked back at Selina.  Selina waited with baited breath.  The master took a deep breath.  \"She'll do,\" he declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the master simply walked over to the sleeping woman and began to sit down, as if on her lap.  As he did, his male body began to sink and seep into hers.  Amy's body began to shake, convulse and jiggle about as her soul tried to fight off the invading force, but she was no match for the master.  She shaking of her breasts and the choking and gargling within her throat were but futile attempts to maintain control of a body that was no longer hers--one she did not deserve.  It has always been meant for another, and it was no clear who.  After the struggling stopped, Amy's eyes opened, a faint red glow upon them.  She gingerly stood, like a child standing for the first time.  She inhaled as much as she could, her boobs expanding and being quite put on display as she did.  \"They'll never see me coming,\" declared Amy's puppet of a body, the master's voice coming out.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several hours later, it was time for the gala. Limo's and fancy cars of all sizes and colors were pulling up in front of the finest catering hall in the city for the special event, lead by Senator Bridget Thompson, who would be presenting her plan to rid the city of crime completely within the next several years. Everyone who was anyone in the city was at the gala from celebrities to business owners, to people who were just plain rich and wanted a show. Out of one particularly fancy car, came Lisa, dressed in a form fitting red gown which matched her hair nearly perfectly. Lisa's former law firm had been partnered with the Senator for quite some time, but Lisa had lost her chance at a special invitation when she abruptly retired from the firm, leaving them without one of their best lawyers. Lisa was now here as the plus one of her best friend, the currently clone-possessed Selina McCarthy. Selina was allowed to not have to work for the night and was even given a free pass in as thanks for making sure that all of the security was top notch. The elegantly dressed police chief exited Lisa's fine car wearing a dress that looked like it cost half a year of her salary to afford, which it did. The real Selina may have been content saving up her money for retirement, but her body's new manager was far less conservative on spending, especially since she had all of Lisa's wealth to tap into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled at the apparent Selina, who just returned the smile as the two made their way through the sea of photographers to head into the hall. the two had no problem remaining close friends since Jonny had implanted his clone into Selina's curvaceous meat suit. Though Lisa knew that it wasn't truly her master inside her best friend's body, the clone had enough of Jonny's personality for her to find the new Selina charming and had the same deep feeling of loyalty to her that she ad for Jonny. However, that desire was only a background thought since she had enough of Selina's personality to make Lisa feel as if the two of them were just friends. As for Selina, she had the same trust for Lisa that Jonny had, combined with the knowledge her memories were giving her of the two of them having been friends since they were little girls. Thanks to Jonny's control over Lisa and his clone's possession of Selina, the two woman had actually ended up becoming closer as friends, both living to serve the same demonic master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for a drink, Selina?\" Lisa asked with a smile on her face as she pulled two glasses of a beverage of of a waiter's plate, holding one out for her possessed friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind if I do. A woman like me has to lay back and indulge herself sometimes, doesn't she?\" she asked with a grin, taking it from Lisa's hand and taking a sip, letting the alcoholic liquid go down her throat. Normal demon's couldn't get drunk, but since she was just a clone, Selina would certainly be able to have a good time tonight. She just had to make sure to stay sober enough to be able to help her master if something went wrong. Lisa smiled and took a small sip as well, thinking the same thing. suddenly, the hall exploded in commotion as heads turned towards the front entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look who it is\" Lisa said with a smirk as Conrad Goldworth, 79 years old and round, walked into the room in a white suit and black tie, his thick arm triumphantly around the waste of his perfect little trophy wife, Amy, who seemed to be half drunk already with a ditzy smile on her face. She was looking around with a wide-eyed expression. Her dress was sleeveless and low, showing off her extremely large boobs to the world, while also being just barely long enough to cover her ass. Were she to bend down though, everyone would have a lovely view of the thong she was wearing. Her husband sat down at a table and whispered something into her ear, causing her to giggle and scurry off into a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the apparent 18 year old beauty ran off, Selina did a cat call that was silent enough for only Lisa to hear. \"It looks like our master is really getting into his role\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took another sip from her drink and nodded. \"Oh yes. He's quite good at it\" she said, resting her hand subtly on Selina's ass. \"So are you, by the way\" she said flirtatiously, prompting Selina to gently take her hand and move it off her rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, Lisa. the last thing we want is to draw attention to ourselves\" she said with a look that said there would be plenty of time for fun after all this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, whatever you say 'Master'\" she said, using the term in a joking way since this was not actually Jonny she was talking to. Selina giggled a little and actually blushed from being compared to her originator before turning her attention to the airheaded Amy, who was now strutting back to her old husband, bringing him a drink from the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent Amy Wilkins sat her fine ass on her husband's crotch, grinning as she felt the aged penis hardening from such a small thing. From inside of her body, Jonny hated that he had to act this way. Her body was so young and her personality was so flirtatious and energetic. At first, it was actually pretty enjoyable getting to forget about all his troubles and sink into the ditzy personality of Amy, but now it was rather annoying. She was by no means a smart girl, and Jonny couldn't relate to her in the least. When Goldworth found her last year, she wasn't stripping because she needed to make money, she was doing it because she liked to show off her body to anyone and everyone. This girl was the definition of a bimbo and Jonny did not like having to play the role. Still, she was extremely inconspicuous and that would be very helpful since Jonny had to rely on his observation skills and that would be easier when unsuspected. Amy was the type of girl that would be eyeing up everyone anyway, either looking at men she found attractive, or women that she saw something shiny or pretty on. Jonny on the other hand, was looking for someone who didn't belong. Someone who was not actually a well off guest at this gala, but was in reality a killer assassin that would be making her move shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenator Thompson was in the corner of the room, talking with one of the security guards about her upcoming speech. Jonny watched her smug face and cringed a little, balling his dainty hand into a fist. Did that woman really think that the plan she would announce today would be able to end all of the crime in the city? Jonny couldn't wait for the fool to be killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, dearest?\" Goldworth asked, with a concerned look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed and immediately switched back to dumb blonde mode. \"Like, I'm fine, bae! Just tired!\" he exclaimed and made an exaggerated yawn, stretching his arms out and arching up his back, giving a lovely view of his breasts, which were them groped by Golworth. \"Well don't you worry about a thing, my dear. We'll have a very good night when we're back home\" he said in a suggestive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny wanted to tell him that he could go fuck himself and that there was no chance he'd be staying in this dumb bitch's meatsuit long enough to do anything with him, but instead he just let out a seductive purr. \"Mmmmm, I can't wait\" he said, licking his lips and kissing his apparent husband on the lips deeply, internally hating every second of his act. \"I'll be right back....I need to use the little girl's room!\" he said, taking any excuse to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be back soon dear! The show's about to start!\" he exclaimed as the person he thought was the girl he had taken in last year ran off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the bathroom door closed behind the young lady, a group of five people walked in. Four of them were men, wearing black suits, with black shirts and red ties. the had their hands in their pockets. The fifth individual was an incredibly gorgeous woman of about 29 years old in a white knee length dress, which was cut in a low V at her breasts. She had long black hair with streaks of red coloring in it and was wearing a red cross around her neck. According to her guest pass, her name was Allison Masters and she was the president of a small start up company. Her pass however, was fake, along with the passes of all the men that were with her. These fake passports were provided by Ilya Chilinkov in order to make their assassination run as smooth as possible. No one, including the employer, knew which of the five of them was the Angel of Death, which was just how 'Allison' liked it. She preferred no one knowing anything about her. She was a pure sociopath, raised by mobsters from the age of five, when her parents were killed and she was taken from her home in Russia. She had no sense of love or joy. She was a killing machine that knew multiple languages and could pass for a native speaker of all of them. Right now she was speaking English so well that no one would guess she was a native of Russia. She felt comfortable going by any name. Though she was definitely human, she was the closest they could get to being a demon. the Angel of Death reached into her purse as she approached the senator, who was just turning to go up to the stage that was prepared for her. She quickly and nonchalantly pulled out a silenced pistol and aimed it at the senator as her partners all removed guns from their pockets. Three were aimed at the police officers on duty while the last one held two guns and aimed each at random guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the little girl's room, Amy's heart skipped a beat, telling her body's occupant that something terribly chaotic was about to happen. A smile appeared on the girl's flawless face as her eyes glowed red just briefly. \"Time for the fun to begin\" she said, walking out of the bathroom in time to witness the bloodshed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny woke up in Amy Wilkin's bedroom a few hours later with a sunlight in her eyes and a bright smile on her face as he got out of the bed that he no longer had to share with that fat son of a bitch who used to own the huge estate. Jonny flashed Amy's sexiest smile in the mirror before stripping off the 18 year old's clothes and heading to the shower. As the hot water hit the young woman's flesh, Jonny closed his eyes and happily remembered the events of the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all happened so fast that Jonny was the only being in the whole gala that was actually able to keep tabs on everything that was going on. The gunshots had started as soon as the faux-Amy had gotten out of the restroom. One of the assassins took out a gun and immediately shot none other than Amy;s husband straight through the head, causing enough of a distration to get everyone's attention. As he was shot down by a cop, the other three male assassins took out two guns each and with the speed of a well trained killer, they shot all six cops stationed inside of the gala, a head shot through each, killing them before any knew what the were up against. In fear, the senator had fallen right into the path of the Angel of Death, who removed her own silenced pistol and took the senator's life before anything else could happen. Jonny had gotten a good look at the angel of death, but by the time he looked back, she had disappeared from sight, escaping with the grace of a true angel. The other assassins were soon cornered by cops and held at gun-point as Selina took charge of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que the assassins all took their guns to their heads and ended their own lives before any questions could be asked of them. Jonny had to admit, he admired the cold efficiency of these men. What were they promised to give up their lives for their cause? Or...could they have been controlled? Now that thought got Jonny curious, but he didn't have time for these thoughts. Right now, he had to pretend to mourn his dead husband. He hated that he had to stay in this rick brat's body, but he couldn't help it. There were too many people around for him to just transfer bodies. It was safer to stay in the girl's body, at least until later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed to himself in the shower as he remembered wanting to leave Amy's body. Now, that was the last thing that he wanted to do. Once things were cleaned up, Amy, Selina and some cops were the last people in the gala hall. None of the cops had the heart to pull the crying 18-year-old off of her dead husband, despite how disgusted they may have been by the age difference in the relationship. Once it was just the two of them left, Selina knelt down and whispered in Amy's ear, \"You know, I hear that he wrote you into his will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just laughed again as he soaped up his luscious body, which had been sculpted to physical perfection thanks to the countless surgeries paid for by Goldworth. The old fool wanted to create the perfect female body to live with him as his wife and plaything until he died of old age, but now that pefect body was under demonic new management and owned all of his belongings. The entire estate, every fancy car, three vacation houses, tens of billions of dollars, and a staff of over a dozen exotic maids with incredible bodies were now in the name of Amy Wilkins, a girl that he thought was too stupid to keep it all for herself. Jonny thought about what a fool that old man had been as he shampooed his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she left the bloody gala, Jonny had mentally sent Selina an image of the Angel of Death for the clone to look for in the ID list when she got back to her office. Selina had dutifully obliged and found the fake name that she used without a problem. Jonny didn't expect that investigation to go far, but now that she had a lead to go by, the hard part was done. Allison Masters may not have really existed, but the guest pass still had to be purchased somehow. Selina secretly gave the job of tracing it to her best investigator, who was not informed of the real purpose of the mission. As Jonny rinsed his long hair out, he wondered when he would finally find out where the Angel of Death was. He really wanted her as a new toy, though he was a bit disappointed that taking her as his meatsuit didn't seem like a possibility now. Amy Wilkins' body would prove to be far too useful to him now that he had access to all of these assets. He'd have to enslave the Angel and keep her close enough that he could make use of her body when he absolutely had to. Alternatively, he could always just jump into the 'Angel's' body and then enslave Amy. That probably wouldn't work out though. Amy was too stupid for her own good, and even under Jonny's power, she would be a liability. Jonny would have to play it safe, by staying in her body and carefully calculating her public stupidity. He knew he wouldn't like doing that, but it seemed like he had no choice. Finally, Jonny stepped out of the show and wrapped his body in a towel, before leaving the fancy bathroom and heading back to her bedroom just on time for Amy's cell phone to ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jonny was finishing drying off his newest body, Amy's phone began to vibrate. Jonny looked at the screen and recognized the number as Lisa's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Jonny asked in Amy's voice, putting the phone on speaker so that he could continue doing his thing as Lisa spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! I've been so worried about you! You never came back and I didn't know what happened!\" Lisa sounded like a nervous wreck. She must have stayed up all night worrying about Jonny's safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed as slipped out of the towel and pulled on Amy's thong. \"Sorry, Lisa. I should have let you know that I was okay. But you should have known that I was fine. Selina would have told you if anything had gone wrong\" he said as he put on a pair of form fitting black tights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I know, but I still worried about you. I was expecting a call or something to confirm that you were okay....I made lunch for you when you get home, Master\" she said, sounding pleased with herself. \"Will you be back soon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sighed again as he snapped on Amy's bra. \"Lisa...things have gone in an unexpected direction. I'll be staying in Amy's body for awhile. I just inherited a very large estate from her dead husband. It just makes more sense for me to stay here\" he said, matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh...\"Lisa said. The disappointment was evident in her voice. \"But...but then what happens to me, Master?\" Lisa asked, clearly concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny frowned as he sat down and crossed Amy's legs. He had actually been thinking about this very question earlier today. Now that Jonny had Amy's estate, Lisa was no longer needed to provide a home and financial security. And now that Selina had been possessed by his own offspring, Jonny now had a confidant far more suitable for him. Still, Jonny liked Lisa a lot. Thanks to his commands, Lisa's primary drive in life was to serve Jonny's command. Without Jonny being around to order her what to do, she would not have a purpose. Lisa was a lawyer so perhaps she could be hired as Amy's personal legal consultant. That would give Lisa an excuse to swing by every few days and still make herself useful. Jonny planned on looking through the employees of the mansion and one by one either firing them or controlling them into loyalty to him so that he wouldn't have to keep up the brainless blonde act at home for much longer. If Lisa really wanted to, he could hire her as his new head of staff, making sure the mansion was running efficiently. Lisa could commute in every day and be his main servant here while also ordering the others as she pleased. If she wanted, she could even sell her house and live here, giving her extra money to Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan for you, Lisa. Why don't you come over here later today and I'll explain it\" he said, liking his newest idea. Before Lisa had a chance to react, Jonny hung up the phone. Jonny's toys were slowly growing. The big question was what to do now? Jonny thought for a moment and then decided to. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny\u2019s eyes fluttered open slowly the following morning.  The world was a blur, but light seemed to pour in from a nearby window.  \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Jonny groggily said as he felt a very definite but blurry presence perched upon his chest.  He moved his hand about for the glasses Jack\u2019s body required.  Finding them, he put them on and looked again.  Lisa straddled his small, thin body.  \u201cMornin\u2019 sleepy head,\u201d said the beautiful middle-aged red-head as she smiled sexily atop Jonny\u2019s resting vessel.  \u201cOh so that\u2019s you . . . felt some pressure so I thought I might have grown boobs overnight . . . not sure I could do that in my sleep, actually,\u201d Jonny mused.  Lisa chuckled.  \u201cYou\u2019re so funny, Master,\u201d she commented.  Jonny looked up at her again.  She was dressed in a black, lacey nightgown that showed off her breasts beautifully.  Her sexy legs were a few inches from Jonny\u2019s face.  She leaned down and kissed him passionately on the lips.  Jonny smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a tough time getting up if you\u2019re there,\u201d he said.  Lisa laughed again.  \u201cWell getting up certainly wasn\u2019t a problem for you last night . . . probably the most action Jack\u2019s body has ever had.\u201d  Jonny nodded.  As he lustily looked Lisa up and down, he said, \u201cWell I had good motivation.\u201d  Lisa climbed off him, and he slowly sat up, moved to the edge of the bed, and put his feet on the ground.  \u201cLast night was amazing,\u201d he said.  Lisa just smiled.  \u201cFor someone who\u2019s only been inside that body for less than a day, you sure do know how to use it,\u201d she said.  Within a couple minutes, Lisa came back in with a plate of fresh-made pancakes and handed them to Jonny, who took them happily and began munching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I forgot that this body still needs to eat to stay healthy.  I mean, I could have any meat suit I want, but if I don\u2019t take care of it, it\u2019ll wear out,\u201d he said.  Lisa nodded.  Jonny sat on the edge of the bed and powered through his meal.  \u201cSo you quit your job I take it?\u201d he asked.  \u201cI did,\u201d Lisa answered with a slight laugh.  \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Jonny asked.  Lisa paused for a minute.  \u201cWell, Master, my boss\u2014a man named Stanley Glickman\u2014told me I was crazy for quitting . . . said I didn\u2019t have my head on straight and that my priorities were all wrong,\u201d she explained.  It seemed to bother her; she chocked up a bit.  \u201cShame too . . . I always got along well with him,\u201d she said, seemingly a bit said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said those things, did he?\u201d Jonny asked, a twinge of anger in his voice, \u201ctell me about ol\u2019 Stanley Glickman, will you?\u201d Lisa thought for a minute.  \u201cWell, he\u2019s a big guy . . . I think about 55, and he\u2019s a very talented lawyer.  Imagicorp is tomorrow going to announce that he\u2019ll be the lead counsel in the anti-trust case that the government has instituted against them.\u201d  Jonny could tell from his host\u2019s memories that Imagicorp was the hottest new technology company on the market right now, folks whose inventions would redefine the way people thought about the human brain, about memory loss, about virtual reality, and so on.  This was the company that the tech folks thought would unseat Apple, but now the government had accused them of monopolistic practices and started a suit that could split the company in two\u2014still formidable, but it would be a shell of its former self.    Jonny thought for a minute.  \u201cGet dressed,\u201d he told Lisa, \u201cwe\u2019re going to pay Stan a visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two were in one of Lisa\u2019s many nice cars and headed downtown to a skyscraper that housed the law offices that, until this very morning, had employed Lisa.  Jonny had conjured for himself a nice suit, and Lisa wore a black formal gown that showed off her impressive figure, particularly her bust.  The two got out of the car and left it in a parking garage and walked together into the building.  The entered through the rotating glass door and passed a very well-dressed greeter on the way in and boarded an elevator.  Jonny pushed the button, and they began to ascend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole top floor of the place is his office except for where his secretary sits,\u201d Lisa explained as the elevator hummed upward.  \u201cWhat does he think of uninvited visitors?\u201d Jonny asked.  Lisa paused for a minute.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure about them in general, but I can bet he will not like me,\u201d she said as the elevator came to a stop with a pleasant \u201cding\u201d sound and the doors opened.  The two stepped off the elevator on the top floor and walked down a short hallway and through another door, where they came upon a woman at a desk.  \u201cWe\u2019d like to see Mr. Glickman please,\u201d Jonny said very politely.  The woman looked up at the visitors with a look of surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny studied her.  This woman appeared to be about 30 years old with long dark hair cascading down her back.  She wore dark-rimmed glasses and a very form-fitting red dress that hugged her every curve.  Her breasts were sight to see.  She was exactly the kind of woman a wealthy older man would want around all the time.  \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to want to see you,\u201d she said, looking to Lisa.  \u201cThen he\u2019ll be happy to learn that he has a chance to yell at the woman who just left him high and dry just as they were about to begin prepping trial strategy, so please inform him that we\u2019re here.  The buxom secretary pushed a few buttons on her phone and seemed to read a response.  \u201cGo on in . . . nice knowing you,\u201d she said in a forlorn tone as Jonny and Lisa entered the man\u2019s office.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door shut behind them, and Jonny looked around in the cavernous room.  \u201cWow,\u201d he said, surprised at how his voice echoed a bit in the room.  The floor was solid marble.  The walls were lined with various awards and pictures of Glickman with famous people\u2014some clients, some just other heavy-hitters in various industries.  \u201cQuite a place this dude\u2019s got,\u201d Jonny commented.  \u201cYou should see his house,\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLISA!\u201d came a sudden bellow from the other end of the room.  The two suddenly turned in the direction of the noise.  From the other side of the very large room, there came a very rotund man with a face as red as a nice, ripe apple.  He was only about five feet nine inches tall, but he probably weighed three hundred pounds.  He had a big, bulging belly that his very nice suit struggled to contain.  It jiggled and shook as he walked.  He had no hair left, and his face was adorned with a hefty double chin that almost made it look like every word he spoke was said twice.  A man of his girth struggled to get about, but he did waddle with a purpose.  \u201cLISA!  God dammit!  Why would you do this to me?!  I was gonna put you second chair when the trial came around, you bitch!  Now I have to find somebody else!  What the fuck are you thinking?!\u201d he screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa just looked in Jonny\u2019s direction.  Jonny eyed the man for a moment.  \u201cSo . . . when you said he was \u2018big\u2019 you actually meant\u2014\u201c and Jonny held his hands out from his body as though to indicate obesity.  Lisa just nodded.  The man suddenly looked at Jonny, and then he looked back to Lisa.  \u201cWho the fuck is this?!  Is this fucking bring you kid to fucking work day?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny had heard enough.  He snapped his fingers, and suddenly, Glickman\u2019s mouth snapped shut.  The man tried to continue his tirade, but his mouth simply would not open.  His face got redder and redder, and sweat began to pour down his plump form; he knew something was seriously wrong.  Jonny moved his hand in a generally upward motion, and with it Glickman\u2019s fat body\u2014all three hundred pounds of it\u2014simply levitated off the floor and about five feet into the air.  There he stayed, suspended in mid-air, as Jonny slowly walked a few feet away, grabbed a chair, and brought it back with him to sit down.  \u201cStan, Stan, Stan,\u201d Jonny began in a voice of mock disappointment, \u201cMay I call you Stan?  Is that cool?  Well . . . in any event, Stan it is,\u201d he said as he folded his hands in his lap thoughtfully.  \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve known Lisa for only about a day now, but, well, she and I are quite close,\u201d Jonny said.  He glanced at Lisa, who beamed with pride.  \u201cSo when I hear you talk about her like that . . . see, well, I don\u2019t like that, so do you suppose you could knock that off?\u201d Jonny asked politely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlickman looked on, suspended in mid-air and in terror, unable to move in any way Jonny did not let him move.  He nodded furiously.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cGood!\u201d he said with a broad smile, \u201csee I\u2019ve always thought that reasonable men like ourselves could come to workable arrangements if everybody just comes into the negotiation with a level head, don\u2019t you agree, Stan?\u201d  He nodded as furiously as he could yet again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, progress already!\u201d Jonny yelled happily.  \u201cCome with me, Stan,\u201d Jonny instructed as he stood.  He walked in the direction of a door at the other end of the office.  Stan\u2019s suspended, dough-like body followed as if tethered to Jonny but still suspended in mid-air.  Lisa followed too.  Jonny emerged from the room on to a grand roof-top patio.  He looked out upon the grand city from high above it.  The wind at this altitude was quite gusty.  \u201cNice view, Stan,\u201d Jonny commented.  The suspended man tried to contain himself, but being stuck in mid-air at the very top of a skyscraper that was itself over 1,300 feet above the city made that difficult.  \u201cWhat a view,\u201d Jonny said, \u201ccould I see the Warehouse from here if I looked?  Never mind.  Stan, I know you\u2019re distracted at the moment, but I\u2019m really going to need you to stay sharp and stay with me for a few minutes.  Can you do that?\u201d Jonny said as he turned to face the still-suspended and still-mute Stan, who nodded yes as tears flowed down from his eyes.  \u201cSplendid!\u201d Jonny exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Stan, I admire men like you.  I do, really I do.  You decide what you want in the world, and then you go get it.  I like that kind of spunk.  One does not see it often, so I know a go-getter when I actually do see one, and you\u2019re a go-getter, Stan,\u201d Jonny said as he sat on an ornate bench perched upon the roof.  \u201cThe thing about go-getters, though, is what happens when they\u2019ve gotten what they were going for . . . it\u2019s a sad thing, Stan, really it is.  See, people start out young and strong and determined and hungry.  They want to make something of themselves\u2014do something big!  But the, alas, they actually pull it off . . . \u201c Jonny said, a note of sadness in his voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Glickman, who was terrified out of his fat little body but trying to seem to be listening intently.  Jonny stood.  He waived his hand, and Glickman was lowered slowly to within a foot or two of the ground.  Jonny got close enough to hear the fat man whimper.  \u201cAnd they become YOU!\u201d Jonny said, poking his finger angrily into the man\u2019s chest.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the money you want . . . all the power you could reasonably ask for, and you\u2019ve got that sexy, slutty secretary out front!  Do you know how many men would kill for your life?! \u201c Jonny screamed. He took a couple steps back and calmed down.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you know what?\u201d Jonny demanded.  \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need more of you . . . it\u2019s the successful ones who then get complacent that are dangerous . . . pride cometh before the fall fat-ass!\u201d Jonny yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to do the world and you a favor, \u2018cause deep down I know you got a good heart, Stan.  It\u2019s filled with plaque and damn near exploding, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got a cardiologist to tell you that, and I\u2019ll do a lot more for you than that, Stan,\u201d Jonny said, patting Stan on the belly like they were old buds.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to experience life from the other side of the coin my man!  You\u2019re going to have to claw your way back to the top with nothing but your body and your wits to help you!\u201d he yelled out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked over at Lisa.  She watched intently, not sure what he was going to do. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for your new life fella; it\u2019s gonna be a hoot!\u201d he yelled as his eyes glowed red and he suddenly jumped forward and placed his hand on Glickman\u2019s bulging belly.  The fat man\u2019s eyes glowed too.  Within seconds, he relaxed, and his body began to shift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlickman\u2019s thighs slimmed down dramatically such that they were toned and athletic.  You could fit three sets of his altered legs in the fat-man\u2019s pants he still wore.  His belly quivered next.  Suddenly, the rolls of fat receded into nothing only to be replaced by a toned and rock-hard set of abs.  The skin on his body became clear and tight and beautiful.  Glickman\u2019s hands changed next, his hairy and pudgy fingers replaced with dainty digits adorned with rings and long, beautiful nails.  Suddenly, his now-smaller mid-section began to shake and writhe about.  It was as though some viscous fluid were moving about inside him just looking for a place to come out.  Suddenly, it found a place.  His chest surged forth into two large, gorgeous, and fleshy mounds perched upon his chest.  They were so big that even his fat-man shirt struggled to contain the new set of mummeries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlickman\u2019s face thinned out.  He lost the double chin, and he lost thirty years of age as his face slimmed and tightened.  He closed his eyes from the strangeness of the feeling.  His features became much more feminine.  His eyes moved closer together, and a set of gorgeous, thick lips encased his mouth.  Long, beautiful black hair sprouted from his head and crawled down his back, and then it all stopped.  Black smoke suddenly crawled up his altered body and replaced his now-way-too-big suit with a sexy red set of leather shorts that did not even reach his mid-thigh.  His mid-section was uncovered except for a shiny red leather bikini top from which his boobs threatened to burst forth at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stepped back and looked at his new creation.  He waived his hand, and the new woman dropped roughly from the suspended position to the ground, causing a pronounced jiggle in her chest and a beautiful view of said chest as the figure struggled on all fours to adjust to a whole new set of sensations.  \u201cWha\u2014\u201c she began, now able to speak again.  \u201cWhat you do me!\u201d she yelled, her voice now decidedly female and carrying a very rough Eastern European accent of some kind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGave you a new start, my dear,\u201d Jonny responded.  The woman sat plopped on the roof massaging her breasts as if to ensure they were hers.  \u201cWhy\u2014why you do me this!?\u201d she yelled, \u201cwhy you make woman\u2014make big?!\u201d she exclaimed, her last question presumably a reference to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny chuckled.  \u201cWell every woman should have an asset . . . and your assets happen to be perched on your chest.  It\u2019s a shame you have some trouble with speaking clear English, though,\u201d Jonny said, \u201calthough that might be a turn-on for some men . . . may have to make your way back to the top by spending some time on the bottom of others,\u201d Jonny said tauntingly.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName is Sta\u2014Sta\u2014Stasha Rosinkov!\u201d she said, unable to utter the name of her old body.  \u201cVery good, Stasha,\u201d Jonny said, amused, \u201cyou get to start over . . . how many former men in their fifties get to say that?\u201d he asked.  The new Stasha looked at him with rage in her eyes.  \u201cI use body . . . I survive, make you see.  I use body . . . make life different!\u201d she exclaimed.  \u201cYou get right on that, oh jiggly one,\u201d Jonny said, and snapped his fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, smoke enveloped the buxom woman with the accent\u2014Stasha\u2014and she was gone.  Jonny rubbed his hands together as if getting dust off.  \u201cNot bad for a day\u2019s work,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s only noon\u2014how\u2019d you like some lunch, Lisa?\u201d he asked.  \u201cI would,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere did you send her.  \u201cA seedy bar in the bad side of town . . . she\u2019ll have to learn to use that body really fast if she wants to survive.  In the mean time, the city, or at least some very powerful people in the city, will be in shock at the disappearance of a wealthy lawyer who was about to begin major litigation.  Should be fun to watch,\u201d he mused as the two walked back in the direction of the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exited the office before the same pretty secretary who had sent them in.  She was surprised to see them.  \u201cFunny thing,\u201d Jonny said to the secretary, \u201che\u2019s not in there!  We even went in and tried calling him . . . we\u2019ll return later I guess.\u201d  A look of panic crossed the secretary\u2019s face.  She bolted from her chair into the office to find her boss, and she would surely call missing persons soon.  Jonny and Lisa exited quietly and headed for the car.               <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jonny and Lisa got back into Lisa's car to head into their day, Stanley Glickman's secretary was frantically trying to reach her boss, wondering where he was. She called his personal cell phone several times, going straight to voicemail each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Nicole Johnson. She was 28 years old and, in all honesty, was not a very good secretary. Most of the time, she had no idea what was going on and would only handle very simple things that Mr. Glickman told her to do. Everything that was really important would be handled by her boss himself. She knew that the only reason that she had her job was because of her looks. Mr. Glickman, like all older men in his position, enjoyed a good fucking whenever he could get it, especially from a young, sexy secretary. It was apparently a sort of fad for the older lawyer types. Nicole wouldn't complain though. All she had to do was sit in front of a computer, talk to visitors and fuck her boss's brains out in exchange for making more money in a week than most people made in a month. Though Nicole didn't make nearly as much as her boss, or Lisa did, she made more than enough to live a comfortable life <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took the glasses off of her pretty face and fiddled with them in her hands as she dialed Mr. Glickman's personal cell phone number, trying to reach her boss and find out where he was. Mr. Glickman had a very important meeting in just over an hour that would officially start his big Imagicorp case and he absolutely had to be there for that. After calling his private number several times and going straight to voicemail each time, Nicole called his house. Mr. Glickman's wife picked up the phone and informed the secretary rather snarkly that her husband had left for work is usual time and that she was quite busy. She then hung up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a bitch...\" Nicole muttered under her breath as she stood up, straightening her knee length red dress before she headed towards Mr. Glickman's office. She left her glasses on her desk, not actually needed them and only having them st her boss's request because they aided her look as a secretary. Nicole quickly used her spare keys to unlock Mr. Glickman's office and walked into the office, her six inch heels clicking on the marble floor. the lights in the room turned on automatically, letting her see everything. Nothing seemed out of place in the room. Mr. Glickman was nowhere to be found, but the Imagicorp case file was open on his desk. It looked like he had been in the middle of reading it. Nicole frowned. This was really strange. Nicole clearly remembered Mr. Glickman coming into the office at his regular time, slapping her ass in his typical greeting before he headed into his office. If he had left to go to the bathroom or to go get something to eat, he would have had to pass by her desk again, and Nicole was reasonably sure that she didn't fall asleep on the job. This didn't add up. A man couldn't just disappear, could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he could\" a voice said, causing Nicole to jump in her spot. Her large boobs jiggled a bit as she turned around fast in the direction of the voice. Strangely, the lights in the office started flickering. Nicole couldn't see very clearly, but she could make out a vague, shadowy shape, that looked human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" she asked, moving a little closer. A sudden breeze came into the room, lifting up her dress to reveal the thong that she was wearing underneath as the office door slammed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had many names, but for now you can call me Ezekiel, or Zeke for short\" the figure said in a clearly male voice as the breeze disappeared as quickly as it came. The lights continued flickering as the mysterious man talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you know what happened to Mr. Glickman?\" Nicole asked, a worried look on her face as the figure slowly moved closer to her. She took a step back, hitting the transparent window that separated her from the long drop to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear there's a new whore in town that'll be getting very popular with the men. She'll be making more money than you were in no time\" the figure said, apparently ignoring the question. \"Do you know why she'll be making so much money, Nicole?\" He asked, moving closer to her as a chill filled the air. Nicole shook her head, clearly terrified of whoever...whatever, Ezekiel was. \"It's because at the end of the day, people are controlled by their desires. It was Stanley Glickman's desire for sex and a hot secretary that made him take you as his secretary and it was your desire to be rich that made you accept the job. Stanley Glickman no longer exists, which means that you will no longer be making money. Because of your reputation as a slut in the office and your most recent boss disappearing, you will be unable to find other work. You'll go out to the streets and try to make yourself money that way, but you'll never be as popular as the new European superstar or any of the other women who know what they're doing much better than you. You will die homeless and poor on the streets. But I can help you prevent that\" the voice says as Nicole shivers. She knew what it was saying was true. Without her next paycheck, she wouldn't be able to finish paying for her new house. She'd lose everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you help me?\" she asked, looking at the shadowy figure, trying to make out any figures, but having no luck at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, Ms. Johnson. You see, I am in the business of granting wishes, per se. Think of me as your personal genie, but instead of three wishes, you get only one. Once you tell me your desire, ie make your wish, I will grant it. It's that simple. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded. \"Y-yes...I understand\" she said, shivering more from the cold energy that seemed to be coming off of this man.  \"I...I wish for financial security...\" she said. That would be enough for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Then allow me to give you that security\" Ezekiel said, holding out his shadowy hand. Nicole took the hand in hers, but frowned. Her hand just went right through it as though it were made out of smoke of something. Suddenly the lights in the office went out as Ezekiel's humanoid shape disappeared, replaced by black smoke that surrounded Nicole. From outside of Stanley Glickman's office, a loud scream could be heard, and then nothing but silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door remained closed for several long moments. Suddenly, the door opened and Nicole Johnson walked out of the Stanley Glickman's office. She strutted confidently to her desk and picked up the glasses she had left there, putting them back on her attractive face. Her computer had gone into sleep mode awhile ago and she smiled at her reflection in the black screen. \"Your wish has been granted, Ms. Johnson. With me running the show, you'll never have to worry about financial difficulty ever again\" she said, winking at her reflection before disappearing in a puff of black smoke. The law offices, which yesterday had been home to Mr. Stanley Glickman, Mrs. Lisa Martin and Ms. Nicole Johnson was now completely deserted, and would remain that way until an hour from now when the CEO of Imagicorp arrives to find his lawyers and their secretary mysteriously missing, with no signs of any kind of struggle. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole Johnson's stolen body walked through the streets of the city, looking around at the people she passed and smirking as she payed attention to everything that was going on around her. Zeke absolutely loved this city. Everyone wanted something, which meant that there was something that he could do to everybody. Right now, he only had one thing to worry about, and that was granting Nicole's wish for financial security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a perfect world, Zeke would have just stolen Nicole's body and not had to give her what she actually wanted, but that wasn't how his abilities worked. If he tried to cheat her out of her wish in too big of a way, he would end up in severe pain until he granted it properly. Zeke also had selfish goals in mind with her wish. He wanted to set himself up having a very nice house and with someone getting him whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. He knew that the other demon, whatever his name was who got rid of the fat-ass lawyer that Zeke had originally wanted to have as a meatsuit, was using the other lawyer to wait on his every need and Zeke had to give a good idea respect. Of course, he'd make sure to one-up that other demon. Zeke was always a show off. All of these factors made granting Nicole's wish his top priority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole' possessed meatsuit kept walking down the street, attracting looks from all sorts of people, Zeke suddenly got an idea for how he could grant her wish, while also ensuring that he'd have a wonderful home for himself, and a new servant. Zeke reached into Nicole's purse and took out her cell phone. He then closed his eyes, looking into Nicole's memory to get the phone number that he needed before dialing and putting the phone to his head. After a few seconds of dialing, a man's voice entered the phone. Zeke took a deep breath in and gave his best Nicole impersonation. \"Hello Mr. Strauss. This is Nicole Johnson...that's right, I'm Mr. Glickman's secretary....I'm afraid Mr. Glickman can't meat you in his office today. He's not really feeling like himself...He told me that I should meet you at your estate to discuss the important features of the upcoming case....yes sir, I know everything I need to...you'll give your house staff the day off so that we can be alone? Fantastic, looking forward.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she hung up the phone and put it back into her purse. The man that the supposed Nicole had just gotten off the phone with was Ivan Strauss, the CEO of Imagicorp and Stanley Glickman's most recent client. Little did he know that all of that was about to change for him. Nicole quickly called a cab and had the driver take her to the Strauss estate, a huge manor right on the city limits. It was by far the nicest house in the area, big enough to fit several of the smaller mansions within it's gate. Zeke knew from his little research that the manor was nearly twice the size of the mansion that the other demon was calling home and it was even a fairly close distance should he decide to meet up with his potential friend. As the cab parked, the supposed Nicole paid the driver with all of the money in her wallet, giving him an unbelievable 200 dollar tip. \"T-t-thank you, ma'am\" the driver said as Zeke stepped out of the cab and smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome kid. I won't be needing it anymore\" he said as he turned and walked to the gate that separated the Strauss manor from the rest of the city. he crossed his arms and looked into the security camera waiting for the gate to open. Sure enough, it opened by itself after a little and Zeke was able to strut his stolen ass right through and into the house. The living room alone was bigger than the average house in the city and was a very pleasant place to wait as Mr. Strauss dismissed his staff so that no one could possibly eavesdrop on their conversation. From the corner of Nicole's eyes, Zeke even saw the old fart telling his security team to take the day off. What a fool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my dear, we are now all alone!\" Strauss exclaimed, walking over to his guest with a big smile on his face as the security team walked out the front door to return to their own cars. Strauss put an arm around Nicole's waste, pulling her close and kissing her cheek before he took a seat on one of the many couches in the room. Zeke did the same, crossing his slender legs and pulling his dress up just a bit in the process to give Strauss a lovely view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for meeting me here and setting this up on such short notice, Mr. Strauss\" Zeke said in his secretary voice, deciding to play his part a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine, dear. Anything I can do to get this matter fixed sooner than later...\" he said, now looking a bit nervous since his staff was no longer here to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, sir?\" the apparent Nicole asked, standing up and moving over to him, taking out a handkerchief from her purse and wiping some of the sweat from his forehead. In the wake of his company's controversy, Strauss' wife and children had picked up all of their stuff and left to live with their grandparents on the other side of the country. He was also being sued left and right by angry customers, not to mention he was almost 75 and had a heart condition. Zeke was betting that the old man wished he could be anyone else right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine. Just tired and weak. Do me a favor and pray you never get to be as old and frail as me, my dear\" he said with a smirk. Zeke mirrored the smirk on his cute face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't see that ever being an issue for me sir\" he said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrauss didn't get the joke, but he continued speaking anyway. \"Now then, I believe there's some paperwork that I should be signing before we can officially have Mr. Glickman represent us in court?\" He asked, as Zeke reached into Nicole's pocketbook, taking out a folded contract that he had made appear only a few seconds earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke nodded as he unfolded the contract and put it down on Strauss' legs. \"That's right sir. You just need to sign on the line\" he said, directing Strauss' hand to the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrauss was about to sign his name when he started laughing. \"My dear, do you honestly expect me to believe this?\" he asked, causing Nicole to frown in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe what, sir?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrauss pointed to the contract. \"This contract isn't hiring a lawyer! It's giving you my house, givng you all of my money and firing all of my staff!\" he exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Nicole's turn to laugh. \"Righttttt...Sorry, I'll explain\" she said, standing up straight and looking right into Strauss' eyes. \"Here's the deal. This hasn't been publicized and I don't expect it to ever be, but Mr. Glickman will not be representing you in court. Both him and his senior partner have chosen to take extended leaves of absence for various reasons. I may only be a secretary, but I know when someone is in trouble, and right now you're in big trouble. Before he left, Mr. Glickman suggested that I give you this. You can quietly give me your estate and money to keep safe and then I'll set you up with a new identity. You'll be free to live a new life until this all blows over. What do you say, Mr. Strauss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrauss looked down at the contract in front of him, clearly deep in thought. He then looked back up at Nicole, letting out a sigh. \"I think you're right. This could help me to get away from everything until things quiet down. You promise me that everything will be taken care of?\" he asked, looking Nicole straight in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gave him her best smile and nodded. \"Of course, Mr. Strauss. Your assets will be very well taken care of\" she said as the old fool signed away his home, his fortune and permanently dismissed all of his staff, leaving the mansion as well as every dollar he owned in the name of Nicole Johnson. Now there was only one loose end to tie up. \"Thank you so much for believing in me, Mr. Strauss. You must really wish you could be anyone else right now, don't you?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruass nodded. :You don't know the half of it, dear. I wish I could have any life but the one I'm living right now...\" he said, looking down with a defeated look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any life?\" Nicole asked with an evil smile on her face. Her eyes suddenly began glowing bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrauss was still looking down and didn't realize anything amiss. \"Yes...\" he said, nodding. \"I wish I could have any life at all that isn't the one in this big mess....\" He said before looking up and jumping when he noticed Nicole's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Nicole said, in a voice that was half that of Nicole Johnson and half the Demon Zeke. \"Since you wished for it, you can have it!\" she exclaimed as black smoke show out of her hand and surrounded the old man, entrapping him in a black circular cocoon like shell. </span></div></div>",

The gorgeous young woman was wearing what appeared to be a french maid's costume, complete with a feather duster in her hand and skirt that was short enough to barely cover her fantastic ass.  Her top was cut low, giving Nicole a lovely view of her new maid's cleavage, which were the biggest that she had seen since coming to this city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wished for a new life, so that's what I gave you. Ivan Strauss no longer exists. Your new name is Colette and you are my slutty maid. You do everything I tell you to do happily and with great love and care because you love me above anything else. You're also an incredible seductress and will help me lure people here whenever I need. We also just love having fun in bed. Isn't that right, dear?\" she asked, smirking evilly as she refereed to the former Ivan Strauss in the same way he had been referring to her for most of the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...that's...that's not...my name...\" she said, holding her head as her mind started to change, finishing the identity replacement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is, dearest Colette. It's your new name now\" she said, taking the contract that Strauss had signed giving Nicole all of his money and home and putting it into her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Colette held her head and closed her eyes. \"No! No! That's not my name! Stop calling me that!\" she yelled, standing up from her chair and throwing the feather duster to the ground. \"Oh god! My head hurts! It hurts so much! What the fuck did you do to me???? What did you...do....what did you.....what....\" she started to slow her words as the final changes her happening. Nicole just smiled as she watched this happening right in front of her, enjoying every minute of the former old man's mental suffering. \"What....what did.....what....you....wh...what....\" suddenly the new maid opened her eyes. They had a new, younger shine in them. \"What....what am...what am I doing here, mistress? I still need to finish my rounds cleaning up the house!\" she exclaimed, bending down and picking up the featherduster from the floor. As she bent, she made sure to give Nicole a lovely view of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you the same thing, slut\" Nicole said, slapping Colette's ass and grinning as the maid laughed happily from it. \"Go finish up your chores. I have some errands to run, but nice I get back we can have plenty of fun\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I'm looking forward to it, mistress!\" Colette exclaimed with a wink before hurrying off to finish her cleaning. the possessed Nicole smiled as she watched her slutty slave's ass swaying before she looked at the front door thinking about what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zeke had used his host\u2019s mind to scrounge about and locate Lisa\u2019s address, and within moments the demon, complete with the Nicole suit, smoked back into reality in front of Lisa\u2019s rather luxurious abode.  \u201cNot bad,\u201d Zeke said as he stepped back from the house to look about.  His host\u2019s heels clicked on the concrete driveway as decorative lights in the yard shone on the impressive home.  \u201cThis guy\u2019s gonna be so pissed that I\u2019ve upstaged him within a day or so of finding my first meat suit,\u201d Zeke said with a chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe straightened his host\u2019s dress and hiked up her boobs to make a fine presentation of himself, and then Zeke knocked on the door.  He waited a few seconds, and movement could be heard inside the house.  Someone fiddled with the lock, and the door came open.  \u201cHello there!\u201d said the woman on the other side of the door.  Zeke quickly recognized her as the very woman his present body had met that very morning.  \u201cLisa!,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cgood to see you!\u201d  She stepped back and welcomed the apparent Nicole into the house and closed the door.  \u201cDid you ever find Mr. Glickman?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cYou know what we didn\u2019t actually; it\u2019s a darn shame too \u2018cause Mr. Strauss was going to see him today,\u201d Zeke said, knowing full well what had been done to Glickman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa cocked her head a little.  \u201cSo may I ask what brings you here?\u201d she inquired.  Zeke smiled back, \u201cJust a social call, and I thought I should tell you to keep an eye out for my boss.  Please let us know ASAP if Mr. Glickman tries to contact you,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re really quite worried about him.  How are you liking your time off?\u201d the possessed Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused.  \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed it a lot,\u201d she said, \u201cI keep so busy I sometimes wish I could let somebody else be me just for a bit of rest.\u201d  Zeke smiled giddily from his host body.  He extended his hand, \u201cWell if you\u2019re willing to shake on that I may be able to help you out with that,\u201d he said.  Lisa began to extend her hand in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the two were about to shake on it, a blast of demonic energy flew into Zeke\u2019s possessed vessel, knocking it and him a good teen feet into the air.  Nicole\u2019s body remained suspended in the air after the impact, and Zeke held his hands to his host\u2019s throat and began to cough as if being choked.  \u201cDon\u2019t go making any deals with this one, Lisa,\u201d Jonny said as he walked into the room, \u201cI know you can\u2019t tell, but that isn\u2019t Nicole.  It may look like her, but I can see Zeke\u2019s pudgy little ectoplasmic goo trying to hid out inside Nicole up there.  Isn\u2019t that right Zeke?!\u201d Jonny called out.  \u201cOh all right you got me,\u201d he said as he still struggled to breathe and kicked in mid-air, \u201cI do love a good ride in a big-boobed secretary from time to time,\u201d he said.  \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Jonny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny paused.  \u201cWell it was going great until you tried to muscle your sniveling little carcass into my lady over there,\u201d he said as he motioned to Lisa, \u201cwhat were you going to do\u2014posses her, kill Nicole, and then ride around in Lisa\u2019s body for a decade or so just enjoying yourself and leave he body years older and thirty pounds fatter than she was when you found her?\u201d  Zeke laughed despite his choking.  \u201cWell the thought did cross my mind,\u201d he said, \u201cfigured you and I could hang out together.\u201d  Jonny nodded indicating he understood.  \u201cHow\u2019d that go?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cNot great,\u201d Zeke said as he struggled to breathe.  \u201cDamn right,\u201d Jonny said.  He looked over at Lisa with Nicole\u2019s possessed body still far above them both.  \u201cLock the door and don\u2019t let anyone else in.  I\u2019m going to go have a talk with Zeke,\u201d he declared.  With that, he leapt his tiny Jack body into the air and sailed through it until he impacted Nicole\u2019s body.  Suddenly, both of them disappeared in a puff of black smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple moments later, the two poofed back into existence on a deserted mountaintop overlooking the city.  They rolled about in the dust and slowly got up as if they had been dropped from quite some distance up.  Jonny dusted his body off, while Zeke stood more slowly because of the extra weight in Nicole\u2019s chest.  \u201cNot happy to see me?\u201d Zeke said with a smile.  \u201cNot happy to see you try to possess Lisa,\u201d Jonny said as he examined Nicole\u2019s body.  \u201cYou\u2019ve already got a fine meat suit . . . how did you manage to climb in there anyway?\u201d he asked.  Zeke chuckled.  \u201cShe asked for financial security, and her body was my price.  She agreed.\u201d  Jonny shook his head.  \u201cStupid girl,\u201d he said.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Zeke agreed as he shuffled up next to Jonny and looked out at the city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny isn\u2019t it\u2014looking at the entire city as our little fucking snow globe?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cYeah,\u201d Zeke answered, \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you this is the first body I\u2019ve taken since arriving here, and I\u2019ve already managed a bigger house than Lisa has.  Some CEO signed over his stuff to Nicole, so I met my obligation to her, and the CEO is now a sexy little maid in my service,\u201d he explained.  Jonny shifted and looked up at Zeke with a smile.  \u201cEver heard of beginner\u2019s luck kid?\u201d he asked.  Zeke chuckled.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s what people whose days on top are numbered use to justify their losses to the next generation,\u201d he responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny laughed.  \u201cYou cocky little shit,\u201d he began, \u201cyou\u2019ve never tangled with an Alpha demon before have you?\u201d he asked.  Zeke looked surprised.  \u201cA what?\u201d he asked.  \u201cOh you\u2019ll see,\u201d Jonny answered.  Jonny walked a few steps away and took another look at the city.  \u201cGonna be a fun contest,\u201d he said with a smile.  Then he got serious.  \u201cIf you get near Lisa again I swear you will beg me to let you posses someone else after what I\u2019ll do to you,\u201d he said, and then he ominously disappeared.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny appeared back at Lisa\u2019s house in a couple seconds, the familiar black smoke announcing his presence.  He looked about and saw no one.  \u201cLisa?\u201d he said, his voice echoing through the big house.  Nothing.  \u201cLisa?\u201d he repeated.  Jonny listened for a minute.  He heard what sounded like a whimper from elsewhere in the house.  It was not very loud, but it was there.  A bit worried, Jonny hurried in the direction of the noise.  He moved quickly into Lisa\u2019s bedroom and came around the bed to find Lisa on the floor with tears in her eyes.  He rushed up to her and knelt down.  \u201cLisa?  Lisa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, concerned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him as she cried.  \u201cI\u2014I\u2014did I do something wrong, Master?\u201d she asked.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that man was,\u201d she said, almost pleading.  \u201cOh I know you didn\u2019t know, Lisa,\u201d Jonny said as he helped her up, \u201cit was a demon named Zeke who was inside Nicole\u2019s body.  The whole reason demons posses people is so we can hide when we have to.  You didn\u2019t know, and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Jonny said reassuringly.  \u201cReally?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cReally,\u201d Jonny said as the two sat on Lisa\u2019s bed.  She cried for a bit more but calmed down in a couple minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d she asked.  \u201cYes?\u201d Jonny answered.  \u201cThat woman\u2014that Zeke\u2014what was Zeke going to do to me?\u201d she asked.  Jonny paused, not sure he wanted to say this.  \u201cHe . . . he was going to posses your body,\u201d Jonny said.  Lisa paused for a minute, as if trying to work through this in her head.  \u201cWould\u2014\u201c she began, \u201cwould that hurt?  Would it hurt to have him inside me?\u201d she asked.  \u201cNo, no it wouldn\u2019t hurt in the physical sense,\u201d Jonny said, \u201cbut he would trick you . . . that\u2019s what he does,\u201d Jonny explained.  Lisa thought some more.  \u201cTrick me how?\u201d she asked, curious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny had to think some more now.  \u201cWell, he gets people to ask him for things.  He elicits wishes that may be perfectly reasonable and probably are, but once he gets you to wish for it and offers to help and you accept, it all goes wrong.  Like . . . you tell him you want break from your life and agree to let him help, but then he jumps into your body.  He\u2019ll have his fun and enjoy himself and you\u2019ll get the break you asked for, but when he leaves your body, ten or fifteen years will have gone by.  You\u2019ll be older, and he\u2019ll probably have trashed your body while he was inside it.  You\u2019d end up fat, pregnant, or something like that, and he would move on to someone else.\u201d  Lisa nodded as if understanding.  The look on her face suggested that she did not like that idea.  \u201cCould you get him out of me, Master?\u201d she asked.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure . . . keeping him out is much easier than getting him out, so you just be careful making wishes around other people, \u2018cause Zeke may not look like Nicole if he thinks he needs to use another body to get inside yours,\u201d Jonny advised.  Lisa nodded profusely.  \u201cI will be very careful, Master,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny stood and paced for a few minutes.  \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cit kind of does piss me off that Zeke has made such in-roads so quickly . . . that Nicole meat suit has served him well,\u201d Jonny pondered.  Lisa frowned.  \u201cMaster, is my house not big enough?  I have a far richer aunt . . . I could kill her or you could posses her and we could\u2014\u201c she started, but Jonny cut her off.  \u201cNo, Lisa,\u201d those seem a bit like bad sportsmanship.  Plus, I like my Jack body for now,\u201d Jonny said, and then he suddenly stopped pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it!\u201d he said.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lisa asked.  \u201cMe!\u201d Jonny exclaimed.  \u201cWell, my body at least . . . this Jack kid . . . he\u2019s in college, and that gives me an idea.  I have a particular document I need you to draft very quickly, Lisa, and then get the car and meet me outside.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zeke crossed his slender arms under Nicole's fine breasts and smiled as Jonny disappeared, probably going off to try to put himself on an even playing field. Zeke grinned, knowing that he had succeeded in letting Jonny know he meant business. Jonny was right when he said this would be a fun competition, and Zeke knew it. There was no reason for this to be any more than a game between the two of them. Both were very powerful demons who had the same purpose in life and both served the same master. This would give both of them an opportunity to make some more chaos for the old man, while at the same time sizing each other up and having some fun at each others expense. Though it would no doubt get pretty heated, this was little more than a game for both of them, but it was a game that Zeke was certainly going to put his best effort at winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.....What can I do to beat Jonny?\" He asked himself out loud, loving the sound of Nicole's his melodious voice. Zeke really liked Nicole's meat suit. She was an attractive woman and was now filthy rich thanks to Zeke's granting of her wish to be financially secure. Since he had granted her wish, he could now keep her body for as long as he wanted to without having any fear of being put into unbearable pain and getting himself kicked out of her body. Zeke really hated how his powers did that. In theory, he was one of the most over powered demons to have been created since he could literally do anything, but his powers were greatly weakened thanks to the fact that he could only do something that someone wished for of there own free will. Because of that little catch, he couldn't simply have his newly created maid wish whatever she wanted because her original will no longer existed to make a wish. Zeke had a few ideas on how to free himself from these restraints, but for now, he just wanted one thing...to win his contest with Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke remembered how protective Jonny was of that Lisa woman, referring to her as 'his woman.' At first, he was only jokingly toying with the idea of stealing her meat suit, but after seeing how much Jonny cared about her, he knew that getting into her would be his winning move, but how would he manage to do that? Jonny had no doubt warned her about him by now, so she would be careful to not make any wished around strangers even if he came to her in a body other than Nicole's. He supposed that he could just find some sucker on the street and offer him some sexual favors from his new body in exchange for looking at a picture of Lisa and wishing that Zeke was her. A loophole like that would let him into her body whether she wanted him in or not because it still had to do with a wish. Zeke didn't want to do that though. It seemed like it was cheating. Granted, Zeke literally made his existence cheating people on wishes, but Zeke respected Jonny too much to do something like that. If he was going to take Lisa's meatsuit, he could make sure it was from something that she herself wished for.  Suddenly an idea came to Zeke's mind that was absolutely evil and perfect. It would let him win Lisa from Jonny fair and square and set him up to topple Jonny off of his self-made pedestal.  With an evil laugh, Zeke turned around and started his hike downhill. His next move was bound to be a fun one. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Lisa's former husband was a fat man was the understatement of the century. Larry Jacobs was forty seven years old, and well over the three hundred pound mark. He currently lived in a luxary apartment paid for by the money that he had managed to somehow snag in his divorce where he took care of his son and his drinking problem at the same time. Lately, Larry had been pissed. Lisa had stopped sending money to him and his son and the bitch didn't even bother to send a reason why. He was going to put in a formal complaint, but had constantly found himself to drunk to care. Today was the first time in a long time that Larry was actually sober, but as he listened to the woman's story, he really wished for a nice drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Larry said with a frown on his face as the sexy woman in the short black skirt crossed her slender legs and a small grin appeared on her red lips. \"You're trying to tell me that my ex-wife is now fucking some snot nosed punk and that he's the reason that I aint getting my monthy dough anymore?\" He asked, hands balled into fists. The faint sound of his young son playing with action figures was heard from the background, but as usual, Larry couldn't care less what he was doing right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded. \"That's correct, Mr. Jacobs. I know how hard this must be for you to take in, but as a member of the same legal firm that Lisa worked at, I feel it is my responsibility as a law abiding citizen to tell you this....is there anything that I can do to help you through this?\" She asked, sounding for all the world like a compassionate person that just wanted what was best for this poor victim of crime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think there is...\" He said, hands shaking with anger as he looked at Nicole's chest, not even trying to hide it anymore. He didn't care how blatant he was being. Larry hadn't been with a woman since his divorce and he missed having a nice body like that next to him in bed. \"I just wish that bitch Lisa realizes what she's done and that the punk she's sleeping with get's what's coming to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile grew on the sexy woman's face. \"I couldn't have worded that better myself, Mr. Jacobs\" she said with a devious smile as she inhaled, feeling her powers opening up to her as the wish was made. \"And believe me, I will use all of my assets, every....power....that belongs to me, in order to held you make those wishes come true. But I'll need you to help me with that. Shall we shake on it?\" she asked, extending her slim hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry covered her hand with his as Nicole's eyes began glowing a fiery red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had just finished putting a chicken in the oven when she heard the sound of heels clicking on the floor behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing tonight, gorgeous?\" the possessed Nicole asked, with that evil grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa jumped, startled that she had appeared. \"Wh-what are you doing here?\" she asked, backing away, but hitting the kitchen wall. Nicole's body was blocking the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to have a friendly chat. Why are you being so rude, Lisa?\" she asked, teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa responded by shaking her head. Her long red hair swayed side to side as she did. \"Master Jonny warned me about you...Zeke!\" she yelled, clearly nervous. \"I'm not going to wish for anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole laughed, a sexy evil sounding laugh that made Zeke very happy that this sexy woman was his meat suit. Nicole's body then disappeared and reappeared only inches in front of Lisa. \"Oh don't you worry your sexy little ass about that\" she said as she put her hand on Lisa's head. \"Your former husband already made plenty of wishes\" she said as her eyes glowed bright red. Lisa's followed suit as Zeke reached into her mind and wiped away the programming that Jonny had done, but he made sure that Lisa kept all the memories of what she had to do under Jonny's command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's stolen body took a few steps back as Lisa held her head. She looked a bit disoriented, but was recovering quickly thanks to her naturally sharp mind. \"Do you want me to get you some water?\" Zeke asked in Nicole's sweet voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa removed her hand from her head and shook her head. \"No, I'm fine\" she said, her voice sounding cold and calculating. She was thinking about everything that she had been made to do. \"Thank you for...bringing me back to myself. I guess that kid was more than just a brat trying to get in bed with a cougar, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke nodded. \"He was trying to get you to be his personal slave. Which you were very happy to be until just a few moments ago, I may add\" he said smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said thank you. It's od to actually think for myself again. You said that Larry wished for this?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wanted to screw up Jonny's plans a little bit and figured the best way to do that would be through you. I knew that you weren't going to wish for anything from me because of Jonny telling you not to, but your fat fuck of an ex made my life very easy. He wished that you realized what you did to him and that Jonny pays for getting in your pants. Half of that is fulfilled now\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa crossed her arms, looking down in thought. Now that she was thinking like herself again, she was having problems processing her emotions. She was very angry that her will had been taken from her, but she remembered having positive feelings for the demon that had robbed her of her will while she was under his spell. \"And what about the second half?\" she asked, unsure how she felt about having Jonny suffer. Her feelings were still confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you come in\" Zeke said, taking Nicole's smartphone out of her purse and pulling up a picture. He handed the phone to Lisa so that she could take a look. On the phone was a picture of Lisa's son with a cute looking teenage girl. \"That's Laura. She's 16 years old and will be babysitting your son from now on. She's a devout Catholic and hasn't touched a drop of alcohol in her life, nor will she ever. She's very responsible and doesn't care about anything other than raising your son to be a fine upstanding citizen. As you can see, I fixed your ex husband's drinking problem and gave your son someone responsible to live with. I've also made sure that a nice portion of my current meat suit's now large cash supply is accessible to Laura so they'll both be well taken care of financially. I'd say you owe me for both releasing you from Jonny's control and for setting this up for you kid, don't you?\" Zeke asked with a smug little grin on Nicole's face and a look of triumph in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa exhaled deeply and nodded. \"It seems that I do owe you\" she said, before grinning herself. \"But I remember what I knew when I was 'working for' Jonny. I'm not going to show you my appreciation by making a wish for you to manipulate and use against me. I'm the type of woman who's honest with myself, so I know that I'm selfish. My body and my will are mine alone and no demon or whatever the hell you monsters are is going to take either of those from me\" she said defiantly, spitting in Zeke's stolen face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep frown appeared on Nicole. \"I'm disappointed in you, Lisa. But it looks like you've miscalculated a little bit. I don't need you to wish for anything. I can do whatever I want to you just from Larry's wish since I still haven't completed it. Until Jonny 'pays for what he's done to you' I can use my powers however I see fit to help me with that goal!\" he said with an evil grin as Nicole's hand once again had hold of Lisa's head. Soon both women's eyes began glowing bright red. \"Now....what to do with you?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The possessed Nicole removed her hand from Lisa's head and grinned as she fixed her skirt, moving it down a little. She looked at Lisa, who just stood at complete attention, a blank look on her face as the red glow in her eyes disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you can still hear me and understand what I'm saying, Lisa. Right now, I haven't done anything to you except paralyze your body. That's not the only thing that I'm going to be doing, but for now I just need to think out loud for a bit and straighten out my thoughts. I hope you don't mind\" she said, winking at the still motionless Lisa. \"You see, when I came here I really wanted to make you into MY slave. That would certainly hurt Jonny's confidence a bit. But now that I'm thinking about it, that's a very stupid move on my part. Jonny is incredibly powerful, and he can easily undo the mental changes that I would make, reverting you back to his slave and undoing whatever I would have accomplished with you. So....what can I do to you that Jonny can't undo? The only thing coming to my mind right now is making your curvaceous body into my new meatsuit.  Jonny is strong, but he would have no way of forcing another demon out of someone's body. But then I would lose this sexy catch\" she says, groping her own breasts and smiling with a sort of prideful look on her stolen face. \"I really like Nicole's form. I've made her so accomplished so fast. She has a a bigger house than you have, more money than you have, and a very sexy maid that's more than happy to have a good time at the snap of her newly manicured fingers. And if I were to give her up, then I'm not sure if I can get her back. She's certainly not needed to make Jonny pay for what he did to you. I'd have to talk her into making a new wish, which is something that she definitely wouldn't have much of an interest in now that I've given her what she's always wanted...which leads me to the reason that I haven't just gotten it over with and stolen that sexy body from you, Lisa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole reached into her purse and pulled out a butcher's knife. She grinned evilly and held it directly against Lisa's chest. \"Here's what's going to happen, Lisa. I am going to count to three. When my beautiful voice says three a few things are going to happen. First, you are going to be able to speak. Second, you are going to make a wish. You will wish that I have unlimited access to any wish that I ever need. For your own benefit, don't try to be smart. I know that you're a lawyer and you always think of loopholes. That means you're considering using that wish to make me go away or do something else. Don't do that. If I hear even one word out of your mouth that isn't what I want it to be, the knife I'm holding goes straight through your stomach. You will bleed out and die on the floor of your home. Killing you in cold blood will get Jonny just as upset as possessing you, but in one of those cases, you get to stay alive and even get your body back at some point. Unlike some of my other acquisitions, I promise to actually take good care of your skin. I want you to always stay as attractive as you are so that Jonny can see all that he has lost to me. I'll make my stay in your body pleasant for you, which is something I have yet to do to any of my skins besides Nicole here. Now that you've heard my end, what say you? One, two, three.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lisa felt herself able to talk again. She opened her mouth as she felt the knife blade pressed a little deeper against her stomach. She gulped as beads of sweat fell down her face. Nicole's eyes had an evil glare in them as the two women looked into each other. Nicole had a smug grin on her face. After all, whatever Lisa did now would be her victory. It was only a matter of waiting to see what Lisa said. She thought things over for a few seconds. Nicole was content to let that thinking happen. The demon inside of the former secretary's body knew that this was a very difficult and literally life altering decision and acknowledged that she had the right to think it over for as long as she needed. Lisa took a deep breath, thinking about what she had been through. Now that she was free of mental manipulation fr a decent amount of time, she was completely back to her old self internally. She knew that she didn't want to die, but at the same time, her experience with Jonny taking away her will left a bad taste in her mouth. She had no intention of being used by another demon for his own personal desire, but she also had no intention of dying. Plus, she did want Jonny to suffer for thinking that he could just manipulate her life like he had done. If she died, then Zeke would have to work out a new way to hurt him. Letting Zeke in would be the lesser of two evils, and she had no reason not to take Zeke on his word that she would be unharmed. Like many of her former clients, this was all just a big game to Zeke. He cared about nothing but winning which meant he'd be accommodating to her if he could get his way. She also had to admit that she admired the intelligence of this decision. Lisa remembered Jonny mentioning that Zeke couldn't just mentally manipulate someone into making wishes because it had to be of their own free will. This wish would be just that since Lisa did honestly have the option of not making it. True, that option would end in death, but like any good deal, every side was a winner. Either way, Lisa would get what she chose, and Zeke would be one step closer to winning. \"Alright Zeke,\" Lisa said slowly, stretching out her words since she knew this might very well be her last time speaking in awhile. \"I wish that you can get access to whatever wish you need whenever you need it\" Lisa said, choosing to save her life and wanting to see where this game would go. Nicole's eyes glowed bright red as the wish was made. Quickly, Lisa added \"And I wish to see everything that happens in your little game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes glowed again as that second wish was made. She licked her lips, feeling more access to her powers opening up to grant these two wishes. \"Smart move, Lisa\" she said, eyes still glowing. \"This way you get to make sure I'm not going back on your word. I wasn't going to anyway, but now you'll have a front row seat to my game. I like that ambition\" she said, wrapping her arms around Lisa's still frozen body and pulling the red headed woman into a deep kiss. Lisa's eyes flared red as her body was allowed to move again. From Nicole's mouth, a black smoke forced it's way into Lisa, down her throat. Lisa's body shook violently as Nicole's fell limply  to the floor, dropping the knife to the side. As the shaking stopped, Lisa's body nearly fell tot he floor before she caught herself and regained her balance. Her hands rose to her chest as she felt her newly acquired curves. The red glow in her eyes receded as she looked at her reflection in the nearest mirror. \"You know, I don't think I've ever been inside of a woman as mature as you, Lisa. I mean that as the highest compliment\" she said to her reflection, knowing that Lisa could see and hear everything that was happening now thanks to her second wish. She then looked down at Nicole's unconscious body on the floor. \"I wasn't expecting you to want to be so in on the action, but now that you are, I'd say I can make use of you\" she said with a grin as she gently placed her mouth just over Nicole's red lips. The newly possessed Lisa exhaled gently and blew out a cloud of white smoke from her mouth. The smoke gently entered the sleeping woman's body, which began to shake, though not much. Nicole's unconscious form put up little resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Nicole's eyes opened and she looked up, seeing Lisa's body smiling down at her. \"You're probably confused, so just let me explain\" the new Lisa said, crossing her arms over her generous chest. \"You wished that you could see everything that transpires. In order to grant you that wish, I've placed you into Nicole's body. This way, I get to keep Nicole around in some way, and you get to be younger and richer than you had been before. I personally think it's a lovely trade off, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Nicole, slowly stood up and looked down at her self. She then looked in the mirror, seeing her now younger reflection. \"Well, I have to admit, it's refreshing to be this young again....\" she said, getting her senses back rather quickly. After everything that she had been through lately, this certainly was not the worst thing that could have happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to know you approve\" Zeke said from Lisa's body, before continuing \"Now, in regards to my first wish...\" she said, eyes glowing bright red as Nicole's eyes followed suit. \"You are mine now just like you were Jonny's. You still have your intellect and you still have your free will, but you know who you are most loyal to. You will also make any wish I tell you to make unquestioningly. You are also going to do all of this of your own free choice, because you want me to beat Jonny just as much as I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red glows faded and a sinister grin appeared on Nicole's face. \"Of course, sir. I'll make whatever wishes you want whenever you want it. I think I'll have a much better time serving you than I did with that possessed brat. What do you want me to do first?\" she asked, sounding eager to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new and improved Lisa smiled, proud of her work. \"Right now, just wish yourself back to your new home and wait for me to call on you again. I'm going to have a little chat with Jonny about how I just stole his house and slave from him in one move\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole did a quick curtise. \"Sounds good to me. I wish I was back home\" she said happily. Lisa's eyes glowed brightly as she was empowered to grant the wish. With a snap of her fingers, Nicole disappeared, reported away to her new home where her new maid was waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to prepare for Jonny's return...\" Lisa said, her smile widening. </span></div></div>",

If only he knew what had just happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Jonny\" she said with that grin on her face. For a moment Jonny smiled at her, as if he were about to return toe greeting. The smiled lasted for all of a second or two, when he noticed Lisa's eyes glowing red. Jonny's fists clenched tightly as he was filled with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you about this, Zeke?\" He asked, clearly finding it hard to stay composed. Zeke responded by just chuckling. He couldn't tell if Jonny was mad because he no longer had Lisa, or because he knew that this put Zeke significantly ahead of himself in their little game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so mad about this Jonny. You knew there was a chance that this would happen since day one\" Zeke said, using Lisa's voice, and even making her tone sound like one that the real Lisa would have used. \"But don't worry. I haven't harmed Lisa, and I don't intend to. She's on my side now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Jonny asked, raising an eyebrow. He was still breathing hard, but he was starting to calm down and think rationally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, before I took Lisa's body from her, I undid all the commands you put in her head. And trust me, she was pissed at you for getting rid of her free will. She was so mad that she actually wished to be able to see everything that I did to you in revenge, so I put her soul into my old meatsuit's body. She's now my slave in every way that she used to be your\" she said as she snapped her finger, causing the new Nicole to appear in the room with them in a puff of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked disoriented for a second or two before she noticed that her mistress had Jonny cornered. \"Make him pay for what he did to me, Mistress!\" She exclaimed happily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa continued grinning at Jonny. \"I now have your number one woman's body, and your slave is now my slave. On top of that, I now own this house and have access to all of Lisa's money that you were once so happy to use as your own. I know that none of your powers include being able to push a demon out of their meatsuit and I also know that my wish granting trumps your mind control, so you won't be able to undo any of the changes that I've done to the old Lisa. In game speak, this is check, Jonny.\" The new Lisa asked, now having a smug look on her face. She looked down on Jonny's young meatsuit, who looked so weak under her. She had all the cards, and Jonny had nothing. \"Now to make it check-mate\" she said as her eyes started to glow brightly. It was time to fulfill her last wishes. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny stood in the restroom for a moment marveling at the beautiful woman he had just turned into his slave.  He would head to her home soon, and he would relish having her around . . . he could certainly use her.  She had spunk.  Jonny started to make his way to the restroom door.  As he reached for the handle, he suddenly stopped.  Glancing at himself in the mirror, he knew something was amiss as he stared at the reflection of his barely-pubescent, thin-as-a-rail male body.  \u201cThis is a women\u2019s restroom,\u201d he reminded himself, \u201cgotta keep up appearances,\u201d he declared with a smile as his eyes began to glow red and he concentrated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to change was his height.  Jonny\u2019s body grew a good five inches, so he now stood at about five foot eight.  His bones lengthened and his cartilage squished about, molding themselves to his will.  Then his skin tone darkened, changing in shade really but not color, if that makes sense.  Gone was his pale skin, and in its place was a beautiful tanned exterior of one who spent plenty of time on the beach.  Around the same time, his skin began to writhe and bubble, like a thousand tiny bugs were crawling about inside him.  Parts of his body expanded and contracted suddenly, like water being forced about inside a plastic bag that struggled to contain it, or like a cup about to run over but just barely holding the material inside it at bay.  Suddenly, the next change began.  Jonny\u2019s hair went from black to a bright, radiant, blonde, and it lengthened by orders of magnitude, crawling down his back and flowing freely and beautifully, though looking rather strange on his male body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi face softened.  Things around him blurred as his eyes grew closer together and his cheekbones came to occupy a higher position on his face.  His eyes shifted into a deep blue color.  Suddenly, Jonny felt a popping and a cracking in his back and hips, \u201cAww shit,\u201d he said as the crackling of bones was rather unsettling.  He looked down at his now ill-fitting clothes to see a set of wide hips and a narrow lower back attached to his ever-shifting male body.  He grabbed at the handle of the door to steady himself.  \u201cHere comes,\u201d he said, his voice now a good big higher than it had been.  The writhing and squishing and bubbling about under his skin became even more intense, enough so that some of his clothes were starting to give way at the seems.  Suddenly, all of that stopped.  Jonny stood before the mirror and beheld his partially changed body, one that seemed unable to decide whether it was a man or a woman.  \u201cNow!\u201d he yelled.  In one wondrous, fluid movement of overwhelming and overflowing expansion, Jonny\u2019s body surged forth in all the right places.  His ass suddenly expanded into a beautiful and round shape, and a bit of extra plump flowed into his wonderful belly.  \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said, his voice now fully female, as his innards writhed and bubbled more.  He closed his eyes and felt a certain concentration in his chest for a split second, followed immediately by a beautiful blossoming of two spectacular mounds of jiggly flesh that surged forth from his boring male body.  Warmth and even burning filled his entire body as a thousand small changes got made at once.  His male member suddenly and immediately seemed to shrivel up and crawl inside his changing body as the changes completed themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny slowly opened his eyes just in time to see a beautiful, form-fitting red dress appear out of black smoke and rest upon every full and beautiful curve of his new body.  \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said as he beheld a beautiful woman.  She seemed to be about 28 years old, a blonde bombshell\u2014the classic American woman.  She had curves\u2014real curves.  Her boobs were spectacular, and her ass was the stuff of dreams.  There was just enough flab in her young, beautiful belly to let people know she never cowered from a desert line.  \u201cShowtime baby,\u201d she said as she walked from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny emerged again into the restaurant, a place filled with lecherous, rich old men who would kill for a woman like the one Jonny now looked like.  Whistles and stares predominated as Jonny strutted his beautiful body down the isle of the restaurant.  Men held out money in an effort to buy his companionship, and so did some women.  Jonny\u2019s beautiful face lit up when his eyes fell upon his target.  He strutted up to the man, his beautiful legs barely covered at al by his short, form-fitting dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in question was one C. William Minton\u2014one of the wealthiest men in the city.  He was an oil magnate who had made millions in the business and also invested heavily in firearms dealers.  He had a slow southern drawl, and he enjoyed classic southern cooking\u2014to a fault, really.  See, Mr. C. William Minton loved the finer things in life\u2014food, women, and clothes, each being roughly equal in importance.  His appetite for food was never-ending.  The man stood at about five foot five when he stood at all, and, at 76 years old, many areas of his body had conceded to time in great measure.  His relatively modest height was coupled with a girth of some three hundred pounds.  He had a double chin and a face that shook and jiggled whenever he talked.  Standing was a struggle, and every step made once standing caused a thunderous sound and a hefty jiggle throughout the rest of his body.  His belly protruded out before him, and he had\u2014to use a colloquialism\u2014a mighty front-butt that his fine suits were specially designed to hold at bay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinton scanned Jonny\u2019s new body up and down upon seeing it.  \u201cYou bring your purty ass on over here darlin\u2019!\u201d he yelled, having enough money and enough alcohol that he cared not at al about being heard or seen doing whatever or whoever he wanted.  Jonny strutted over and set his curvy form gingerly on the big old man\u2019s lap.  Jonny leaned in and got close to the old man, putting his face mere inches from the old man\u2019s horny smile.  \u201cDo you like my body?\u201d Jonny asked.  \u201cYes mam I surely do,\u201d Minton said as he used his hands to begin exploring Jonny\u2019s many fine curves.  Jonny caressed the man\u2019s face with one hand and rubbed his bloated stomach with the other.  \u201cYou know what, big boy?\u201d he asked.  \u201cWhat is it sweety pie?\u201d Minton asked, transfixed.  Jonny suddenly placed his hand firmly on the man\u2019s belly, and his eyes glowed red, as did those of his companion.  The old man\u2019s whole body relaxed, and his head drooped a bit as he seemed to struggle to keep his eyes open.  \u201cI think I saw the woman over there looking at my boobs as I came over,\u201d Jonny said, motioning to an older woman\u2014probably in her seventies\u2014enjoying the company of a young male model, \u201cand that makes me so sad \u2018cause my whole body is just for you,\u201d Jonny declared.  \u201cSo why don\u2019t you take care of her for me, and when the cops take you, be sure to tell them that the Chameleon told you to do it.\u201d  The man nodded, transfixed.  \u201cSure thing baby . . . I\u2019ll be doin\u2019 that right quick,\u201d he mumbled.  Jonny stood up slowly as his eyes took on their normal color again.  He turned away from the old man as he came out of his mystified, enthralled state.  Jonny looked back at him with a smile.  \u201cThanks for being such a good sport,\u201d he said as he strutted off, giving everyone a fine view of his ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny got a few steps away and heard a loud voice from behind him.  \u201cThem titties is mine!\u201d the southern voice screamed.  Then came a single loud gunshot, followed by yelling, the sound of a scuffle, and crashing glasses.  Jonny smiled.  \u201cAll in a day\u2019s work,\u201d he said as he exited the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jonny glided through the night like a killer angel, his form shifted back into the familiar, less curvy body of the male he\u2019d first possessed.  The form-fitting red dress was replaced again by a black suit that his vessel had worn in the past.  Jonny found Lisa waiting in the car outside.  He opened the door the luxury vehicle and climbed inside, sliding his stolen body across the expensive leather seats.  The red-headed Lisa looked at him.  \u201cWhat took you?\u201d she asked.  Jonny laughed.  \u201cJust having a little fun . . . you\u2019ll hear about it on the news later,\u201d he said.  \u201cSay,\u201d Jonny began, \u201cwhere would a young on-the-town man like myself go to have a bit more fun at a time like this?\u201d  Lisa paused for a minute.  \u201cWell, Master,\u201d she began, \u201ca young man like yourself would probably go straight home on a night like this and try to make his way through algebra homework rather than having entranced older women drive them about in their cars,\u201d she said.  \u201cOuch!\u201d Jonny said with a chuckle, \u201cI see being my plaything has not stripped you of your wit, though I may strip you of some other stuff later,\u201d he said as he eyed her low-cut dress.  \u201cMy wit\u2014\u201c she said, \u201cwould you have it any other way?\u201d  \u201cI would not,\u201d Jonny answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a charity fundraiser at a house on the water,\u201d Lisa said, \u201cone of the senior partners at my law firm is throwing it\u2014his house makes mine look like a sandbox, which is not easy.  I could get us in.  There are sure to be plenty of sexy rich people of varying ages with their own fun toys eager to show off their money,\u201d she said, \u201cor we could go to my home.  You could come to work with me tomorrow . . . have some fun there,\u201d Lisa answered.  Jonny paused for a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly Pierce sat quietly in her high-rise apartment in a skyscraper full of luxury apartments.  Her abode was quite opulent, so much so that it actually took up the whole floor.  The views were amazing--one end of the apartment overlooked a beautiful beach, while the other end had as its view the vast city of glittering lights that lit the offices and apartments of the bustling metropolis she called home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's story was quite interesting--at once sad and inspiring, really.  She had been born the only child of Mark and Cindy Pierce--a factory worker and a secretary, respectively, and they had been loving parents by any standard.  They did not have much money, and indeed their jobs did not allow them to amass much wealth even if they were good at them.  Kelly had always yearned for a bigger life full of possibility and new experiences and people.  Her younger years had been filled with promise and popularity, but her teen years had brought with them the stifling familiarity, the numbing predictability of a small town filled with the same cast of characters--nice, but boring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had become withdrawn in her teenage years.  She was always pretty and so had her share of suitors, but she always turned them away.  She came to see herself as the big fish in the very small pond, a place to which she did not want to tie herself.  She spent increasing amounts of time in her room and among a fairly small group of outsider friends.  Her parents tried to get her to go out and be social, but she resisted, seeking solace in her room and the small band of misfits.  Sometimes, the friends would come over, and they'd close the door--mumbling about things unknown to her concerned parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly was 17 years old, her parents were killed in a car crash on the way back from a Christmas get-together.  The weeks and months that followed were filled with heart-breaking feature stories in the local newspaper.  It was a small town, so people tended to know each other pretty well.  Old friends and relatives came out of the woodwork to tell Kelly how sorry they were at the death of her parents.  She thanked them all and cried on camera a few times, then retreated into her room again away from the prying eyes of the media and her friends.  The story itself passed from the public mind soon enough--surpassed in importance by the next tragedy, whatever it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the world had moved on, Kelly took the substantial payout from the life insurance policy and jetted away from the small town that was all she had known.  She landed in the bustling city and fell into an improbable bit of luck--she invested the life insurance proceeds in a few financial instruments that seemed to do very well.  The small apartment she rented upon first arriving gave way to bigger and better homes over the years.  Kelly's penchant for investing landed her gigs advising small companies (which then became big ones) on how to manage their employees' pension funds.  The gigs paid better and better over time, and Kelly somehow saw the financial crisis coming before most others.  She had been one of very few to bet against the housing market, and it paid off many times over.  <br>\r\nl <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movers and shakers in town thought Kelly was a genius--a keeper of a lucrative crystal ball that could make them all rich.  Kelly's life became one of opulence and unimaginable wealth.  Her money bought her influence and the ear of the right people in the right circles.  Her life was filled with galas and top-tier boardrooms, with top-rate restaurants and clubs and vacations with whomever she wanted whenever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, Kelly's chosen environment was the pool on her rooftop apartment.  She sat mostly submerged in the shallow end of the pool as the city bustled and hummed below.  Kelly was 42 years old now.  Middle age suited her well, and she had aged beautifully.  Granted, she was no longer a spring chicken, but maturity suited her.  She had a couple small lines around her eyes, but curly black hair dangled beautifully down from her head and a chunk of the way down her back.  Her body was full--she wasn't built like a stick.  Kelly enjoyed her curves, her voluptuous body.  Thigh gaps were a scourge upon the world, she figured.  Kelly had a wonderfully full and jiggle-prone set of boobs that shook as she walked.  Her belly had just the slightest bit of extra flab, and she was all right with that.  The men still loved her.  Farther down, her ass stuck beautifully out behind her--a bubble butt that brought a blessed bounty of lustful stares from men in their twenties.  She could be their mother, but she could tell they wanted to fuck her.  Their eyes were glued to her as her wide, motherly hips swayed about as she walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a drop-dead gorgeous with the body and air of a cougar, Kelly did not have as many relationships as one might expect--at least not publicly.  People had dared to suggest in hushed whispers that she was secretly a lesbian, hence the absence of men on her arm most of the time.  Kelly liked being the topic of conversation, despite the oddity of the conversation itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sat tonight in her pool as her companion talked.  The woman with Kelly was her intern--an energetic, sexy young recent college graduate named Wendy Newman.  Wendy had adored Kelly for years--her success in the corporate world (one traditionally dominated by men) made her a role model for Wendy.  Wendy was a beautiful, if somewhat nerdy, young woman.  She was thin with a toned body the product of frequent gym visits.  She had sexy nerd glasses on her face, and she was eager to please her mentor.  Wendy's boobs were not as impressive as Kelly's, but they fit her smaller, less curvy frame quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Pierce, um, I'm glad you invited me tonight to go over the numbers--ah, but, weren't there supposed to be other people here too?\" Wendy asked.  Kelly seemed not to care a bunch about the question.  \"Were there?\" she said absent-mindedly with a small smile on her face as she looked out into the night.  \"Um, yeah--you said Ali was gonna come too, remember?\"  \"No,\" Kelly replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly began to make her way toward the side of the pool, stepping out slowly by ascending the steps.  \"Wait here,\" she told the confused Wendy as the water from the pool clung beautifully to Kelly's every wondrous curve, shining in the dark of night as her boobs jiggled with her steps.  Kelly grabbed a towel and wrapped it around herself as she stepped into the silence of her luxury apartment.  She walked through the living area and into her bedroom.  Kelly smiled a bit as she made her way toward a wardrobe that had 2 doors in the front.  She grabbed the handles of the doors and opened them.  The wood of the doors creaked a bit as they came open, revealing a mirror and all manner of strange and unusual personal effects.  Below the mirror inside were a couple rows of tiny drawers and shelves.  They contained animal bones, bits of hair, vials of blood, and other things commonly used in the practice of witchcraft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you,\" Kelly said into the mirror, and her call seemed to summon a swirling mass of smoke on the other side of the mirror.  The smoke formed into the vague outline of a woman's face.  \"You called?\" said the smokey figure.  \"I think I want her,\" Kelly answered.  \"Who?\" said the smokey woman in the mirror.  Kelly rolled her eyes.  \"Wendy, I want her.  I haven't had a good fuck in a few days now, and I want her to go to bed with me.  Can you make it happen?\" Kelly asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of silence followed.  \"I have done much for you, Kelly,\" the woman in the mirror said, \"your money, your connections, your beautiful body and the fact that you have enviable tits without plastic surgery--all things from me.\"  Kelly was getting annoyed.  \"Yeah, and I'm the one who has devoted myself to witchcraft since I was a teenager, and I did the spell that caused my parents' accident just to get your attention in the first place.  I kill people when you ask me to, and my boobs are part of my payment.  Now can you help me fuck Wendy, or not?\" she demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something of you,\" the woman said.  \"What is it?\" Kelly asked.  \"Come closer,\" said the woman in the mirror.  Kelly was perplexed.  Most of the interactions did not involve an instruction like this.  Nonetheless, she stepped closer a bit.  \"What are you going to do?\" she asked pensively.  \"My enemies are massing, and I am going to meet them, and you're going to help me,\" the woman declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tilted her head in confusion.  \"What the hell are you going to do?  You're stuck in that mirror,\" she said with a chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not,\" came the devious voice from beyond the mirror.  Suddenly, a swirl of smoke jetted out from the mirror toward the unsuspecting Kelly.  The smoke began to force its way inside Kelly's mouth and down her throat.  She gagged and coughed and choked as it made its way into her body.  Her wondrous boobs shook and jiggled about as she tried to fight off the invading presence, but she would lose quickly.  Kelly fell roughly on to her back as the smoke disappeared inside her and she continued to struggle.  Still, it was over in a few seconds.  All the struggling and gagging stopped as the final wisps disappeared into the curvy woman.  She lay on her back for a moment before silently sitting up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly brought her hands up and used them to cup her enviable chest, massaging the jello-like globes for which men so adored her.  \"You had this body because of my magic, but it was never really yours,\" Kelly, or rather the thing inside her, said.  \"Thanks for keeping it safe for me babe,\" she said as she looked, with a devilish smile, into the mirror.  Her eyes glowed a bright purple.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The being that was currently in possession of Kelly Pierce's lovely body continued to smile at Kelly's reflection with that same devilish grin on her gorgeous face. She stopped groping her ample chest to brush some of her golden blonde hair away from her eyes, which were still glowing brightly purple. Lena, as this demoness was really named, concentrated on her reflection in the mirror. This caused the glow in her eyes to disappear, though the color stayed purple instead of reverting to Kelly's normal blue. Lena cracked her stolen back and placed her hands on her hips. She then ran her hands all around her body's curves, getting familiar with her new self. She tested the limits of her new flexibility by touching her toes and doing a split. Then she cracked her knuckles, grinning again at her beautiful reflection. She placed her hand upon the mirror that she had once called home and smiled. Lena's purple eyes glowed brightly as she felt a weight pushing up from her stomach and through her throat. She exhaled deeply towards the mirror as a white smoke flew out of her mouth and into the glass, which rippled as it entered. Lena watched as the white smoke slowly formed into the vague outline of her meatsuit's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kelly\" Lena said, the evil grin never leaving her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me, you bitch?????\" Kelly exclaimed, now trapped within the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. Is that any way to speak to me after all that I've done for you, young lady?\" Lena asked, groping her chest to emphasize all that she had done for her body's former occupant. \"I suppose I do owe you an explanation, but believe me when I say that I've done for more to you than you realize\" she said, looking down at herself and playing with her breasts with a childish grin on her face. \"Oh, and sorry if I get a little distracted. It's been ages since I've had a proper body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, more than I realize?\" the former Kelly, now disembodied smoke-spirit asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Kelly continued feeling herself up with a disinterested look on her face. \"Well, let's start at the beginning. I am an ancient demoness. I have knowledge of the most dangerous and wonderful secrets of magic, while also being extremely powerful from my own natural abilities. And I am extremely angry with a specific dark being. I have been plotting my revenge for a very, very long time. When you were a teenager and first getting into witchcraft, you cast a spell to summon me in exchange for the lives of your parents. I knew that I could use you, so I made you believe that you had me trapped inside of this mirror that you now call home. I aided you in everything that you need, and If I do say so myself, I made you into the most powerful witch of this generation. You thought that I was doing it because you had me under your power, but as I said this body was never really yours. Ever since that first spell I taught you, I have been preparing this body for myself. I have very high standards and will only accept the most beautiful and most powerful of people to call my home. Now, this sexy skin of yours is overflowing with your own magic as well as my own demonic powers. I do believe that I am now the most powerful witch and demon in this timeline\" Lena said, eyes glowing extremely brightly as an aura of purple energy formed around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This timeline?\" Kelly asked confused. A look of intense fear came over her smoky face as the aura surrounded what used to be her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are several of them. All are similar but all are different. That is not important, for in all of them, I will be getting my revenge\" she said with a grin. \"Now that you know everything, I think I'm going to go enjoy being back in flesh and blood. It's been centuries since I've had a good fuck and you prepared me a wonderful first treat out there\" she said, licking her lips as she thought of everything that she was about to do to the unsuspecting Wendy, who was still waiting outside, currently speaking to her fiance on her cell phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do to me?\" Kelly asked, clearly scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, well that's a good question, babe. I have all of your memories inside of my body, and I've known you for long enough to be able to act like you even if I didn't. That means that you're pretty useless to me. I could just eat up your soul, but my magic keeps me alive without having to sink to such lows. I think I'm going to make you into my own personal magic mirror. Not that I would need you, but maybe I can sell you to someone for a good profit. Not that I need the money either, with the assets that I've inherited from you\" she said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where's my say in any of this? After all that I've done for you, I think I deserve something in return!\" Kelly exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena placed her hand on the glass and smiled evilly. \"You should have known better than to make a deal with the devil\" she said as her purple aura surrounded the entire mirror. Kelly's spirit screamed from inside as Lena wiped away every shred of her memories and personality, leaving nothing besides for the admittedly vast knowledge of magic that had taken Kelly most of her life to master. Everything that had once defined the spirit within the mirror as Kelly was burned away and erased by Lena's magic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow settled as the now only Kelly smiled at the mirror. \"Mirror mirror on the wall...tell me who I am\" she demanded of the mirror, which was no longer human enough to warrant being given a proper name for itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face in the mirror now had a blank expression. When she spoke, it was in the voice of Kelly, but robotic and unemotional. \"You are my mistress, Kelly Pierce\" she said, keeping her reply short. Now believing herself to be nothing more than an enchanted mirror, she had no reason to prolong conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" Kelly asked, wanting to know for sure that her magic had done it's job. She was, after all, out of practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not understand your question, Mistress. I am but a mirror, given life by you for the purpose of being a storehouse of magic. I serve whoever my current owner is and will magically aid them with whatever they tell me to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. I'll do my best to get you a new home shortly. Something tell me I will not be having need for your magics since I have my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mistress\" the mirror said as Kelly closed the doors on it, returning it to its wardrobe. The mirror would not want or care about anything. Whoever the new, and only Kelly would sell it to would become it's new master or mistress. The mirror would know nothing of it's former life and would be more or less a living spell book. If Kelly played her cards right, it could be used by it's new owner as a wonderful asset to put a wrench into the Old Man's ordered chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turned around and walked out of the room, strutting and making a point to sway her hips with every step that she took. She slowly opened her door and walked back outside, onto her rooftop pool. Wendy was still on her phone. As soon as the intern noticed her boss return, she immediately got flustered. \"Sorry, honey. My boss is back. Love you\" she said before handing up and putting her hone into her purse. \"Welcome back Ms. Pierce!\" she exclaimed, immediately flashing a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly smiled back, looking the young woman over. Wendy Harrison had shoulder length Auburn hair. She was tall, but not too tall, and was very fit. She had the type of body that an athlete would have, and was sure to look great in a bikini. She was currently wearing a long sleeved white blouse that was buttoned too high for Kelly's liking and worse a long skirt that covered her knees. Her stunningly toned legs barely got any showing. Her glasses gave her a nerdy innocent look and her engagement ring sparkled on her finger. Kelly licked her lips. Wendy was clearly a very innocent young woman. Of course, with the right pushing, she could be very different. Where Kelly just wanted to fuck Wendy for the night, Lena wanted to make Kelly hers for a much more extended period of time. Perhaps she could be a concubine or live-in servant? After all, someone would have to work around here to keep the place nice and clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Pierce...is something wrong with your eyes? they look...different\" Wendy said, taking a step closer, and seeing their purple color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Kelly just grinned evilly as her eyes began to glow, causing Wendy to take on a startled expression. \"I don't think my eyes are what you should be worried about, Wendy\" she said as her body became surrounded by the her purple magics. Usually there wasn't this much of a show involved with her fun, but after being without a body for such a long time, Lena could afford to overcompensate a little. What happened to the former Kelly was just a warm up. Now it was time for the real fun. </span></div></div>",

The job of any demon is to bring chaos to the world of man, and THIS...I want you do to above all else. But there are also a a certain number of specific humans that I wish to have silenced...permanently\" the old man explained. \"I will give your 'associate' Jonny the list of these individuals, you will be reporting to him throughout, understood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master!\" Kal replied from inside Carly's petite body, as his own, ghostly form highlighting hers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He will be in charge of you. the only one you listen to before me, is him. do you understand?\" The old man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\" the other three said in unison. Although their personalities were back to normal they would always serve the old man unquestioningly. to them it was as if it had always been that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. By the way, be sure to feed every day or so, or you will be forced into oblivion. You are demons so feeding will be seconds nature to you. The soulless bodies left over will be your unquestioning slaves that will serve you without question or hesitation. They would gladly kill themselves for you to get rid of evidence. Their bodies will also be much easier for you to take over as their will not be a soul to over ride. when not under orders, be sure to cause as much chaos as possible. Fair well, mt servants.\" The old man said, before fading away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do now?\" Jonny asked no one in particular, placing his hands on his new hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the master. You're our boss, you tell us.\" Kal said, while rubbing his stolen crotch, and moaning in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one thing, do that on your own time. What you do to her is your own business, but please don't tempt me.\" Jonny said, looking at his stolen breasts and placing a hand on one. to his surprise, Kal stopped almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I recon we should get out a' this house and go have some fun! We aint been breathing for way too long. Why not take our new toys out to party?\" Lizzie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think babycakes!\" Billy said, before embracing his lover for an extremely passionate kiss. Normally Jonny would be against doing anything unethical or immoral, but since becoming a demon all those years ago his outlook changes dramatically. Now all he wanted to do was cause chaos and have fun with his stolen body. It was as if he were changed at the very core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good idea to me. Let's go find their car.\" Jonny said. The others all went through the door, but Jonny stayed for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the house they were leaving behind. They had been trapped there for twenty years. All that time, they were bored to death. Jonny massaged his hosts breasts and smiled sinisterly. Something he was sure his host body had never done before . Things weren't ever going to be boring again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man faded into view inside of an abandoned warehouse. Standing in front of him was a young man in his late twenties. He had shoulder length blonde hair and a shaggy beard. The old man new very little about him. All he knew was that he was attempting to end his own life when the old man had teleported him away and commanded him not to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man placed his hand on the man's head and felt the man's soul latching on to his hand. He could feel the soul pulling it's way out of the mans body and into the old mans arm. The old man felt the younger mans soul fill his body as it left the young mans. the young man fought against the absorption, but it was no use. His body began to spasm as his soul left his body. When he felt the last of the soul enter his body the younger man stopped fighting and the old man saw the dead look in the mans eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man felt himself become filled with energy as the soul radiated his body. for the briefest of seconds, his body changed and became younger, more fit. As soon as it happened, the change ended and the old man returned to normal, but with a rejuvenated gleam in his eyes, which briefly glew bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh that feels much better. It has been too long since I had a good meal.\" the old man said with a smile at the young man, who stood at attention in front of him. \"Now then, I understand you were attempting suicide earlier..\" the old man said to his newest victim, who's soulless body was now his eternal slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my master.\" the young man said, almost robotically. The old man materialized a gun with one bullet in the man's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then finish the job.\" He said, turning to walk outside of the warehouse. As he left, he heard a gunshot and a body dropping to the floor. The old man made both instantly disappear. It was a shame to kill the man, but the old man already had too many slaves. What was he going to do with another? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny got into the drivers seat and saw that the Calhouns were busy making out in the back seat while Kal was still feeling up his host body. Once they saw Jonny enter they all stopped and looked at him expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we waiting for?\" Jonny asked in his hosts cute accent, taking the key from Billy. \"Let's go party!\" He said putting the key in the ignition and driving away at full speed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah. He definitely wouldn't get bored again any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kal then copped another feel of his stolen tits and squeezed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this bitch is tight, I wonder if they're all like this over in merry old England\" he then moaned. \"One thing's for sure, her parents will have no idea their little girl is now just a \"meat suit\" for me to wear\" he laughed out loud. He then turned around and took a look at Lizzie and Billy in the back seat, still wearing their own host bodies and unable to keep their hands out of each other's pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, you two gonna be like that the whole fucking way?\" Kal asked. Lizzie just turned her head and grinned, giving Kal 'the finger'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We ain't had sex in over three decades Kal, we got a lot of catching up to do okay\" she said in Liz's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point!\" Kal responded, nodding Carly's head. He then faced the front again and fidgeted in his seat as he hitched Carly's form-fitting black dress and started vigorously rubbing his snatch through the fabric of her knickers. \"Oooh...fuck yeah, I always wondered why broads were always so fucking happy, now I know\" Kal moaned in his own voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just looked over at Kal and shook in head, though he did have to keep feeling up his own host's breasts whenever he had the chance. He loved being inside Natalie's body and he didn't plan on transferring into a new host anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey..lookey here, a diner!\" Jonny suddenly pointed out to his compatriots, and even Lizzie and Billy stopped making out in the back seat to take a look out of the car window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it has a fucking bathroom, I'm about ready to soak this bitch's panties!\" Kal chuckled wickedly, again using Carly's own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had pulled over, Kal and Jonny stepped out of the car and had a look around. Kal steadied himself in Carly's stiletto pumps and then set off walking in a very 'manly' fashion towards the diner. There was nothing at all feminine about the way Carly's body now moved. He idly scratched one of his tits and spat on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a little shitbox we have here\" Kal muttered, causing Jonny to agree with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, looks like it!\" he said from Natalie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two numbskulls getting out the car of what?\" Kal shouted to Lizzie and Billy, who slowly exited the vehicle. Then suddenly the door of the diner opened and out walked a middle-aged man wearing some dirty jeans, a checkered shirt, boots and a baseball cap. Kal just started walking towards him and he used his host's 'cute' appearance to get the guy's attention for a second. He then reached up and clamped one of Carly's dainty, manicured hands on the man's head and grinned as he extracted the man's soul from his body. The soul shot into Carly's body and her eyes burned fiery red again as Kal enjoyed his first 'meal'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, fucking delicious!\" he exclaimed. \"Now, go drive into a ditch, rob a bank, do whatever you want, just get out of my sight you mindless meatbag!\" Kal then said to his 'slave', waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man got back into his car and drove off eratically, and the demons knew it wouldn't be long before his body would be as dead as his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend the meals in this place, they're very tasy\" Kal laughed, contorting Carly's face into another wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny just ignored Kal's statement and let out a sigh as he brushed Natalie's long hair behind his ears. Lizzie and Billy of course thought what Kal had said was hilarious, both of them laughing maniacally. The demonic foursome then entered the diner and looked around at the several other patrons and staff who were in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good a place as any to start right honeybunch?\" Billy said to Lizzie, and they walked their host bodies further into the place, hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Jonny had to admit to himself that he was 'hungry' for a soul.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There would be plenty of time to play on a full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick look around, he saw that there were seven people in the place in total. There were two teenage waitresses, each wearing a matching tight diner uniform and short skirts, talking to each other, a cook who stood around in the kitchen looking bored, and four people at a table who looked like they were having a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four all looked like college students, who had just gotten inside from a fun night. They were talking to each other happily, not really paying attention to anything else around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you hit that guy...\" One of the two girls said, jokingly punching one of the guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it wasn't my fault. He came out of nowhere. I wonder where the body went though.\" The guy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that old man took it...\" The other guy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't remind me, that guy was a creep.\" The last girl said. they were completely oblivious to the four who had entered the diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like quite the buffet.\" Kal said, this time using his hosts accent as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So what's it like, eating a soul?\" Jonny asked, curiously. Billy and Lizzie were kissing each other violently in a corner they had found. Jonny didn't really mind. The two lovers hadn't been able to touch each other for decades so the least he could do was let them have their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you need to try it...It's like the best thing you've ever eaten times a thousand. And it just gives you the biggest rush..It's fantastic.\" Kal said, rubbing his hosts slim stomach. Clearly he was hungry for seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for us to all have our firsts before you take a second though..\" Jonny warned. Kal put on one of his host body's best 'pouting' faces but eventually gave in. Jonny definitely liked the feeling of being in charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jonny moved to the kitchen and found the cook, who was sitting on a chair reading a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow night?\" He asked, making full use of his hosts cute voice and accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No slower than usual,\" He said putting down his book and standing up so he faced Jonny. He was a good three inches taller than Jonny's host, but that wouldn't matter. \"So what can I do for you, young lady?\" He asked with a polite smile. He looked like he was about 50 or so, with some tattoos on his arms, and a thick Italian accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much. My friends and I had just stopped over here for a bite to eat. I was hoping you could give us something nice.\" Jonny said, taking one of Natalie's slender hands and placing it on the mans chest. He looked up at him seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, I'll make you anything you want.\" The man said. Jonny took his host's hand and put it on his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about some of your soul?\" He asked as he felt himself pulling the man's soul right from his body. The man struggled as he felt his souls being taken away, but he couldn't move. One Jonny had touched him, the were attached until the feeding ended. Jonny moaned in Natalie's sweet voice he felt a tingling throughout his new body. He could feel the new soul he was absorbing give him power and energy. One he felt it all inside, he removed Natalie's hand and looked at the man's eyes. They were dark and empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's for the meal big boy,\" He said. \"By the way, why don't you start out meals right now. And don't stop until you die from over work.\" Jonny said, giving the cook as kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my master.\" The man said unemotionally as he immediately got to work. Jonny walked out side and saw that Kal was still waiting and the Calhouns were still busy with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right...What a fucking rush...\" Jonny said, now full of energy. the Calhouns stopped their kissing and went over to Jonny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our turn now right?\" Lizzie asked, looking starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, both of you go eat and then join us back here for seconds.\" Jonny said, pointing them in the direction of the two waitresses. They left with huge smiles on their face as they headed for their first meals. Jonny just smiled...Oh this was going to be fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lizzie then put one of her host's hands around the redhead's neck and lifted her a full foot off the floor. The girl struggled...but then her body went limp as Lizzie quickly extracted her soul from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh baby this feels...sweet!\" she squealed as the young, vibrant soul was absorbed into her host body. She then put the 'mindless slave' that the girl had become down, just as Billy was silently forcing the brunette against the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly always liked to be different and he kissed the other waitress...and literally 'sucked' her soul out of her body. He then licked his lips and laughed at Lizzie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, she sure does taste good...but she tastes no where near as sweet as you do Lizzie!\" They then resumed kissing and fondling each other's host bodies, as the two obedient slave waitresses just stood there, awaiting their 'orders'. Billy stopped kissing Lizzie enough to briefly look at the two waitresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...go eat each other out or something, we're done with you\" he chuckled, and the two soulless, diner employees went into the kitchen and started making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you two enjoyed your meal!\" Jonny asked the two lovebirds, not expecting to get an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they did, cop boy!\" Carly's possessed body laughed, as it stood there, hands on hips. \"Now what we doing about those four over there?\" Kal asked, gesturing behind him to the four students, who amazingly hadn't seen or heard anything that had just happened. Kal was once again making no effort to hide his Brooklyn accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Billy can have some fun with 'em, if he can draw himself away from his beloved for a few seconds\" Jonny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think we're done in this fucking place\" Kal muttered quietly, as he rubbed his stolen pussy through his dress. \"But hey...you're the one in charge, you tell us what to do\" Kal then added, looking at Jonny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Jonny mumbled in Natalie's voice, \"I say we...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Billy's demonstration back at the house had left a mark on Jonny, and Jonny wanted to see what else he was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get you're ass over here, redneck!\" Kal called. Reluctantly, the two southerners stopped making out and walked over to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do ya want now?\" Billy asked, clearly annoyed both that he was no longer making out with Lizzie and that he had been insulted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see those kids over their?\" Jonny asked, pointing one of Natalie's manicured nails at the table of kids, who still hadn't noticed anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about em?\" Billy asked, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go use your powers on them. I want to see what you can do.\" Jonny said. Billy smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing bossman. But let Lizzie help. She has some powers a' her own to try too.\" Billy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. got have fun.\" Jonny said as both Calhouns walked over to the table. Jonny didn't know Lizzie had extra powers too, but he'd be interested in seeing what they were. Billy stood next to the table and introduced himself to the kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, my name's Billy Calhoun and this is my beautiful lover Lizzie,\" He said, putting his arm around Lizzie. \"I represent a fashion company that specialized in complete makeovers. Would any of you be interested in a free sample?\" Billy asked. Jonny was impressed that he was able to make up a story so fast. Apparently he was smarter than he looked. Both girls at the table, a hot blonde, and a shy looking brunette with glasses nodded happily. The guys looked like they couldn't care less either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on, guys. We can give you the sample to. ah promise yawl won't mind.\" Lizzie said. Reluctantly the guys agreed. apparently they had nothing better to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Then let's begin. First all a you close your eyes.\" Billy said. All four listened and did it. Jonny wasn't sure if that was because Billy was using his demonic persuasion, or if the kids were just that stupid. Billy stared at all of them and began to change their bodies. He turned both girls into exact duplicate's of Liz and David, and both guys into exact duplicates of Carly and Natalie. Even their clothes changed. Jonny was impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yawl can open your eyes now.\" Billy said. All of the students gasped at their new forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do to us?\" The one who now looked like Liz asked, in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eew, I'm a guy now. This is nasty.\" Said the one who looked like David. Jonny was amused that rather than saying anything, the two guys who now looked like Carly and Natalie were busy feeling themselves up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you a body makeover. Now Lizzie here will give you the next part...\" Billy said. Jonny was curious about this. He had never seen Lizzie's power yet. All of the bodies spasmed as she over rid the kid's minds. Eventually they stood up and looked at the other four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It looks like there are eight of us now!\" The one who now looked like Natalie said with a smile. Jonny looked at Lizzie, who smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're wonderin' what I did, I changed their minds to think they're us.\" Lizzie said with a smile. Okay, Jonny was impressed. Apparently while Billy could change the physical characteristics, Lizzie could change the mental onew. They were the perfect couple, even as demons. Both pairs of Lizzie and Billy began making out, and the two Kal's felt up eachothers body. The Jonny's just looked at eachother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is interesting.\" The real Jonny said. The new one just smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. I don't think we're real demons like you. We're just you in mind. The four of us can't possess anyone or eat souls.\" The new Jonny said. That answered some questions. The question was what to do with their new additions now.</span></div></div>",

It would be the perfect place for the demons to have fun.  Jonny parked the car in a parking lot, and the four got out of the car. As they were about to look around town, the old man appeared in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you are all well?\" The old man asked. His eyes faintly glowing red in the night time darkness. The demons didn't keep track of time very well, but they knew it was probably past midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master.\" Kal said, bowing his hosts head. The others did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now then, there is something very important I must tell you all,\" The old man said, looking at them all. \"Your host bodies are not meant for permanent housing. If you stay inside of them too long, they will begin to burn up. You would have at most a day with every body. Now then, this town is where you will be staying most of the time. This town is large enough that you should never run out of new bodies. There are already a few demons here, but they will all be friendly.\" The old man said. He looked at Kal, Billy and Lizzie. \"You three may go. I have taken the liberty of buying hotel suits for you. Good bye.\" He said, clicking his fingers as the three immediately disappeared from view. The only one's remaining were Jonny and the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this to us?\" Jonny asked, putting his hands on his hosts hips. He'd miss this body when he had to get rid of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simply something I do. It's my job to create demons.\" The old man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you send them away but not me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most important of the four, Jonny. I have a special job for you.\" The old man said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what, exactly, is my job?\" He asked, getting annoyed that the old man never gave a straight answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out eventually.\" The old man said with a smile. apparently he knew Jonny was annoyed. The old man clicked his fingers and Jonny found him in a hotel suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny looked in the mirror at his new face. He'd definitely miss this body, but since he could posses anyone he wanted, he could always find a better one. Jonny slowly stripped off his hosts clothes until he was only in her bra and thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He gave his breasts a squeeze and moaned in pleasure as he began rubbing his hosts crotch. If this was going to be his last night in her, he might as well have fun. Jonny could see why Kal was always doing that.</span></div></div>",

The screams filled the room when he finally did climax, and having experienced the best that Natalie's body could offer him, Jonny felt content. In the next room though he could hear Kal's deep grunt as he experienced his own, unbelievable orgasm in Carly's body. As for Lizzie and Billy, they were probably screwing each other by now, Jonny grinned when he imagined their two host bodies going at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny then just laid there, staring at the ceiling and wondering what he and the others were going to do next, what kind of bodies they were going to get themselves. None of them, not even Kal seemed to be too fussy about the gender of their hosts. In fact, he guessed that Kal now preferred female hosts. Jonny did know that he didn't want Natalie's body to desintegrate, so he would leave it while she still had a chance of surviving afterwards. And since the others now had to do what he said, he could 'save' her friends too. He knew it wasn't a very 'demonic' thing to do, but he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Jonny exited his hotel suite, once again fully dressed in Natalie's clothing. He was feeling a little hot under the collar, and he suspected that the process of his host body burning up from the inside out had already begun. He rushed to Kal's suite and walked straight him, catching him just slipping Carly's thong back on. Perspiration was starting to pour down Carly's delicious little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cop boy, I think this bitch is about done!\" Kal grunted in his deep voice, as he continued getting dressed in his host's clothing, which he had strewn about the floor of the suite. He then slipped his feet into Carly's pumps and started walking awkwardly around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave these bodies before they die!\" Jonny told Kal, who simply frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're only humans, who cares if they die?\" was Kal's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do as I say\" Jonny said firmly in Natalie's sweet tone, eliciting an obedient nod from Carly's possessed body. And it was then that Lizzie and Billy walked into Kal's room, both of their host bodies were also showing signs of wear and tear. \"Billy...change Lizzie's host back to how she was\" Jonny ordered. \"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" a frowning Billy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww shit Jonny, spoil a girl's fun why don't you!\" Lizzie whined from Liz's busty body, as Billy returned it to its normal proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're finding new hosts within the hotel, split up and take your choice, we'll meet back here in 30 minutes\" Jonny said, and his three companions did as they were told. He then wiped the sweat from Natalie's brow with one of his manicured hands and exited the room himself in search of a new body to possess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonny loved Natalie's body, but the constant sweating was getting annoying. He figured it would be best if he just ditched Natalie's body and let her resume her life. She should be able to find her friends once they were de-possessed. Jonny didn't really know why he was so concerned about whether these Brits lived or died. He couldn't care less when they sent their soulless slaves to their deaths, but now he was concerned. Maybe he wanted to find Natalie one day and have some more fun as her. He wasn't sure and didn't really care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny sat Natalie's body down on a bench and left her body. He looked down as she slumped on the bench, unconscious. Jonny didn't like being without a body. It reminded him of all those years trapped, and that was the last thing he wanted on his mind, now that he was free. From his angle, Jonny could see pretty much everyone in his area of the hotel. There were a lot of nice options for his newest host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were quite a few guys in suits, who looked like they were in town on business, some girls who looked like they were in college, and a few families. No one really caught Jonny's attention at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the girls were pretty good looking, but there was nothing special about them. Jonny floated around for a little, and finally found someone who caught his attention. She looked like she was in either her late teens or early twenties and was by far one of the most beautiful girls Jonny had ever seen. She had long blond hair, and green eyes, with a cute face and a flawless smile. Her breasts weren't the biggest Jonny had ever seen, but her ass was just incredible. She was wearing a form fitting, black tank top, and black leggings that accented her great curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny flew down behind her and followed her as she walked, watching that amazing ass sway with every step. There was no question about it. she would be Jonny's next host. The only question was how he should go about possessing her. It looked like she was heading towards the bathroom, which probably wasn't busy. That would give Jonny time to have fun with taking her body as his own, but at the same tile, he really wanted to get inside of her. </span></div></div>",

As soon as the girl had clicked into the bathroom in her heels...Jonny flew into her from behind, but he didn't immediately take her over. The girl's body jolted as he entered, and she looked down at herself, her legs just wouldn't move anymore. She tried to walk, but she couldn't, and she couldn'nt even feel her lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh god, what's wrong with me?\"</i> the girl thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny now had control over the girl's lower half, and he could feel the pumps on her feet, the tight leggings hugging her shapely legs and ass, and of course her skimpy panties riding up the crack of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh baby, this is gonna be good...for me!\" Jonny laughed. The girl then suddenly lost feeling in her arms, and her expression turned into one of complete horror as her manicured hands began groping and squeezing her perky boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody help me!\" the girl tried screaming, but it emerged as a whimper instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting an end to the girl's 'suffering', Jonny then completed the take-over and subdued her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh...that's better!\" he muttered in her voice. He then took an admiring look down at his new body, it was smokin' hot and his new hands roamed over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna be a good 24 hours in this little lady\" Jonny chuckled from his host body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny quickly emptied the girl's bladder and then exited the bathroom, walking back the way he had come. He smiled when he saw a hotel maid sat with a groggy Natalie on the bench, giving her a drink of water. The poor girl didn't know where she was...or what had happened over the past day or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving back at Kal's suite, Jonny sighed, none of the others had arrived yet. He just ran a hand over his delicious new ass and then took a seat on the end of the bed. This gave him a few moments to properly familiarize himself with his attractive new \"meat suit\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man had short black hair and was quite well built, he was wearing smart dress pants, black loafers and a white collar shirt. His wife, a petite redhead with D-cup breasts had her hair in a ponytail and she was wearing a red blouse, a white pencil skirt, tan hose and a pair of white stiletto pumps. \"Hmm, what'ya say honey?\" Billy said, gesturing to the couple as they walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, I'll make it easy on ya!\" Billy then grinned, then he exited David's perspiring body, which slumped unconscious in the hallway. Lizzie then watched as her fiance flew down the hallway towards the couple...and phased into the woman's back, making her jerk forwards. As her concerned husband looked on, the woman's body convulsed and her 'ample' breasts jiggling on her chest as Billy assumed control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, look at these babies!\" Billy suddenly shouted out in the woman's voice. Even though she was from the north-west, she now had a strong southern accent. \"We ain't got all day baby, make your move\" Billy then said to the still possessed Liz down the hall. The woman's husband's confusion only grew, that is until Lizzie made a sudden arrival in his body and took it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's body slumped on top of David's in the hallway as Lizzie reached down to feel her new crotch. Her face lit up when she felt her new 9-inch prick growing erect. \"Oooh...that does feel kinda nice honey!\" Lizzie said in her host's deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya!\" Billy grinned from his new, sexy body, as he took Lizzie's large hands and put them on his tits. \"Now whad'ya say we find a nice secluded place to have some fun?\" he suggested with a wink as he stood there rocking in his stiletto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Jonny will be waitin' for us!\" Lizzie reminded him, \"And...what about those two meatbags!\" she asked, gesturing to the unconscious David and Liz.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His possessed body falling into a seat while his spirit flew across the room before taking on old man in a plaid green suit with a stained lapel. He flexed his fingers adjusting to his new pair of eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laughed \"Losing your touch? You picked the brownest banana in the bunch.\" Johnny Quipped as Kal took to stepping in his new but worn shoes. The suit was just slightly baggy, it hung off him in just a way that it swayed slightly with every step. But Kal smirked as he sauntered eloquently. As that happened the Calhouns watched Johnny's expression shift from snide to shock as he watched Kal changed his gait, standing taller. Looking at Kal's feet the old dress shoes turned into raised sandals with a thick soul with cloth wrapping going up his shin to his leg which they could see slimmed considerably from a haggard stick of muscle to a shapely leg with creamy skin. The plaid green pants changed as well into a skirt with a diamond pattern of vibrant colors as it hung just bellow her thigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Kal's suit jacket shrinks and contorts into a folded cloth midriff revealing a slim and slightly tone hip bone of a woman. Before they were obscured by lithe womanly arms clad in large gold bangles folding under her perky chest. Looking up Kal's body turned to a woman with sparkling blue eyes, complimented by beautifully long eyelashes standing out from her thick silk like hair framing her face like a hood of rich vibrance heralded by a large gold circlet with a brilliant sapphire jewel in the center with matching earrings dangling from her ears with modest chains holding intricate clusters of beautiful gems in a reverse tear drop pattern with a gold boarder. \"I figured a cop would have a more discerning eye than that, Johnny.\" Kal remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Johnny simply stared back at Kal's new body. Kal enjoying Johnny's awestruck before laughing to try and snap him out of it \"Come on smart guy. Let's hear it?\" Kal asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally coming to Johnny shook his head \"C-Can I touch you?\" Johnny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal laughed \"Sure you can handle it?\" Kal put her arms behind her head putting her chest forward \"You look ready to blow just by looking at me. I bet you'd love to have a girl like me in your life huh, officer?\" Kal snidely quipped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny coughed with a blush over his face looking for words while Kal give a more good natured laughed \"I guess I'm playing dirty. Let's put on something a little more... friendly.\" Kal's midriff expanded with two cute puffy shoulders which joined by a simple gold necklace, her shirt however still kept a good amount of her hips visible and her skirt started to grow and poof out until it hung just over her ankles with a sparkly bow tied around the back \"How bout we dance?\" She asked innocently while her beautiful dress swayed from her shyly swing from side to side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your earrings.\" Johnny squeaked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal smiled \"It's a start.\" She said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old man appeared on a deserted street a few miles away from town. Laying in front of him was a sixteen year old body names Kevin Marcos. The old man had been watching Kevin for the past few months, and was very interested in the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was only sixteen, Kevin had an interesting understanding about life. He realized that humans were not the most important beings in the universe and that there were higher powers out there. He also had a firm belief in the paranormal. He believed in ghosts, spirits and demons. His friends considered him paranoid about it, but the old man liked how he stood by his beliefs. The kid even fantasized about what it was like to be a demon, and the old man had thought he would make an excellent one. Now he had the chance to see if he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kevin.\" The old man said, looking down at the bloody boy on the street. A few hours ago, he was living life just like everyone else, but now he was left out in the street to die. Some kids from his school were out driving drunk, and had hit him while he was on the way home from a friends house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you...\" Kevin said softly, saving what little energy he had left. Kevin had already seen the old man several times. He had come to Kevin in dreams to tell him of demons. It was the old man's way of repaying Kevin's belief. The old man always had a soft spot in his 'heart' for those who believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's me. Do you want to die, Kevin?\" The old man asked. Kevin looked up, and with great conviction managed to utter a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The old man smiled. Kevin was a boy who refused to face death even in the end. He would gladly accept the fate the old man had in mind for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I told you that you will never die. Your body will die, but I can save your soul. You will live the same existence as me and a few others. The existence of a demon. You will be able to possess others bodies to interact with the world, take revenge on those who wronged you, and be able to see your loved ones again. but there is a price. You will have to feed on human souls.\" The old man said. Kevin had read up on demons so he knew everything else. Surprisingly, a lot of what Kevin knew was very accurate. Kevin's father was possessed by a demon when he was first conceived, so Kevin allready had it in his blood. He may even have powers that rivaled Jonny's. That would help the old man greatly. \"By the way, most demons can only stay in a host body for a day, but with your heritage, you will be able to use your host bodies indefinitely. You can stay as long as you like without burning up. Now do you accept the deal you make by becoming my demon? Will you spread chaos throughout the world without hesitation?\" The old man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept. Let me live.\" Kevin said firmly. The old man placed his wrinkled hand on Kevin's head, and pulled his souls from his body. However, rather than eating it, the old man transformed it into something more than a normal soul. He gave his own energy. The soul glowed brightly as it became a demon. Normally the process would take decades, but with Kevin's heritage, it was nearly instantaneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's new form glowed for a few minutes before dimming. He smiled at the old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He said. The old man nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me your life. You will serve me now.\" The old man said. Kevin simply smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my master.\" Kevin said. The old man didn't even need to control him. The boy genuinely wanted to serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are more demons than just you in this town. Join them if you wish, but I don't care. Do whatever you want. Remember, you're body is dead now. The funeral will be in a few days if you're interested.\" The old man said, fading away. Kevin remained where he was and stared down at his former body. It was time for a new start. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin hovered above his dead body, mumbling a quick farewell to his old life before taking off and flying away. He enjoyed the feeling of being able to fly, and the freedom that came from no longer having a body. For his entire life, Kevin had been trapped by his parents, and friends in a cage he didn't even know he was in until he was a demon. Now he was free to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed he suddenly had a drive to cause chaos, but didn't think much of it. It was probably just a cost of being a demon. It was a cost he would gladly pay. The entire world had turned on him in his last few days. Kevin's parents were mad at him about his grades, and his friends were all turning on him after a brief accident involving some spray paint and a house a few nights ago. No one liked Kevin anymore, and Kevin sure as hell didn't like anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person he honestly missed was Kaylee. He never got the chance to ask her out before dying. Kaylee Cooper was one of Kevin's friends before the accident. They had known each other since middle school and had instantly developed a fast friendship. they both liked anime, the paranormal, and most importantly, each other.  As their friendship went on, they began to spread apart. Kaylee got into girlier things, like cheer leading, and boyfriends, while Kevin stayed as he was. A nerd into ghost movies. It had gotten to the point that they didn't even talk anymore and it was driving Kevin crazy. Especially since Kaylee had become one of the hottest girls in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin had finally worked up the courage to talk to her again, and was heading over to her place to ask her out, when he got hit by that car. Kevin was always unlucky, but that was just bad. If only he had left Matt's place a little earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin flew outside of Kaylee's house and hovered outside her window. He looked inside and saw Kaylee talking on the phone with a friend of hers. She looked happy, without a care in the world. Kevin phased himself through her window so he could hear her voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, right?\" She asked, talking to her friend on her pink cell phone. Her room had changed a lot since Kevin was there in eighth grade. The black anime posters were replaced with boy bands, and all of her ghost movies were romance now. Kaylee looked different too. Instead of her cute glasses, she now had contact lenses. Her golden blonde hair was long and flowing rather than a pony tail, and she no longer had a problem about showing off her body. Right now she was dressed in her cheer leading uniform, a tight blue tank top, a and white skirt that just barely covered her great ass. Kevin wished more than anything that he could ask her out, and be close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd never date that guy. Kevin's just not my type.\" She said, the mention of his name, grabbing Kevin's attention. Was it just him, or was there a hint of disgust when she mentioned his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a creep,\" she continued, oblivious to Kevin being right next to her. \"I knew him back in middle school. He was always watching anime and talking about ghosts...I know. Like I said, he's a total creep. I can't believe I ever liked him either, heck I can't believe I ever talked to the guy...Yeah, he definitely should be in a nut house..\" Kaylee said. Kevin felt a rage growing in his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she say something like that about him? After knowing each other for so long? Kevin was angry. Angry at his family for not believing in him, angry and his friends for abandoning him, and angry at Kaylee, for betraying him. He loved her more than anything and that's how she repays him?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stared at her, a rage in his eyes he had never shown anyone before. He wanted Kaylee to suffer for what she had said. He wanted her to feel the pain she had just caused him. He wanted her to be miserable. He wanted her ruined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked at her great body and thought. He was a demon now...He could take over bodies. He could use Kaylee's body and ruin her reputation forever. Hee'd be able to make her feel like he felt. And once he was finished with her body, he would leave it and let her take the fallout. Maybe he'd even come back and take her soul afterwards, making her body his eternal slave. Kevin definitely liked the idea of that. </span></div></div>",

He wanted her to know that it was her that was the cause of this and that she was the one responsible. Plus he wanted to get inside of her sexy body. Kevin had always wanted to get close to Kaylee and like this he could be closer to her than ever. He could actually be her. And once he had her body he would destroy her reputation. He'd make her feel like he'd felt and then he'd eat her delicious soul and keep her around as his slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he were a normal demon, he'd only be able to use her body for about a day, but the old man said he could possess people indefinitely, which meant he could take as long as he wanted to make her sorry. Kevin stood right in front of Kaylee, who was still talking on the phone without a care in the world. He didn't want to simply possess her and have her wake up ruined. He wanted her to know exactly what was happening and exactly why it was happening. Kevin knew from research that demons weren't spirits. Some could become at least somewhat physical and have contact with the physical world. Maybe he'd be able to have some fun with that first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin concentrated on making his hand physical. He didn't make it visibly, but he made it so he could at least touch something. He found the end button on her cell phone and quickly pressed it, ending her call. Kaylee looked surprised, and looked around her room for a few seconds, obviously not seeing Kevin. Kevin grabbed the phone from her hand and threw it onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee looked horrified. She had no idea what was happening and Kevin loved it. It was like a real life ghost movie. He was the ghost and she was the innocent victim. Before he possessed Kaylee's body he wanted to scare her, and he wanted to have fun with it. He wanted her to know who was doing this to her so she knew what she had done wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his hand, and placed it on Kaylee's shoulder. She let out a scream and jerked back in her bed, not sure what had happened. Kevin took his hand again and this time grabbed on of her large breasts and squeezed it. She screamed even louder that time and Kevin just laughed. He didn't think he'd be getting this much of a rush out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to touch her again, the door opened and Kaylee's sister Alexa walked in. Alexa was a tall brunette with just as good a figure as Kaylee. She was even considered hotter than Kaylee by most people. She was 21 years old and a model. Kevin had always thought she was incredibly hot, but he never liked her as much as he liked Kaylee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Alexa said sounding worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh...I...I think there's something in here...\" Kaylee said, freaking out. Kevin just laughed again. Alexa looked at her oddly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're alright? Did you have anything to drink earlier?\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,,,I...I'm fine..,.But I think there's something in here....\"\" Kaylee said, just sounding like someone going crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaylee, what are you talking about? Mom and dad had me watch you while they're gone but I can't help you if I don't know what you're talking about.\" Alexa said, staying calm. Kevin could see in her eyes that she was worrying for her sister's sanity. This was fantastic...</span></div></div>",

It was not long before Kaylee's ear piercing scream was heard in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What?'', Alexa inched closer, now really worried about the mental state of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A... ghost... I saw a ghost... be-be-behind you...'', Kaylee's voice trailed off, before she realized that the ghost was grinning maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Alexa's body shook and convulsed wildly, as she fell flat on the bed she began to make noises just like in one of the last horror movie that Kevin used to watch with Kaylee just before they began to drift apart. Kaylee felt powerless, she was frozen in shock and horror, never she thought that the scenes from a horror movie would unfold before her eyes. Kaylee grew wide eyed as her sister suddenly sat upright again and began to laugh like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No... no..'', Kaylee inched backwards, ''Don't joke around sis...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possessed Alexa continued to laugh manianically before her hands gripped Kaylee's shoulder tightly.

As they kissed, he took Alexa's hands and started to feel up her boobs. Oh yeah...that felt nice... Kevin didn't want to involve Alexa so much though. He wanted to ruin Kaylee's life, but he didn't want to involve someone he didn't even know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt up Alexa's body and brought her into her room. He could read Alexa's memories, so he knew which one was hers. He laid Alexa on her bed and closed her eyes. Once he left her body, Alexa should stay unconscious for several minutes. . That should give him some time to get to know Kaylee's body personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself fly out of Alexa's body and floated back into Kaylee's room. Kaylee was awake now and looking around the room, terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexa? Where are you?\" She asked, confused and scared. Kevin was getting a huge turn on seeing her so scared. It would make finally possessing her so much sweeter. Still, Keving wanted to have fun before claiming Kaylee's beautiful body. He concentrated on making his voice audible and knelt down directly in front of Kaylee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaylee...\" He said, his voice filled with desire. Kaylee screamed again and tried to figure out where the voice was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...who are you?\" Kaylee asked. Kevin made his hand physical and began massaging Kaylee's breasts. Kaylee screamed again. \"Please...please stop this...\" Kaylee said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Kevin asked, making sure Kaylee's felt his warm breath on her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...Who...who are you?\" Kaylee asked again. Kevin laughed, loud enough for Kaylee to hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't know who I am? It's me Kaylee...\" Kevin said. Kaylee's eyes went wide from the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K...Kevin?\" She asked, tears forming in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...When everyone turned against me, I thought I still had you. But you're just like every one else...You thing I'm worthless. Well who's worthless now?\" Kevin asked, putting his hand on Kaylee's shoulder and holding it firmly. Kaylee started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaylee, I want you to know exactly what I'm going to do to pay you back...I'm going to take over your body, and I'm going to use it to humiliate you until I say you've paid enough for what you did. Then I'm going to eat your souls and make your body into my eternal slave.\" Kevin said. Kaylee shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...Please, we used to be friends...Please don't do this to me Kevin...\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have thought about that before you said all those things about me...\" Kevin said. While he was alive he might of forgiven her, but as a demon he had no pity...All he had was a strong desire for her body and a hunger for souls that he had to satisfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin began phasing himself inside of Kaylee's body. She started to scream as he forced his way through her skin. Kaylee's body began to shake and spasm as the two souls inside fought for control, but Kaylee was already disoriented. Her body continued to shake until eventually everything stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few quiet seconds, her eyes opened and Kaylee stood up. Her eye's glowed a bright red briefly before dimming down and returning to their original color. She briefly felt up her body's luscious curves and walked towards her full body mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I promise I'll take great care of your body. It'll be nice living here for awhile...\"Kevin said with his sexy new voice as he struck a sexy pose in Kaylee's mirror. He was in control now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted her to know what her body would be doing while he was in control. He wondered if he would be able to communicate with Kaylee's powerless mind. Her reaction to all this would certainly be funny, but then again she seemed like the kind of girl to bitch about this non stop. Kevin decided not to take his chances. Maybe a little later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin struck some more poses in Kaylee's mirror when he noticed a strange feeling. He felt hungry. It was odd, though. Kevin didn't feel the hunger coming from Kaylee's stomach, he felt it coming from his soul. He suddenly felt an overwhelming need to satisfy the hunger. He needed to find a soul fast. Kevin smiled to himself. It was his lucky say. there was only one other person in Kaylee's house, and he'd be able to eat up her soul without anyone noticing. He'd even be able to get his own personal slave out of the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin walked out of Kaylee's room and knocked on Alexa's door. He remembered Kaylee always knocking first because Alexa used to be the type to get mad easily if Kaylee went into her room without permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" Alexa asked, opening the door. She had already recovered from her brief possession and it looked like she didn't remember anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say I was sorry for scaring you before. It was a bad joke.\" Kevin said, making Kaylee's voice sound sad and remorseful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I was more worried about you than anything else. Don't scare me like that again...\" Alexa said, putting her hands on her hips and looking at 'Kaylee'. Kevin smiled and looked up at Alexa evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sis. I think I'll scare you again.\" 'Kaylee' said putting both her dainty hands on Alexa's shoulder and holding her in place. Alexa stuggled but 'Kaylee's' grip was simply too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what are you doing, Kaylee?\" Alexa asked, getting scared. Kevin continued smiling at Alexa. He concentrated and felt the power of Alexa's soul, being pulled from her body. Kevin moaned as he felt the pleasure of absorbing Alexa's soul. He could feel the massive energy flowing through Kaylee's body and he loved the feeling. As he felt the entire soul be pulled into his body, he removed Kaylee's hands from Alexa's shoulders and saw the dead look in her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my slave now, right Alexa?\" Kevin asked, feeling up Kaylee's boobs again. He just couldn't get enough of Kaylee's body. Now that he was full, he could really get to know her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master.\" Alexa answered unemotionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will serve me unquestionably, no matter what I ask you to do?\" Kevin asked, enjoying the feeling of having complete control over the sexy girl standing in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my master.\" Alexa said nodding. Kevin smiled. This was fantastic. The only question was what to do now...</span></div></div>",

He was already pleased that he was getting his own back on Kaylee by inhabitting her body, though absorbing Alexa's soul had been a completly new sensation altogether. The power he had felt absorbing her lifeforce for substance had been a rush unlike any other. \"The old man definatley gave me a great ability in that!\" Kevin noted with Kaylee's sweet little voice. He took a moment to fondle his hosts boobs once more before he realised Alexa was still standing there, black, emotionless and awaiting a command. Kevin smirked as he eyed up his new slave. Alexa may have been the younger sister, but she had developed just as well as Kaylee. Only a year or so behind her older sister, she sported a natural brunette to her sisters artificial blonde. It was full of volume and added to her sexy character. She was slim, yet curvy where it counted. Her boobs had budded nicely, shaping out into delightful mounds. Kevin reached out Kaylee's dainty hands to grab her sisters tits. Fondling, he noticed the lifeless Alexa wince slightly in pleasure, though she returned to a blank expression once he withdrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Alexa, tell me about yourself\" Kevin commanded his new slave. \"Well, Alexa is 15, only 11 months younger than her sister. She studies at the same school and hangs around with the alternative kids mostly. She loves indie music and is still a virgin\" Alexa replied, still pretty emotionless in her words. A slight trickle of personality was there however. Kevin rounded her in his sexy new body, admiring Alexa from front and back. \"So you'll do anything I want?\" he asked again. \"Yes master\" Alexa replied. Kevin began with a few simple commands first. \"Jump up and down\". Alexa began jumping on the spot. \"Ok stop. Go sit on the bed\". Alexa went to sit at the foot of her bed, still looking up obediently. Kevin decided to try something a little more extreme. \"Slap yourself around the face\". With full force, Alexa raised her right instantly and gave herself a hard smack around the cheek. Kevin laughed hysterically as he couldn't believe it worked. \"This is great!\" he chuckled. He had one more question as he eyed her up. \"You'd kill yourself if I commanded it?\" he asked, delving into the darkest reigons he could think of. \"Yes master\" she replied without hesitation. Kevin sat there wide eyed. He truly had full control of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to Alexa, he began to move close to her, kissing up her neck as he proceeded to make love to her body. Kevin had been denied the sensation of sex in life. What better way to start than making a backstabbing bitch fuck her own sister. The two sisters began to go at it, tongue invading each others mouths before the shed each other of their clothers. Kevin began to get a sinister idea as Alexa began sucking on his new tits. \"Give me your phone\" he ordered the slave. She obleiged, pulling out a small pink mobile. Kevin began to take pictures of the ordeal, getting himself or Alexa to snap away as the pair fucked each other. Kevin loved the sensations Kaylee's body was giving off as Alexa began eating him out. The obediant slave didn't let up as he brung Kaylee's body to orgasm to several times. Next to eating a soul, it was the best sensation he'd ever felt. Laying down next to Alexa in bed after the rampant sex session, Kevin made sure to capture a cute picture of the two girls in bed together, naked. \"Perfect, I can use these if I need them in bringing Kaylee's life down\" he noted, admiring his handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa lay obidiently next to him. Kevin enjoyed the press of her sexy body against his own. He massaged his boobs once more, loving every second of it. Noticing the time on the wall, he saw just over an hour had passed since the sex had begun. Still, the night hadn't ended yet. Kevin could go out and use his new host to commit more chaos. Maybe he could find the bastards who ran him over. Still, maybe it would be best to wait until the morning and start bringing Kaylee down at school. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The new Kaylee smiles as she got herself out of bed. \"There's really no need to wait until morning for my fun to continue...It's not like I have rules as a demon\" she said with a smile, leaving her clothes on the floor in Alexa's room. Somehow she knew that her sleeping slave would be more than happy to put them back where they belonged once she awoke. Once Kaylee got back to her room, she looked at herself in the mirror, still naked from the sex with her sister-slave. She could never deny that her body was beautiful. In fact, she was gorgeous. Part of Kevin felt bad for doing this to her, but that part was soon quieted by the memories of what she had said about him. Now that he had Kaylee's memories, he could tell that she meant every word. The more she grew out of her 'nerd phase,' the more she thought of Kevin as weird and crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm soooo sorry you think that about me Kaylee\" she said to her reflection as she groped her breasts once again, squeezing them. \"Maybe if you had given me a little bit of respect, I wouldn't currently own your sexy body\" he says as he moves his hand to Kaylee's nude pussy. She takes a finger and gently pushes it in, moaning in the pleasure it brings to her. \"Ohhh....you feel sooo good.....I just love being you sooo much...\" she says as her phone gets a text message. She had heard the phone going off as she was having her fun with the younger sister but didn't think much of it. She sighed, taking her finger out and licking it, still looking at the mirror with a seductive look on her face. \"There's always next time....\" she says, winking at the reflection as she checks the phone. There were several texts from a guy named Will, who was Kaylee's current love interest according to her memories. The two of them had apparently hooked up at a party a few weeks ago and had been seeing eachother casually ever since. Kaylee wanted to get into a more serious relationship with him, but  part of her was worried since it sometimes seemed like all he wanted to do was get in her pants. The naked cheerleader read the texts from him and smiled. It seemed that he was involved in a little hit and run incident earlier where he and a friend had been drinking and hit a kid from school. He thought he killed the guy but didn't stay long enough to check. It seemed like he was very upset and wanted desperately to talk to Kaylee. Well, the new Kaylee would be happy to oblige. Especially if it meant revenge on the guy who ran Kevin over, PLUS a little extra torture to Kaylee. She dialed his number and waited for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyyyyy there sexy\" 'Kaylee' said with a grinn once she got an answer. \"I got your texts. Don't you worry about a thing..... I just got a text from the guy you hit. He's totally fine. Now why don't you come over and take me out somewhere. I'm bored...of course I'm feeling okay, why wouldn't I be....okay, see you soon honey...\" she smirked as she hung up the phone and then went over to her closet. She took out a black pair of panties and slid them on over her crotch, smiling at the feeling it gave her. Then she took out a matching black bra and used Kaylee's memories to put it on perfectly. Finally she looked for clothing and decided on a black tube top that revealed quite a lot of her cleavage and right black shorts that was just barely long enough to keep her ass covered. After putting on black high heeled boots and a leather jacket, her look was complete. She smiled at her reflection in the mirror as she struck a sexy pose. \"Mmm, I can really get used to having your body Kaylee\" you say as you hear a car pulling up in the driveway. You grin as you leave your house and get in Will's car. \"Hey there sexy\" you say to him. As he's about to react you pull him into a deep kiss and suck out his soul, devouring it and being filled with a wonderful sense of pleasure. You moan gently from the feeling as his soul feeds your energy. Once you pull away, you see that his eyes have the same look that Alexa had. \"Mmmm, now then Will, you're going to answer some questions for me, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. But don't call me mistress. Just because I'm wearing a girl's body doesn't mean I actually am one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, Master\" he says \"What would you like to know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was anyone with you when you ran over that person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was with my girlfriend, Amelia\" he says. Kaylee grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why on earth did I not know about Amelia?\" she asks with a naughty look. \"Were you cheating on little Kaylee here, Will?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. \"Yes, I was. I had been all along\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Now listen to me closely, Will. You're going to go offer this Amelia bitch a date. Be very insistent that she goes with you. You're going to drive her to that mountainside that all the couples go to. When you're there, you're going to break up with her. Be very very mean. Break her heart completely. Then you're going to put the car into drive, and drive both of you off that cliff. You'll do that for me, won't you Will?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master\" he says. Kaylee smiles, kissing his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do it. Right now\" she says, leaving the car and waving goodbye. She grins as she watches the car drive away, thinking about how she finally got revenge. \"Hmmm....whatever shall I do now?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The house was old and large. It must have been around for at least 100 years, but could have easily been around for longer than that. It was the biggest house in the area, but was also one of the most rundown. It's windows were smashed, and the paint was peeling off of it. All of the metal was rusty and all of the doors seemed to be stuck shut, impossible to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that all of the windows were smashed, no one ever tried to break into the house due to its reputation for being haunted, or at the very least, looking the part. The house really did look like the typical haunted house, and so people usually avoided it when they could. Most people did at least. Because it was avoided by most people in the nearby towns, the house attracted the types of people that were not exactly smiled upon in everyday society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrug dealers and addicts used the lawns for deals, though they usually did not enjoy hanging around for more than they had to. It was the perfect place for expensive deals that both parties wanted to end as fast as they could. Jake Masters was one of the top dealers in town, a wealthy man who made sure to be careful in all that he did to prevent being caught by the law. He was a deeply religious man that believed he had the power of G-d on his side, watching over him and making sure that no harm would befall him as he made his deals in the land surrounding the unholy house. Because of his religiosity, he had a strict code and would not make deals that would anger the community too much. As a result, most cops left him alone most of the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, cops were almost always patrolling the area, making sure that everything was alright and that nothing too bad was going down. Even they found the house to be unbearably eerie, so most deals were ignored unless there was a very good reason that they should be stopped. Tonight, Officer Brenda Nelson was on patrol, looking around for possible drug busts. She was one of the only cops in the whole district that refused to let rumors of haunting bother her, though that may just have been because she was an out-of-towner who was transferred to this district only a month ago. Whenever she would insist on being on duty at the house, her partner would claim stomach illness and wait for her in the car for the night, refusing to leave until she was ready to head back to the station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh end prostitutes also enjoyed having territory outside of the house. The citizens who wanted to have their tastes satisfied by the most beautiful women in the area knew that all they had to do was suck up their fear and explore the areas around the house. Prostitution was such a common vice in the area that the cops tended to leave them alone. Maddison Mason was the best of the best, and she was always close to the house, making people really suck in their fear to get to her. She was Jake Masters' on and off girlfriend and as a result, she would spend a lot of her less busy nights keeping him company by the front door. Even if they weren't dating, the two of them had a very close bond of friendship, which could be seen as cute if the two weren't so twisted in their own ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, there were more visitors close to the house than just these three individuals. Stephanie Jacobs was a college student studying Parapsychology (the scientific study of psychic phenomena). Like Officer Nelson, she was new to the area and so she did not know any of the stories surrounding this house. Stephanie made a bet with one of her classmates that she would come to the house and perform a seance to try to contact whatever spirits supposedly possessed the house. As proof that she actually went to the house, she had brought along a classmate, Simon Rogers. Simon was a quiet kid who had a huge crush on Stephanie so he came along with her to videotape everything. Currently he was holding his camera to Stephanie as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I made you guys this bet and I'm gonna win it. As you can see, I'm at the house\" she said, motioning to the door behind her. In on corner, in the distance, Bobby and Maddison were watching the two with curiosity and amusement. It was a slow night for both of them, so they were just hanging out. On the opposite side, Officer Nelson also noticed what was happening, but did not know what to think of it. She debated approaching the kids or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the house was cold and empty, as well as covered in dust. It looked like no one had been inside of the house in decades, and that was accurate. Suddenly, a man appeared int he center of the main room of the house. he smiled as his eyes glowed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wake up</i>\" the man said with glowing eyes as suddenly every light in the house turned on and flickered. For the past few decades there truly was nothing to fear about the house, but that had just changed. Demons had been lying dormant inside of this house for centuries. And these were not just any demons, but incredibly powerful demons, which were more evil than anything that the world had ever seen. They now possessed the house, but soon they would want bodies of their own, and luckily for them, there were several warm bodies right outside, just waiting to come in and become their playthings. The Old Man felt the house's confusion and explained the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been asleep for centuries, resting up and charging your power. Now you are ready to be released into the world to do my bidding. For now, you possess and control this house, but that does not have to be for long. Do what you deem is appropriate. I will trust your judgments\" said the Old Man, before blinking out from existence as fast as he had appeared, leaving the house to do as it wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nStephanie spoke loudly into the camera, \"Alright, you assholes. I've tried opening this door twice already and the thing won't budge. If it doesn't open after one more try, I'm leaving and you owe me the money since I even tried\" she said as she placed her hand on the rusty door handle once more. Suddenly, the lights inside of the house flicker on and the door opens easily. Everyone watches in surprise, unsure what to do. This had never happened before. Stephanie gulped and motioned to Simon. It was time to go inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before anyone fully had time to make a decision on what to do, the Old Man walked out of the house, smiling as he looked around, knowing everyone who was in the immediate area. He smiled, eyes glowing red as shadowy black tentacles grew out of his body and shot towards everyone that he felt giving off signs of light. The tentacles quickly shot towards the people in the area, and embedded themselves into their chests. The people's eyes all glowed red while their bodies became stiff, as the old man assumed control of each and every one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my,\" the Old Man said as he saw into their lives, looking into their pasts. \"It seems that we have quite the array of characters this evening. Two college students that have come on a dare, a rich drug dealer and his high end prostitute lover, and two police officers on patrol. I believe my demons will be happy with this selection....enter the house and await your fate\" he says as the controlled humans do as is said. The two cops get out of their patrol car and walked through the door, followed by Jake Masters and Madison Mason. The two college students had been the first to enter since they were the closest to the door anyway. The Old Man directed the people into various different rooms within the house before removing his tentacles from them and causing them to fall to the floor unconscious. The Old Man grinned as his snapped his fingers. The front door slammed itself shut and the entire house became encased in black flames. No doors or windows of the house would be able to be used as an escape. The now empty patrol car became engulfed in the same flames and disintegrated into a pile of ashes, leaving behind no evidence of anyone being in the area. To anyone new who happened to be walking around the area, the house would appear as it normally did. With his work done, the Old Man disappeared in a puff of black smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie Jacobs woke up with a pain in her head. The last thing that she remembered, she had dragged Simon to that scary house so they could perform that seance and win the bet she had stupidly made while she was drunk at that party. Steph knew that she never should have had those extra shots, but she took them anyway to prove that she could handle it, which was again a stupid idea. She made a mental note not to drink that much ever again. She made realllllllly shitty decisions when she was drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph looked around with a frown. She just realized that this wasn't her room. She didn't quite know where she was. Steph sat up and looked around the room. Everything was old and covered in dust, but looked intact. There was an eerie chill in the room, but Stephanie chalked that up to being from the open window in the corner. She got out of bed and walked over to the window....now that she was closer, she saw that it wasn't open at all. She looked outside, but could see nothing but darkness. \"Well, shit. Look what you've gotten yourself into now, Stephanie...\" she said to herself before hearing the door behind her creaking open. Stephanie jumped and turned around quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon Rogers walked into the room, holding his camera and pointing it right at Stephanie. \"Aaaaaan Steph is alive, ladies and gentlemen!\" he exclaimed, speaking loud enough for the camera to pick up what he was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie just looked at Simon confused. \"Simon, what happened? The last thing I remember, we were outside of the house, just about to walk in. did I pass out or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon frowned. \"Yeah, you did. So did all of us. We've all been waking up in different rooms and trying to find eachother....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? what are you talking about?\" Steph asked confused. \"And why are you still filming this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shrugged his shoulders. \"I've tried as much as I could, but the camera won't turn off, so I figured I may as well keep recording. I was one of the first to wake up so I looked around and found some other people unconscious in other rooms. We pieced together that there should be six of us here. C'mon, I'll introduce you to the others!\" Simon said, leading Stephanie downstairs to the main entrance of the house. Sure enough, there were other people gathered in the house. \"Hey everyone! I found Stephanie!\" he said, running down the stairs, pulling Steph with him by the hand. He pointed the camera in front of one of the people, a tall guy with blond hair and a leather jacket. \"That's Jake. He's a drug dealer, but a really chill guy\" he said as he moved the camera to the young read headed woman standing next to Jake. She was wearing a tight scarlet dress that couldn't contain her large breasts entirely was just barely long enough to cover her ass. \"that's Madison. She's Jake's...girlfriend....I think?\" he said, clearly unsure. Both of them looked to be in their late 20s. Finally, Simon moved the camera to a black haired woman in her mid 40s who was wearing a police uniform. \"Lastly, this is Officer Brenda Nelson. Her partner has been missing since we woke up, but we think that he's in here with us. So there you go, six different people, all trapped in this house. None of the doors or windows are opening, so we've been getting to know each other and looking around\" Simon said, finally shutting himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looked around at these people, most of whom she had never even seen until now. Having lived int he area for the past little while, she had heard stories about Jake Masters and his drug trade. Supposedly he was known for being a trustworthy guy that would never give anything in life threatening quantities and stayed away from children or anyone who would be too easily addicted. She didn't know how much she believed about that, but there were certainly les drug dealers to be stuck with. As for the girl with him, Steph could tell that she was almost definitely a prostitute. Still, she wouldn't judge. People had the right to do what they wanted with their bodies and this woman was no exception. Other than them, the police officer seemed trustworthy enough. Stephanie had never really had any reason to interact with the police since she was generally a law abiding citizen, but she had a respect for anyone in uniform and knowing that an armed cop was here with her made her feel safe. \"So, we're all stuck here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nodded. \"Yeah, that's what it seems like. We're assuming that Officer Nelson's partner will wake up any minute now and come to join us. Once we're all together, we'll figure out a way of getting out of here, but so far nothing seems to be working.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon finished up his statement, the police officer piped in. \"Simon is correct. We should wait for Nick, my partner, to find us before trying to find any way to escape, no matter how unlikely that escape is. We should try to stay together until then and maybe try to get to know each other a bit.\" She looked in the direction of Jake and Madison. \"I already know why those two are here, but what brought you two kids?\" she asked in Stephanie and Simon's general direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon opened his mouth to answer her question, but Stephanie beat him to it. \"It's really stupid, but we actually came here because of a dare. I'm a parapsychology major so we were dared to come here and videotape me doing a seance. We wanted to just get it over with and leave, but I guess we can;t exactly do that now\" Steph said, looking out the nearest window, which was behind officer Nelson and seeing nothing but a sea of darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Nelson chuckled a bit. \"A seance? Like summoning a demon or something?\" she asked in a bit of disbelief. Steph nodded in response. \"Well, why don't we do it now? We'll be waiting for Nick to wake up and find us anyway, and that video camera isnt turning off if I remember correctly, so why don't we do it? That way we have something to do to pass the time, and you two can win your bet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison moved closer to Jake, who wrapped his arm around her waste. \"I don't know about that\" she said, putting her head on Jake's shoulders. \"that sounds scary.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake tightened his grip on her and smiled. \"I don't see the harm. It'll be a nice little ice breaker and a way to kill some time. I'll make sure we're safe from any demons\" he said, flexing the muscles on his free arm and smiling in a cocky sort of way. Everyone laughed at that. No one in the room actually considered the fact that demons were real or the cause of their strange predicament. Though maybe that was just the effect of the house they were all in. The four younger people started moving to the center of the room while Officer Nelson stayed behind and looked outside into the darkness. She wanted to be outside of this forsaken house sooooooo badly, but she'd have to wait patiently for awhile first. Officer Nelson looked at her reflection in the glass window and remembered what had happened to her only a few hours ago, when she had woken up in this house.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three hours ago, Brenda Nelson was being shaken awoke. \"Brenda! You have to wake up! I knew we shouldn't have come to this house!\" Nick Trask yelled as Brenda opened her eyes. She held her head as she sat up and noticed Nick moving away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nick? What happened?\" she asked, looking around and seeing that they were in what appeared to be a wine cellar. the wooden walls were moist and they were surrounded by bottles of wine. Brenda took one step and accidentally knocked a bottle onto the floor, shattering it loudly. Nick flinched from the noise and looked at the bottle in fear. Brenda giggled a little. Nick was always a scared cat. One would think that a 37 year old police officer would know how to handle himself in any situation, but the guy was even too scared to patrol near a house, a concept that Brenda was never quite able to wrap around her head. Brenda herself was 45 years old, and being the good looking cougar that she was, most of her partners were already nervous with her. This wasn't helping things. \"Nick, answer the question. What happened?\" BRensa asked, regaining her senses slowly but surely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed as he began talking. \"I...I really don't know. We were sitting in the car, I was telling you how much I wanted to get out of here....next thing I knew I woke up in this room and you were asleep. I went over to wake you up...\" he said, sounding terrified. He looked around the room in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, just relax...there's nothing to be scared of. We'll figure out what happened\" she said with a reassuring smile as she looked around the room as well. There was a staircase that lead to a door out of the room. Brenda smiled as she walked towards it. \"Nick, I think I just found us a way into the main part of the house!\" she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have something you should see first\" Nick said from behind her. Brenda turned around to face her partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Nick?\" she asked curiously, walking towards her partner, who's body was shrouded int he shadows. Suddenly, Nick moved forward, using his strength to push Brenda against the wall and hold her there by the neck. His eyes glowed blood red. \"Just wanted you to see the stolen face of the one who's going to be riding in that sexy body from now on\" he said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda struggled to try to pull herself free, but it was as if Nick had some sort of extra strength in him. \"Wh...wha...t...ar...ee.....you...talkin...g about?\" she asked, through struggling breathes as Nick moved his face closer to hers. His glowing red eyes were right in front of hers. His mouth was almost touching against her full lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, when I first found the two of you down here, all set up, I really, and I mean REALLY, wanted to jump on into that sexy form of yours. But I'm a bit new to this whole demonic thingy so I accidentally hopped into little Nicky's body instead. I don't wanna take another risk, so I'm going to make sure I don't mess this up...officer...\" the man who wasn't Nick said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda tried to question what he was talking about, but couldn't get any words out of her mouth before Nick's mouth was pushed against hers. Brenda felt something force its way down her throat before her vision went black. Nick's body collapsed onto the ground as Brenda breathed deeply, in and out, feeling the heavy rise and fall of her breasts. Her eyes glowed blood red and a smile formed on her face as she felt her body up all over. \"Mmmm, well this is nice....My name is Officer Brenda Nelson now. Ironically, I'm a cop, but if I'm going to be in the body of one of you law enforcing dogs, I may as well be in the cougar and not, the scared puppy. Now what to do about you....\" the possessed Brenda said as the glowing in her eyes faded away. She noticed Nick's body starting to stir so she bent down and took the shattered sine bottle from the floor. she quickly and forcefully stabbed it into Nick Trask's back, killing her partner without a second thought. As his body stopped moving, Brenda began feeling herself up once again, grinning evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, the supposed Officer Nelson was pulled out of her flashback thanks to one of the kids calling to her. \"Hey, Officer Nelson! Are you going to be joining us here or not?\" She saw that the other four were already sitting on the floor in a circle, holding hands. the video camera that one of them....Simon?...kept holding was recording everything from the staircase, looking down on them at an awkward angle, but it was the best they could do. She smiled and started her walk towards the other. The demon that was now wearing the officer's sexy body knew that he would be in for quite a show from this. Even though he was inside of this human meat suit, he could hear the conversation of the others. Boy did they have something fun planned for these kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm coming over!\" she said, sitting down and putting out her hands to the people on either side. \"And you all can just call me Brenda....that's my name after all.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five trapped people were sitting in the center of the room in the shape of a circle. Their legs were crossed and their hands were held together, forming a connection between them all. Steph would be leading the seance, so she sat as in the middle as possible. Directly across from her was Brenda Nelson, or at least the possessed body of Brenda Nelson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon got up suddenly and looked over at his camera, which was still recording, though at a very awkward angle. \"You can do the seance with four people, right Stephanie?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph nodded. \"Call me Steph, I hate being called Stephanie.....But yeah, that should be fine. Why? Are you too scared?\" She asked jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon frowned. \"Well....I am a bit scared but I also want to film from outside of the circle. That way we can get it in better quality so no one back at school can tell us we didn't actually do it\" he said, taking his camera from the stairs and holding it towards the now four people who fixed up their positioning a bit to make due without the fifth person. Steph was now sitting across from Brenda, and between them on either side was Madison and Jake. Simon walked around them, giving the camera a 360 degree look so that no one could question anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get this thing started already?\" Jake asked, one of his hands interlocked with Brenda and the other one with Steph. \"Don't get me wrong, I love these things as much as the next guy, but as soon as your done getting credit for this stupid dare, I want to find that other pig...ooops, I mean cop, and get the hell out of this house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison giggled. \"Wow Jakey, I didn't think you were the type to be so scared\" she said, sticking her tongue out as she gave the two other women her hands. \"Besides, this circle is one guy and three beautiful woman. Why do you want it to end so fast, huh?\" she asked teasingly. Jake just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really should start soon though\" Brenda said, holding onto Jake and Madison's hands tightly. \"The sooner we find out where Nick is, the sooner we can actually work out a plan to escape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph took a deep breath. \"Alright, let's do this then\" she said, closing her eyes. Everyone else did the same besides for Simon, who just kept recording. He noticed that the camera didn't seem to lose any charge, despite not being able to turn off or stop recording for the past few hours. That was weird, but he didn't think much of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon knew he should be scared from this whole experience, being stuck in a house that was known for being haunted and having nothing outside but pure darkness. He also knew that having a seance in said haunted house was nowhere near a smart idea, yet it was as if something was preventing his brain from registering that. He had no idea that this same effect was happening with everyone else as well. It was as if their rational thoughts had been shut off, allowing them to fall right into what the house wanted of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon wearing the skin of Brenda Nelson, knew that this was happening with the other visitors and just grinned. The Old Man was still inside of this house somewhere and still had a minor enough hold on these young people to prevent them from making the proper logical decisions. He was making everything very easy for Brenda's siblings to strike. They could have made their move at any time, but the apparent Brenda knew that they wanted to be a bit more flashy with it. She would be happy to assist them in their fun. \"Go on\" the supposed cop said to Steph with a smile. \"I believe in you. Let's begin\" she said, making sure to speak in a reassuring voice in order to give the girl confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph smiled, feeling reassured. \"Okay, let's do this\" she said. \"Everyone close you eyes and concentrate...\" she said, beginning the procedure that she had read about so many times before. Simon watched from the nice corner he had found as Stephanie began leading her breathing exercise, having everyone take deep breathes to channel their energy supposedly. Simon didn't believe in this whole seance thing and he didn't think that Steph believed in it either, but it was definitely an interesting way to pass the time here while waiting for Officer Nelson's partner to come find them. Simon wondered what was taking him so long. He tried to take a step forward to get a different angle, but frowned. for some reason, Simon was unable to move his foot. He tried moving his hands but couldn't do that either. He was like a statue. He tried to call out to the others, but found that he couldn't even move his mouth to speak. This was freaking him out. Simon felt sweat dripping down his face as worry and fear filled him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon could only watch what happened next in absolute horror. Stephanie began reciting the Latin spell that she had learned, but midway through it she started to make a strange noise, as if she were choking on something. Steph had to release the others from the circle as her body began shaking and spasming. Simon thought it might have just been an effect of the lighting, but it looked like her eyes were glowing red as she shook. The others opened their eyes and freaked out, watching stephanie, unsure what to do. Officer Nelson went over to her first and knelt down next to Steph, who was still shaking violently. She placed a hand on Steph's back and seemed to be whispering something into her ear. Simon assumed she was trying to calm Steph down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, the shaking finally stopped and Brenda helped Steph to stand up. Steph ran her hands over herself and a huge smile appeared on her pretty face. \"Are you alright?\" Jake Masters asked, clearly worried. Madison's face also showed concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph smiled at them both, putting her hands on her hips. \"Oh, I'm much more than alright. But that is more than I can say for Stephanie\" she said as her eyes glowed bright red. Madison let out a scream and moved backwards, while Jake held his ground. Steph put a hand on his chest and grinned at him. \"My, aren't you brave? Too bad for you that bravery is something that will get you killed!\" she said as Simon watched her pull some sort of energy out from Jake's chest. The energy flew into her mouth as Steph laughed. \"Mmmm, I haven't eaten in such a long time. That tasted sooooooo nice\" she said with a grin. Jake's body became stiff, standing at attention. \"Why don't you help Brenda restrain your girlfriend?\" she asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Simon's surprise, Jake nodded. \"Of course, mistress\" he said, walking in Madison's direction. The prostitute was already being held in spot by Brenda, but she was trying her best to escape from her holding. Steph, or at least Steph's body, walked over to Madison with an evil grin on her face. She put her hand on Madison's cheek and felt her face over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're very pretty. Of course, the body that I am currently wearing is pretty as well. Even that police officer that is now nothing more than a meat suit is pretty. I really struck gold with you people entering me, didn't I?\" she asked, in Steph's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you...\" Madison said, tears falling from her face as she became restrained completely by the possessed cop and soulless Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie licked her lips before answering. \"I am the demonic embodiment of this house. For all intents and purposes, I am this house. I control everything about it. I can make it look however I want, move rooms at will, and alter and control its occupants in whatever way I see fit. That's why statue boy over there hasn't moved since he started filming\" she said, pointing at Simon. \"It's also why none of you fools realized how idiotic it was to host a fucking seance here instead of freaking out about being trapped. It's also how I can do this\" she said as she snapped her fingers. Suddenly, Madison's dress disappeared and was replaced by an incredibly skimpy maid's outfit. \"Come here, boy\" she said motioning to Jacob. Jacob nodded and moved next to Madison's body. Steph's hand moved to Jake's chest. Her eyes glowed crimson as Jake's empty body shifted and changed, turning into what looked like a cat. It let out a meow and purred as she pet it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed down Madison's cheeks. \"You're a monster...\" she said, causing Steph to let out an evil laugh. \"Monster? Haven't you been listening, you stupid girl? I am a demon! Not just any demon, either. I can control the reality of this house at will, but I can also create my own demons, branching off from my consciousness to move outside of the house and find my more prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she did to me\" Brenda said, as her own eyes glowed red. \"I was created by her to take one of those police meat suits so that I can leave the house and find more people to bring in. It'll be really easy. All I have to do is find an excuse to get someone into my cop car, then I just drive them over here and watch the fun. It's a pretty good gig, I have to admit\" she said with an evil grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Steph looked right at Simon. \"You can come here. Stand next to Ms. Mason\" she said, picking up her newly created cat and petting it. As Simon was forced to walk over, he noticed that Steph's close changed from jeans and a t shirt into an elegant gown. She then looked at Madison. \"By the way, if you're wondering how I know your last name, it's because I can see into the memories of all who enter my domain. Steph took the camera out of Simon's hand and it was soon consumed in black flames. \"Now...what to do with the two of you....\" the possessed Steph said, grinning evilly as her eyes continued to glow brightly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steph's possessed body put her hand on Madison's head. Madion's body became stiff and rigid as her eyes echoed the red glow coming from Steph. \"I already have you wearing a maid's uniform so that is what you shall be, my dear. Forget your past. From now on you only know what I tell you, do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded. \"Yes. I only know what you tell me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph smiled. \"Very good, dear. Your name is Madelyn. You have lived in this house for as long as you can remember. You know all about the demonic entity that runs the show, and you serve me loyally because I have done so much for you in the past. You would never do anything to fight against my will. Your job is to make sure that the house is always spotless and to serve those who are above you. do you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, now Madelyn, nodded. \"Yes mistress. Your wish is my command\" she said with a smile on her face as Brenda released her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. there's a dead body in the wine cellar. Go clean it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, mistress!\" the newly molded maid said, scurrying off to do her duty to the house that she now called home. Steph smiled as she watched the short skirt bouncing as Madelyn ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it so awesome that I can do that?\" she asked, snapping her fingers and allowing Simon to move again. Simon nearly fell to the floor. His body was weak from being stiff for so long. She put the cat that used to be Jake on the floor and let it run off to do it's cat things before she smiled at Simon. \"You know, I really don't quite know what to do with you. I'm full from eating Jake's soul, and Since Brenda here is just an extension of me, it means that she eats when I eat, so we can't just eat your soul. Not to mention, I have a little secret for you\" she said, moving close so her mouth was right next to Simon's ear. \"Steph here had quite the crush on you...that's why you were the one she wanted to keep her company....\" she said, causing Simon to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...she did?\" he asked, standing up as the possessed girl moved away from him, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet she did, kid. She really had the hots for you, but you were too oblivious, and look where that got you...too bad you didn't just see what was in front of you sooner huh?\" she asked. Simon clenched his fists, getting mad. This may be Steph's body talking to him, but the Steph that he knew would never talk like this. This demon-house thing that was possessing Steph's body had to pay for this somehow. \"Oooh, wow, I didn't think you'd have violent thoughts in you, I'm impressed\" she said with a grin as she saw Simon's look of surprise. \"Don't you remember my whole shtick? I'm the house. I can see the thoughts of every human that enters the house. You're already in my power, so just stop fighting and let this happen\" Steph says with a grin, putting her hand on Simon's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph's eyes glowed brightly, but Simon couldn't feel anything happening to his mind. Instead, it was his body that Simon felt changing. He felt his legs becoming shapely and feminine, followed by his arms. Then slowly, his chest started to expand outwards as large breasts grew. Then he felt his crotch shifting and changing, as his body became completely feminine. The hair on his arms, legs and chest disappeared as the hair on his head grew out, becoming long and blond. His face also changed, becoming female. \"Now that the body is done...let's work on that soul of yours\" Steph said as she pulled the soul straight out of Simon's now female body. She held the soul in her hands and grinned as black flames engulfed it. She was not devouring it, but was rather using her flames to burn away its humanity, converting the human soul into that of a demon. \"You know, I had lots of ideas for this, but I think I'm happy with what I now have. You see, the demon thats possessing Brenda is just an extension of me. Because of that, it can only go so far away from the house without being forced back into me and out of its host body. Its also essentially mindless besides for what I tell it. I don't want you to be like that Simon. So I'm making you into a full fledged demon. A servant of chaos that will be able to go as far away from this house as you see fit, steal whatever bodies you want and lure whoever you want back to me. I'm also giving you quite a kinky mind so that you can have all the fun you want, whenever you want it. You'll be a truly seductive demoness, with nothing human about you. In fact, all memories of you ever being a human have been wiped clean. As far as you're concerned, you've only ever been my sister demoness, Alli. You see me as your older sister, and you love me dearly, doing absolutely everything I tell you to. On top of that, you love this house, and will never be gone for long, always bringing me more play things, but not without having your own sexy evil fun. Mmm, I think thats enough for you\" the possessed Steph said, tossing her newly made demon back into the newly made female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body spasmed and shook as the brand new demoness asserted her control. Finally her eyes opened and the blond girl smiled, eyes glowing red. She licked her lips and before even saying a word, kissed Steph's body deeply. \"Mmmmm, thanks for getting me this sexy body, sis. I love it in here\" the newly created Alli said, releasing Stephs body. A short skirt and tube top appeared on the girls sexy body as she grinned at her sister demon. \"Love the clothing choice. Can I go now? I wanna go out into town and have fun. I promise I'll bring you back a snack if you let me goooo\" she pleaded. Steph's possessed body smiled. there was truly nothing good or human left in the body that was once Simon's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Brenda will drive you into town so you can have your fun. Enjoy\" she said with a wink, before turning and walking up the steps. Alli and Brenda left the house, closing the door behind them. Once that happened, Steph's eyes glowed brightly as the entire house began to shift and change. Rather than simply being a rundown house, it slowly became a fully functioning mansion, though everyone in town would still see it as what it originally was. This was going to be fun....</span></div></div>",

The guy seemed nice enough, but there was something buried underneath his grandfather like quality that just gave her the creeps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys sure we should be going into the house?\" Lauren asked. Eric chuckled at her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You scared or something?\" Eric asked, practically laughing. Eric had always been a jerk and Lauren was starting to get really tired of his 'I'm better than you' attitude. Lauren didn't want to admit it, but after looking at the house in front of them, she was getting a little scared. It looked like something right out of a horror movie. It was a tall brick house, covered in ivy with cracked windows. There must have been something in the way the wind blew on the house, but Lauren thought she could hear voices coming from the house. No one else seemed to notice though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be alright sis, we'll just use the phone and leave.\" Cody said, squeezing her hand to let her know it was okay. Aside from his occasional parties, Cody was usually a good guy and genuinely loved his twin sister. The two had been raised together by their aunt and uncle since their parents died in a car accident and they were very close, even if they both had completely different sets of friends. He was trying to act calm, but Lauren could feel his hand shaking slightly. He was just as scared as she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, isn't that cute? The two siblings are holding hands. You know, I hear incest is in this year, and it's not like the two of you can get with anyone else here.\" Kelly said, jokingly, putting her slim arm around Eric's muscular shoulder. Eric wrapped his own arm around her shoulder and smiled at her. It was obvious the two of them had a thing for each other since the beginning of the night. Lauren thought it made complete sense. The bitchiest girl she knew and the cockiest guy ending up together. To say Lauren hated the two of them was an absolute understatement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, slut.\" Lauren said defensively, removing her hand from her brother's. and staring at Kelly angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?\" Kelly asked, getting away from Eric and moving towards Lauren, ready to slap her. Before either of them realized it, the four of them were standing in front of the huge black doors to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop fighting. As soon as the police come for the guy we hit, we can leave this place and get back to our old lives. But Cody, if your sister calls my girl something like that again, I'll beat the shit out of you.\" Eric threatened, putting his arm around Kelly again. The two weren't officially dating yet, but that whole 'my girl' statement made it pretty obvious that the two would be together from them on. Eric took hold of the door handle and pulled it open, a gust of cold air blowing on the college students as the large door creaked open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four walked into the house and marveled at the inside. They were in a large room, with a giant chandelier on the ceiling, which gave the entire house a dim lighting. There were several doors on either side of the hall and two spiraling staircases. The house was covered in cobwebs, as if no one had lived their for years. The large door slammed shut behind the kids and they all turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was probably the wind.\" Eric said, going over to the door. He tried pulling it open, but the door wouldn't move. \"What the hell...\" Eric said, continuing in his flawless attempts to open the door. Eventually he stopped trying and just kicked in with all his strength. \"Stupid thing,\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, I'm sure it'll open eventually. Let's just look for the phone. The man said it would be behind the big black door, so let's try to find that door.\" Cody said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's split up. There's reception here so if one of us finds the phone, just call the cops then call the rest of us and let us know.\" Lauren said. The rest of them nodded in agreement. Kelly gave her a dirty look before the four of them split up going their separate ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man materialized himself in front of the door which held the room his demons were locked in. They were mumbling to themselves about how they had sensed the humans entering the house and that their freedom would soon come. As soon as the black door opened they would be back into the world forever. The old man phased himself through the door and found himself face to face with the demons he had created. They looked at him with pure rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons looked just like they had as humans, but with several main differences. Their bodies were now made up of a form of black smoke that would be invisible to humans unless the demons wanted themselves visible. Their eyes were also constantly glowing red, an animal like need for chaos now replacing any human emotions they may have once had.  They still possessed some emotions though. The Calhouns still had an enormous amount of lust for each other, and Kal still had an unending greed for power and women. Jonny was changed completely to his core. A conscience like his would not be necessary for a demon, so the old man got rid of it completely. All he wanted was to spread chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my servants.\" The old man said, a bit of pride in his voice as he looked at each of his demons. He was their creator, their master. The demons looked at him, as if thinking about how best to kill them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your mouth gramps,\" Kal growled, an inhuman darkness overpowering any kind of humanity he may have once had. \"Once we're freed, you'll be the first on our menu.\" He said. The old man smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will not.\" The old man said. He waved his hand in front of the demons and they all stopped moving entirely, as if frozen. That was when the old man quickly rewrote their minds. He made them believe that they had all begged the old man to make them demons and that they would all serve him unquestioningly. He also made them each aware of their unique abilities, as if they had always been aware of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to finally be freed, my slaves. You are about to be released from this room. In the house, you will find host bodies to take over. From this moment on, the four of you are free to do whatever you wish in this world, as long as you spread chaos wherever you go.\" The old man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for all of your help, my master.\" Kal said, respectfully, bowing down. The others did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome.\" The old man said. He phased out of the room and once again stood in front of the black door. The odds of the four college students finding it were slim, so the old man would have to handle this by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man places his hand on the door handle and opened the door. He watched as his demons flew out of the door looking for bodies to claim as their own.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren sighed as she opened the door to reveal yet another empty room. Seriously, how long did it take to find a stupid phone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should go see if I can find the others, maybe they're having some better luck...\" Lauren said aloud. Lauren turned around and went to try another door when she stopped short. It could be her imagination, but Lauren thought she could hear something moving behind the door she was standing in front of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Lauren called, gently knocking on the door. After a minute or so of silence, Lauren decided to open the door herself and see who was inside. Just as Lauren had placed her hand on the door, it flew open and a shadowy figure grabbed her by the shoulder and forced her inside the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh !!!!\" Lauren screamed, forcing herself out of her attacker' s grip. It took her so much effort that she was pushed back onto the bed in the room. Her attacker started laughing. It was a familiar, over confident laugh that Lauren had been forced to hear since she decided to get in that car with Cody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen the look on your face. It was just priceless!\" Eric said, practically crying from laughter. To say that Lauren hated him would be an understatement. Everything Eric did disgusted her.  He was the type of guy that could only survive by putting down others. Lauren couldn't remember a day when he and his group of friends weren't either trying to get Lauren in bed or make fun of her for still being a virgin. Sure, Lauren knew that if she tried, she could easily get any guy she wanted, she was just waiting for the right guy to appear for her. If her prince charming existed, Eric would be his exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a jerk\" Lauren said, slapping his face as hard as she could with her slender hand. Once he stopped laughing, Lauren bent down and picked up her glasses, that had fallen as she landed on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww relax, I was only kidding\" Eric said before starting to laugh again. Half way through it, something had changed. He stopped laughing, and Eric's body fell to the floor, spasming as if in a seizure. His open eyes glowed a bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this isn't funny\" Lauren said in disgust. This was no doubt a joke on his part to scare her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Eric's body stopped spasming. He got up and slowly cracked his back and next. He stretched his muscular arms in front of himself and smiled. When he looked at Lauren, she saw that his normally Brown eyes were now tinted a little red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lookey here, I've got me some mighty fine musles.\" Eric said, now in a heavy southern accent. \"Ohh, this is new...\" Eric said, massaging his crotch and smiling sinisterly at Lauren. \"It'll take a mite a' gettin' used to, but I think I can enjoy bein' a man. Tryin' new things is one a' the perks a' bein a demon.\" HE said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seriously isn't funny, Eric\" Lauren said. Eric just kept smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speakin' a' tryin' new things I wonder how my love'll enjoy bein' you... You ain't as mature as I was, back when I was livin' but you ain't bad. I wish I had some a' your looks when I was young. Yessir, I think my darlin'll love bein' ya, gorgeous,\" Eric said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, stop joking around, Eric...\" Lauren said, getting worried. Eric smiled even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, hun, Eric aint here anymore and I reckon he aint never comin' back\" Eric said, laughing. Lauren briefly saw the image of a southern looking woman flash around Eric's body. Lauren screamed at the top of her lungs before feeling herself go cold and dark.</span></div></div>",

As the movement stopped, Lauren slowly stood up and felt herself over before smiling evilly at the apparent Eric. Her eyes glowed red for a few seconds before settling down on her normal eye color, only tinted slightly red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well howdy, sexy\" she said, now speaking in a southern drawl, much like Eric. The possessed football player just smiled at her as the image of a southern cowboy looking guy flashed over Lauren's body. Suddenly, Lauren's body turned to face a mirror and put a hand on her cheek. \"Well gosh darn, look-a-here! I'm a woman!\" she exclaimed, pulling off her shirt quickly and then struggling to take off Lauren's bra. The possessed Eric then came to her rescue and clipped it from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya sure are, honey! And I'm a real life football player!\" she said, pulling off Eric's shirt and flexing his muscles as Lauren's bra fell to the ground. Lauren was in the process of fondling her breasts as she remembered the powers she had as a demon. She concentrated a little as her chest size expanded quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...now this is a nice rack! I can't believe Master gave us these fantastic powers, can you sugar?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly cannot! But I reckon the two of us can go out with these new bodies and powers and have ourselves a lot of fun, now can't we?\" Eric asked, reaching his hands around Lauren and helping her to fondle her breasts a bit as he felt himself getting hard. \"You know, I think this body here is gettin' the hots for yours. What do ya say the two of us have some fun with these kids? After all, it's been soooo long since you and I have done anythang. I think we both want it....\" he says. \"Please, baby?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren pushes Eric's hands away from her chest and smiles. \"I most certainly reckon we can arrange some fun. Made even better since this Lauren chick hates your body's guts. I reckon this'll be a lot of fun\" she says, slowly pulling off Lauren's pants to give the apparent Eric a show. Eric, for his part, was getting harder and harder from all this. Despite being a girl on the inside, Lizzie was now following Eric's rules and was very attracted to the sight of an undressing girl in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what are we waiting for?\" the possessed Eric asked, surprising the supposed Lizzie by pushing her down onto the bed. The two of them laughed and smiled at each other lovingly as the two began their first physical fun in a long, long time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old man opened the door and walked through, looking upon the kids in the room. Upon looking upon the old man, the 3 kids started to shriek and run for the exit, which caused the old man to sigh, looking upon the havoc being brought by his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo alleviate some of the tension, he began to change his body, which got the kids attention. His old face changing to a much younger, more feminine appearance and his clothes shrinking around his body, turning into a two piece bikini. Cody, and the girls were captivated by the spectacle before their eyes. His body changed from a masculine appearance to a womanly one as his hips widened, and his butt pushed outward, and his chest and shoulders became less broad, and a nice bosom appeared on his chest. Soon all outwardly signs that he was a man were gone and before them laid this beautiful bikini clad woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"There, that's better don't you think? You don't have to fear me. I simply wish to impart my gifts upon you kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls and Cody looked at one another and then back to the womanly figure before them. Lauren had some questions but Cody was the first to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: \"You....You mean we can change our bodies like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"Oh yes, and when the time comes, all you need to do is say yes, to a certain question and you will be able to do oh so much more than just alter your appearance and age\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids discussed among themselves, finally coming to the decision to accept the old man's offer. She smiled as she imparted the magic to be able to change their bodies upon the kids, getting them ready for her underlings behind the door in the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was the first to change his body. Young and Curious he was always curious about the other sex and he immediately began to change his body into one of a girls. He began by lengthening his hair to his waist, and changing the color to orange, making him a red head. His chest and shoulders became less broad and he grew an ample set of DD cup breasts, catching the eye of Kelly somewhat. He then narrowed his waist, and widened his hips and his clothes soon became that of a bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody felt over her new body, enjoying how soft her skin felt, and the wobble and jiggle of her new bosom. Lauren smiled as she changed her body next. She immediately shed some of the pounds she had trouble getting rid of and even shrunk her ample bosom down to a more manageable C cup. Her hair became shorter and changed to a more reddish hue like Cody's before her clothes morphed into a 1 piece bathing suit with some frills around the waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was next to change her body. She lost a little bit of height, going down to 5'2. She also shrunk her bosom to that of a B cup and caused her butt to swell outward a bit more. Her hair became lighter, and got put into two pigtails upon her head with two jewel encrusted hairbands holding them in place as she became a greyish blonde tint. Finally her clothes became that of a two piece bikini and she smiled, loving her new form. Tho she did seem to eye Cody's ample bosom somewhat, much to the old man's watchful eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man's eyes wandered over Kelly's new form, as the girls as Eric began his own transformation. He became shorter, and much thinner as his body became that of a girls as well. His pants became like Daisy Duke's shorts and his shirt became a bikini top. His chest sprouted C cup breasts as his hair became shorter and more reddish in tint. He ended his transformation by changing his genitalia into that of a woman's as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody and Eric walked up to one another and began to remark about the change in both sex and clothing. All while Lauren began to test out the clothing changing part of her shape shifting abilities by forming jewelry and other forms of clothes. Kelly sat off on her own, looking at her friends as the old man sat next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"Not curious about the others child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly: \"Nah...none of them really had any imagination. I mean, I applaud Cody, he had the imagination to go with bigger breasts, but he made his hair red, and way way too long for my tastes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"Oh? you enjoy big breasts and short hair? Why not give them to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly: \"Oh, I don't want them myself, but I wouldn't mind it on another girl. I mean.... its weird. Its like when you want something, but you dont want to BE that something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"Ah, I get it....so you enjoy big breasts like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man closed her eyes, and her bosom began to grow bigger. Her D cups soon became DD's and inflated even bigger, dragging Kelly's eyes with them. She smiled, seeing the breasts grow beyond Cody's size into the G cup range. The old man also made her hair shorter, and lightened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Man: \"Like this? Oh...and I think I should give this form a name.... How about Yumiko, or Yumi for short\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly: \"Yes....it looks good...but can you go even bigger....and make your hair....pink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi smiled, as her breasts began to once more swell outward, Kelly whispering Bigger, over and over, as Yumi's breast swelled outward past conventional cup sizes, and now were needing to be described with various forms of fruit. Cody and the others took notice of the changes Yumi was going through as well, as her hair became pink in color, and her breasts became the size of honeydew melons. Kelly continued to whisper bigger, egging Yumi to grow even more. Soon her breasts were the size of Watermelons, much to Kelly's satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi: \"mmmm these are so big and heavy. I might need you to help me carry them when we proceed with this day young kelly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly: \"Y....Yes of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, behind the door, Kal growled. The old man was getting friendly with those kids! He was supposed to be preparing their new vessels, but Kal could tell that the old man was starting to have second thoughts about the whole thing. He was already hatching schemes to get into the kid's bodies and then dispose of the big titted woman the old man had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the room, Cody and Eric were feeling eachother up, and Lauren had created a tiara of jewels as well as many different rings on her fingers. Yumi was smiling, starting to have second thoughts about her plan as Kelly gently felt over the curvature of her immense bosom. She was starting to develop a crush on the young girl, and wanted her as a human...not as a demonic host for some hellspawn. Kelly whispered to her that she would very much enjoy a younger more perkier version of Yumi. She smiled as her body became that of a teenager's once more. Her age disappearing off her form as she shed the years and became 16 once more. Kelly's face lit up in excitement as she hugged Yumi, her body squishing against those immense breasts she now sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, she was conflicted. She loved this hug, this embrace. She would never get this kind of affection from Kal of any of their hellspawn brood. Maybe she could convince them that they could have all but Kelly and then get them another body. Hopefully the little demons would be patient enough for her to prepare another host so that Kelly could remain herself. On the other hand.... he could give Kelly to an obedient demon and have them be an obedient partner for her. The possibilities were endless... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately she decided on.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicture References - Post Transformation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/bf/99/b7bf999d406a6313ac615758e96a3265.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/bf/99/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumiko/Old Man : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sybziXO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/sybziXO.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren :  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn-ossd.zipjpg.com/pay/2fa02cf41f817d600b069118160cf83a_1_0_photo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn-ossd.zipjpg.com/pay/2fa02cf4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4712/38702118955_4ffa5ebd1c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4712/3870...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tbib.org//images/5301/80ab616e33523bde915579665eff979d037a3a2d.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://tbib.org//images/5301/80ab616e33...</a></span></div></div>",
