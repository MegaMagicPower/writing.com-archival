It is so strange how we miss what we least expect.  When I was preparing to leave I thought I would miss the sunshine on my skin, or the feeling of a planet pulling me down.  And I do miss these things, in a simple, expected way.  I didn't think that I would miss the sometimes frustrating experience of prying apart the red edged, white flesh of a pomegranate fresh from the tree.  No matter how careful I was,  a few seeds always burst and sprayed red juice everywhere.  It stained my shirt, stung my eyes, and generally made a mess of things.  Then I would pry each little seed, more pit than fruit, and crunch on them.  They were always a deep ruby red, tart, and astringent.  We lived in a climate warm enough for the bush to grow, and too cold to have sweet fruit.  So now I am here, looking down on the planet where I was born, loved, grew up, bore a child and then buried him.  I can see more stars than I could ever have imagined, and I float about, without orientation or resistance.  It is a brave new world, a new frontier, an exciting adventure, and all I can think about is that wonderfully tart explosion of juice in my mouth as I bite into a dozen pomegranate seeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld prompt:<br>\r\nIf I only knew...what is your story based on this prompt?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew prompts:<br>\r\nIf your pet (or potted plant) could talk, what would they say?

He has the home field advantage, he knows these woods, I do not.<br>\r\n    I realize it too late. I had been too preoccupied with the thoughts of the man behind me that my mind never registered the sound of rushing water ahead. If I was smart I would have turned, started running left or even right, anywhere that would put distance between me and him. But I'm not, I hesitate, just long enough for him to catch up.<br>\r\n    Within a second I can feel his strong arm wrapping around my throat, squeezing tight, but not tight enough so that I can't breathe. He doesn't want to kill me yet, he wants me to suffer. <br>\r\n    \"You saw to much,\" comes his quiet, sinister whisper. He chuckles softly, then gradually his chuckle gets louder and turns into a hysterical fit of laughter. \"and now you're gonna pay.\"<br>\r\n     It dawns on me that this amuses him. It was fun, it was sport, he loves it. He doesn't want it to end too quickly. I close my eyes, bracing myself for the hours of terror that are to come before I will finally be given the privilege of taking my last breathe. I feel the sharp sting of a knife blade as it is pressed against my stomach. <br>\r\n       I feel my heartbeat quicken, I can hear it thudding in my ears, pounding against my head. I feel sick to my stomach, I just want to collapse and throw up and pass out right there at the same time. <br>\r\n      This is it. There is nothing beyond this. I had thought that I had felt this emotion before, but no, whatever I had felt before were just mere imitations of the real thing. This is shear terror. This is true fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I couldn't hold back anymore, \"I thought you were my friend!\" I shouted.<br>\r\n2. I sat in the classroom, staring at the board. <br>\r\n3.

I'm not quite sure what had happened to me, but I had I had a feeling that whatever had caused these strange events had originated at my uncle's workplace. He was some kind of scientist, though I wasn't sure exactly what he did, I sure wished now that I had been paying attention when he had talked to me about his job so many times, at the dinner table, picking me up from school, while he was showing me around even! Gosh I was stupid. Unfortunately while he was showing me and my mom around the lab, I had wandered off despite his warnings, and I had managed to find some kind of odd chamber filled with hundreds, maybe even thousands of spiders.<br>\r\n   Now unlike most girls my age I had always found spiders cool, fascinating even. So, naturally I went to go get a closer look. Everything was fine, or so I thought, I had only been in the chamber a few minutes before I heard voices approaching and had to quickly duck out to avoid being caught. It wasn't  until later that night that I had found the small spider bite on my shoulder.<br>\r\n  It looked normal, not infected, not poisonous ,but of course these spiders had been in a LAB, I knew they couldn't be normal. I had panicked at that point, was I sick? Was I going to die? Even if I didn't  Uncle Jason was going to kill me! I couldn't tell him. So my only option was to wait it out and see what happened.<br>\r\n  It was the next day that I noticed the changes, the first incident was when I picked up my Algebra textbook to pack it in my backpack.  When I had tried to let it go, it stuck. The book stuck to my hand! That is so not normal, but after I had pried the book from my hand, I somehow managed to convince myself that it had never happened, it was just my imagination. That worked, for about 2 hours, when it happened again, this time with my English paper. <br>\r\n  Over the next week I noticed significant changes, for instance my sticky fingers, which I had managed to control, I had gotten stronger physically, and more agile, and my newest discovery, I could shoot webs of spider's silk...from my wrists. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I haven't told anyone yet, not my mom or uncle. I wasn't sure how. But, there was someone I felt I could talk to, maybe even help.<br>\r\n  Rising in popularity was a new, er, super hero if you will. Some say he works for good, others say he is against us. As for me, I believe that he is on our side, and I wish to help him. He calls himself, spider man.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I sighed and admired their beauty for a moment. But something was still wrong.<br>\r\n  \"Hurry up kid we're going to be late!\" I female voice called. I frowned...I knew that voice, vaguely. And..kid? come on I'm 14! I sighed. something was definitely wrong, This body didn't seem like mine. I quickly looked in the mirror to find that instead of the short , auburn haired girl I had been I was now tall with black hair, golden eyes, there were three white stripes on the side of my head and oh yeah...and I was dude! I grinned into the mirror.<br>\r\n \"Hurry up kid!\" I heard the voice again. <br>\r\n  \"Coming Liz\" I shouted back. I had a feeling that it would be an exiting day...I was death the kid.</span></div></div>",

Today, however, was different. As I walked from the box thumbing through the daily paper carnage I was excited by the sight of a hand written letter. As time has passed the hand written letter has become somewhat of a novelty, shared mainly by the elderly, the imprisoned, and those serving in the armed forces. Yet here, I was holding one such letter in my very hand. There was no return address, so I quickly opened the letter hoping to find some unforeseen fortune or perhaps the scribbling of a long lost friend. Instead, I was confronted by these words, \"We have your son. If you ever want to see him alive again do not call the police. We will contact you with further instructions.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I try to pass by quickly, I'm not in the mood, but as I do he reaches out to grab me by the arm and says, <br>\r\n\"You only have 30 days to live, my daughter. Repent!\" I cringed, shook him off and ran down the street. I finally reached a corner and sharply collapsed into it. I broke down in tears, flooding, was it that obvious, did I really look that ill? Cancer, freaking thing! I can feel my lungs seize up and n't help but cry more. A sudden car stopping makes me look up.<br>\r\n\"Jade?\" He looked down on me and then bent on his knees to my level.<br>\r\n\"Lee?

I cringed and pressed my back fast against the headboard as he slowly approached, the artificial smell of meal-worm hamburger and salt-drenched fries assaulted my nostrils.  When he was standing only a few feet away, he tossed the bag into the air and it landed next to me on the bed. I rolled onto the other side of the bed and jumped to the floor, grabbing a t-shirt I had thrown down last night and using it to cover my nose and mouth. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"What are you thinking?!\" I shrieked. \"Get that shit OUT OF HERE!\" The person continued to approach me and I slowly backed up until my back hit the wall. The window wasn't far. I tried to inch my way over. The person didn't notice. There was a pencil stuck in the sill. I tried pulling it out to no avail. The person grabbed both of my wrists and raised my arms above my head. He slammed them against the wall and pressed himself against me. I could smell the nasty stench of pre-packaged onions, ketchup, and fake meat on his breath. He was wearing a ski mask so that I couldn't see his face. It wasn't black, but red. As though he hadn't had time to buy something dark to keep himself better hidden.  He pulled something from his pocket. I struggled against the grip he had on me. He was too close for a good knee in the crotch, but too far for a kick. Suddenly he was coming at my mouth with a can of something. A can of--of-- \"Not an ENERGY DRINK! ANYTHING but that!!\" I scrunched my eyes closed and turned my head away, but he brought one hand down, keeping my arms with the other, and forced the sweet, sticky fluid into my mouth. I spit it in his face. Dropping the still-full can on the floor, he ripped off the mask and drove his tongue into my mouth. The taste of rubber chicken and salt came to mind, but something was familiar about the motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his arms down my sides, squeezing my upper arms and pulling me against him. He pulled away and stared at me. \"Eric! You're back?\" He only smiled and reached for the button of my pants, making me forget all about my vegan breakfast of the morning. How could I have eaten after what he'd put me through? Salt-and-meal-worm morning. </span></div></div>",
