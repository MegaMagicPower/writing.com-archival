It was a meteor rock but, like none he has never seen! It was purple he thought, i will take a closer look, and to his astonishment it didn't make him feel weak and sick like the regular green kryptonite. He decided to take it home, he then super speeded home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrives there, and sees that the family truck is gone, so he looks on the kitchen to see if there is a note, he checks and finds one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear clark, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething has come up, we had to go to Metropolis on an important errand, we may not be back all weekend, maybe even longer. We hope we can trust you to stay home alone and we will be back shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, The Kents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks to himself, sweet. Then he remembers lana, pete, and the rest of the gang are on a trip, he says oh well i will have a peaceful weekend for once, He pulls out the purple kryptonite rock, he looks at it for awhile and yawns sleepily. Wow!im tired, i will look at this later. Clark heads up to his room, leaving the mysterious purple kryptonite in the kitchen.</span></div></div>",
