He turned off his stereo, and flopped himself on the couch.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe laid there, looking at the ceiling of his new apartment, his new home, and just thought about many different things. How his life had changed, how he had tried to love a new girl, but found himself finding a girl that could live up to Hannah, and failing. He'd have to find her. He knew that she was somewhere in New York City. Even if it was humungous, he hoped he would find her. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe tried to think about finding a job, while continuing to look for a major job. A job that would become his career.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe put his hands behind his head, and blinked his eyes a little, feeling them getting heavy. Before he knew it. He was out like a light.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\"> []   []   []   []   []</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHis eyes flashed open. He didn't remember the dream, but he remembered it had something to do with Hannah, and the prom. He shook his head. He sat up on the couch. It was dark, and with the bright lights outside, there were no stars. One thing he missed about Montana. He got up, and made himself a pot of coffee. It was almost three in the morning, and there were still people walking the streets, laughing, talking, hanging out with friends.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe walked to the window, and watched the people below walk across the very crowded sidewalk. He sighed. He wished his friends would have come with him. They could have played football in a park. Spilt into two teams and played against each other, like they did in college.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned, and found that his coffee was done. He poured himself a cup, and ran his free hands through his hair. He needed to make some friends. He'd go crazy if he didn't have anyone to talk to.</span></div></div>",

I very much appreciate the interest. However...maybe I'm nuts, but I really don't want to turn this forum into a pitch mechanism for my books. I already have other means for promoting my work. This site is intended to promote the craft of writing, and provide a supportive environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I realize that a few members of the Shelter will eventually buy one of my books because: A. They feel a connection B. They like my style of writing, C. They pity the author.<br>\r\nAnd when they read the story, I expect they will like it very much, or dislike it very much. I doubt there'll be much middle ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease keep in mind that I've been particpating in WC long before I ever sold a book. I didn't come here to beg people to buy my work. With that in mind, I'll tell you a few things about Offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book's release is still a few months away, (Oct. 6 release date) though some people have already, and inexplicably, pre-ordered through Amazon.com. Don't ask me why. I honestly can't imagine why. Heck, the cover art isn't even up on Amazon, yet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI digress. I sold the book in March, 2004. The wheels of publishing turn slowly, uh? Truth is, I wanted to delay publication until my retirement from the day job, which by the way, now coincides with the release date. Don't you love it when a plan comes together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince selling the first book, I've had several conversations with my publisher, the Thomas Dunne imprint of St. Martin's Press, regarding additional stories. I'm very pleased to announce that I sold two additonal books to St. Martin's just last month. This allows me to tell the story in the form of a trilogy. We've also discussed additional spin-offs, as many as two additonal trilogies, after Offspring runs its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffspring falls into one of three genres, depending upon ones perspective. Supernatural epic, dark fantasy, or horror. It has a few rather graphic moments. The good guys are, for the most part, regualr Joes. Flawed in myriad ways. Course langauge upon occasion, thoughtlessness, vanity, disdain for their fellow man... and capable of great heroism when the need arises. Sorta' like some very real people I know. The bad guys are...bad. Really bad. I mean, \"fifty miles of south Texas blacktop road\" bad. <br>\r\nLuis walked out of the New York City airport, with his luggage in hand.

He can feel the heat coming through the open doors. He smiles at the man behind the desk, in front of all the mail slots for each room of the hotel. Some are empty, while others are full.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs he walks out the door, someone collides with him, and they both fall to the ground. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs he falls, he sees whisps of blonde hair. He notices that whoever knocked into him, was beginning to stand up.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm so sorry! I was looking in my purse, and I wasn't even paying attention! God I'm so sorry!\" It was a woman's voice, and it sounded delicate and soft.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looked up, and stared at her for the longest time. She moved her long blonde hair from her face, and put it behind her. She looked up at him, and the same concentrating face appeared over both of them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah?\" The ravishing blue eyes had caught him. He knew them from somewhere, and Hannah's face instantly popped into his mind.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Luis?\" A smile appeared over her face, but it was an unsteady smile. She wanted to make sure it was him before she got all excited. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Come here! Geeze, I never thought I'd bump into you like that!\" He said reaching out to her, and pulling her in for a hug.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Luis! What are you doing here? I never expected to see you!\" She said excited. Her blonde hair came back into her face, but before she could move it, he moved it for her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You have such pretty hair Hannah. I see you're letting it grow longer.\" He complemented. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe last time he saw her, it was just below her shoulder blades, and now it was almost down around her buttocks, but it was thick, vulouptuious hair. It was cut even at the bottom, and it was a beautiful golden color.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe blushed. \"Thanks. You got taller, and more cuter it looks like.\" She said, giving him her smile.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, if I got more cuter, it's only because you got more beautiful.\" He knew it sounded kinda cheesy, but it was things he used to say to her to make her smile.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe raised an eye brow and laughed. \"You and your cheesy sayings. Where are you headed anyway?\" She said as she dug into her purse again, and finally, what it looks like what she had been looking for, she pulls out a hair scrunchie. She smiles, and pulls her hair back into a ponytail.</span></div></div>",

It's so comfortable.\" He smiled, and they walked down the sidewalk, mixing with the hundreds of people walking down the sidewalk.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA small outside restaurant stood out. It was called Hope Falls. \"Want to eat here? I've had some of their coffee. It's actually pretty good.\" Hannah said as they stood at the corner. People rushed past them. It was almost lunch hour, and the streets would be packed with people who spoke different languages.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sure. If you think it's good. It prolly is. Just don't set me up with something with some foreign name.\" They both laughed, and they found a small table, to wait for a waiter.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, what do you like best about New York City?\" Luis asked as he took a sip of the beer her ordered. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I love it here. Despite the occasional problem or two. It's really great. I love the diversity. I bumped into a guy who spoke Japanese. I think he swore at me.\" She laughed as she took a sip of the tea she had ordered.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well that sucks. I mean, it's worse enough to have some who speaks english swear at you, but when someone who speaks another language does, and you don't know what he said, now that's gotta suck.\" He took another sip of his beer, and held it in his hands before setting it back down.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe laughed, and looked up at her. He noticed the way she smiled at him. The way her hair hung in the ponytail, and the little hair that had fallen from it, and was now hanging in front of her ear. The little sweat beads that had formed on the--now--tan skin of her brow. Her eyes seemed to be searching him. Checking to see what had changed in him, and what had not. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How have you been Luis? How was California?\" One hand was on the arm rest, and the other was laying across her lap. She was trying to be composed, he thought with a smile.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I've been great. California was cool. I got to be an architect like I wanted, but....it just wasn't like high school you know?\" He replied. He hoped she would pick up on the fact that he had meant her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I missed you, you know. It seemed weird waking up, expecting to see you outside, waiting for me on the front porch. Or getting ready for a football game, and me getting ready in my cheerleading get-up. It was very weird for the first few years.\" She teased the handle of the cup with her fingers, and rang her right pointer finger across the rim of the cup. She looked up at him, with a look in her eye he didn't remember.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It was weird for you not being there either. I tried to date a couple of times, but they didn't last more than the first date if that. I kept trying to make them seem like you. After awhile, I think they got the picture, and girls just didn't want relationships with me.\" He said as he fondled the bottle of beer.</span></div></div>",

It was a half hearted, who-gives-a-shit, kinda laugh.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"After awhile, I believed then that I had to open my horizon as some might want to call it. I remember this one guy in particular. He was a senior when I was a junior. His grandparents were from India. He was really cute.

You aren't friends anymore?\" He asked, seeming to be more interested than he wanted to be.

It was in a car accident, involving his small truck, and a moving truck.

Her hand seemed to instantly release of the tension, and it relaxed. She let go of the cup. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer eyes met his, and they stared at each other for a moment.

So, it's normal to have missed him.' The young woman dropped her gaze for a moment for she wasn't certain whether that was the truth. When she looked up, Luis was still looking at her.

I thought that i'd forgotten you, forgotten how it felt to want you, forgotten how it felt to be wanted by you, but i havent forgotten, if anything i know more now than i ever did. I don't want to freak you out or anything, i just needed to get it off my chest\" he sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled and placed her arm on his. \"I'm glad you told me. You used to tell me everything. It's nice to think you can still trust me like that. I feel the same. When i saw you again tonight i got a pain in my stomach. I didn't know if i still loved you, or wether it was just because i missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and...\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because i love you. I've always loved you, i always will love you, there's always going to be a place in my heart for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis smiled as he felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He'd waited long years to hear her say that again and here it was. He noticed she looked a bit glum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...isn't love a happy thing?\" He asked trying to lighten the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannahs head stayed down, she was twiddling somthing on her finger.

As she finished washing her hair and started to rinse it out she suddenly had a flashback from 4 years prior. When she shared her shower with a handsome man named Luis. It suprised her and she had to shake herself back into reality. She wondered aloud \"What made me think of him?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nOut of the shower Hannah quickly got dressed to meet a few friends at a bar a few blocks away. Looking in the mirror at herself she was pleased. Red dress that fell just below her knees and her hair up letting a few strands fall on her shoulder, she looked young and beautiful- she felt that way too. Tonight Hannah was on a cloud that just kept floating with her every step. </span></div></div>",

She colored her hair everytime you blinked your eye or turned your back. This time it was a black, with deep blue highlights. She was normally a blone with blue eyes, but she had an act to get out with her energy and ideas. \"Yeah I know!

Blonde haired, blue eyed bombshell!\" Hannah felt herself blush, and she went with her friends to a table. \"It feels so weird for us to be out, and not having to worry about being back to our apartments early enough so we can study or just get sleep, and be energized for school.\" Mallory said brushing a dirty blonde strand out of her face, and behind her ears. \"Yeah I know, we're officially called independant women!\" Melissa spoke up and burst out laughing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter they all got drinks, Christa spoke up. \"You know, we should be here looking for studs.

Not only that, but she was in an unfamiliar bedroom. She groaned, lying down again. Face to face with Luis Armstrong. Hannah flinched- and then, the memories of last night started flooding back. The first sighting of him in years at the bar, the first kiss since then, their sweaty bodies moving together until they collapsed in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah felt a rush of excitement thinking about it- tinged with a slight regret. Was there such a need to rush it? She wished she hadn't readily dropped her friends to be with him.. but it showed how much she still loved him after years apart. <i>How did I ever forget Luis?</i> she wondered, feeling a grin spread on her face despite her hurting hangover. She reached out to touch Luis's cheek, snuggling closer to rest her lips on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Hannah sank into sleep again.

She smiled, croaking, \"Good morning Luis.\" he smiled back. \"Good morning..\" and moved down to kiss her bare neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, they were kissing passionately, groping eachother, hardly coming up for breath. Before they could take it farther, Luis whispered in Hannah's ear, \"I'll be right back.\" he pulled himself away from her grasp and slipped out of bed. Hannah sighed, impatient, but gladly watched the back of Luis, naked, walking to his jacket draped on a chair across the room. He pulled out a pack of condoms. As he returned, Hannah took in the front of his bare body and prepared to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he suddenly halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Hannah whispered, thinking he may now only have noticed the intense hangover she already felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, the time!\" Luis looked around the room, hurriedly pulling on underwear and a shirt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have somewhere better to be?\" Hannah suddenly felt horribly exposed, and pulled the covers around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Hannah, I have to go.\" He was grabbing shoes now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah watched Luis dress in a rush, confused and disappointed.

You will never believe what happened to me today, though!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah looked in disbelief at the pile of dirt on the floor she had just cleaned so carefully, but didn't have time to say anything about it as Anna rushed on to tell her story.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Okay, so I'm at Sak's looking for a business suit for my interview next week, blue, I'm looking for blue, because I look really good in blue, and I pick out all these blue suits, and I'm thinking I can't decide between a long skirt and a short skirt, so I head towards the dressing room, and I walk right in without asking, and bump straight into this guy.  It was the men's dressing room, can you believe it?\"  Anna giggled, and then went on.  \"Okay so I drop all these suits on the ground, and the dressing room lady is like freaking out about all the clothes because they might get wrinkly or something but this guy is SO HOT!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wait a minute,\"  Hannah finally interrupted, \"You have a job interview next week?  You didn't tell me that!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah, it's with Parker and Barnes, but I'm pretty sure I'll get it 'cause my cousin works there, but anyway, about this guy.  He picks up my clothes and hands them to me, and I'm like all flustered about it and I don't even remember what I said, but he smiled at me and I nearly died of the joy of it.  So anyway, I go to the women's dressing room and try on all my clothes and I pick out this awesome blue suit, which turns out to be a short skirt with a jacket that would make anyone want to hire me, if you know what I mean!  But anyway, after I bought the suit, I stopped by the yogurt shop to get a snack, and there is the guy, sitting at a table all by himself!  I didn't want to be obvious, but I went over and sat with him and we had the best talk!  Anyway, I invited him over tonight and I think we might go out to eat or something!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna had to stop at that point to take a breath, which Hannah took as a good sign that she could safely begin to ask Anna questions without being interrupted.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um, Anna, don't you think you should be at home?  Um, cleaning your apartment?  Your roommates don't really seem keen on washing dishes and it really smelled when I came over yesterday,\" Hannah said, wrinkling her nose at the memory of messy Anna's living space, which was a stark contrast against Hannah's neatly-kept and well-decorated apartment.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, that's the thing,\" Anna went on, \"I wasn't about to invite him to MY house, so I gave him your address.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What??\"  Hannah practically shouted.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah!\" Anna whined, \"You know I couldn't have a guy over to my place, he would take one look at my roommates and turn around and leave.  Besides, this guy was totally clean cut, I can tell he goes for the organized and clean type.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, Anna, you're NOT the organized and clean type, so why waste your time?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, duh, reason number TWO I gave him your address.  That way he thinks that I live here and will think that I AM organized and clean.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I can't believe you!\"  exclaimed Hannah, \"I JUST moved in and I'm all hot and sweaty and tired and you invited a guy over to my house.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know, but it'll just be this once, maybe just a few times after this.  Look, I'm going to run home and change and get ready, he should be here at 7 tonight, okay?  I'll be back in like an hour.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah glanced at the clock, which read 5:45.  Anna was notorious for being late and flighty, which was precisely why Hannah was not more surprised at the occurances of the evening, but Hannah was not about to greet Anna's man only to wait with him for an hour while Anna finished re-applying the tenth shade of lipstick.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Anna, I swear to you that if you are even one minute late, I will never talk to you again!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I promise!\"  Anna replied, and grabbed her weight-lifter's purse to leave.  \"I gotta run, but I promise I'll be back by 6:59!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWith that, Anna ran out the door, and Hannah could hear her 5-inch clogs stomping down the stairs.  Hannah rolled her eyes again, and got the vacuum out to take care of the dirt on the floor.</span></div></div>",

Brian is picking me up in like 5 minutes!  We're going to Alba's!  I'm going to wait outside for him... You two have a good time!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna ran outside to wait for Brian and Hannah and Luis looked at each other and laughed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah...\" Luis started, \"I just wanted you to know that when Anna invited me over, it was because she told me that a bunch of people were getting together, and not because she and I were going to go out on a date.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, it's fine,\" Hannah insisted, \"I don't have a problem with it...  I mean, it's been like four years.\"  Hannah laughed nervously.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know that,\" Luis replied, \"I just didn't want you to think that I was in the habit of going out with girls I just met.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, that's not really any of my business anyway,\" Hannah said, quietly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Of course it's your business,\" Luis protested, \"We've been best friends all our lives!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah and Luis continued making small talk throughout their meal, and sat quietly listening to the live band when they started playing.  After dinner, Luis asked Hannah if she wanted to go somewhere else for a while, since it was still early.  Hannah agreed, so they got in her car and started driving around.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Where are you taking me?\" asked Luis, with a smile.</span></div></div>",

The front of the building was nearly all glass, but from where they were, Luis couldn't tell what was inside it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs they walked toward the building, Luis looked around him curiously, and decided that wherever they were, it definitely wasn't the typical city setting.  Though at the edge of the city in a neighborhood that not at all matched the actual place they were at, Luis saw a green area that looked very much like a park behind the building, and flower gardens on the sides.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This is a really beautiful place,\" Luis said to Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know...

There she pointed to a large painting on the wall.  \"Read the sign next to it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis stepped closer to read the sign and saw Hannah's name neatly listed as the artist.  He stepped back and looked at the painting again and smiled.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow, that's incredible...  How did you get a painting in a gallery?\" he asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, this gallery likes to show the work of local artists in addition to historical pieces, and one of my old professors introduced me to the curator a few years ago, who liked some of my work and asked to purchase some for the museum.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow, that is so cool!\" exclaimed Luis, \"So you're like something of a local celebrity, huh?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis grinned at Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Whatever,\" Hannah said, playfully rolling her eyes at Luis, \"Let's go outside, there are a bunch of cool sculptures throughout the gardens.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis unexpectedly grabbed Hannah's hand and led her outside.  Hannah may have blushed, but certainly didn't pull away.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey walked outside until it got dark, looking at all of the sculptures and catching up on all the time they had been apart.</span></div></div>",

Not much, I know, but I fell in love with the hardwood floors in here and the view.  It's absolutely beautiful on a clear day.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, it's really nice,\" said Luis, \"I'll have to bring you over to my apartment, which is much tinier than yours, and not half as clean!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, if you are anything like what you were in high school, I'm sure it'll be clean soon.  You always were a neat-freak,\" Hannah said.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know, one more thing we have in common.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey laughed as they went back in the kitchen to check on the cookies.  Being that they were done, Hannah took them out of the oven, piled them on a plate, and they went outside to her balcony where they sat on Hannah's tiny hammock and ate them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen all of the cookies were gone, they looked at the plate in surprise and laughed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh my gosh!\" laughed Hannah, \"You are the only guy in the whole wide world that I would EVER eat that many cookies in front of!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh stop it,\" Luis laughed in return, \"If anyone should be embarrassed, it should be me.  I ate WAY more cookies than you did!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah took the plate back inside, and Luis followed her in.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah, I should probably get going,\" he said, looking at the clock.  \"I have a job interview kinda early tomorrow morning...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh... okay,\" Hannah replied, a little disappointed that he was already leaving, even though she knew she had to get up early the next day for work. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can I see you again tomorrow?\" Luis asked, hopefully.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'd like that,\" smiled Hannah, \"Can I come over to see your house?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, that doesn't leave me much time to clean,\" Luis laughed, \"But I guess since it's you...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Okay,\" said Hannah, \"I get off work at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon, call me after that okay?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah wrote her phone number down on a piece of paper and gave it to Luis before she walked him to the door.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll see you tomorrow then,\" Luis said, and gave Hannah a huge hug.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Bye,\" Hannah replied, as she watched him walk out the door and down the hall.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe shut the door and then leaned against it and sighed.

He had always professed to never being bored with Hannah, but the summer after their senior year in high school, Hannah had known that Luis had been seen all over town with Lisa Barnett, even kissing her, while Hannah and Luis had been dating.  That had been most of the reason why they hadn't kept in touch during their college years.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah thought that she should have known better than to trust him again.  She walked the entire mile to her building in high heel shoes that hurt her feet and caused blisters that she would remember for days afterward.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It serves me right,\" she sniffed, \"as she opened her apartment door and locked it behind her.

She wanted to avoid Luis at all costs and so didn't want to ask who it was for fear of informing Luis that she was actually home.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah, open the door for heaven's sake!\" shouted Anna, her voice muffled on the other side of the door.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRelieved, Hannah opened the door to see Anna holding a grocery bag with what looked like the outlines of pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and holding the latest issue of Cosmo between her teeth as she rummaged through her purse for something.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna took the magazine out of her mouth to say, \"Jeez, about time.  What took you so long?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't know, I thought you might be Luis.  I'm getting a peep-hole tomorrow.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You are so paranoid, you freak!  Check it out, Ben and Jerry's and Cosmo,\" Anna grinned.  \"We'll have you feeling better in no time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't WANT to feel better,\" Hannah sighed, \"I LIKE wallowing in my own misery.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut in spite of herself, Hannah pulled out a pint of ice cream and dug in.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe girls spent the evening doing Cosmo quizzes and eating more ice cream than a person would think would fit in the stomachs of the two small-framed girls, and Hannah had to admit afterward that she did feel better. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt this point, Hannah's phone was still turned off and she hadn't checked her voice mail. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna started complaining about having called Hannah and left her several messages on voice mail but never receiving a call back.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sheesh, as if I'm not your best friend or something!\" Anna said, glaring at Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I haven't checked my voice mail in a while, I just don't want to hear from Luis,\" Hannah answered.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh my gosh, I bet he's called.  Oh please please please check your voice mail, I'm dying to know what he said!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You check if it you want to know so badly.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Are you serious?  Okay!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna jumped up and ran to the phone and dialed Hannah's voice mail number and began to listen to the messages.  Hannah pretended not to be paying attention, instead fiercely picking at the paint on her old baggy shorts.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter several minutes of silence on Anna's part, she hung up the phone and looked at Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I think you should call him,\" she said, gravely.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why?\" asked Hannah, \"What did he say?\"</span></div></div>",

Go to bed so that I can get up tomorrow morning for work and continue to live my life.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah, you really don't have to be so stoic.  It's okay to be sad about things.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's not okay to be sad about this.  Luis did this to me once before, and I shouldn't have trusted him, but I made the mistake and now I have to deal with it.  I refuse to spend my time crying over someone who doesn't even think of me!\"  Hannah's voice wavered as she spoke.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna wisely (for once) didn't say anything in response but just held her best friend as she cried.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnna offered to stay the night, but Hannah told her that she just wanted to be alone for a while, so after Anna left, Hannah took a long shower and went to bed.  She had a hard time falling asleep because everytime she thought of Luis (which was very frequently), she had to try very hard not to cry.  But she eventually fell asleep the next morning, albeit to wake up to puffy eyes again the next morning that she knew would be commented on at work.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWork went in much the same direction as it had the day before, strange stares directed her way by her co-workers, and a general quietness pervading Hannah's office.  She didn't get a thing done at work, instead re-reading the same sentances over and over, never being able to grasp their meaning.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe had never been more ready to leave than she was at the end of her workday.  She knew that she was setting herself up for disappointment in thinking that there would be a message for her from Luis when she got home, but she rushed home a little faster than usual, and checked her voice mail as soon as she walked in the door.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah...  Please call me, we need to talk,\" said a familiar voice through the phone. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah's heart leapt as she heard his voice.  Other than that short sentance followed by his phone number, he had nothing else to say.  She found herself rationalizing over whether or not to call him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn the one hand, he had treated her badly, she thought, and he hadn't called her until a day and a half after the incident had occured, and hadn't even sounded all that sorry.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn the other hand, he had called, though late, and did want her to call him back, and he HAD been her best friend nearly all her life.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe didn't want to seem too desperate, so she waited until 8:43 that night.  She picked an odd number so that he wouldn't know that she had been waiting at home cleaning and working on projects to bide time until she thought that she could safely call him without seeming desperate.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe dialed the number with shaking hands and palpitating heart and waited nervously through the first three rings until Luis picked up on the fourth.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hello?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um, Luis?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah?  Is that you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah.... what's up?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can I come over?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well... I guess.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis was unexpected.  Hannah had already changed into her pajamas, and though her house was mostly immaculatlely spotless, there were chocolate candy wrappers all over the floor as well as the kleenexes with which she had used to wipe the teary mascara streaks off her face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Okay, I'll be right over.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Okay.... Bye.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Bye, Hannah.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs soon as she hung up the phone, Hannah hurriedly picked up all of the candy wrappers and kleenexes and threw them away, and then ran into her bedroom to change into something that would make Luis feel like he was missing out on much more than just a good buddy.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen she heard the doorbell ring, she was just putting on a fresh coat of lipstick, and she intentionally waited a few seconds longer to answer the door so that it wouldn't look like she had been waiting impatiently for Luis.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Look at me.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah looked up at Luis, who was staring intently at her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I swear to you that nothing is going on with Katy and I.  I promise you that I did not give her my address, and that I did not know she was coming over, and I am telling the truth when I tell you that she left right after you did.

She felt very vulnerable at this point, for to admit she was upset was to admit that she had feelings for Luis, and he had not yet done the same for her.  It was too late to retract her overreaction, and she knew it, but she also knew that it would be better to have her feelings out in the open than to hide them only to get hurt later.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well?\"  Luis asked, \"You forgive me?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis gave Hannah a little smile.  He had known Hannah long enough to know when she had forgiven him, and recognized her expression as such.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut Hannah didn't know if she was ready yet.  She returned Luis's smile with one even smaller, but followed it with the movement of her eyes off of Luis and down onto the floor.  Luis frowned.  He knew that he hadn't yet won complete forgiveness, despite what he thought had been a forgiving look on Hannah's face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe got up off the couch and kneeled down in front of Hannah and put one of his hands on each of her cheeks so that he could force her to look at him.  Hannah looked at him in surprise and instinctively tried to pull away, but he held her in place.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hannah, I have given you the truth, and now I want some from you.  Do you believe me, or do you not believe me?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah looked straight into his eyes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I believe you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis smiled at her and wrapped his arms around her and held her close.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Look, Hannah, I know that we have been best friends for all our lives, and except for a few occassions, we have always been completely honest with each other, and that's why I need to be honest with you now.  I came to New York to find you.  All those years in college were just years without having you in my life.  I know it's soon to say this, but I want to work things out with you again.  We belong together.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah smiled to herself and rubbed her face against his shoulder to wipe her tears off.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis pulled away and kissed her forhead.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What do you think?\" he asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah didn't answer, but instead smiled at him and then buried her face against his chest.

But what can she do? and opens the-just-closed-by-Anna door.<br>\r\n   But no one is there. How odd, she thinks to herself, and then remembers the warnings she received earlier that day about the young building practical jokers. As she turned to close the door, she sees the reason for the interruption.  A simple letter. Curious she lifts the letter from the ground and steps into her apartment. Sitting down, she opens the lid and finds a hand-written letter.<br>\r\n    She quickly scans the words written there and blushes a deep and vibrant red. It's a love poem and letter declaring someone was deeply smitten with her. It gave very little clue of who it could be from but Hannah, being a very resourceful woman, knew she could find the author. Ha! she says to herself! wait 'till i tell this to Anna! She's not the only one with a love interest!  Throughly pleased with herself, she sighs, put the letter away in a (well placed, might i add) drawer and goes to take a shower. The letter had only taken up about 15 minutes of her time but it was already it was 6:15 and she was starving, she wanted to eat before Anna's 'hot date' arrived. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They ended up in different colleges at far ends of the U.S. It's four years later, at twenty-one, they go out and look for jobs, and unexpectedly bump into each other...literally. With the years spent apart, is their passion still burning for each other?\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<b>Characters</b>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Hannah Denny</u> - She's 21, blonde hair, bright ravishing blue eyes. She went off to a University in New York City, where she decided to become an graphic designer. She decides to stay in NYC, and try to find a job for herself. She hasn't forgotten her best friend Luis, and the two years they found themselves, finding they had true passion for each other. She wonders if maybe there would be any left if she saw him again.
