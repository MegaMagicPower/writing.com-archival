I have read the posts in the Gentle Giantess forum and I have been thinking about joining in so this is my way of say greetings to fellow GTS fans. I have a few questions and send your answers to me by email or review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) What superpower would you want to have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) How you try to beat a villian like naraku or sosuke aizen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) What female from any anime, manga, or game do you like to be with in stories that you create here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) What is your favorite couple from anime, games, or manga?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) If you had a baby, who would it look like and would it be a boy or girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal question: what name and superpowers would a supervillian has to face off with my two star characters, Ryan Kasshi and Ryan Shinonome?</span></div></div>",

I'm 10 years old, my name is Ray, and I like surprises. My parents are pok\u00e9mon masters in battles and contests so I'm going to be like them, but they wanted me to follow my own dreams. The Master of Mystery and Mistress of Magic are my parents, but their real names are Ryan and Melody. They really care for me even when they are working their shows, but their pok\u00e9mon are psychic types like alakazam, solrock, lunatone, spoink, and other psychic types; but they had a ralts, karlia, and gardevoir to help raise me when they were on stage and they would have them babysit me when I was a little boy. They are like family to me and I care for them, but I started to get strange feelings for Kari (female karlia) and Rio (female gardevoir). They thought it was cute and I talk to them about it, but I had trainer school to deal with and they helped me with my studies. I'm smart enough to get the right answers, but how to get them can be a slight problem. In short, I passed my finals and I was able to get an expert trainer license so I can get three-starter pok\u00e9mon. I like gardevoir, ninetails, and chansey, but wigglytuff is in my list and some others as well. I got to the gate to the lab of Professor Gray and he greeted me at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Professor Gray.\" I say as he let me inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ray, how is your family doing?\" He asked as we walked to the lab where I can pick my starter pok\u00e9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are doing well and they are still in the magic show business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked over some tea and then we strolled over to the laboratory and he shows me about 12 sets of three starter pok\u00e9mon teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So each three pok\u00e9mon will you choose?\u201d he said as I start to look over the pok\u00e9balls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, I picked three pok\u00e9balls and they turned out to be a growlithe, vulpix, and an eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour growlithe is a male and your other two pok\u00e9mon are females. I\u2019m telling you this so you can give the right names.\u201d He said as my team greeted me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the tip, professor.\u201d I said as he gave me five pok\u00e9balls and my own pokedex<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you should know the land on our own island first and see what kind of pok\u00e9mon live on it then go to the mainland for the pok\u00e9mon league.\u201d He advised me as I recalled my team back to their pok\u00e9balls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are also some weird pok\u00e9mon hanging around a lake in the forest and they are to be human and pok\u00e9mon, but they are female and only female.\u201d He said which caught my interest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre these creatures strong?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are more to peace and harmony, but they will fight if they have those who have an impure heart invading their forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I left the lab as other new trainers like me were lining up to receive their starting pok\u00e9mon and I came home to see my parents and pokemon are getting ready for the party to celebrate me becoming a trainer.</span></div></div>",

The professor is right about them wanting only peace and fighting for it, but they like to have visitors some time.\u201d Dad said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we had the party and it was over when it was time for bed since the party was two hours long, but we started late. Rio was tucking me in my bed as my three pok\u00e9mon were on beside me on the bed and she kissed me goodnight before turning off the light. I was dreaming about the village and the creatures there, but somehow I was dreaming about rio and her body was getting more curvy and beautiful. Soon I felt her mind with my mind and she was smiling, but I wasn\u2019t trying to think like that and she thought it was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~That is very sweet of you thinking I was that beautiful.~ I heard in my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Rio, were you and karla from the village?~ I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ray, your parents were at the village when I met them and it was the same for karla; but we did come from the village and your father used real magic to make my body to become like a normal gardevoir.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~When you were going to be born, I wanted my real form so you could see the real me.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know the real you no matter what your body looks like.~ I thought and I saw her hugging me in my dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Thank you ray, but I think that your father should let me have my real form and tell you the truth.~ she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my dream, she looked like a supermodel and I was just staring at her surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know you don\u2019t think like that and this dream is only how you can see what my real body looks like.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed me on the cheek and I blushed lightly from the kiss. She noticed and giggled before she hugged me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Your father is my trainer as karla is your mother, but ralts is too young to be going with you.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dream ended and I had some peaceful sleep and I know rio is watching over me as a mother should. I know my parents care for me and they love me, but they are to busy and they have been there for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, it\u2019s time to get up.\u201d Someone said and I just turned over not wanting to get up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive more minutes.\u201d I said wanting to sleep more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel someone pulled me out of bed and gave me a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You need to get to the table for breakfast.~ I heard in my mind and I noticed karla was hugging me</span></div></div>",

He began sprinting and his short spiked blond hair began collecting snow. He turned the corner and stopped a few feet in front of Anuza the spirit of the Desert. She had the head of a jackal covered in black fur and her body was covered in black fur as well and she was wearing a silverish white toga. \"So your obviously not the spirit of speed\" she said before writing something down on a scroll. \"What the hell am i then?\" asked Luke. \"You'll have to find out on your own\" said Anuza before smiling and picking up a basket full of meat and handing it to Luke. \"Now go feed the Dark Beasts\" said Anuza. \"Why the bloody hell would i want to do that?\" asked Luke. \"Cause your my apprentice and you must do what i say and getting raped wouldn't help me with today\" replied Anuza while rolling her eyes. \"Besides you don't even have to walk into the cage just throw it in\" said Anuza before Luke sighed and then walked up to the Dark Beasts cage and began throwing meat inside. \"Bloody stupid creatures\" said Luke throwing the Meat inside and watching them fight for it. Dark beasts were two legged creatures with 4 eyes and black skin and they were known to rape females of any species if not fed instantly and steal souls of there victims. \"Not enjoying todays tests are you?\" asked Nahza who is the Spirit of light. Nahza wore bright gold robes and had a scepter in his right hand and had a hawks head instead of a humans and the rest of his body was covered in feathers as well. \"Why haven't you told me who i am?\" asked Luke. \"Cause then you will never find yourself\" said Nahza. \"Your 45,000 years old and you probably don't even remember your trials\" said Luke. \"I remember Anuza doing them and she acted the same as you\" said Nahza. \"At least she didn't have to feed these retarded things\" said Luke pointing at the Dark beasts. \"She did and has for 23,000 years but she is to busy to feed them today\" said Nahza. \"What about you what do you do?\" asked Luke. \"Make sure that the mortals see a sun everyday\" replied Nahza before walking away. After Luke had finished feeding the beasts he walked up to Anuza who was speaking with Coth the spirit of Night. \"Now what?\" asked Luke. \"Balance on those poles for 10 days\" said Anuza and Luke's jaw dropped. \"Your crazy!!\" shouted Luke and Anuza and Coth smiled. \"we both did it Luke\" said Coth with a smile on his face. Coth was a Panther spirit and he wore black robes with moons on them and stars. Luke walked up to the poles and climbed up onto the top to begin his balancing and within 5 minutes he fell. \"You will not leave till you've stayed up there for 10 days\" said Anuza before Luke was left alone balancing on the pole.</span></div></div>",

The return was of a man named Gore.  He was a fiend, truly fit for only the depths of hell, where all thought he was banished to remain forever.  Yet, if this were true and he was returning after only four years, could Zephyr be the warrior to banish him again?  He beat him alingside his partner Jaxx, who all were told died of his wounds gained from the fight.  But no, he was having a peaceful life in the country with his wife.  His son Zenn, what an energetic little guy, and funny too.  It was truly an honor to be named his godfather, though there is nothing that could possibly kill Jaxx before Zenn was at least eighteen.  Zephyr pulled the door to his rickety car open and drove to visit, though the reason behind it was too dark for anyone but Jaxx himself.  He turned the key and hit the accelerator.  Soon he was driving out on the beginning of what would put him into history.</span></div></div>",

He pulls in, seeing something that would always burn in his memory from the day he saw it.  The house was smoldered.  But not from flames.  The clear meddling of Gore's dark powers was at work here.  He searched the house.  He found only the remains of Jaxx's wife, burnt and sucked completely of her blood.  \"Oh shit.  Oh shit, not Maria.\" Zephyr took time with his emotions before standing.  The search ended up fruitless.  At least he didn't know the other two were dead.  That leaves a chance.  \"Zenn, Jaxx, please be safe...\" He got up and saw a shifting shape.  The ebb and flow of blood magic.  The very same Gore uses.  The previously mentioned nemesis appeared from the blood.  \"Zephyr... I'm happy to see you're doing well.  How's being a forgotten hero working out?\" Gore stood with his pure black skin and blood red eyes.  \"You're looking like someone who just finished setting themself on fire and doing crack.  So, normal for you right?\" Gore sneered and then looked at him.  \"This time there won't be failure.  None of your light magic will stop me when the plan finishes.  Hell, there won't be enough light in the world to stop me when it's over.\" Zephyr stood defiantly and brought hisgun out.  A rope of blood pulled it away and he dropped into a fist-fighting position.  \"I would crush you like the bug you are, but I need to finish my preparations.  See you in the living Hell I create for you.\" Gore disappeared in a whirl of blood.  \"He never talks about a plan, just world domination through killing off any people who could challenge him.  What's he up to?\" Zephyr's thoughts were mostly around that until they reached Jaxx and Zenn.  He searched the area but they seemed to have dissapeared.  Finally Zephyr guessed the hiding spot.  The tower.  He got back into the car, leaving behind the mess that signified what could be the beginning of the end.</span></div></div>",

I am going to kill him.\" Zephyr had become very good friends with Maria.  After his wife died, Maria had been like a second mother to his daughter.  Alexis now lived with other parents, because Zephyr couldn't raise her very well on his own and because of his need to fight Gore.  First he sent her to Maria, and she now lives with another family, surely at about the age where she would learn of her powers, just as Zenn will.  She and Zenn were born two months away from eachother, Alexis first, then Zenn, about two weeks before their hunt for Gore.  Zephyr pulled off the country road next to a cornfield.  The sun was dipping below the horizon slowly, and the day was near its end.  The sky was red.  Red as the blood that fuels Gore.  Zephyr fought his way throughout the corn, praying that they were in the tower.  In the middle of the field was an inconspicuous gap in the corn.  Zephyr opened the hidden door in the ground.  He went into a cavern, which had a rune painted on the floor.  Zephyr muttered the magic phrase and felt the rushing sensation that meant he was teleporting.  He felt the motion stop and saw a blade of fire pointed at his throat.  Not coming from Jaxx, but Zenn.  \"Hello Zenn.  I'm here to see your father.\" the ten year old said, \"But my dad said not to let anyone in.....\" The sound of feet on the stairs came from below.  \"Jaxx?\"<br>\r\nThe man looked up, the usual kind, but world-weary smile appeared on his face.  \"Zephyr.  So this means you know?\" The man's stare was intense and Zephyr nodded.  \"I'm so sorry about Maria.  We will kill him this time.  You can get your revenge.\"  Jaxx nodded, unable to show anything else.  At this point he had been hollowed out of everything.  Everything but the hate and the rage.  Zenn had backed into a corner and sat on a chair, reading a book.  </span></div></div>",

Zephyr shook his head, pointing his gun into the center of the room.  Zenn had two blades of fire pointed at the same spot, a spitting image of his father.  The blur dissapeared, revealing Gore.  The two men shot, and a fireball and bullets were each stopped by a wall of blood.  \"That's no way to make me feel welcome.  Thanks for showing mr the secret way in though..... very nice of you.\" I only came here to show you how my plan is coming to fruition.  He opened his coat, and then showed a spirit.  Alexis' spirit.  \"Son of a bitch!  I'll kill you!\" Zephyr fired an entire clip of bullets, each easily blocked.  \"Why not just use your powers?  It would be so much easier.\" Jaxx whispered at Zephyr.  After an accident, Zephyr had sworn not to use his powers again.  \"Fine.\"  He pounded his fists together, causing electricity to flow through them.  The original partners charged together, Jaxx being grabbed around the neck by a rope of blood and pulled in next to Alexis.  \"Spirits of Ice and Darkness!  Heed my call!  I challenge you to a battle!\". Gore yelled into the air.  \"What are you doing?\" Zephyr said.  The spirits obeyed and appeared.  The battle was nonexistent.  Both were dragged into the area where the captured souls go.  Zephyr watched as Gore yelled \"Spiritual Fusion!\" Zephyr understood.  He was taking their power and then taking over the world.  \"Gore!  You won't get away with this!  I won't let you!\" Gore smiled and then laughed, all the while gaining the powers of the souls he was taking.  Zephyr smashed his fist into Gore's face and then began hitting him, not giving the Blood Mage a chance to react.  Zephyr finally threw a huge uppercut, throwing Gore into a wall.  \"Heh..... I forgot about you.  But you are an insignificant worm.  I will soon be greater than God himself.  There's nothing you can do about it.\" Gore started thrashing Zephyr with blood whips and soon the man was sent to the ground.  Zephyr crouched down trying to determine what to do.  \"I give up.  Come take my soul.\" Zeohyr let the words slip out I'd his mouth.  The rope grabbed his neck and he grabbed it, coursing all his electricity through it.  Gore was stunned and wounded.  He fell to his kneeez as Zephyr ran at him, finally landing a huge kick to his head.  Zephyr then jumped on top of Gore and started bearing him mercilessly.  \"You are going to die you disgusting freak!  Burn! In! Hell!\" The last three words were said at the same time as three huge stomps on his head.  Gore used a blood rope to yank his msg after the last one and Zephyr fell.  He began whipping the man at places with main arteries.  Zephyr slowly bled out and died, his soul not takable by Gore.  </span></div></div>",

I am going to take you somewhere where you'll be happy.  Just let me erase your memories of your time in the tower.\" Gore planned yo take the boy's spirit when he was older and much more powerful.  Zenn finished saying what he had wanted to and now yelled it.  \"SPIRITS OF FIRE AND LIGHT, BURN THROUGH THE NIGHT!\" A beam smashes into, Gore releasing the soul least absorbed into him.  Jaxx was sent away from Gore.  Gore had fired his memory eraser and it hit Zenn.  Jaxx then turned to see Gore disappear.  Zenn fell unconscious and Jaxx realized at that moment what he must do.  Zenn's life must be ruined, at least for awhile, to save the lives of millions.  Jaxx erased Zenn's memories, replacing then with those of an orphanage.  With a good amount of his remaining power and life-force, he blocked Gore from returning to their world until Jaxx died.  He just prayed Zenn could be fully trained by then.  If not, there would be severe consequences for not only Zenn, but the entire world.  Jaxx looked at himself in a mirror.  \"He looks just like me.  Just like his father.\" A tear rolled down his cheek as he pulled out a mask to hide their resemblance.  \"He'll hate me. He'll hate me until he understands what I did.\" The tears flowed freely as Jaxx put on the mask and put Zenn into a hut in a small town in Nevada.  The father lpoked at his son, giving him a final kiss on the forehead and then looking at the sunrise.  This one orange.  Just like the boy's eyes.</span></div></div>",

I hope that explains almost everything, it's modified to some extent...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanet Vegeta, homeworld of the saiyan race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saiyans, one of the fiercest warrior races in the universe, had just beaten the Tuffles, and taken over planet Plant, renaming it to Planet Vegeta, after their king. Some time later, they had adapted advanced technology and conquered planets as mercenaries, for races that hadn't suitable planets, until they were conquered by Frieza's empire, and since that moment, they worked as part of his army. For years, they worked for him, conquering even planets, and this led to Frieza using them against a rival empire of his: The Jigokujin's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigokujin, an ancient and very powerful race. They had a gigantic empire and domain over many planets for millenniums, until Frieza's one appeared, and started a war against them. That war was going anywhere, and Frieza's forces failed at defeating the highly experienced Jigokujin, which indifference oh him, fought both the Jigokujin themselves and the rest of their soldiers from other planets. Frieza didn't want to fight them himself until he knew the true extent of their power, but now, with the saiyans under his orders, he sent them on war...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigokujin's planet was highly protected by powerful barriers, fleets of powerful spaceships, and many powerful warriors, thus, the attacks were first directed towards their subordinated planets, which provided them with resources. Every day, and every night, there were violent combats between saiyans, with some backup from other Frieza's soldiers, and the Jigokujin, and their subordinated soldiers as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day, a teenager (about 17 yrs old), called Broly, who had been labeled an outcast since his birth, and kept prisoner for most of his life, was taken to battle. The already somewhat insane teenager enjoyed the fight, and the blood, and soon transformed to something the Saiyans hadn't seen: His hair stood up in spikes, and looked reddish, and a golden aura surrounded him. He dashed at an amazing speed, breaking through the enemy's defenses with no problem, and started causing mass destruction all by himself. His fellow saiyans were shocked, he had been some sort of abnormal since his birth, but they didn't expect him to go that far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saiyans were even more shocked when they looked how Broly threw a green energy ball at the Jigokujin's main planet's energy shield, damaging it, and breaking it. After some seconds of shock, the saiyans cheered up and went to their space pods, and advanced into the planet. However, there wasn't precisely a welcoming committee awaiting for them, and they were received with heavy weaponry and energy blasts, which didn't damage the space pods though. One of the saiyans that  came out from his pod first was a tall man, with middle length black hair, and a scar that ran from above his left eyebrow, down to his left cheekbone level, in a straight line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing an almost typical black saiyan armor with 2 large shoulder plates, a black jumpsuit under it, with wrist and ankle guards, as well as dark blue fingerless gloves. He had some insignia in his chest armor and his right shoulder plate. After him, a female saiyan came out of her pod, this one was somewhat thin, with light brown long wavy hair and green eyes. She wore a black armor with a light green jumpsuit under it, and her armor lacked the shoulder plates. As soon as they got out of their pods, were attacked by the furious Jigokujin, but they simply deflected the ki blasts and countered with their own, as more and more saiyans landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigokujin were humanoid looking as well, but in difference of saiyans, their predominant hair color was either white, platinum or gray. Their eyes were ranged between red, orange and brown. Also, their canine teeth were longer than average standards. When engaged the saiyans in battle, it was shown that they were almost even, and the Jigokujin fought evenly against them. Until Broly arrived, the teenager became even more blood thirsty than the already blood thirsty saiyans, and transformed further, this time, his hair was golden, and his power increased even more. He started to cause havoc by himself (Although this planet was as large as Jupiter, so, it wasn't as much damage in proportion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome Jigokujin transformed as well, they grew black feathered wings, and also increased their power. They fought Broly 6 on 1, and Broly still had advantage for a while. Somewhere far enough from them, a male saiyan asked to the one who first landed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sir, what do we do with that kid?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let him fight. He's doing well. We'll attack the rest of the city and take whatever we can. This is going to be a long war...\"- The other saiyan answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, sir, have you seen his power level?\"- The saiyan asked to his superior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- The saiyan colonel seemingly hadn't, and pushed his scouter's button (btw, his scouter was transparent gray). It read 50,000. The saiyan leader was clearly surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The readings are right, sir... that boy has been always trouble...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* After this, take him and bring him back to planet Vegeta, the king must know about this...\"- The saiyan leader said more seriously, then his tone changed to a more cheerful one and said -\"In the mean time, let's keep up with the work...\"- And dashed to attack more of the Jigokujin (Even civilians can put up a fight against saiyans, but only soldiers are a serious threat)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was almost a big success, and as more saiyans arrived, the others returned to a nearly Frieza's planet to eat and rest. Among them, the saiyan leader and the female saiyan. They were eating at a table, as many other saiyans and aliens were. The female saiyan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Kailan*... I've been feeling... a bit... weird...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean? Are you tired?\"- The saiyan (Kailan) replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"N-no... it's just... weird...\"- She said, and Kailan suspected something, and put his scouter back on, pushed its button, and it beeped for a moment. Then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aha!! You have 2 power levels... do you know what that means, Sharotto?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- Sharotto asked, and Kailan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better go back to planet Vegeta...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Yeah...I know...\"- After finishing their food, Kailan went to a room with his wife, and slept, because they had grown somewhat tired by the battle, Jigokujin were very powerful enemies. Some hours later, loud noises woke Kailan up, and rushed outside to see what caused it, and what he saw was several saiyans trying to restrain Broly, who was no longer in the weird transformed form, but was still putting up a fight. A saiyan with a particular hairstyle appeared and managed to sumbit Broly, knocking him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jeez... that kid needs to learn some manners...\"- The saiyan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't precisely one to teach him that, Bardock\"- Kailan answered -\"So, he's the kid that was born with a power of 10,000...\"- Kailan added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* Yeah... he's quite a character...\"- Bardock said, crossing his arms -\"At least he broke through that damn planet's defenses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just before going nuts... Anyway, weren't you busy on a mission?\"- Kailan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. It was piece of cake, my crew is resting, we heard you had a big party here\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're just recovering from that. I bet you'll enjoy tomorrow\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you crazy?! I'm not gonna wait all night for this!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kailan? What happened?\"- Sharotto stepped out of the room groggily, and noticed he had company -\"Oh, Hi Bardock\"- She said, and yawned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBardock, who was still wearing the scouter, noticed it beeped, and that it read two power levels from her. He then playfully nudged Kailan twice and said -\"Hey!! It seems you weren't wasting your time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto blushed, and Kailan scratched the back of his head, laughing -\"It's strange to hear that from you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... it's not my thing...\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way, where are your kids?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea... well, Radditz is somewhere doing some minor mission with other saiyan children... and Kakarot is...\"- then he started mumbling, trying to remember -\"I don't remember, but he was sent to a weak planet, the little bastard was born with a power level of 2...\"- He said carelessly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You weren't precisely born as powerful as you're nowadays Bardock\"- Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. But even if it's true, that means Kakarot will need years of fighting if he ever wants to get out of the low class hole...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long has he been there?\"- Sharotto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I dunno... 4..5 years, who cares?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you should track him because that's a little too much even for a saiyan baby...\"- Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I will...\"- Bardock said, but his tone said he wouldn't. Kailan sighed and went back to sleep in a bed with his wife...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*I decided to go with the tradition of vegetable based names, don't ask...</b></font></span></div></div>",

After seeing that, Sharotto stayed, Bardock and Kailan went back to fight. The battles had become even more intense, and the Jigokujin were fiercely defending their planet. While taking a break from the fight, Kailan commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whew... this is really going to be a long war...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? Don't you want to fight a powerful race?\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I want!! But I don't want to risk important things because of this...\"- Kailan said, and Bardock put his hand on Kailan's shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's safe... Jigokujin are actually cornered, they can't afford attacking us while leaving their world defenseless...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe... but don't you think we should speed up this?\"- Kailan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hell yeah!!\"- Bardock* charged an energy ball in his left hand, and shouted to all saiyans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey everybody!! Stare at the sky!!\"- And threw upward the energy ball, which stood in place. The Jigokujin didn't really understand the meaning of that and assumed it was some sort of signal, until they looked at their enemies again, and started to transform into giant apes!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jigokujin were overwhelmed, and they assumed their transformations as well (grew wings and got a power increase), and an even more violent fight ensued, as the great apes caused mass destruction even more easily than before. Due to this, Jigokujin were forced to draw back all of their forces, leaving a great part of their empire un protected, and got conquered by Frieza's forces, while the Jigokujin were desperately fighting back at their home planet, which they had taken pride on, as a symbol of their power and wealth, as them and their empire, their planet was intact for thousands of years, heavily defended, and supposedly impregnable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 months passed, and despite all the battles, the Jigokujin were getting worn down slowly. While for the saiyans it was like a vacation, fighting all day, rest, fight again, and so on. Since that planet's moon hadn't appeared yet, they relied on their own false moons to transform. After other 6 months of carnage, the Jigokujin surrendered, and Frieza's higher ranked men told the Saiyan to go back to their planet and take some time off, while they secured the planet... something the saiyans didn't like very much, but didn't question orders anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to them, Frieza had a secret reunion with the Jigokujin royalty, where they started to discuss their terms. The Jigokujin king was covered in very thick armor, and nothing of him was visible. His voice sounded metallic although not mechanical. Nobody knew his true name, but he claimed the name of Omega the 17th (because of his dynasty, in which each king took the name Omega). Frieza was accompained by his henchmen, Zarbon and Dodoria, just in case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, well, well... you've called me personally to discuss your surrender terms\"- Frieza said, Omega nodded, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you want to stop this war, yes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No sense in making a mess when we can discuss everything as gentlemen...\"- Frieza answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll be subordinated to you, and we'll cede 70% of our empire. However, we will keep a small percentage that is vital to keep our civilization. Also, these planets will be under our orders, which leads to the following point: We'll work for you, but only if you let us keep our independence...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That seems quite reasonable\"- Frieza said, scratching his chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's one more last condition: Destroy those saiyan warriors...\"- Another Jigokujin noble said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think you're in position to demand so much...\"- Frieza said 'I already suspected about them'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we can keep going with the war, and it'll cost you more than it does for us...\"- Omega said, hitting the ground with his sword (The sword itself is very sharp, and can cut even the battle armors Frieza's soldiers use. However, the Jigokujin rely more on ki and melee combat, as well as technological weapons. This sword in particular belongs to the Omega Dynasty, and it's been in their family since their planet's foundation)  to emphasize<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine...\"- Frieza said, and signed a contract that stated the terms Omega said. After a polite hand shaking, Frieza left. The only reason he didn't attempt to destroy them all in one shot was because all of the nobles had power levels at least above 500,000. And Omega himself got a 1,550,000 reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to his ship, Frieza sat on a chair in the ship's flight deck, and while holding a glass of wine, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We were going to destroy the monkeys anyway. Zarbon... send only saiyans to any following mission we may get and when they're done, have teams of our best soldiers kill them. Team by team, and one by one... soon there will be no more monkeys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, lord Frieza\"- Zarbon quickly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to planet Vegeta, Bardock was accompanying Kailan at the nursery, where his wife, Sharotto, was giving birth. Bardock said, with a  bored tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can't we just come back when the damn baby is already born?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be like that. I want to see this moment...\"- Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the point, he'll be sent to some planet in very little time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"- Kailan said -\"I have enough authority to keep him/her from that. I want to train him/her myself, and when he/she becomes trong enough, then he/she will fight many successful battles...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You really need to go out more and do some battles\"- Bardock said, Kailan laughed at that. Some minutes later, a male baby with dark skin and long black hair was born, Sharotto was very tired and Kailan held the baby in his arms. Bardock facepalmed himself and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, I'm aware most of our fellow saiyans think I'm odd, but if they saw you like this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bah. Let me be, Bardock...\"- Kailan said while slowly rocking his child -\"In other planets, in different cultures, parents appreciate more their children... they appreciate giving birth to a living being that carries their blood, and, I dunno. It makes you feel special...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget what I said about previous missions, you seriously need to stay here until you remember you're a saiyan!!\"- Bardock said, although he was just joking, he knew that, when they were younger, Kailan got to see more of other cultures other than their armies. Since he was very smart and a good fighter, they educated him in several different planets, and their customs have seemingly influenced him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's just a crybaby, leave him there and let's get something to eat...\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe now he is, but one day, he will be a great warrior and will make me proud...\"- Kailan said, and Bardock asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way... What will be the kid's name?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Abakku\"- Kailan said -\"That was my father's name... I'd like he was still alive so he could see his grandchild...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. Your father was always nicer than the rest of us. He won many battles with brains rather than power, I have to give him that...\"- Bardock said, and pushed his scouter's button -\"Hmm... 1,820... maybe you're right, if trained, your child might become a great warrior... I almost envy you, Kakarot was born with a power level of 2\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I know\"- Kailan said, still rocking his child, then they were interrupted by Toma, who came in and told Bardock they had just got a mission at Planet Kanassa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tough one. I heard nobody wanted to do that mission...\"- Kailan said, leaving his child in Sharotto's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I bet you I can do this mission in less than 15 days\"- Bardock said -\"You'll have to pay a whole meal, I'll be hungry after this...\"- he said jokingly and left, while Kailan just waved his hand. He sat next to his wife, most of saiyans had time off, and only small teams had been assigned to missions, each one in planets far from each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* According to the wiki, Bardock claimed he's conscious of what he does while great ape...</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, it was probably because he lost too much blood...\"- A saiyan who was near him said -\"Wherever they sent him, it was a tough fight for sure...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKailan and Bardock were now more worried, and went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't tell me this just happened!!\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know...\"- Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going to go get back my crew before something ugly happens!!\"- Bardock rushed outside again to get a pod, Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm coming with you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No. Get our people together. Don't let anyone out!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Kailan went back inside, while Bardock left. He spoke to all the guards, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got new orders. All missions are cancelled until further notice. Let everyone in, but nobody out\"- The guards saluted and followed this new order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKailan didn't want to start any panic yet, but he was discreetly rounding up as much saiyans as possible. He also checked to verify that wounded ones were getting healed. He was walking around and it could be noticed that he was deeply concerned. A male saiyan with light brown hair interrupted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Kailan!! What's with the big rush?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yousei!! Uhm... it... it's nothing...\"- Kailan answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're worried about something...\"- Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll sound crazy... and you'll laugh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bardock had a vision about Frieza destroying us, and less than 5 minutes later, a fellow saiyan arrived, bled to death, but before dying, he shouted something about that Frieza killed his team...\"- Kailan said, Yousei had a very shocked face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know, you don't believe it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think you'd tell me such a thing if it were a lie...\"- Yousei said -\"So, what can we do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"King Vegeta and Nappa are out on missions. I ordered to cancel all missions and not let any saiyan out...\"- Kailan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who else knows?\"- Yousei asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bardock, you, me, and our dead comrade...\"- Kailan said -\"Until we have some proof, I'd rather to not tell everyone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where's Bardock?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He went to get his crew back, before something happens...\"- Kailan said to Yousei<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all saiyans were informed that the missions were cancelled and that there would be no new missions until further notice. Most of them were mad at that. Meanwhile, Bardock was shocked to find all of his comrades dead, and Toma told him what happened before dying. Bardock swore to avenge all f them and fought Frieza's elite soldiers. He fought and defeated them, but faced Dodoria, who nearly killed him. Luckily, he left before verifying Bardock's status. He managed to get back to his pod and arrived very wounded at Planet Vegeta. He rushed to a room where many saiyans were eating and resting, and spread the word about the impending danger. Because of his panic and his status, they regard him as crazy and laugh at him. Then Kailan arrived with Yousei, and they spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen to him!! What he's said is true!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon, Kailan, did you really fall for Bardock's lies? He just met his match on a typical mission... nothing to worry about...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not too long ago, another of our comrades bled to death after just arriving, and he said the same. Listen, because if we don't we'll die, and we are saiyans!! Will you stay here and calmly get killed or will you fight back?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of saiyans started to mutter about what to do, and Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No saiyan dies without a fight... where's your saiyan pride?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd finally shouted in agreement. And they started to check the radars... indeed, several spaceships were heading for their planet, some of them were Frieza's, but the others... the others belonged to the Jigokujin. This angered the saiyans, and Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See? Frieza has joined the Jigokujin, our enemies, against us!! We were the ones who worked for him, we didn't question his orders, and always did our best, and that's how we're paid?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saiyans readied for combat, and started flying massively. Bardock was about to go, but Kailan stopped him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You did it... we'll fight back, all of us together, our saiyan brothers saw the light of truth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Y-yeah...\"- Bardock fainted, and was taken to infirmary to a healing tank. Kailan and Yousei still stayed behind, as they were organizing the attack, and constantly received information about their fighting numbers. The ships released several thousands of soldiers, and the saiyans started the battle at their atmosphere. Initially, over 350,000 saiyans went to fight, despite the saiyan population was much larger, Kailain decided to keep reserves. They were doing well against Frieza's soldiers, but started to get overwhelmed when the Jigokujin deployed their own army, and Kailan ordered a reinforcement of 300,000 more saiyans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat battle was a real carnage, All saiyans, combining their power, were proving themselves superior to Frieza's henchmen, and were putting up a fight against the Jigokujin soldiers. However, back at the planet, Kailan and Yousei were shocked when they identified one of the ships as Frieza's personal ship, which meant Frieza came himself to exterminate them. However, Kailan and Yousei decided not to panic, but informed their comrades<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Brothers. This may be our greatest battle. Frieza, as we know, is a really powerful being, but let's not forget that he's afraid of us!! If we unite, we WILL defeat him, and we WILL succeed!! Let\u00b4s fight to the last breath, with Saiyan honor!!\"- Kailan said through his scouter, targeted to all saiyans. But Yousei called him to talk in private, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe that was too optimistic... remember what Bardock predicted?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If he could see that, maybe we can change it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And maybe we can't... listen, I don't know if this will work, but, if we fail, we'll be extinct... I have a backup plan...\"- Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"While we're fighting, we'll send all of our children to the weakest planets in the universe. There's no way Frieza may ever wipe us out they're spread...\"- Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... but...\"- Kailan hesitated about such a decision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If we succeed, we'll track them down the launching records of this computer. It says who are and where they were sent...\"- Yousei said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, do it...\"- Kailan said, feeling somewhat defeated, but it was true, they couldn't guarantee they'd win such a battle. The computer started analyzing its database and showed the planets with the weakest inhabitants... They started sending saiyan children almost randomly among these planets. Yousei went to his room, and explained his wife the situation, she carried in her arms a female baby with light brown hair and hazel eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And that's why we need to send all saiyan children to somewhere safe...\"- Yousei explained his wife, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I'd prefer to know that she'll live at least...\"- She brought her baby closer to her face and said with some sadness -\"Forgive us for this, Reinari...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was seemingly confused by her mother's reaction, but couldn't understand, she was just 1 year old. They put her in a pod and sent her away into the space, to some planet far enough from there. Kailan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, were did you send your daughter?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A planet called Earth. It's very small, but has a nice weather, rich variety of plants and animals, and inhabited by very weak people. She'll be safe there...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can you give me the coordinates? I want to send little Abakku there too\"- Kailan asked, and when Yousei gave him the coordinates, started typing in the computer, fixing a similar course....</span></div></div>",

Also, readings indicated it was unstable, and may be a threat in the near future. He is to be executed...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yousei!!\"- Kailan called him and showed him the screen -\"You sent that kid to Earth as well!! He's another mutant like Broly!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His unstable power is making the pod to malfunction, he probably won't make it to that planet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I really hope so. If not, you've just sentenced my son and your daughter to death...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt that will happen... it's as improbable as to think that my daughter and your son will ever meet. That planet is big enough for that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd prefer that they met... if we die... at least they can restore the species...\"- Said a more concerned Kailan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You say that just because daughter's parents pay the wedding...\"- Yousei replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKailan was about to say something, when a great explosion shook the place, and noticed that Frieza had sent even more soldiers. The computers were sending all children in pods as fast as they could but they'd need some time to do so, and Kailan went outside, followed by Yousei. Kailan said (intending to himself, but the others heard him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is it!! It's now or never!! I'll fight, no matter if I die or if I live...\"- Then he pushed another button in his scouter, and said -\"Calling all saiyans in reserve... Frieza is about to go out on us. No more games!! We'll fight to the last breath for our planet, for us, and for our saiyan pride!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard some steps and next to him was Bardock, nearly completely healed (It's been roughly 6 hours since the attack started). He was wearing a red headband, which Kailan didn't recognize at first, and almost reading his mind, Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's Toma's armband, stained with my crew's blood. This is the symbol of my promise. I will avenge them!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the rest of the saiyan population, Bardock, Kailan and Yousei flew toward the skies, encountering with Frieza's and Jigokujin's army. They fought their way through them, while looking at the massive battle that ensued. Saiyans were fighting at their best, and their number, despite being lower than their enemies', still overwhelmed them. Saiyans had truly become one of the strongest races in universe. Bardock was tormented by some more visions, but didn't tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept fighting many opponents, killing dozens, maybe even hundreds of Frieza's soldiers. They also encountered with some Jigokujin soldiers, which gave them more of a fight. Despite that, Bardock, Yousei and Kailan managed to get in front of everyone, facing Frieza, who had just gotten out of his ship. Bardock flew a bit forward, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Frieza!!... Listen up!!... We Quit!!... All of us!! Got it?!! ...We dont work for you!!. We're free. You can find someone else to do your dirty work.... Oh yeah, there is one last thing... This is for all the people that we killed in your name. I wish we were never foolish enough to obey you. Here!! Have it!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBardock charged a powerful energy ball in his hand, and while he spoke to Frieza. However, he listened to the saiyan's speech patiently. Meanwhile, the Jigokujin soldiers withdrew from the battle, and Frieza formed a supernova, which absorbed Bardock's attack, and released it. However, Kailan and Yousei shot energy beams at it, and were followed by the many saiyans that were fighting. They knew about the backup plan, and didn't really care as much for their children, but bought them time anyway so the saiyan blood didn't die in this battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll saiyans were struggling against Frieza's colossal supernovat seem to bother, he was rather amused at the efforts of the warrior race. Zarbon and Dodoria merely witnessed. While the Jigokujin were angered, in their months of war against the saiyan race, they saw how tough were they, and that together they were more than a threat. However, both them and Frieza failed to notice the numerous space pods that were being sent toward many different planets labeled as inhabited by weak species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes of struggling, the Jigokujin grew tired of seeing the saiyans fighting for their life and started firing energy blasts at them (They were fully focused in using all their energy in the beams to counter the supernova). Some of the saiyans stopped firing eneergy and flew toward the Jigokujin attempting to fight them, but found that they weren't able to defeat them before the supernova destroyed their planet. Also, some of the saiyans started to realize that it was a lost battle, no matter how long they kept trying, thus, while nearly half of them still struggled trying to repel the supernova, the others decided to die fighting, and engaged the Jigokujin in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKailan, Bardock, and Yousei, who knew this, and were firing energy beams at the supernova, decided to keep doing so until the last of the pods escaped. As the saiyans kept fighting, they started to get killed by the Jigokujin and Frieza's soldiers. And with more saiyan deaths, there were less saiyans to oppose reistance to the gigantic energy sphere. Also, they endured constant energy blasts from the Jigokujin, and some more fellow saiyans died while trying to focuse into repelling the supernova...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Frieza decided that it was enough and aiming his hand at the supernova, started to push it forward with invisible energy. Yousei, Bardock and Kailan were in the front, and were the first to be hit by it. Yousei and Kailan struggled against the burning energy with their bare hands, and Kailan was so desperate that his hair rose up, and was surrounded by a golden aura. He kept trying to push away the supernova, as it slowly advanced, dragging even more saiyans and more of Frieza's soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBardock, who had been doing nothing, put his hands on Yousei and Kailan's shoulders, and the three of them had a vision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They were standing in an unknown planet, which had grass, trees and an ocean. Something about that environment felt like it was a dying planet, then, they noticed, Frieza, sitting in his hover chair, just like now. And before him, they saw three people standing in front of him: In the middle, a tall man, nearly identical to Bardock, although with fairer skin, wearing orange clothing, blue boots. At his right side stood another guy, one with dark skin, wearing a brown jacket and black jeans. When they looked at his face, they noticed a scar, identical to that of Kailan, although in the opposite eye. Also, he had a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a girl, with light brown wavy hair, dressed with a white shirt and blue jeans. She also had a tail. These three stood in front of Frieza</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saiyan trio finally understood, and each one of them muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ka...kakarot...\"- Bardock said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe it... is that Abakku? My son...\"- Kailan, who was pleasantly surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Reinari... my girl...\"- Yousei also muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of that last vision, Kailan and Yousei muttered -\"Thanks... Bardock...\"- Before being totally incinerated, these three saiyans died in peace, being assured that their deaths, and their fellow saiyans' would be avenged, someday... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supernova incinerated the majority of the saiyans who fought back, and crashed into planet Vegeta, burying in its core, blowing it up, as Frieza laughed and congratulated himselfn enjoying the \"fireworks\" before leaving in his ship to continue business as usual. In a single day, the powerful saiyan race was apparently wiped out. The Jigokujin weren't as festive as the new space tyrant, but felt relieved of eliminating the one race that may have been a threat to them. They also resumed their life, living like captive nobility, allowed to keep their lifestyle and customs in a much smaller portion of what was once a thousands years old empire, thought to be invincible, and proud of itself. They would conspire one day to claim everything and more back, but they'd need to wait...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were at least three saiyan space pods which were sent to Earth. Despite what Yousei thought, the mutant saiyan not only did make it to the blue planet, but also, his unstable energy altered the course of the other two pods, thus, they landed in practically the same place, separated by some miles (They were expected to be far away from each other). Makotsu's pod landed somewhere in Siberia, and was caught by scientists, who had witnessed a strange object fall from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey discovered that the child wasn't human, and started running tests on him, which was very difficult, as he seemingly damaged electronic devices with some sort of energy pulse. They ran a lot of tests on him, and kept him secret in a military base. They also nicknamed him Ivan, because it's a common Russian name... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to teach him to behave like a human but they failed, and he was clearly hostile, even as a baby, so, they had to restrain him with the best they had. However, as he grew up, he was becoming more powerful and more difficult to restrain, so, by when he was 10 years old he was frozen in a special cryogenic tank and the scientists ran even more tests with his blood and DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found that it was compatible with human DNA despite being different, and they suggested that he was an alien from a species heavily related to humans themselves. However, his DNA and blood samples were very unstable and this lead some of them to believe that he was a mere mutant, this theory failed at explaining why did he come from an unknown spaceship... And an alien mutant was just too rare to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 years later, even frozen, Ivan's power was too much, and the machines stopped working due to his immense power (although its growth was slowed down a lot for the 5 years he was frozen). He broke free, and slaughtered every living being in the area. Then he destroyed the whole military base and escaped. Russian government claimed that it was an accident with missiles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other side of Earth, the other two children landed as well. Both of them got hit in the head while landing, because of the malfunction Ivan's power caused tot heir pods. Kailan's son, Abakku, was raised by an old woman who happened to see what looked like a comet falling from the sky, and was very surprised to find a small round spaceship with a baby inside, as well as many strange things, what looked to be a full armor set, and a note written in an unknown language. The baby had a tail... and the old woman could only assume that the kid came from another planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the kid as her own grandchild, she named him Blake, after her dead husband, and kept all the armor, a strange device that seemed to be some sort of monocle, and the note in a chest. She also found that if she squeezed the child's tail, he'd be unable to move and suffered pain. Thus, she didn't want to cut it, and decided to toughen it by accustoming it to soft squeezes, then stronger, until squeezing it with pliers caused him nothing... This took her over 4 years to accomplish, though this method left a side effect Blake will learn later in his life. She also taught him to read and to write, and additionally, to keep his tail always secret when outside, and never tell anyone about it. Sadly, she died when Blake reached 10 years old, and ever since he has been forced to live on his own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYousei's daughter had better luck. She landed near a mansion, belonging to a scientist and his wife. They found strange that a spaceship crashed into their backyard and it contained a baby girl with a monkey tail... Almost any scientist's dream (in the sense of finding an alien baby). The pod also included what seemed to be an armor set. The scientist kept it safe but he'd run some tests on it. Also, in difference of what many scientists would do, he decided not to make public his finding, and decided to raise her instead. They named her Joana, after his wife's mother... The scientist would soon find that she required a lot more of food than a regular human, but he was rich enough to sustain her needs. He had invented a lot of devices and his wife was in charge of the corporation that sold and distributed them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also found that her strength and speed were far above any living known person on Earth, and since her childhood, he trained her, though not so much because he still felt it shouldn't be so tough for a girl, even an alien girl. He and his wife also taught her to read, to write, and to keep her tail, real nature and real strength secret. The scientist felt it was a crime to attempt to remove it, because he didn't know what effect may such a thing have in an alien body which apparently needed that tail... However, he also discovered that her tail might be a weak point, and when she grew to 7 years old started to try to strengthen her tail. He also found a strange reaction in her blood cells when exposed to moonlight, while testing her in her very first days, so, he never let her to be exposed to the moon,and her room had windows made of a special glass that blocked any radiation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after 16 years, Blake and Joana will start high school...</span></div></div>",

It's also been told what happened to each one of them, and now, two of them will start high school*...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather boring day for Blake, he wasn't feeling good, but it had been years he had felt like that. He was always pale and looked weak, and still, he was stronger than many people. Being at high school meant nothing to him, he was just a new guy who would probably be picked on, and he'd have to fight again, as he used to do when he was at elementary. Fortunately for him, theere wouldn't be any homework in the first week to get the new generation of students used... which meant a lot of free time to \"interact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate this already' Blake thought, and he had just endured 3 classes, then the bell rang and everyone went for lunch. Blake didn't rush, as he had no money to spend on another extra food. And he was alone anyway, and ended up sitting in a table located farthest, in a corner. He didn't mind. And unknown to him, his presence already had caught someone's attention, but he wouldn't realize, and would just keep being by himself. When the bell rang again, they came back to the classroom, and there were even more classes, 4 to be exact. Blake was nearly fainting by the end of the last one, he never had an explanation for his illness, and he was taught by his grandma that he couldn't get medical tests because of his tail, and that he may end up at government's secret bases and be experimented on or something... And Blake hated medical stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake went to his locker to put away his stuff and closed it, just to find a guy taking away a backpack from a girl. While he didn't even know the girl, he recognized the guy, who studied in the same elementary school Blake came from, and knew he was up to no good, he sighed and walked toward them (Despite being tall, he was rather unnoticed by the majority of people, which Blake considered good). He thought of using speed to hit the guy and get away anonymously, so he wouldn't have to explain anything, and tried to, he punched the bully in the stomach, but couldn't get away, as his speed was really limited because of his condition...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha?!!\"- The guy had the wind knocked out of him, and fell backward. Blake took the backpack and when he turned around, the girl was staring at him. He extended his arm with the hand that was holding the backpack. She slowly reached and grabbed it, and Blake looked away, it was one of these uncomfortable silences, and for Blake, the consequences of getting himself into others' business...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that silence was cut off, literally, as the bully got up and attempted slashing Blake with a knife... he almost missed... but hit Blake's left arm, which immediately bled (Again, Blake's body is really weakened). Blake punched him twice in the stomach with his right fist, hit him also with his knee, he fell backward again but kicked Blake, so he fell down as well, and since he had nearly run out of all strength he had left, now he was at the mercy of the bully, who got up and kicked his ribs, Blake tried to kick him back but the bully caught his leg, and while Blake was pitifully trying to get away, the bully pulled him and punched him more in the ribs, until Blake spat out blood. Blake managed to punch him in the face and tried to get up, but the bully tackled him and started punching him in the face frantically...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stopped, and Blake saw that the girl just knocked him out with a single hit in the back of the neck... She also tossed him aside, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...It seems my presence here was more than unnecessary...ugh...\"- And fainted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, he was under a tree's shadow, and the first thing he saw was the girl's face, from a different angle... then he realized that his head was resting on her lap, and he got up quickly. He checked his arm, which was bandaged with fabric, which corresponded to the girl's missing sleeve. Blake turned around, and said weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"T...Thanks...\"- But what he got for an answer was an incredibly strong hug, which felt like crushing all of his bones. Blake opened his eyes wide because he realized that if the girl was that strong he did an unnecessary intervention, and ended up hurting himself, not that he really cared. The girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm glad that you're alright!! I was worried!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Worried?!... but you don't even know me...\"- Blake said, and the girl replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not much, but I know that your name is Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're in the same classes and it was written in that silver tag you wear...\"- She said, and Blake felt suddenly stupid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... thanks for the bandage...\"- Blake said, and wanted to leave, because he didn't know what to do in such a situation, however, the girl didn't let him go, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks to you... you got into this trouble because of me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem...\"- Blake said, and this time the girl broke the hug, which had amde Blake uncomfortable, however, the girl still held his arm, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Joana\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... alright... nice to meet you...\"- Blake said, feeling awkward about the whole situation, and left. Only some minutes later he realized that it was 3:00 PM, which meant he had been knocked out for 2 hours... he somewhat felt bad for seeming ungrateful, but Blake wasn't used to have anyone near his personal space... and so, he returned to his house (formerly, his grandma's, but there was nobody else to claim it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*And with high school I mean 10th grade. </b></span></div></div>",

He had just an apple, and that would have to do, though his thoughts were interrupted by Joana sitting in front of him in the same table. He raised an eyebrow and asked in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wrong table?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- However, Joana got it and replied -\"Nope, this is where you sat yesterday...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good...\"- Blake put his hand in his forehead, as he was having a headache. Which Joana noticed, as well as his pale skin (it was obvious he had a darker tone, I mean, his skin has an unhealthy pale tone...) and the fact that he got a lot of damage with relatively few hits the previous day. She noticed that he was eating an apple, and there was no tray nor anything that indicated he ate anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... Blake...\"- She said a bit shyly, and Blake stopped, also confused, and after swallowing, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't you hungry?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question sort of confused Blake even more. He was eating... but he knew that it was rather an excuse of a food... his whole body felt like it was falling apart because of this. His wounds took a lot to heal, he had an extremely low stamina, and a few hits made him spit out blood... Blake sensed in Joana's look that she noticed this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I'm eating right now...\"- Blake said, and looked down, he wasn't used t talking to other people very much, and while his interaction with people in school was either superficial (teachers) or hostile (most of male students), he only really talked to his grandma, which died 6 years ago... Blake was pretty much completely alone. And he didn't really want to share his trouble to a girl he just met by merely stopping a bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You... you don't have enough money, do you?\"- Joana hit the nail, and Blake opened his eyes wide for a moment, just to look away, and remained silent, unable to answer, but his eyes were saying that he didn't want to tell anything. She already knew the answer, but wanted to know why, and Blake answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are many reasons I don't want to explain and you don't want to hear, so, let's leave it like this and pretend this conversation never happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know I don't want to hear them?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Simple, nobody can be interested in someone they met randomly the day before...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Joana -\"...To be honest I know nobody else too...\"- She added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? Really? I thought you were some sort of cheerleader or something...\"- Bake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know. I just thought you were one...\"- Blake didn't want to tell further, but it is known for most people that usually good-looking girls are either in cheerleading or some sports team...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I'm new here too... and cheerleading is not my thing...\"- Joana said, and Blake had practically nothing else to say, she had no other friends either<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't make much friends sitting here...\"- Blake said, finishing his apple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need many friends, and I already have one...\"- She replied with a n.n face, Blake remained silent, again, he didn't know what to do in such a situation. Nobody had called him their friend, and he definitively didn't knew what he should do or say, so, his only option was to stay silent, but after seeing Joana's look, he felt that he needed to say something, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I...I really....don't know what to say...\"- Blake said apologetically, and Joana smiled, but then, she gave him her tray with her lunch (she hadn't touched her food yet), and Blake stared at her in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't accept this... I mean... what will you eat then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. One day without lunch won't kill me...\"- She said cheerfully, and Blake ate rather quickly (he was hungry), when he was done she added -\"Don't worry. I'll get lunch for you from now on...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Blake couldn't understand why Joana was so willing to spend money on food for him. -\"...You don't have to...\"- He said quietly, and Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you. Don't worry...\"- The bell rang, and they walked together back to their classroom. Blake noticed that several guys were staring at him as if they wanted to kill him, but again, he was the new guy, so, he guessed it was because of that, and ignored them. The classes went on until the last one, which was sciences, and the teacher assigned homework <i>(Although most of teachers don't assign homework in the first week, and it was somewhat of a non-written rule, sciences teacher bypassed this and assigned homework by the 2nd or 3rd day)</i>, which was to be done in pairs. Most of the students were very quick to form their duos, remaining only Blake alone, the teacher noticed this, and walked toward him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Again... I'm the guy with no team... either this man is going to scold me or tell me to be more social, or worse, to join to an already formed group... dammit....' Blake thought, and the teacher asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake? Who are you going to work with?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!! I... I-uh.... uhhh...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head, and said -\"...Myself?\"- The teacher shook his head, and sighed, he knew Blake was from a different school, so he was the new guy compared to most of students who came from the same elementary. He also had already noticed Blake being not social at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... You really need to work on your social skills. You can't always rely on yourself...\"- He started lecturing him, while Blake thought 'That's been my life for the last 6 years...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"... You need to meet some people, I don't know, make some friends... people you can trust....\"- His tone changed from serious to an advising one -\"This is usually life's best stage, you have fun, specially with friends, and becomes a time people remembers for the rest of his life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Then I guess I'll have to...\"- Blake started to say, but was interrupted by Joana, who was next to him, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry sir, He'll be working with me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!!\"- Blake and the teacher were confused by this, and Joana winked at Blake, then, she said to the teacher<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry for not telling, I was writing down the last notes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...Alright... no problem then...\"- The teacher was surprised because he hadn't noticed Joana being alone as well, and knew that she actually saved Blake from ending in a random group. He walked back to his desk thinking 'Blake may not be social, but at least he's lucky...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When did I...?\"- Blake was about to ask Joana about her sudden decision, she winked at him again, and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I couldn't think of anyone else to work with...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed a lot but quickly covered his face with a book, pretending to be reading, and he said in his mind 'What the hell is wrong with me?! Why do I feel embarrassed?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you have anything to do after class?\"- Joana said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...No...why?\"- Blake answered slowly, to prevent stuttering, as he was feeling weird by Joana's attitude<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we can go to my house to do the homework...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HER HOUSE?!! Alright, Blake, calm down... it's not like you are her boyfriend or something.... WTF?!! Why am I thinking such a thing?! Anyway, as long as you are nothing beyond a friend, you're safe from her parents...' (Blake knew girls' parents usually went beast on their boyfriends, by watching when walking by, not that he really was watching, but some times the girls' fathers' shouts were simply too loud to be ignored...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... you look paler...\"- Joana said worried, and Blake said frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don'tworryit'snothingtoworryabout....\"- He calmed down and added -\"It was nothing, just stupid me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana giggled, despite he said it seriously, it somehow sounded cute to her, and she realized (as anyone with 2% of brain would) that Blake was worried and blushing. However, she knew she was the one to worry about certain things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class continued for some more minutes and the bell rang again, Blake went to his locker, and was followed by Joana, whose locker was close to his. After they put away their stuff, they walked out of school...</span></div></div>",

It had been Joana, and she said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We needed to go around this corner... you didn't hear me, did you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I was trying to learn the way...\"- Blake said, and Joana giggled, she added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't bother me taking you here...\"- Again, Blake blushed and looked away, because in all this time she hadn't let go his hand. They walked for some more time (roughly 20 min) until they got in front of a really large mansion, and Joana opened the gate by dialing a password, while Blake stared with a O_O face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just my luck...' He thought, he was expecting a more normal house so his economic situation wasn't so noticeable, but to Blake, this wasn't just his day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, here we are\"- Joana said and entered, still pulling Blake by the hand, who had somehow forgotten about that, nor remembered, and whispered to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! Don't you think...uh...that...well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"- Joana asked, and Blake gulped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're still holding hand... I don't think your parents would be too happy to see this...\"- Blake said nervously, and scratched the back of his head with the other hand. Joana released his hand and blushed a bit, though Blake didn't notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry\"- She said quietly, then after walking some more, they finally got to the house, Joana opened the door and they went inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm home!!\"- She said loudly, and a blonde woman came in, seemingly from her room, and greeted her, then she looked at Blake, who was standing a few feet behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, hello! You must be Blake...\"- She said, and Blake was rather surprised, but greeted back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... Hi...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana already told us about you. Thank you very much, I guess it's still difficult to be the new guys at school......\"- She said to him, and then he realized that the woman was Joana's mom, despite she looks nothing like her. He also paled even more because he didn't really expect Joana to tell her parents about a guy she barely knows. Joana's mom noticed that Blake was very different from average guys, and his behavior was that of a shier one, despite his tougher look... also, he looked pale and unhealthy, as if he lived in poverty, then, she realized that Blake was intimidated by their lifestyle. She went back to her room, and Joana said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... I guess I owe you a few explanations...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not necessary, if you don't want to...\"- Blake said, but Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I want to. And I think you deserve to hear them, you didn't even know who I am when you saved me...\"- She said, blushing a bit more -\"Well, my father is a scientist, and does lots of different stuff, my mom runs the company that sells and distributes his technology... That's the short version...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I understand, no problem...\"- Blake said, and thought 'Whoah... These people have CapsuleCorp* technology level...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My dad may help us to do our homework...\"- Joana said, and Blake nodded in agreement, thinking 'Now that I know he's a very brilliant scientist, it makes perfect sense...', and felt suddenly being dragged by Joana, who was dragging him by the hand, and took him to a laboratory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure I should be here? I don't want your father to be mad at us...\"- Blake said, though he really meant \"Me\" instead of \"Us\", he also thought again that Joana was stronger than a normal girl for sure... could it be her father's doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course!! There are many computers and we can use them...\"- Joana said as if it was an everyday thing, with a n_n face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came in and Blake saw a black haired man, seemingly in his early thirties, typing in an impressive looking computer, one with 5 screens, and what looked like a huge CPU (Blake knows of computers, he repairs them as a job... didn't you wonder how an orphan managed to pay high school studies?). Joana greeted him, and he almost jumped of his chair. He quickly turned off the screens and greeted back at Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What were you doing?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... A personal project...\"- Her father said, rather nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Well, I got homework about sciences and I wondered if you can help us...\"- She said, and he raised an eyebrow at her saying \"us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake will work with me\"- She said, again, in a little too natural way from Blake's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... hi...\"- Blake said, not really knowing what to do, and both of them stared at each other with confused looks. Then Joana's father seemed to remember<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I remember now!! So, you're the one who saved my daughter from those bullies?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dad!!\"- Joana was for the first time embarrassed by how her father stated facts, while Blake remained silent and shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Some things never change... I hated bullies back when I was at school...\"- Joana's father said, and remembered how many times he ended up beaten up, with his homework stolen, or forced to do others' homework, or simply getting beaten for the heck of it... That's why he learned martial arts when he was a teenager (more exactly at 17 years old)... -\"They seem to sink lower each generation... the bullies of my time didn't attack girls at least...\"- He muttered, then he said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thank you personally. You have no idea how much trouble you saved Joana from...\"- He said and sounded honest, although he thought 'He saved everyone of knowing Joana's real strength... and us from moving...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...No problem...\"- Blake said, once more unsure about what to say, though that answer seemed to be okay. Joana's father then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, what's the topic of the homework?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm...\"- Joana started checking her notes -\"It's about hybrids and interbreeding...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of topic is that?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, it's very interesting. When compatible species interbreed, their hybrid descendants are usually superior to both of parents' species. However, this behavior is highly unlikely in nature, and species aren't really attracted to different ones. To put it easy, a lion won't go with tigresses as long as there are lionesses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow, that's just about half of the homework...\"- Joana said, and was writing in her notebook<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The results are impressive when done correctly. Back to my little example: A lioness + a tiger = a tigon... which is in fact slightly inferior to both species... but, a lion + a tigress = a liger, which is an enormous feline, obviously far stronger than the rest of natural species...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aren't hybrids sterile?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not all of them. Usually hybrids are sterile because their parents have a different number of chromosomes, which makes a sort of a mess, let's say a hybrid's father was 78 chromosomes, and the mother has 80... given that the hybrid would inherit half of each, he'd end up with 79... and despite the hybrid advantages, it's a genetic mess... However, some hybrids can be perfectly normal if are the result of even more compatible species that happen to share their chromosome number...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's impressive, but, isn't it still a bit unnatural?\"- Blake asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Technically yeah... in terms of animals is easier, although they are attracted to their own species and only breed with others when there aren't others of their own. And still they seek a genetically closest as possible mate. In sentient beings, it's more complicate, given that there are emotions and free will, but still, their own species' opposite sex's pheromones have a stronger effect than other species'...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. Thank you very much dad, I think this will do...\"- Joana closed her notebook, and said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Would you like to have dinner with us?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! But... uhh... it's just 4:30 PM...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can stay here until it's time...\"- Joana replied, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Won't your family be uncomfortable about dinning with a stranger?**\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't see the problem... And I doubt Sarah would be bothered either...\"- Joana's father said (Sarah is Joana's [adoptive] mother' name)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, if that's alright with you...\"- Blake said, then a loud grumbling was heard, and Joana blushed slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you go get some snack? I have some more things to work on...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sure\"- Joana said, and dragged Blake again, grabbing his hand. Joana's father noticed this, he also knew that usually guys from her previous school attacked her a lot, and that she never had a friend before, but he expected a girl... also, Blake had an unhealthy look to himself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*Since this is Dragon Ball Universe, I assume CapsuleCorp is a huge corporation in the technology area, but, who said it wouldn't have rivals?<br>\r\n** I know this may vary in other places, but unfortunately it's a negative common stereotype here.

'I doubt just an apple would do for her...' He thought, and when he realized they were outside, there were many different trees, most of them with different fruits, also, he noticed that Joana was no longer next to him, and noticed that she was eating several fruits while on a tree's branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured him to come with her, and he jumped to a nearby branch. This tree had a fruit unknown to Blake (I don't know what is supposed to look like, but it's similar to this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=20tp8v6&amp;s=7\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=20tp8v6&amp;...</a> ). Blake had sen them but he had no idea what they were, he only knew that they were too expensive for him. Joana also told him to eat with gestures, and he did so... strangely... the fruit had a very similar taste to cooked meat, although with a lime-like touch. Also, it was way better as a food than Blake's everyday foods (which are both too poor in quality and in very small quantities)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake allowed himself to eat another fruit. He even felt his entire body functioning at 100%, and his muscles tightened for a brief moment, before going back to normal, something a bit weird but considering he had eaten a decent food in a very long time, he didn't pay attention to this. Unknown to him, Joana perceived this as well, and that he no longer looked pale after some minutes... which was weird... like all he needed was to eat more... she smiled, relieved that he didn't seem to be really sick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Joana and Blake were done (Blake didn't pay attention to how many fruits she ate), they jumped down from the tree, and Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You hadn't eaten these fruits before?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...No... I have eaten nothing costing more than 100 zenny...\"- He replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"100 zenny? What can you eat with 100 zenny?\"- Joana was more worried than she thought she'd be<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Precisely...\"- Blake replied -\"But it doesn't matter... I've been like that for my entire life, so, there's no problem...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem?! Blake, you can't just be used to that!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like I have a choice... I don't get too much money from my jobs and I need to pay electricity and other stuff as well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We... I guess you're right...\"- Joana said, she then said -\"But I'll keep my promise, I'll bring lunch for you at least...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, I don't want to sound mean, but let's be honest: Your family's lifestyle is way different than mine, and it's obvious I'm nowhere near yours... Do you really think your parents would give away free food to a stranger? Even if they do, it would be because of you, and they would be secretly mad at me, and I don't like that kind of help...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said, and this time, Joana remained silent, she really wanted to help him. Then, after another uncomfortable silence, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... We've done most of the homework, do you want to check my notes?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess so\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and her went back to the living room and Blake started reading Joana's notes and writing in his own notebook. They didn't know that Joana's parents had heard most of the conversation, nor that they were watching them from the distance. Joana's mother (Sarah) asked to her husband<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you think, John?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Well... the boy doesn't seem to be the typical hormone driven teenager...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He seems a bit sensitive about being poor... I wonder how does he live like... But besides that, look closer...\"- Sarah said, and John scratched his head in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're... doing homework? What's with that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems our girl likes him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?! What?!\"- John was now even more confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're good in sciences, but you've always been dense to more personal things, silly...\"- Sarah said, then she added, giggling -\"But I liked that in you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have the feeling Blake doesn't know either...\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Men...\"- Sarah said, and laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But... what's she going to do about her...\"- John wondered, but Sarah interrupted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Tail?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...yeah... that and the rest of her other alien traits... like the amounts of food she eats... and her strength... but mostly the tail...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll talk to her about it...\"- Sarah said, then she added -\"...And you said she wouldn't like a human because of her being an alien...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I said she would be less attracted to humans because she's from a different species... unless...\"- He started scratching his chin thoughtfully, and Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better don't do anything that embarrasses or annoys her... You have that 'scientific' look...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Alright...\"- But he thought 'It's not really likely anyway, I mean... how can I believe the first guy Joana meets happens to be another alien?... meh...' However, he almost scolded himself mentally 'It wouldn't hurt to verify that!! You're a man of science, and anyway, if the boy is human, no damage will be done... unless they find out...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that his wife seemed to be happy about Joana. Now that he was focusing, he noticed her grabbing Blake's hand and giving him a warm look, although Blake didn't realize, he was focused reading and writing. Almost reading her husband's mind, Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You shouldn't be surprised, he's just as dense as you were back at high school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- John was caught in that point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... let's leave them alone...\"- Sarah said, and started to head for her room (not where they sleep, it's another room where she has some computers, papers and a phone, and where she works for most of the time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you say so...\"- John said, and headed for his lab<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Blake was using Joana's notes to make a better homework, normally, he didn't care too much about that stuff, but since he was a new guy, and almost everyone was trying to screw him up, he tried to do his best so he at least approved the classes... After some more time, he finished, and they watched some TV while they waited for dinner time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake felt somewhat sleepy, because that's the typical effect after eating, and Blake wasn't used to that, and after finishing his homework, he fell asleep without even realizing. Joana checked the notebook, and was surprised that Blake was smarter than she thought, and using all her notes he made a more detailed report. She smiled at him, and carefully moved him so that his head rested on her lap. She caressed his hair for a brief time, and watched television while waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah went to drink a glass of water and noticed what her daughter did, she also smiled, giggled silently, and went back to her work room. Some minutes later, Joahn came to see her, he decided stop working on his inventions for that day, and Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Have you seen our daughter?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a look out of the door, and noticed Joana watching the television with Blake laying in the sofa, his head resting on her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was quick... that guy has some guts...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, he did nothing. He just fell asleep... It's understandable, he looked like he needed a lot of rest... But what I mean is that I was right, Joana likes him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You still need to talk to her... she shouldn't raise her hopes very much... It's highly likely he's going to freak out if he ever finds out she's not a human... and if she isn't aware of this, it'll break her heart...\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be so pessimistic... what are the chances he finds out about her tail?\"- Sarah replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"10% in the short run... but nearly 100% in the long run...\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why can't you just remove it surgically? I know you're perfectly capable of that...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We don't know enough about her anatomy... the tail is no mutation... and there must be some reason for it to be, maybe it's even vital, or removing it may have nasty side effects...\"- John said -\"You know that merely pulling or squeezing it causes her immense pain and renders her immobile...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know... I didn't know a baby could cry like that before...\"- Sarah said -\"But I can't believe it's such a big deal...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The tail seems to be an important weak point, but also, it seems to absorb certain types of energy... Evolution doesn't give body parts for no reason...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then... if this keeps going and at some point he asks her out, me may need to 'prepare' him...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe, but only if this goes on... if he keeps things as just friends there's no problem...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt Joana would like to stay in 'just friends'...\"- Sarah said, and added -\"I hated it when you wanted us to stay like that back at high school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"- John said, a bit embarrassed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours and a half passed, and Blake woke up. he remembered falling asleep while sitting so he sat up very quickly, and gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you have a good sleep?\"- He hard Joana's voice behind him, and turned around to see her, he also realized he had been sleeping on her lap. He backed away a bit and said apologetically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I am really sorry... I didn't mean anything... I fell asleep... I don't even know when did I...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright. You don't need to apologize\"- Joana said, blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake didn't know what to say, he expected her to be angry at him (he had noticed how many times girls slapped guys by almost anything, and sometimes for no reason, although the guys from Blake's previous school weren't precisely nice guys [Some of them study at the same high school as Blake, and all of them are troublesome, bully others, and have many bad behavior reports, this makes Blake a rarity among them, and he stayed neutral to most conflicts for most of the time, but he had to fight a lot to defend himself because even as neutral, many guys tried to pick on him, or take his lunch, or simply intimidate him...] ). Blake was also a bit afraid because she defeated the bully he stopped rather easily. Joana perceived this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You thought I was going to punch you, didn't you?\"- Blake opened his eyes wide, very surprised because he didn't expect her to almost read his mind. Now that he had spent some time with her, he had sensed something different and strong in her, and he took it as a signal of her being a lot stronger than he thought, further keeping a warning about her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... yeah...\"- Blake decided to be honest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you afraid of me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not really afraid of you, but afraid of what can happen...\"- Blake started to explain, although there was something about her he was afraid of, but he decided not to tell this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In the school I studied before, there was only chaos, it was very essed up, and school authority never bothered to do anything. So, some groups attained dominance through intimidation, and there were many conflicts, and a very great deal of them were because of misunderstandings... I learned that guys who try to be too close to a girl get either kicked where it hurts the most, or slapped in the best case...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not like those people. And I have no reason to hurt you, you're actually a nice guy...\"- Joana blushed more when she said that, and Blake blushed as well, but despite he looked away, Joana still noticed it. They remained silent for a while, until Sarah (Joana's adoptive mother) called them for dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan had broken free a year ago, but he kept wandering around the vast and snowy siberian land, he hunted animals to eat, and drank molten snow, until he found a small city, which he destroyed easily. After having a really good lunch (obviously, he ate all the food he found in the stores, after killing people), he started walking again, his instincts were taking him to somewhere, but he didn't know. He walked a lot, until it was night, and a spaceship landed a few miles from him. Then, his instincts kicked in, and he dashed toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 16 years-looking boy got off from the spaceship. He had long white hair, and red eyes. He was wearing a white cloak over a gray shirt, and white pants. He also wore a blue scouter. This was an enhanced version of scouters, which was adapted by the Jigokujin after their war against the saiyans. These scouters had far more functions than Frieza's forces' or saiyans'. Also, they worked with neurological command. The guy started looking around, muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe they sent me to this waste of planet to track possible saiyans... They were killed by Frieza and us over 15 years ago, dammit!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his scouter beeped -\"Huh?\"- He got a reading of a power level getting near, seemingly, heading toward him. He smiled -\"Heh. This will be easier than I thought...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan stood before the strange white haired guy and his ship. The white haired guy immediately noticed Ivan's tail, and started to clap his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Very good. I didn't expect such cooperation from you monkeys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who the hell are you?\"- Ivan asked, he was starting to feel angry, to feel the urge to kill, to fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Call me Blaze...\"- The white haired guy replied -\"This will be fun...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Joana's house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner went rather smoothly. As both parents were already aware, they said nothing about Blake, although he avoided answering personal questions because he didn't want to tell that he was a guy with no family and with very little money. Blake left after some more time, and Joana's parents decided to talk to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um... Joana...\"- John started to say -\"We've noticed what's going on here, and we need to talk to you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- She asked, she could't believe her parents could read her emotions with such ease<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We realized that you may have... feelings... for that guy...\"- Sarah said, a bit hesitant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must be aware that you can't be too reckless about yourself, about some things, like...\"- John said, but he was interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like my tail?\"- Joana sounded sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... any normal guy would kinda freak out if finds you have a tail, and it could be dangerous if they tell others...\"- John said -\"It doesn't mean you aren't a pretty girl, just that, as you know, you aren't human...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know...\"- Joana sounded even sadder -\"But... what if Blake doesn't mind?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That'd be very nice, and you'd be very lucky if that was the case. But we should stay realistic...\"- Sarah replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I understand...\"- Joana went to sleep, rather saddened by her talk with her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was better now than later...\"- Sarah said, and sighed -\"Though I feel bad for her. She's really pretty for a girl... it's just that tail...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Her appetite is also inhuman... only because she ate a lot of fruits it was possible she consumed a normal dinner...\"- John said -\"Although all of this is a little intriguing...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana nearly fell in love with that guy in just 2 days...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's a girl, and she's at highschool, it's perfectly normal...\"- Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Normally, girls start to develop crushes near 10 or 11 years, but Joana never did, until now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you insinuating?\"- Sarah was now intrigued as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing yet. But there are several suspicious facts that I need to verify. I'll tell you when I find something...\"- He went back to his lab, after some minutes, Sarah thought 'I know what he's thinking, and it's completely absurd...'</span></div></div>",

I am here to kill you... and that's all you need to know...\"- Blaze said, and quickly dodged a punch from Ivan. Blaze's scouter beeped several times, and it gave a more complete reading (Jigokujin had already scouter-like technology, but in non portable form factor, so, these scouters are more based on their own than on Saiyans', who seemingly obtained them from the Tuffles by the way), it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Species: Saiyan. Gender: Male. Age: Between 15 - 17. Additional info: Unstable power readings indicate this is probably Makotsu, a dangerously atypical saiyan. Son of another atypical saiyan, Broly, rumored to be the Legendary Super Saiyan. Threat level: Potentially highly dangerous...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Potentially dangerous? Bah!!\"- Blaze said, and his scouter beeped again -\"The power level is... 12,000? Not bad...\"- Ivan roared furiously and punched him in the stomach, but Blaze didn't even move an inch. Ivan punched him several more times and kicked him, but Blaze just yawned in boredom. Ivan dashed backward and threw an energy ball at Blaze, which he deflected with only one hand (I would've written bare hand, but he was wearing gloves...). Blaze laughed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least make my long travel worth it, you monkey...\"- Then Blaze sighed, and said -\"I'll play way less than my best...\"- Then he cracked his knuckles and dashed toward Ivan, he seemingly disappeared and reappeared behind him, timing perfectly, punching Ivan in the stomach as he turned around. Then, Blaze grabbed him by the face and slammed him against the ground, Ivan kicked him and swiftly got up. He readied two energy balls (by the way, Ivan's attacks are somewhat of a yellowish green) in his hands, and dashed toward Blaze, this time, Blaze disappeared and reappeared above in the sky, just to be hit by both energy balls, which created a large explosion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan readied other two energy balls, but before he realized, Blaze appeared in front of him, and gave him a really bad beating, punching, kicking, and slamming him against the ground. Blaze ended the combo by punching him into a mountain.However, much to his surprise, Ivan didn't seem very damaged, and his power level was exactly the same. Ivan rushed toward him but Blaze dodged him and kicked him, causing him to crash into the ground. Ivan got up and wiped off the blood of his lips' corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ivan shot a barrage of energy balls at an incredible speed, but Blaze wasn't harmed at all, and said in an annoyed manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How disappointing... although, according to the data, the strongest saiyan warriors known besides Broly were just near or slightly above 10,000... I admit you maybe are stronger than them, but you won't have the chance to grow stronger!!\"- Blaze was surrounded by a dark purplish aura, and punched Ivan with so much strength that he vomited blood. Then, he put his foot over the back of Ivan's neck, but he roared in anger and knocked Blaze off his feet, to follow with a lot of furious punches, although, Blaze apparently got damaged, but he healed back in no time, and even his scouter was intact, so, he regained composure, and grabbed Ivan by the throat, and punched him several more times before flying about 650 feet high, and punching him downward, he also added an energy blast, which exploded right after he crashed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze laughed maniacally, while watching the fire and smoke slowly dissipate. Ivan was damaged, and was laying down on the burned ground. Then, the clouds in the sky dissipated as well, and Ivan noticed the full moon (not intentionally). His heartbeats became faster, and stronger, and he felt everything in his body tightening. Soon, he lost conscience, and rose as a great ape. Blaze was really surprised, as he had never seen such a thing, and evidently, someone didn't do their research... His scouter beeped several times, and Blaze opened his eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power level is... 120,000?!!\"- Then, a warning appeared in the scouter, which said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DANGER!! Saiyans have the ability to transform into giant apes, and their power increases ten times... There are no known weaknesses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And now you tell me you piece of junk...\"- Blaze powered up, but his scouter kept beeping, and sent back to their planet a report:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"DANGER!! Male saiyan detected in planet Earth!! Threat level: High... Power level: 120,000... Current situation: Engaged in battle against the Jigokujin prince... Power level: 92,000. Notes: High probabilities of defeat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was sent, and although Blaze would've broken the scouter, it'd be an important handicap he couldn't afford by now. He started to charge up a beam with his right hand, as the now ape Ivan was far more powerful than him. he fired the beam, but Ivan neutralized it with a mouth beam. Then, he ripped off a piece of the ground, and threw it at Blaze, who couldn't dodge it due to its size, but kicked it back, further angering the beast, which shot fire at him, and while Blaze managed to dodge most of it, the fire caused some serious burns, which Blaze could still heal, he'd worry if it wasn't night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All Jigokujin have this healing factor, though it depends on each individual, the more powerful they are, the better and faster his healing will be. Also, their native planet has 4 large moons, and is always at night, and only one moon is visible at a time, except on some special occasions were two, three or all of them can be seen. Their moon cycles are identical to Earth's though. Thus, they are stronger when the sunlight is blocked, also, they're stronger when the weather is cold)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze charged up for a longer time an energy beam with both hands, and fired it at Ivan, this time, causing some burns to his chest. He flew near his face and punched one of his eyes, but got swatted by one of his giant hands, and crashed into the ground. Before he could realize, the giant ape stomped on him. But it takes more to kill someone like Blaze, who managed to partially lift up Ivan's foot, and fired another beam, drawing blood from it. Quickly, he flew away from the giant ape's foot to hit his other ankle with two energy beams. Ivan groaned in pain and fell down. But he still managed to get up, despite limping, and Blaze fired another beam, which slashed Ivan's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blaze miscalculated the ape's reach, and Ivan grabbed him, and started to try to squeeze him to death, and despite Blaze's strength, he was turned into a boneless piece of meat. As soon as this happened, all of Blaze's bones and organs regenerated once again, which angered the ape. Blaze bit the ape's hand, which proved to be effective due to the Jigokujin's fangs. Blaze flew away and spat the saiyan's blood in disgust. Then, both f them rushed toward each other, and Blaze could connect a powerful punch in the back of the ape's neck, but, by reflex, the ape swatted him away with great force, and so, while Ivan fell unconscious, Blaze was too weakened to finish him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Ivan hadn't lost the transformation yet. Blaze grabbed his left arm in pain, and everything inside him ached a lot. he wouldn't last much longer in such conditions, specially if the Earth's sun appears. Blaze ended up retreating to his ship, and while the ship took off, e noticed that the saiyan slowly reverted to his normal form. He promised himself to come back and kill that saiyan with his own hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Jigokujin's home planet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo human-looking women walked among the crowd. They had brown and black hair, which was very different from Jigokujin's typical white, platinum or gray. These women passed as tourists. One of them looked to be in her late 20's or early 30's, while the other looked like between 17 - 19. The older one had light brown shoulder-length wavy hair, while the younger one had black waist-length hair, wavy as well. Also, the younger one had darker skin, while the older one's was fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sneaked into the Jigokujin palace, and spied on the king and the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My lord. We just got report of a saiyan detected in Earth!!\"- A messenger said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I knew it!!\"- Omega (the king) slammed his fist on the table -\"Frieza thought all saiyans were dead except for the three ones working for him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your Majesty!! We had another encounter with the rogue saiyan known as Turles. He defeated our forces once again. His power level was reported to be near 20,000...\"- Another messenger who had just come in said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"20,000... That's not good... the strongest saiyans we've fought were just half as powerful...\"- Omega said, and a screen showed images of the war that happened 16 years ago. It showed Kailan, Bardock and Yousei in separate sections.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"Dammit!! My son found another atypical saiyan!!\"- Omega shouted, and asked -\"What's the progress of the battle?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The atypical saiyan was confirmed to be Makotsu... son of the another atypical saiyan known as Broly... He possessed a power of 12,000 but it suddenly rocketed to 120,000...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That damn monkey thing...\"- Omega muttered, although his expression couldn't be seen, as he was inside a very thick armor, and his voice sounded machine-like. His red eyes glowed inside the helmet, and were the only thing visible inside it. Also, his hair was platinum and rose from the top of his helmet and reached his ankles (sort of a knight-like look). He wore a white cape over a silver armor, with some golden adornments, and a red Omega letter on his chest plate. By the way, Omega was larger than the average Jigokujin, who are human sized. Omega stood at 9'10\" tall (3 meters).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor covered the totality of his body, and his gloves, also metallic, were shaped as claws. The metal this armor was made of was very rare and only found in this planet or in some Asteroids. It's far superior to the alloy Frieza and his forces wear. It's solid, but can stretch a lot, also, it can act as gum-like when taking strong hits, preventing cracking, although potentially, hits powerful enough can crack and shatter this metal. Though keeping this in mind, Omega's ancestor, who made the armor, which has been worn by all kings (instead of a crown) also implemented nanotechnology, which allowed the armor to repair itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, and his enormous power, Omega hasn't fought personally nor made a serious move to prevent Frieza from knowing about his abilities, as he showed himself to Frieza more as an equal than as a servant. The latter would lead to Frieza killing him off just like did to King Vegeta, although the war against them would be much longer and more violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was what we needed to know...\"- The woman said, and started to head for the ducts' exit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought Makotsu was Broly's son... what business would we have with him?\"- The girl asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, but the planet they sent Makotsu is the same we're looking for. Now, let's go...\"- The woman replied, and they left quietly. After some minutes, they reached their space pods and left into space, setting course for Earth. They'd arrive in slightly over a month...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks passed in Earth. Blake hadn't gone to Joana's house again, and despite he tried to talk her out of it, she kept bringing lunch for him. Blake started to realize that she wasn't spending time with anyone else, also, that more guys glared at him, although he still didn't understand why, maybe because her family is rich?. While he and Joana were in some classes, a man came to the principal's office, after formal greetings, the man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm here to notify you that one f your students has been found to not have any living relatives... His name is Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- The principal seemed a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We've been verifying the students' information, and when we tried to locate Blake's grandmother, it marked it as red, which meant that she was already dead, and it was verified that the death certificate was indeed legit. So, you have an underage student with no legal guardian. He needs to get one in order to keep studying... Besides the fact that this student registered at this school while the grandmother has been dead for 6 years...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know... but, shouldn't you try to locate his parents...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt we can. We don't have any sample of Blake's DNA, also, the grandmother was an adoptive one, she reported to have found the child. And the grandmother has no living family either...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If we forced him to get a guardian, wouldn't that rather mean Blake would be mistreated? I know a lot of children and teenagers don't get precisely nice treatment when adopted at late ages...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's not our business. However, I have to add that Blake has been investigated for a few days after finding this, and it's obvious he lives alone. He also looks dangerously unhealthy. He started recovering just recently, but he still looks unhealthy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell him to get a legal guardian then...\"- The principal said, and the man left. The principal started checking all files related to Blake (which weren't many, given that it's been only two weeks)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe registering papers, nothing outside normal. However, when he checked his entrance test's results, he got 935/1000. Then he checked the school he came from, one that wasn't known to be nice, all other guys from that school were troublesome and labeled as bullies. Now the principal was a bit intrigued. He also knew that less than 10 people got results above 800, and Blake's was in fact the third highest. 'This guy can be a good student. He deserves a chance...' He thought, and decided not to tell anything, luckily, the man wouldn't come back to check. Usually these notifications weren't further verified, although some students got expelled because of that, but only when they were troublesome or with low notes, which meant they couldn't justify their staying. But Blake's was justifiable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also checked the medical reports (There was a medical checkup the 2nd day of classes), which reported:<br>\r\n\" Name: Blake.<br>\r\nAge: 16.<br>\r\nStature: 180 cm<br>\r\nWeight: 55 kg<br>\r\nReflexes: Faster than average, but nothing outside normal<br>\r\nBlood Test: He refused to have it.<br>\r\nPulse: 140 bpm<br>\r\nRespiratory Rate: 8 per minute<br>\r\nAdditional Notes: He looks extremely unhealthy. His skin is pale, and his look evidences he has some form of anemia, weighs 15 kg less than he should. His heart rate is abnormally high, and his respiratory rate is dangerously low. It is needed to talk to this student's parents as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that makes sense... though, why would he refuse a blood test? Maybe he has some illness and doesn't want to tell anyone... It is really sad guys like this one aren't taken care of. I'll tell Blake about the guardian thing as a recommendation...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also found P.E class report, he checked it. It stated average, except for two individuals with higher physical performance than average: a girl called Joana... and Blake... The principal was surprised, as this seemed to contradict the medical report...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report on Blake, student number 006: He has higher physical performance than the rest, despite his looks. Thin for someone his stature, by the way. He can jump higher and longer distances than the rest. He had no problem climbing the rope, and can also run very fast. However, his stamina is ridiculously low. He was barely able to complete the first lap, and he couldn't continue after that. He looks like being ill or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it sorta makes sense... though I'd expect Blake to be weaker by what the medical report said...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake and Joana had finished their class, and despite Joana tried to invite Blake to her house again, he said he had a job to do, and left quickly. Joana sighed in sadness and walked to her house, alone another day... She couldn't get Blake to go with her anywhere outside school after the team homework, which got an A. She wondered if she screwed it up that badly that time. Blake wouldn't go to the movies, nor anywhere else. He agreed to go with her almost wherever at school, but outside, he seemed desperate to get out, always with a not-so convincing excuse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Siberia, Ivan took the two weeks to fully recover, and he could do so by destroying another town, and eating all of the food during his stay. And despite he didn't get stronger, his instincts became more powerful after that fight, and he felt that he needed to go somewhere, to kill someone. He felt the urge of going somewhere across the ocean, and to kill someone. He remembered that Blaze called him \"Saiyan\" and after remembering it, it echoed in his mind, and he roared very angrily, despite there was nobody to hear it. Ivan shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"SAIYAAAN!!!!\"- And flew towards the ocean, following just his instincts</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake's status was between very bad and bad. And the principal, who bothered in watching him at certain hours, noticed that he also had no friends except for one girl that kept following him around for most of the time, and despite he didn't mean to meddle in Blake's personal life, he noticed that the girl brought him food, and constantly tried to get him to go to her house more often. Blake avoided it every time with some excuse. He also seemed to avoid anything that implied them being outside of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal wondered if it could be related to Blake's condition. However, he knew it wouldn't be right to spy on him, so, he decided to talk to him. But as the last class ended, it'd have to be postponed to the next day. The principal observed that many guys were hostile toward Blake, and the only logic cause was that he was friends with the girl. (Though Blake himself didn't realize of this yet). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake went to put away his school stuff, a bully called Albert said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, Albert?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been said that you're going out with that girl Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rumors...\"- Blake said while putting away his books, but Albert shut the locker rather roughly, and said in an angrier tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's obvious that there's something between you two, and none of us agrees. A rat like you isn't worth that girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not going out with her. And I thought girls were people, not objects anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert punched the locker next to Blake's, denting it, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're lying!! And that kind of loser talk is what girls always seem to like...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not interested in going out with anybody. Nor I have money to pay a date, you already know that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Funny thing is that she's rich!! She can pay that and more!! That's why all the other guys including me want to try our chances...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I said. I don't care... I'm not interested in Joana, nor I'm interested in competing...\"- Blake opened his locker again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe how easily you lie. It's obvious you want her for yourself!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just sighed, and Albert added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You want to live the great life, don't you? It's obvious she's your ticket for getting out of your misery!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually I'm used to misery... And I wouldn't fit in rich people's world anyway. Do as you want, as long as it's not threatening or hurting her...\"- Blake said, as he finished putting away his stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Or else?\"- Albert laughed at what Blake said -\"Are you telling me the limits of what I can do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Regarding Joana, yes. She's still my friend, and I won't hesitate to kick your or anybody's ass if you mess with her...\"- Blake said, crossing his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's it!!\"- Albert tried to punch Blake, who stopped his fist with one hand. Unknown to him, both Joana and the principal had seen and heard everything (from different positions, none of them were aware of each other). Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You already know I can mop the floor with your face if I want to...\"- Albert roared in anger and tried punching and kicking Blake at a very fast speed, but Blake dodged every hit. However, Blake panted a few times to regain his breath, and punched Albert hard in the stomach twice, then, he kicked him away, sending him against the lockers. Blake then started to walk away, but Albert got up and tried to attack Blake again, this time, Blake could only dodge some hits, and got punched and kicked when he ran out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert punched Blake in the stomach and slammed his face on the floor. He said -\"I've seen your weak point, Blake. Your pathetic stamina...\"- Joana and the principal opened their eyes wide, the former was more surprised than the later, but the principal was still surprised because that medical condition was being used against him. He was about to intervene, but noticed that Blake kicked upward, hitting Albert's jab, and got up swiftly, although he was breathing heavily. Albert said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you bother protecting her, Blake? You've just known her for... 2 weeks?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You've said it already, Albert. I am a despicable rat. But she still offered me her friendship...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert rushed toward Blake again, and Blake connected some more strong hits on him, but Albert managed to slam him against the lockers and started to smash his face against them. Despite the pain, Blake laughed, and Albert asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's so damn funny?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everyone says I'm a rat, but you're worse than me...\"- Albert got angered by this and smashed Blake again against the lockers, which got stained with Blake's blood, as he was at least smashed 5 times before the principal decided to intervene, however, much to his surprise,  someone moved very fast and tackled Albert. It was Joana... She was looking very angrily at Albert, and punched him in the stomach with so much strength that it knocked the air out of him, and he fell unconscious. Blake noticed Joana's suddenly saddened look, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How... long... have you... been here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw and heard everything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"- Blake said very quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What does that mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That I've realized how much you hate me now...\"- Blake struggled to get up, refusing help from Joana -\"It's okay. Everyone does. It was weird enough you didn't for a while. Don't worry, I'm used to that... now, I need to get going...\"- Blake started to walk away, but he couldn't even walk two steps before coughing up blood, and falling to the floor again. He was breathing heavily, and noticed Joana was staring at him, although not with the hateful look he saw in everyone else, in fact, there were tears forming in her eyes... although Blake couldn't understand why. Then Joana ran toward him and knelt by his side, she let her tears drop, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can you say that I hate you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... well... I thought you would because I didn't word properly what I said... *cough!* I'm just another idiot...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana's voice faltered, and shed more tears -\"I don't hate you... I... I...\"- Joana hesitated to continue, and Blake got unconscious. She lifted him up and carried him on her back. The principal, who was too surprised to even move, was further surprised by seeing that Joana lifted Blake up rather easily, and carried him on her back with no problem, despite that technically, Blake weighs less than Joana. She left the school carrying Blake on her back, and didn't mind that some people saw her. Despite her family's reputation and her high notes, she never cared about what people would think of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, seeing that this happened because many guys were envious of Blake for being with her, with this, she tried to leave a clear message, that she wasn't interested in other guys. She even glared at some guys who were giving angry looks at the unconscious Blake... Eventually, she took him to her house, and her mother gasped when she saw her carrying a very wounded Blake. She first checked on Joana, asking worriedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened? Are you ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine. Blake was attacked by a guy...\"- Joana laid Blake on a bed in one of the guest rooms. Sarah called her husband, and when he came, he opened his eyes wide when seeing Blake, unconscious, and bleeding. He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened?\"- Then he looked at Joana, and said -\"Did you...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NO!!\"- Joana cried a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't mean that... I meant... did he try to do something to you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"NO!!\"- Joana sounded angrier, and she said, while crying -\"He was attacked by a guy, because of me... because the guy was jealous of him being my friend...\"- She cried some more, and said -\"I told you, Blake isn't like the others. He was willing to defend me despite he didn't know I was watching and hearing him. He fought that guy despite feeling bad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... alright... Sorry\"- John said, then he added -\"Well, let's take him to my lab so I can check his condition...\"- Joana carried Blake again, and laid him on a bed in the lab. John took a sample of Blake's blood, and also, connected some machines to him to check his vital signs. Soon, the machines were frantically beeping and making any sound they were programmed to in case something was wrong. He, Joana and his wife were all surprised when seeing that he had a heart rate of 45 bpm, and was breathing 6 times per minute. Sarah asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the lower limits on normal people were 60 bpm and breathing 12 times per minute...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Indeed... No wonder he's so weakened... but at the same time, it's incredible that he's strong enough to withstand such a bad health...\"- John said -\"I'll check what's in his blood...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was sitting in a chair, next to him, and Sarah was standing near Joana. She noticed that her daughter was very worried about this guy, and that there should be something wrong in his life... 2 hours later, John came with the results.<br>\r\n-\"Everything is wrong... He has just 35 units of sodium, 0.5 of potasium, and 15 of blood sugar...\"- John sighed and said -\"These values are insanely low...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are the normal values?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The lowest healthy normal values are 136 of sodium, 3.5 of potasium, and 70 of blood sugar...\"- John said -\"Although that doesn't apply to you...\"-</span></div></div>",

And since he seems to have lived like this for who knows how long, I bet he can heal, he just needs to rest, however, he'll need parenteral nutrition... and for good measure, someone should keep an eye on him...\"- He knew Joana would do it without even being asked to. So, he set up the PN and left for a while, his wife followed him. Joana watched the vital signs on the machine, and wondered how was it even possible Blake lived like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sarah, you may not believe me, but I'm sure there's something inhuman in that boy...\"- John said, after getting far enough to not be heard by Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Again with that?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You saw it!! He's been living with less than 1/3 of the minimal living requirements. There's no way even the toughest martial artist would withstand such a bad health...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe it's just some disease or a genetic thing...\"- Sarah replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not saying he's the same alien type as Joana... he might be an entirely different species... although his blood values are at a midpoint, they're lower than Joana's, but are far superior to normal humans...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And the next thing you're going to say is that Earth suddenly became the Universe's daycare center, huh?\"- Sarah said, crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That attitude kept mankind stuck for 500 years in ignorance during the Middle Age...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I believe there would be certain advanced life form somewhere in space, but I don't think they'd look like us nor that they sent their children here... I mean, what reason could make a mother send her child to an unknown planet?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Our concept of family may not apply in other civilizations...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe. But my point is that I don't think that boy is an alien. We know and accept Joana is one, and besides that strange sphere where she came from, we have nothing else that tells us about what kind of world she came from... But seriously, it's not possible that two aliens ended up in this same planet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Science will answer this question. I still have some of his blood, and I'll use the computers to compare it with Joana's, although it'll take some time...\"- John said, while Sarah facepalmed herself. Then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He doesn't even have a tail...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Correction, we haven't verified he hasn't a tail...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If your crazy theory is right, what if he got his tail removed and doesn't even know he's alien?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If he got his tail removed, that may explain his bad health...\"- John said -\"Maybe it's a consequence of having it removed by whoever who raised him, thinking it was a mutation or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And if he's so conveniently the same alien species as Joana, what would that mean for them?\"- Sarah asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... it'd explain why she likes him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know why but I have the feeling that you want alien grandchildren...\"- Sarah said, and John blushed in embarrassment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dreaming costs nothing...\"- John said -\"Although... if sexual dimorphism is the same as in humans, he would be even stronger than Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By how badly beaten he got from a bully who is not obviously another alien, I don't think so...\"- Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the computers will answer this question. I'll go check on him...\"- John went back to the lab...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the lab, Blake woke up, and much to his dismay, he was attached to several electronic devices and they were injecting some stuff into his veins. He feared that Joana found he was an alien and reported him to government, and instinctively, tried to get up, but he heard Joana's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, don't move. You're very wounded...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where am I?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In my dad's lab. I don't know where you live and you needed medical attention anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. The machines don't say so, and your blood test results were terrible...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blood test?!\"- Blake was now really worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, my dad needed to check it and your nutrients are very low...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake froze as he thought 'Dammit!! If they haven't seen I'm not human they will in to time... I'll have to destroy this laboratory and get the hell away from this place!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are things I need to do, and I can't stay here, so, thanks for everything, but I'm going to...\"- Blake tried to get up but Joana prevented him from doing so, and despite he was trying his best, Joana seemed to be stronger than him. Blake then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can't force me to stay here!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana saddened again. She didn't know why he was so eager to leave, and what could be so bad about her or her family that Blake didn't care abut his own health as long as he could leave. Blake was still struggling, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell you what, but something bad it's going to happen if I stay here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? We're trying to heal you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't be healed. I've been always like this... It's something nor me nor you can't understand...\"- Blake said, still struggling to get up. Some of his wounds reopened and he stopped struggling, and writhed in pain. Joana's father came in, and noticed this, and asked what happened, Joana was about to answer when Blake said it was just a wound that reopened. But he also added that he needed to go, then John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're in no condition to leave. Everything in your body is screaming for medical attention... And I need to to a full physical checkup\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- Blake was surprised, however, he was relieved, as he knew that they hadn't found he had a tail... yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. I'm a professional...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't want to be checked...\"- Blake said -\"And I won't explain the reasons...\"- John sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I can't force you...\"- 'Although it seems a bit suspicious... what would he not want me to see... a tail, maybe? or some other alien trait?' John's scientific mind wondered. Then, he told Joana to get a glass of water for Blake, and after she left, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Listen. I can't really explain what's going on, but my daughter cares a lot about you. I won't force you to anything, but I ask you to stay until you're in better health. Not for you, not for me, but for her... She wouldn't be in peace with herself if she knew you left while being in this condition...\"- Blake sighed deeply, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... But I don't want you to make any analysis on me or my blood...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that you took a blood sample from me. Well, I don't want it to be analyzed...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Personal reasons. Something my grandma taught me... so, please give me back the sample...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was somewhat surprised that Blake was firm and was determined to keep whatever it was in his body hidden. This only added more suspicion on the theory about him not being human. However, John was smarter, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't. I've already used up the sample to get the levels of blood sugar and blood cells...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, apparently in relief. And John smiled inside his mind. However he was now afraid that the results of whatever he found might change everything, and as he was considering the most likely variables and scenarios, he wondered what kind of damage may come from knowing about the secrets in Blake's DNA... But he wouldn't know until he tried, and as a scientist, he was a bit too stubborn to give up without investigating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, John, who had one more blood sample (He had taken 3 but has already used 2), took half of it and poured it into another tube, which he inserted in a slot in what looked like a very complex machine. He gave a voice command<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Analyze this sample and compare it with Joana's blood and DNA data...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Affirmative. The comparing process will be complete within exactly 6 days...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"6 days?!!\"- John didn't expect it'd take that long<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In order to determine any similarities, the DNA must be thoroughly analyzed, and also the genetic patterns must be checked in order to tell if this individual is from the same unidentified alien species. Also, since our data bank consists of only one known specimen, comparison will take longer because it needs to take on account the individual genetic differences...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- John mumbled, somewhat unhappy to have to wait so long. With the rest of the blood sample, he ran some more tests to find what's wrong. Nothing indicated a particular liver or kidney failure. He needed a new blood sample to know if there was some change in his blood, but he knew Blake would refuse. So, he decided to speak to him now that he was with Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I know that you said you'd refuse to have more blood samples taken, but I need a fresh one to try to find out what's wrong, why you aren't improving...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It doesn't matter. But I won't have more of my blood taken...\"- Blake said, Joana had a very worried look, John sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... what's the worst thing I could find? A disease? Drugs?\"- He knew that at least the second one was false, but was trying to get Blake to at least accept despite telling nothing. However, Blake quickly detached all machines from his body and stood up, putting back on his shirt and jacket (His jeans and socks were never taken off in the first place). Then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!! Drugs!! I'm a damn drug addict!! That's why I told all of you that my condition is normal!!\"- Blake then ran off, putting as much as strength in each stride, still, his heavily damaged body didn't got too far. He didn't even make it outside Joana's house (or mansion, whatever you want to call it), as he fell face first to the ground again, all his muscles ached in deep pain, and could no longer respond to Blake's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, I don't know about you, but I have the feeling that what he said was not true...\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought you'd actually believe him... I think he lied too...\"- Joana didn't understand why Blake seemed so paranoid, speaking of which, Blake also coughed up a lot of blood, as this great effort reopened many hidden wounds inside Blake. Despite the immense pain he was suffering, he managed to stand up again, and tried to keep walking, although he fell down again in less than 4 steps. He fell unconscious once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, he noticed he was in the lab again. He'd expect to be tied or something, but surprisingly, Joana was just sitting next to him, with a very worried and sad look, John was doing tests with another sample of his blood. He sighed in defeat, and remained silent. John then came in with a worried look as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You've had no improvement. It's getting worse, and the parenteral nutrition has done nothing at all...\"- John also added -\"Also, there was no strange substance found in your blood... no drugs...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake growled in further defeat, however, for an unknown reason, Joana's presence soothed him. However, he was very aware about his life being in danger. John then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what's going on... but you need more help, Blake. Your blood test indicated that you've been living under insanely low life conditions for a very long time. You might get long term damage if we don't stop whatever it's causing it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- Joana said, very worried and almost crying. She's known him just for 3 weeks, but he was her only friend, and she was developing feelings for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and Blake's condition hadn't changed. John didn't know what to do (while keeping the assumption that he was human, which he was seriously doubting by this moment). Meanwhile, Joana bandaged some of his wounds, despite Blake's reluctance. He got his shoulders, arms, forearms and torso bandaged. John seriously wondered about Blake's condition. He also knew that if this guy died, Joana's heart would be broken in a far worse way. Also, despite his actual attitude, he seemed to be more innocent and nicer than many other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake eventually fell asleep, as his body was exhausted, damaged, and struggling to live. Joana held his hand while he was sleeping, and John noticed this as well, although he said nothing. He already knew (because his wife told him) about her feelings for him. Also, the fact that he was willing to defend her was something that drew John's attention regarding this matter, many guys wouldn't bother fighting other guys just for a friend they aren't interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana also fell asleep when more time passed, and John increased the parenteral nutrition dose to twice the quantity for a normal human at their worse state. He went for a coffee, and when he came back, he noticed that there was some improvement in Blake's condition. He took another blood sample, as Blake was too tired to even feel the needle. This blood sample showed Blake's blood with near human levels of chemical substances, although his heart and breathing rate were still lower than a normal person's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is extremely weird. I'm sure any person would've died with such a high dose... Now, I'm completely sure Blake has either some genetic syndrome or is just not plain human...\"- However, he wouldn't be able to confirm neither theories until the analysis was finished, which would take 6 days...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere else, in space...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough scouter communication, the black haired saiyan girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mom... I'm hungry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me too. Let's stop in the next planet...\"- The brown haired saiyan girl answered. In an hour they landed in a planet that resembled Earth, although with different shaped continents. They immediately sought food, and they ended up entering a city inhabited by human-looking aliens. When they noticed their armors, the men prepared to fight using arm blasters, while the women and children started to run away. The saiyans' scouters revealed that these aliens' power levels ranged from 10 - 25. And the energy blasts were harmless to them, and stood still while rolling their eyes, annoyed. After some minutes, the men ceased the fire, and the black haired saiyan girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In case you haven't noticed yet, we could've destroyed all of you with no effort if we really wanted to. We just came here for some food...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men stopped the attack and most of them went back to their normal activities, although they were still worried about them, their armors and scouters were associated with Frieza's forces, which hadn't conquered this planet yet. The two saiyan women ate a lot of food at a restaurant, and given their power, none of the aliens dared to tell them to pay for the food. Some of the aliens who were inside this restaurant didn't hear or see what happened outside, and were talking normally, and it was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, did you hear the latest news? It seems that the saiyans weren't fully extinct after all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Saiyans? The people that transforms into monkeys?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis angered slightly both saiyan women, and despite they were seen as a potential threat, they were thought to be Frieza's soldiers, none of the aliens noticed their tails wrapped around their waists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. The Jigokujin have been looking for them to destroy any remaining saiyan alive. They found one at some primitive planet called Earth...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And how did you get to know such information, I'm sure it would be top secret...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone leaked the reports...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see. Is there more about it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, besides the fact that both Frieza and the Jigokujin feared them, they also said that the saiyan found on Earth was so powerful he defeated the Jigokujin prince. Although, unless we develop something effective against such enemies, either the saiyans, Jigokujin or Frieza's empire will still be a problem for us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How strong do you think Abakku is by now?\"- The black haired saiyan whispered to her mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...I don't know...\"- The brown haired saiyan woman replied -\"He was born with 1820. So, he can't be any lower than that. I can't tell how strong would he be...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... we're going to find out soon, right?\"- The saiyan girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... in a week...\"- The saiyan woman replied, and after finishing their food, they left, and in little time they were back at their saiyan pods, then they left the planet and headed for Earth once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up the next day, after the slight improvement in his condition. He felt better than usually, but John told him he was not healed yet. He noticed that Joana was there too, and Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought we had classes today...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You aren't in condition to go, and I've been worried about you, if I went I'd be distracted anyway...\"- Joana replied</span></div></div>",

My condition won't get past this...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't know until we try...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, let's make a bet. If I'm still like this by Sunday, you'll let me go...\"- Blake said, John and Joana had raised eyebrows at such a bet, specially because not many people would refuse a free treatment for whatever disease or illness they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- John said, shaking Blake's hand, like typical men doing a bet. Joana immediately exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dad!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, but I can't just force him to stay as long as we want to. Although a bet would be something to respect... I doubt you'll understand that, it's a men's thing...\"- John replied, as he really knew that usually men were bound by these non-written rules. He also knew that he may have a chance at winning if he increased the nutrition dose, <br>\r\nuntil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HOWEVER... No new treatments... To make this bet valid, everything will be kept as it's being done now...\"- Blake said, and memorized the levels on each machine. John had a mental 'D'oh!' as he realized his plan may not work after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- John mumbled, he hoped the current treatment worked, not only for his scientific curiosity but for Blake's well-being, since he was Joana's only friend, he appreciated him more than just a mere stranger, also, the fact that he hadn't acted, nor seemed to act like a perv earned him bonus points on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend passed, and while Blake's condition improved very slightly, it was not enough, and Blake won the bet, although Joana insisted on that he should stay, to which Blake replied that he was fine, and that he could stand a mere discomfort (Though he's putting it very lightly, as in reality, Blake felt very tired, with low stamina and always body pain, but since he was taught to hide his non-human nature, he'd prefer it over being a lab-rat for the government...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Blake left, John said to his adoptive daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better keep an eye on him... his body can collapse at any moment. I don't know how long will he last in such condition but something tells me it won't be for too long...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana nodded, and went back to her room, with nothing else to do... Then Sarah came in, and had heard everything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that look. You still think that there's something else about that guy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. But I need 3 more days to prove it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you gain by proving he's an alien? You'll sentence the poor boy to be experimented on by the government...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who said I'm going to tell the government?\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... it's the obvious choice by almost everyone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't mean harm, it's just that I need to know. Also, if he cooperated he could help me to expand and improve my research on Joana's species...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you so sure he'd be the same species?\"- Sarah asked (Although not being scientific-level smart, she has a lot of knowledge due to spending so much time with John)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are some hints... His blood values were at a midpoint between Joana's and humans'... but his condition improved only after I changed the parenteral nutrition dose to twice...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wasn't that fatal for anyone?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Exactly...\"- John said, scratching his chin -\"And you know... Joana's species seems to have a very high caloric demand... I guess that her immense strength and speed don't come from thin air... But the point it, that Blake's condition improved after getting a superior income of nutrients into his body, thus...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He needs to eat more?\"- Sarah said, and John blinked twice in confusion, then his eyes illuminated and exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's it!! That was the solution to Blake's problem!! Dammit... Why weren't you here 10 minutes ago?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I realized of the obvious... why, what were you thinking before I said what I said?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That the nutrition dose may be a proof of Blake's alien nature...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe if you had been more focused on healing him than on proving his species you'd have realized yourself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Duh...\"- John knew of this flaw, that his \"knowledge hunger\" blinded him from obvious facts often...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Monday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was normal, and by lunch time, Joana brought more food for Blake, who started to feel bad about getting food for free... Also, he had noticed that the hostile looks toward him increased even more than before... And something inside him was telling him that something may have happened the day he missed class (Friday). Joana interrupted his thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I don't want to annoy you... but... I think you should let my dad help you... You don't look good...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... I have never looked good....\"- Blake answered in a careless manner, and Joana looked down, she didn't like very much Blake's low self steem, nor his carelessness about his own health. But more than disliking, it saddened her, and Blake failed to notice this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...\"- She said, after a short uncomfortable silence -\"How about hanging out after school? I promise I won't annoy you anymore...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake would have simply said 'Sure' (Completely unaware of what Joana meant) but the looks of many people around made him gulp, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... I would like to, but... I just remembered I have something to do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? You said you live alone and you have not much to do after school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... yeah, that's true...\"- Blake started to laugh nervously, and Joana got the hint, and looked around discreetly, she noticed many guys glaring at Blake 'So... a non-spoken threat...' She sighed, thinking 'I'd wish Blake told me his problems rather than making up excuses...' Then, she remembered she had two tickets for a movie's premiere, she got them as a gift at the mall a week before school started, and at that time she had no idea of what to do with the second ticket, but now she had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a surprising move, she grabbed one of Blake's hand, and asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Blake was really nervous, and blushed madly at Joana holding his hand, but more of his redness was because of the fear of the many guys wanting to beat the life of of him right now... Even when he was stronger than average people, Blake's health and low stamina meant he would lose a fight that lasted over 3 or 5 minutes, or against several guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Joana... I'm gonna get in trouble...\"- He said, thinking 'I'm screwed anyway...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Trouble? Do you mean those guys?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly many of the guys went back to do their regular lunch time activities almost innocently, and Joana whispered to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have a plan to take care of them. You just don't do anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... but...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, Blake?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed now for reasons he didn't understand, and he muttered -\"Can you release my hand now?\"- Besides this, it hurt slightly, and it made Blake's hand numb, as Joana didn't control her strength properly. Joana blushed as well, and noticed Blake dissimulated pain, and felt bad about herself, her parents had told her her chances with any guy were low if her alien nature was found, but even if not, she now thought that her strength might hurt people she didn't mean to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I remembered I got two tickets for a movie... I wondered if you'd go with me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Blake scratched the back of his head nervously,  and also, he noticed in Joana's look that she wouldn't accept a 'No' this time... He had used it too many times by now... -\"What time will it be?\"- Blake asked, then Joana, with a happy expression, checked the tickets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's on Wednesday, 5.30 PM...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess I'll be there then...\"- Blake answered, but Joana read him like a book, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still want to hang out after class anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake would've slammed his forehead against the table if Joana wasn't there. He wanted to avoid trouble and other people's attention, but being with Joana was doing the opposite... Not that he could blame her... But he feared he wouldn't be able to defend himself, and would get another beat-up... (Well, he didn't get beaten up, but he still got heavy damage)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- Blake said, and could almost hear funeral music, and shut his mind up, thinking 'It's not like I would have a funeral anyway... nobody would attend....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and Blake was somewhat relieved, and tried not to think about what would happen when he was alone. They had Biology class and in the middle of it, it was heard the principal requesting Blake to go to his office, and he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why me?\"- He asked the teacher for permission and walked outside the classroom, most of the male students had an evil grin, thinking Blake was getting what he deserved, some of them even muttered 'That's Karma for you!!'</span></div></div>",

Please take a seat\"- The principal said, and Blake did so, still silent, expecting something bad to happen. Probably the fight he got into... He sighed, and expected some angry yelling, but instead, the principal asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was visited by a government's agent. When checking students' information, it highlighted yours because you have no legal guardian...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes wide... He had worked a lot to get the money to get registered at the school (At least where I live it actually costs) and knew his grandma was dead, but had no other choice, as he didn't want to be sent to some sort of orphanage (At 16 years old he was a bit too old for that) or some random adoption. Now he knew he was screwed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You need a living legal guardian, Blake... Don't you have any other relatives?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No sir.\"- Blake didn't know what else to say. The principal noticed his silence, he wouldv'e liked to hear something more from him, as his files had very little information about him. He had no involvement in any extracurricular nor club activities. The only other thing reports showed was that he only interacted with Joana, as she was the only person he worked with for paired or teamworks. But he also felt that he shouldn't push him because probably his family's death was probably a delicate subject<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Normally students with no legal guardian are not allowed to study... But I'll make a temporary exception. You're actually a good student. I'll give you a week to get someone to be your legal guardian...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A week?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm afraid can't give you more time... If you're lucky, the next agent wouldn't event check on that, but in the case he or she does, you'd be either expelled or given in adoption...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... alright...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was what I wanted to discuss. You better start looking for someone...\"- The principal shook hands with Blake, and he left. First thing he thought was that it was a bit strange that he let him choose someone... Blake would have expected that he brought a couple of friends who were seeking to adopt someone... Well, it wasn't like he had someone willing to help him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classes had finished, and Joana greeted him again, she immediately asked about the what did the principal want, and Blake replied that it was just a formality regarding some school papers... however, Joana had learned to see when Blake lied, and also, his vague description actually gave her a hint. It was almost obvious that the fact he had no family didn't go unnoticed... They walked out side the school, and after stopping at a park, Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, what was really your visit to the principal about?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? I've already told you... some papers, stuff... boring stuff...\"- Blake replied, but Joana raised an eyebrow, and he knew he had been busted -\"If I tell you promise not to go crazy...\"- he said, and Joana nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm going to be expelled from in school...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! Why?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell you... but yeah... I have a week, at most...\"- Certainly Blake knew he had no chances of getting anyone to help him during the week<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you haven't done anything to be expelled!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Life is always unfair\"- Blake replied, and this also drew Joana's attention, as she couldn't find what Blake really is like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it because of you not having a family?\"- Joana risked with that move, but the brief widening in Blake's eyes was enough to tell her it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That has nothing to do with it...\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't have to feel ashamed...\"- Joana tried to comfort him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not like I can do anything about it...\"- Blake sighed -\"You win. The principal gave me a week to get someone to adopt me as a legal guardian, guess what? NOBODY will help a random guy with no family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was already considering her parents adopting him... money wasn't a worry, and she would actually like Blake living with her, though probably her parents would say no, and it would end up as Blake said. Though she would tell her parents anyway. Blake said goodbye and left on his own. Joana went back to her house, and after her parents greeted her, she told them what happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- Joana's mom asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is he going to do about it?\"-  Joana's mom asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Little to nothing...\"- Joana sighed -\"He said he can't do anything because no one will help a random guy with no family...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"- Sarah said, and she also caught the hint, however, by her tone, Joana thought it should be better to suggest adopting Blake later, and she left to do her homework. Then Sarah asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? What?\"- John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw what Joana wanted to say... she wants us to help Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Adopting him? But...he... she... they... wouldn't...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't see anything wrong... anyway, maybe that's what Joana needs to get closer to him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But she's an alien!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if Blake in the end doesn't mind?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I seriously doubt that the first guy Joana likes is going to be the one...\"- John said, with his 'scientific' tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... I'll tell you that things will only happen if Joana wants to. Let's remember that I had practically to force SOMEONE back when we were younger...\"- Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, well...\"- Then his mind kicked in, and he thought 'This is perfect!! I'll be able to study that guy!!' -\"Then I guess I'll have to talk to him, won't I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yup\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"- John now sounded happier, but his wife knew if was his science obsession... he was suggesting the boy was an alien and wouldn't be happy until he proved it scientifically, or he would stop on the matter if the results were negative. Though still, the thought of having a guy that his adopted daughter likes living in the same house bothered his \"parental sense\" a bit. He also was a bit eager because the results on his DNA analysis weren't ready yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also decided he would tell Joana about it, probably at dinner. He knew already that Blake was stubborn and that he wouldn't accept right away, so probably Joana was the only one able to convince him, as, so far, and by what Joana said, she was the only person that Blake would do something for. Although at least Blake didn't have a romantic feeling in it, he said himself that he couldn't say no all time because Joana was the only person that offered him friendship...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of Blake, he was very tense, as he didn't know what to do. He got stressed to the point he had to stop working on a computer repair because he couldn't think clearly, and laid on his \"bed\", which was just a wood piece with a towel on top. Looking at the cracked ceiling, he felt very tired, as always, but also mentally, which was uncommon... Blake eventually fell asleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joana had to resume her everyday life, and was doing her homework, until she heard someone knocking their door. She opened it and her parents were there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um, Joana... Your father and I have been talking...\"- Her mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, we wanted to tell you that we are willing to adopt and help your friend Blake, but you'll have to convince him,,, I doubt he'd accept the offer from us...\" Joana's father said, and right when he finished his sentence, Joana hugged him and his wife tightly, he laughed and said \"Careful with that strength, young lady...\" Joana blushed and apologized, and told them that they were the best parents ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rested for a while on his wooden bed, but it was too uncomfortable to even sleep. He was used to sleeping in a hammock, that's how his grandmother raised him, but the hammock was in the laundry, Blake then remembered that it should be done already, and so, he went to a nearby laundry. He presented his ticket and the person at the counter brought him his hammock, Blake paid and left, in a slightly happier mood. That hammock was made of silk, and was given to him by his grandma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Blake's poverty, due to him inheriting his grandma's house, he lived in a decent medium class neighborhood. He thanked God for that, if he lived in a poorer, more dangerous place, he may be dead already. If he hadn't met Joana maybe he would also have succumbed to his disease. He never understood what was wrong with him. He always was weakened, and feeling bad, none of the remedies his grandma knew cured him, but they helped alleviate the symptoms at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed by a market, and noticed that they sold the same fruits that grew in Joana's yard. They were kinda expensive, 2000 zenny each. He wondered why those fruits made him feel better for a while, and unaware of it, he stared at them for a few minutes, enough for a person ask him if he needed help, snapping Blake out of it, and he replied that he didn't, he was just seeing, he had never seen those fruits. He was surprised when he saw Joana walk there, carrying a basket with some of the fruit. Apparently, she sold some of her fruits periodically to that market for some money. Blake didn't really know what to do, and it was inevitable that he would have to talk to her. Joana greeted him happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi...\" Blake said in a much less cheered mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you doing here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I just passed by, I went to the laundry to pick up this\"- Blake showed her his hammock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A fishnet?\"- Joana was a bit confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...No... It's a hammock... it's what I use to sleep...\"- Blake said with a sort of -_-' face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"People sleep in these?\"- Joana had never hard of anything other than beds for sleeping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... my grandma, and by consequence me...\"- After that, there was an uncomfortable silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey... what are you going to do about school?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honestly, I have no idea, I'm screwed... I'm not gonna go get anyone to adopt me, most likely I'll be robbed of what little I have, like my grandma's house... Nobody adopts a teenager\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... I could help...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How?!\"- Blake was surprised for real<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My parents told me they were willing to help you\"- Joana said, smiling sympathetically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, right, your parents... Wait, what?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They are willing to do the adoption so you can keep studying...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ugh... I'm gonna hate myself for this, but I think I agree... Studies are my only hope to get out of my miserable life...\"- Blake said, feeling unsure about it all -\"Hey... It's just paper formalities right? I don't actually have to live there, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We wouldn't mind...\"- Joana blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... I have been raised to earn my own stuff. Even if I'm well, poor... but that's what I can get, it's the fruit of MY effort, I have electricity, water, and a repaired old computer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you don't have much left for food right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine... I've been like this for 6 years and I'm fine...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I will be honest, you look sort of sick... I can almost tell that you need nice foods and a good rest...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got the rest part covered...\"- Blake signaled his hammock -\"The foods one... only if someone buys my soul, but meh, not even the Devil bothers...\"- Blake joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you give it a try? Stay with me for some weeks and if you don't like it you can go back to your house...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Blake blushed when Joana said 'stay with me' and was stuttering some attempt of a excuse <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's for free and you lose nothing, in fact, let's go already...\"- Joana took Blake by the arm and dragged him to her house. Blake couldn't break free from her grip, and neither he could oppose to her walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey... My stuff is still at my house...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can go get it later today, we can go in my car...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU have a car?\"- Blake was again truly surprised, he was used to only have his own feet as transportation. By the way, Joana's car is one of those flying ones, as seen in DBZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\"- Joana said casually<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed, he didn't know what did he get himself into. Joana was a bit happy though, even if it was a bit forceful, she got to hold Blake's hand for a considerable time while she walked home. They arrived to her house after who knows how long. Joana's parents were surprised when they saw her bring Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't know she would convince him so fast...' Sarah thought, and giggled mentally, knowing that because Joana liked Blake she would do anything to help him, even by force. She noticed her husband's look, and gave him a glare that said 'Do NOT try to take advantage of this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana talked to her parents, told them that Blake was here and that he was going to stay with them and that tomorrow they would get the papers done. Blake tried to say no but Joana tightened her grip on his hand, hinting him to shut up, rather painfully. Blake could only sigh in defeat. Joana's parents welcomed him and offered him a room, Joana said they could go for his belongings after eating, he had to accept to be polite, but he felt uncomfortable anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly he and Joana ate, so, Blake was spared from some awkward moments, and could even relax a bit. He somehow felt a bit safe with Joana, acknowledging that even if she could be a bit forceful, she only wanted to help him. After that, they went on a quick trip to his house for him to pick up his belongings, namely his clothes. He was going to unplug his old computer but Joana giggled and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can give you a new one. You can leave it here... Anyway, It would take too much space...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess...\"- Blake felt again uncomfortable about getting things for free, but he also concluded that it was reasonable, Blake rescued that computer from a junkyard, and it was an over 10 years old model, kinda bulky, maybe heavy too, but neither he or Joana would've had trouble carrying it if it was just for the weight. He was feeling a bit better since he had some of those expensive fruits, and he didn't know that the whole time Joana had been putting his clothes in her car's trunk while day dreaming about hugging Blake and kissing him. She snapped out of it when she noticed Blake brought a chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's there?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No idea. All I know is that grandma told me to open it if things got dangerous as in life threatening. I consider this is important for me to keep near at all times, if you don't mind\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's ok, it fits in the backseat anyway\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana effortlessly put it in her car's backseat and they were ready to go. Blake secured all windows and doors, and felt a bit of nostalgia about leaving the very house in which he lived his whole life. However he kinda thought that his grandma would've liked him to go on a better lifestyle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Flashback, 7 years ago, Blake was 9*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake helped his grandma to water plants in the backyard. Blake's grandma commented how life could only be changed via hard work, but also that some things are beyond their own control, Blake wondered if that wasn't a contradiction, but his grandma exemplified it with their current situation, they keep the plants alive and in good health performing some work, but, for those plants, it's mere luck, for they can't control their own fate. Blake's grandma said that it was an overly simple way of seeing it, but it was true that some situations were beyond the control of a single person<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Call it fate, or God helping you but sometimes life will provide you some help. To be always a good person also helps, even if we are poor now, who knows, we may have a better life some time later... At least you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake comforted his grandma with a hug, but she said that it was alright, she was aware that she was an old woman, aged 89, and that someday she was going to pass away, she only prayed to God that Blake would be prepared to face life alone, as she was worried about his being an alien, in a world were fear of the unknown was the rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must learn to recognize life's subtle ways, you may miss good things\"- Blake's grandma later joked about that she couldn't tell Blake that he would get a girlfriend, because of him being well, an alien, but Blake didn't really care, and he said he wasn't going to be with anyone anyway, so he may never reveal his secret. His grandma told him that there is still good people in this world, and that he might actually find the right woman someday. Blake still disregarded that as being unnecessary, and promised to stay forever in celibate, Blake's grandma laughed heartily, and commented that he may just have given Kami-sama a challenge, Blake said he was determined to not surrender...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End of flashback*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It seems you won, Kami-sama, wherever you are...' Blake thought, as they went to Joana's house...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake felt a bit intimidated again, he was in a place that was not his home, but he knew he really hadn't much of a choice, he needed the adoption to keep studying, and maybe his health could improve if he stayed there... the question being, for how long? Since Blake is very good at repairing electronic aparatuses, he might get a job under this corporation. He decided to not stress the subject anymore and tried to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana kinda knew Blake needed to take a break from tensions and showed him her videogames, she had almost every console from the last 20 years, and a vast collection of games, Blake was impressed, and he particularly liked the older ones. (Insert a Super Nintendo look-alike here, lol). Blake also found a small handheld console that could play most of the games of the other consoles (PSP lookalike) and he liked it very much, Joana noticed this and gifted it to him. He put it in one of his jacket's pockets and played some games on the consoles with Joana. Meanwhile, in John's lab<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wonder how she convinced him so fast\"- Sarah commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake seems a bit thoughtful, maybe he was struck by reality and how bad he had been living... I managed to get some info on him, he spends days without food, and sometimes the most he can eat is an apple or another single small thing. He's got a bit notorious for being exceptional at repairing electronics, and charges very little, they say that he doesn't mean to make the others poorer and thus he gets barely enough to sustain himself... he even fixes things for free for poor people\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Since when can you get info on people?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not that difficult, walk around, do some errands and casually talk to people... Blake does draw some attention because of his health, many have seen him collapse in the sidewalks, or cough some blood. Even an elder woman told me that it was obvious from miles away that he didn't eat enough\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well at least that chapter should be over. I still wonder... he got better with twice the nutrition dose, right?\"- Sarah remembered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, slightly. That almos outright tells us that either he's not human or has a serious mutation... either case maybe he wouldn't mind Joana being an alien after all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mutant alien grandchildren, you just outdid yourself...\"- Sarh joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! I didn't even think about that\"- John replied, laughing a bit -\"The answers will still take 6 more days though...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Joana's parents would show at school and sign the papers making themselves Blake's legal guardians. The principal was genuinely happy about this. However, things weren't going as smoothly in school itself, despite not being anything public, it became known shortly after, and every guy gave death glares to Blake, but since he was feeling a bit better, he was ready to fight back. Strangely, despite Blake never attacked first, and fought as last resort usually, there was still something about fighting that he enjoyed, maybe because it was a test to his skills, or maybe it was the thrill from combat itself. He didn't pay further mind to that, and went on with his day as usual, recess however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy recess, Blake and Joana sat at their table as usual, but this time they were surrounded by angry guys, all of them shouting that Blake wasn't worth anything, and that they were going to end his misery. Blake told Joana to remain seated, cracked his knuckles, and the fight (more like a one-sided beatdown) began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was able to send some of the guys flying a short distance with single punches and kicks, and dodged every attack thrown at him, in a matter of minutes, all the angry guys who threatened him were on the floor, writhing in pain. One last guy tried to hit Blake from behind with a steel tube, but Blake punshed him with the back of his hand, without even bothering to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Garbage taken care of...\"- Blake said, satisfied. Definitely those fruits were doing something to cure his disease, whatever it was. However it took him a moment to see Joana's genuinely surprised face -\"...What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Last time you barely fought one of these guys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those fruits of yours are doing their job then\"- Blake smiled and gave her a thumbs up, She blushed a bit but gave him a thumbs up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't know that via a security camera that was well hidden, the principal had seen it, and was utterly surprised. The weekly P.E report confirmed tat Blake seemed to be in better health, with a remarkable stamina and all above average stats. 'This guy could be the next olympic star' the PE teacher wrote at the end of his report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the guys' crushing defeat singlehandedly done by Blake, they refrained from further attempts to attack him, and Blake could breathe a sigh of relief, finally, his life was seeming to go forward to a better way. He also inadvertently was spending nearly all of his tme with Joana, which he didn't even mind as they usually talked, played games, or watched tv or movies. Blake stopped to reflect about it a few times but concluded that there was nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 days have passed... A nearby forest, 4:45 PM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided to be a bit more productive and bring some food to the house himself. His grandma had taught him that he could survive from nature, and knew most edible plants, berries, roots or fruits, as well as hunting and fishing. Blake could have attempted this earlier in his life but since he was in bad health and these activities were time and energy consuming, he refrained from them. He was determined to bring something good for dinner, and maybe to feel he was paying for himself. Despite his initial worries, Joana's parents were very understanding and demonstrated to be truly nice people, their wealth didn't make them greedy, envious, or hypocrite... Blake appreciated that, the least he wanted was to deal with people who would hate him in secrecy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere in Japan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA saiyan pod landed in an isolated farmlad area. A tall muscular saiyan with long hair came out of it, killing people on sight, and stealing the food available. He checked his scouter, looking for something... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power levels here are trash... huh... what do we have here?... 334, 322... bah...\"- However the scouter beeped once mor, pointing to the west -\"A POWER LEVEL OF 2,000?! 10,000 kilometers away... But, is this reading right? It's probably him, but I wonder, why hasn't he killed the people in this planet as ordered...\"- The saiyan flew toward the direction his scouter indicated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided against hunting but went for fish, he just dove and caught them with his bare hands. He managed to fill the basket he brought. He closed it and dried himself with a towel to later change into his clothes, when suddenly he heard something like a jet plane. He paid it no mind and resumed putting his clothes on and picking up the fish basket, when before him landed a man with a strange armor and a weird monocle. Blake put down the basket, and didn't kow what could such a strange person want...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kakarot?\"- The man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't speak your language...\"- Blake assumed that it was a sort of soldier, but from which place, he noticed that the green monocle beeped and showed some symbols in yellow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power level is 2,000. How is it possible?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea what you're talking about but I have no idea what is a kakarot, so, if you excuse me, I have to go...\"- Blake picked the basket and turned around, but sensed danger and ducked, dodging a purple energy beam that the strange man shot at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE HELL?!!\"- Blake noticed the explosion far away, and the man charged and attacked him, Blake however was able to block his punches, and kicked him hard in the stomach, knocking the air out of him temporarily. Taking advantage of this, Blake punched him in the face several times and knocked him off his feet with a kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The man stood up again, and fired several purple energy balls that Blake dodged, and could even deflect one with his hand, and realizing this, he deflected every energy attack the man threw at him. However the man didn't give up and attacked Blake with punches and kicks, managing to land some hits, but Blake caught both of his wrists and hit him in the stomach with his knee, and let him fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok weirdo, now you better tell me what was the big idea, and how the hell can you fire that...\"- Blake stopped in his tracks when he saw the man's tail... a brown furry monkey-like tail... like his own... (currently hidden under clothing). The man used his tail to knock Blake off his feet and got up, flying away quickly. Blake got up and cleaned off the dust off himself, while muttering -\"Ok, that was officially weird...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>Chapter End Note: Yeah this might seem as a disappointment, but I thought that if Raditz were to engage in combat against someone stronger and realize about it early, he would rather flee because he's afraid of death. So, his fight with Blake was rather short. Also, due to the difference in power Raditz would have concluded to not try anything else against Blake until he got reinforcements.</b></font></span></div></div>",

He didn't get to obtain any answers from him though, and decided to pay it no more mind, maybe later he could get to answer his questions, by himself hopefully, if anyone found out his secret he would probably be given to government agencies to study... So, he just headed back to Joana's house with a basket full of fish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere in space...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in their pods, the saiyan women slept for most of the travel, when the radars beeped, and they got an incoming transmission. The older saiyan woman checked the radar, it indicated that another saiyan pod headed for Earth earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Zorn* here, do you copy?\"- A man's voice spoke via their scouters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, loud and clear, what is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We've gotten leaked reports about that planet where you're heading, Earth... both Frieza and the Jigokujin are temptatively targetting it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Frieza had someone go pick up a saiyan they sent some years before the destruction of our planet... they calculate that the saiyan should have already conquered the planet, but never reported back...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who could that be?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kakarot...\"- Zorn replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kakarot...\"- The saiyan woman repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- The saiyan's daughter asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bardock's younger son...\"- The saiyan woman sighed -\"Well, at least that's one recognizable face we'll find there...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However keep in mind that they have sent someone to retrieve Kakarot, no idea who, so you may want to play safe, also, the Jigokujin have different reasons...\"- Zorn added -\"They located Makotsu in Earth... that could be dangerous... he's Broly's son...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah we know. His power level is 20,000. He defeated their prince by transforming into a great ape...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And he beat their p... wait, what? How did you know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We sneaked in their home planet and heard the king himself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are one crazy saiyan lady, Sharotto...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto laughed, and said -\"Nothing is crazy enough if it gets me to get my son back...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can only guess... He'll probably be a great warrior...\"- Zorn replied, hesitating to add on to that sentence, as he knew Sharotto was still a bit sensitive on the topic of Kailan's death. After a short uncomfortable silence, Sharotto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"On an unrelated matter, did you manage to contact Turles?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We arrived too late, the planet was drained dry and there was almost nobody left. We got from a few survivors that Turles obtained a sort of mystical seed that grows into a gigantic tree that gives a fruit, and whoever eats it will experience an immense power boost... I would haven't believed it if I hadn't seen the tree with my own eyes. It's rumored that Turles is preparing to war against Frieza...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we need to contact him as soon as possible. We need to gather all of the saiyans to rebuild our great army and civilization...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your son is the last one according to the reports...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When I find my son I'll let you know so you can send some ship to pick us up...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... good luck Sharotto, Zorn out...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, it seems we may have some fun before going for Abakku?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really. We're going for Abakku and we're leaving... We have no idea whose side is Kakarot on, so we better avoid him. And Makotsu... if he's like his father, we can't get overconfident... Broly was a monster...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What if Abakku is also on Frieza's side?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We will tell him the truth. Frieza does not deserve the loyalty of any saiyan. Thinking about it, we might get Kakarot come with us as well... if he never reported back to Frieza that means he either took the planet for his own and didn't care, or that was he raised by the natives somehow... In any case he's not loyal to Frieza actually\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wonder how strong is Abakku\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll get to find out in 3 more days, now, if you want to be ready, lets just rest until we've arrived...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Earth, they day went as usual, Blake wouldn't mention his strange encounter with a man who seemed to be like himself. His fishing was a pleasant surprise and Joana gladly helped him cook dinner, Blake stated that he wanted to feel a bit productive since he was getting so much for free...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in John's lab...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was working on improving technologies for his corporation as usual, unlike others, he did all the scientific work by himself, and had his wife and other staff to take care of the merchandising. However he was still intrigued by Blake's change of health, as he had observed that eating the fruits that grew in his yard seemed to cure his disease. He even had analyzed the fruits, they were worth 2 or 3 days of food for a regular human, thus, they were a cost efficient food for medium class people, or for people who did very intense physical efforts. But Blake did neither, and technically a person shouldn't eat the fruit everyday, or more than once a day... The only one who actually needed such a diet was Joana... He went to his computer, but it told him that the results were about halfway, and it wasn't enough to tell. John was a bit disappointed, his curiosity about what was Joana's species and what was their world or culture like intrigued him everyday since they found her in the spherical space ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the baby herself, there was a note written in an unknown language, as well as an armor set and an ocular device. John had no idea what could be the device for, but the armor evidenced that the species practiced war or some form of combat. He performed some tests on it, and no weapon was able to damage the armor, and it was extremely light and stretchy. He has also spent some time throughout all these years trying to decipher the alien language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Blake would know anything or posess something else, he may be able to finally decipher the alien note and maybe the purpose of the ocular device. John almost wished that Blake was an alien, even though it'd be objetively better that he were just a human, with nothing to hide from the government or others. His wife came to bring him some water to drink, and to hint that he shoudl take a small break, she noticed his thoughtful look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're still going on with the test?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course! I want to know if Blake is one of Joana's species... if he knew something i may e able to decipher more about their race and culture... all we know is that they may be a sort of warrior race, or practiced a form of combat. The ocular device is a total mystery. All I know is that it seems to scan living beings, but the language is extremely complex...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's say Blake is an alien as you say... then. what if he was raised by someone and doesn't know either about his origins...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He may still posess something to help my research. The fact that Joana arrived with a note and a full armor set, and that nobody ever came back for her may mean that they sent her here for a reason, and the armor may have been for general protection in an unknown world...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would a parent send their child to an unknown world?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We don't know, there may be infinite reasons, as well as that maybe the concept of family is entirely different in other cultures...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about Joana's spaceship?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's almost done. But I've been taking breaks because it fatigues both my mind and body to deal with its circuits and internal structure... It amazes me that it seems to be powered by solar energy, and may have potential to travel faster than light...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey changed the subject eventually and after some more minutes Sarah left and John resumed his work... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had spent most of his time with Joana in a regular basis and was still largely unaware of any feeling she may have for him, partially because knowing he's something different from regular people, he imagined he better stayed alone, and Joana was the first person to ever be nice to him after his grandma. So, he had no idea that Joana was already considering asking him out, but as she also saw that Blake finally had some rest and could enjoy life a bit, she was unsure about if she should tell him by now. She decided to go with more indirect questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom casual talks while playing or hanging out, she got that no, Blake never had any girlfriend, and he wasn't particularly interested, when she asked why, Blake commented that he didn't seem to be the kind of guy girls usually go after, citing that in school, usually the popular sports team guys were the most sought after, and that average people was usually lonely. Joana told him that it was just because some people can be superficial doesn't mean everyone is. She also said that he didn't look bad at all, which made both of them blush and change subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, things would continue to go on for 3 more days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Note: Zorn was an anime-only saiyan who seemed to be King Vegeta's second in command. As an additional note, the solar powering thing for the saiyan pods was made up by me</b></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>3 days later... Saturday, 10 AM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was particularly excited about finally getting to know the results, but the computer revealed that it would take yet about 6 more hours for the results to be concluded. The scientist sighed and decided to go on with his day, as the less he thought about it the faster time would pass for him. Meanwhile, Blake had fallen asleep in Joana's room while doing some homework, and she let him rest in the desk with a pillow for his head. When he woke up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up groggily, but was snapped out of it when he realized he was still in Joana's room, and panicked, however, Joana was already awake and told him to calm down, and brought some hotcakes for breakfast. Blake scratched the back of his head and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These biology homeworks are interesting but can tire the mind... I kinda read more than necessary...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana noticed that indeed Blake had read up to the first half of the sciences book, and they were still on the first week<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey today is Saturday, No more homework for us!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I did it yesterday... and yours... sort of...\"- Blake commented as he noticed that Joana had also done it, she smiled and said that she did it faster because she didn't read any more than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Reading is good. Biology is interesting, unlike math... whoever invented math didn't have any better to do with his life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good thing my father didn't hear that\"- Joana giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's true, beyond basic math, which is easy, understandable or useful, we go to algebra and calculus, wich are an undecipherable mixture of numbers and letters and teachers expect us to make sense out of it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Agreed\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's parents weren't there, and Blake was the first to notice it after they finished their breakfast and went to the living room to watch some tv (Blake also went for some milk to drink)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They went shopping, they go every week to get the basic things, food, soap, that stuff...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't leave my house with a stranger in it\"- Blake laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They really think you're a good guy...\"- Joana said, blushing a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana suggested to play videogames but Blake noticed the news and asked Joana to not change the channel, and both watched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"For the first time in recorded history, an extraterrestrial object has landed on Earth, with evidence... There were reports about a possible meteorite falling to Japan, and it caused an explosion that desolated a few hundred meters within... The locals had reported that it may be some sort of UFO, but weren't taken seriously, until someone bothered to go investigate... As you are seeing right now, it's a spherical spaceship, apparently for a single individual... now the question is, where is the owner of this ship, and what are their intentions toward Earth and us? More information later, when scientists can tell us more about this strange spaceship...\"- The reporter said, he was in the site of the ship's landing, and as he spoke, the ship was carried by machines, presumably to be investigated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So that's where that mysterious guy came from...' Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A real extraterrestrial ship? whoah...\"- Joana commented, and then, there was an uncomfortable silence, both she and Blake thinking 'Act normal, you must not be suspicious of anything specially now' They ignored the rest of the news as they weren't interested and they played videogames, both of them still felt the need to stay in guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, with most of the tension by the news gone, Joana was again considering asking Blake out, without revealing her true nature yet of course, as it would be poorly timed with that alien ship incident, but at least Blake knows very well that she didn't come from it. Some indirect approaches seemed to work, as Blake now didn't mind when Joana held his hand temporarily at times, he dismissed it as a casual involuntary thing, but blushed profusely when she had kissed him on the cheek a few times. Joana had done this to try to get Blake more used to it, she knew for sure that Blake was completely unfamiliar with such things. She was too, but Blake wasn't in touch with his instincts while she probably was a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was summer, and the weather got hotter as the sun rose, neither Joana or Blake liked those temperatures, and they went back to Joana's room, where she turned on the AC and closed the door (to diminish the loss of cold air)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Glorious AC, whoever invented it deserved a real good prize\"- Blake commented, enjoying the cold air. Soon after he was again playing videogames with Joana. Neither was fond of going out to parties or similar stuff like typical teenagers, Blake didn't consider he had anything to do there, and Joana, all she would get is annoyance from guys trying to hit on her, and it was the least she wanted when she was feeling she was close to ask Blake out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the incident where Blake singlehandedly beat several dozens of bullies/gangster guys, Blake's popularity increased among the average students, and at least they greeted Blake whenever they encountered him, Joana was a bit paranoid about this, fearing another girl may make her move before hre own, specially the cheerleaders or sports girls, who were the most popular and mostly were interested, in Blake's case, as a trophy for being a sort of tough guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't care either, and he considered the attention a hypocrite thing, and even told Joana \"Only you were nice to me when nobody knew or cared about me\" She blushed slightly but Blake didn't even notice. Also, ironically now Joana was the one giving death glares to some girls when they were at the cafeteria or in class when Blake wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, the room had gotten colder and Joana put her arm around Blake's neck, and commented on that she was feeling a bit cold, Blake remarked that he still preferred the cold, but a bit of warmth felt nice. Joana put her face next to Blake's, which made him blush a bit, and said, almost as if she were thinking out loud rather than really talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... I love you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-WHAT?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens were in a sort of panic, Blake from this sudden revelation, and Joana, snapping herself out of the brief trance she entered in while she was getting close to him. However she also thought that since she's already said it she might as well go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're the first and only guy who has been really nice to me... And for some time I have been wanting to do this...\"- Joana then kissed Blake on the lips. Blake was totally stunned, and surprised like he had never been in his life. His heart was beating frantically, and his hair rose up slightly for less than a second. After Joana let go of the kiss, Blake had absolutely no idea what to do or say, it felt unreal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blake was reminded by his sense of danger that he shouldn't go further with this, as his secret would be in danger... Joana herself was also a bit worried, but trusted Blake enough. He was scratching the back of his head and said in a nervous tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-well... I have never had a girlfriend before, so I don't really know what to do or say...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can I take that as an affirmation that I'm your girlfriend now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed more as he realized that his wording had another interpretation, but at the same time, it was like saying yes, Joana playfully licked his cheek, and took Blake's jacket off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey...\"- Blake was going to complain about that but he noticed Joana's puppy eyed look, he had no real idea about any of this and decided he may as well just go along, but couldn't stop feeling nervous. Joana took her own blouse off, and Blake kind of felt he had to take his shirt off, and as soon as he did, Joana playfully knocked him down on the bed (they had been sitting on it). All these new feelings and the overall unreal feeling of the situation made Blake temporarily forget about his secret, but when Joana reached to take off his jeans, both stopped in their tracks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake kept his tail wrapped in a manner similar to a belt, buthe hid it usually under clothes... and when both Joana and Blake stopped in their tracks was because Joana accidentally touched it. Both had a sort of poker face which Blake quickly broke, saying no words, putting his shirt and jacket back on, and rushed to his room to pack his things as quickly as possible. Joana sat there a bit stunned for some seconds, she managed to feel and see a bit, and she was sure Blake was hiding a tail like hers all along. Realizing that Blake had rushed out presumably to leave, she also ran as fast as she could, Blake was already getting out of his room, with a suitcase<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You saw nothing... Thank you for everything though...\"- Blake tried to run but Joana put her hand on his shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... why didn't you...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake realized that even if he ran he would be screwed, and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How was I supposed to tell you... It's not like I could go 'Oh hi Joana... guess what? I'M A FREAKING MUTANT OR SOMETHING' \"- Blake sounded a bit exasperated, and since it made no sense anymore, unwrapped his tail -\"This is who I am, mutant, or something... Now, you can go tell someone to take me to do weird experiments or me or who knows what...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana felt a bit saddened, but understood Blake's feelings and fears, and saying no words, unwraped her tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?\"- Was all Blake could say</span></div></div>",

He kept the weighted clothes he used for the mornings training and his eyes narrowed thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou will have to reappear soon to friends because the peace on this planet is about to end.\u201d- ryan said as the parents nodded knowing what he meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cRyan, you may be the strongest between you and your siblings; but they have more training than you and more control. You will help your fellow fighters, but remember not to use any more than 10,000. You still need to work on some of your control and maybe you will be needed here in the future.\u201d- his mother said as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d- he said before leaving through the mountains and flying high enough in the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan jet over to help his friends in Japan and fight the weak saiyan that started causing trouble over there. He started going full speed, which made a sonic boom that will lessen his time to maybe about two days. He began making a plan for when he met up with his sparring partners and he started to think about a rivalry with krillin. Something about him just made him want to mess with him about certain things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~No more than 10,000 power level worth of juice.~ ryan thought as he focused on the power levels of the saiyan, the two younger ones, goku, and piccolo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cI have to hold back a lot till things start to get really interesting.\u201d- he said to himself as he went a little faster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept a mental list of where the power levels are as he head straight for goku and piccolo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cFighting someone else instead of family for a change has me interested and a test for my control, but I bet my parents will have their senses trained on me when I power up some.\u201d- he added as an after thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed, he was going at people would have thought he was superman or the flash if he was running on the ground. He was using about half of his limited power before he started to slow down as he saw two people flying in the direction of where the saiyan power level is and he sensed another one next to him meaning something happened while he busy with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHey Goku, Piccolo.\u201d- ryan called out to them when he got close enough for them to hear him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look to see their favorite sparring partner flying towards them at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cSo why are you following us.\u201d- piccolo asked with an amused smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cI felt a power level and I was bored this morning so I came to help.\u201d- ryan said deadpanned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cA person called himself my brother has my son and piccolo wanted to help.\u201d- Goku said smiling while said demon lost his smirk with a frown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan chuckled as he shook his head before turning serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe will pay for taking gohan and I\u2019m his god brother/god father.\u201d- ryan said as they nodded before flying to meet with the saiyan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cDoes the person has a name?\u201d- ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHe said his name was Raditz.\u201d- piccolo said as ryan was laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cI\u2019ll call him Radish.\u201d- ryan said as goku was laughing at the joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cIt does sound like Radish.\u201d- goku added chuckling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiccolo just shook his head with a smirk as they started to plan for the fight and ryan will be backup for them.</span></div></div>",

At that time, Blake dismissed her statement as a poetic embellishment, but now, he noticed that very subtly she told him the truth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I always thought I was a simple mutant, since I have been also sick most of my life...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea about that, maybe my father knows...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR F... oh right, you're alien too...\"- Blake had been quick to overreact, he was absolutely not used to anyone knowing his true nature, and finding he was an alien was already shocking enough. -\"So I bet you were keeping your secret for the same reason as I kept mine?\"- Joana nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well. I don't mean to sound like a jerk but it's nice not to be alone in this world...\"- Blake looked down as he spoke. He also had no idea what to do or say about what was going to happen before this revelation, and he decided to not say anything about it. Both Joana and Blake had many questions but they realized that both of them knew about the same and none had answers for their questions. Blake still showed concern, and Joana hugged him, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, my parents won't let anyone else know. You're safe here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they went back to Joana's room and played videogames, Joana had observed that doing that helped Blake to relax. After about half an hour, Joana's parents arrived from shopping, and they went to help accomodate the stuff. After that was done, Joana, dragging a bit Blake by the hand, went to his father's lab, where he went to check on his work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was a bit impatient to see the results of the blood analysis, and the computer was doing the final processes, when he heard the door open <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Dad... there is something we must talk to you about...\"- Joana spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn noticed Blake being dragged by her and wondered what could it be, when his computer began to beep, still, not paying attention to the machine, he saw Joana telling Blake something, and he could barely believe what he saw, Blake revealed he was hiding a tail just like Joana's, he then turned to his computer screen and read<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResults 100% positive. The subject Blake is a male specimen belonging to the same unidentified species as Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now this explains some things...\"- John commented, now understanding why Blake had distrusted them. Now he knew for sure that Blake's previously bad health was the result of being unfed by human standards, which was much worse for an alien like Joana, as they require a larger amount of food to stay healthy. He commented about this to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who would've said it... I needed more food... hey, how come she eats the same food as a human and she's healthy?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The fruits she and you have enjoyed are worth about 2 full meals. Eating them before the 'official' meals enables her to only eat normal amounts of food to keep appearances\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, Blake, I will admit I had suspected you may be an alien due to your refusal to medical attention or blood tests... It intrigues me, now it's 2 aliens who were sent here as babies, why? Do you by any chance know anything?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't even know I was an alien until Joana told me\"- Blake said with a discrete sweatdrop in the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stood up and walked, indicating Blake and Joana to follow him, he showed them a small spherical thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is the spaceship where Joana arrived. I have been checking it but the repairs have been merely superficial, it appears that it's still fully functional, yet, replicating its engineering has been overly difficult. It also included a set of armor and a note in an undecipherable language\"- John showed them the things as he spoke -\"All I can infer from these high technology armors is that your species practices a form of combat or war... Blake, don't you posess any object related to these things?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was never told anythng beyond that my grandma found me... wait... THE CHEST...\"- Blake ran to his room, Joana and her father followed him. Blake had been given a key, which he kept atatched to a silver chain he wore around his neck. Blake usually hid it under his shirt, thus, never had anyone noticed it. Blake took a deep breath and opened the chest... It contained a different loooking armor set, which consisted of a black torso armor with a golden insignia on the left side, deep red shoulder guards and lateral thigh guards, deep red fingerless gloves that also cover the forearms, a black full body jumpsuit, black boots with deep red tips, and a strange sort of technological monocle device which Blake could not understand what was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, this confirms that your species at least intended to give you this to defend yourselves maybe? I have performed tests on Joana's armor, no weapon on Earth can damage them. So it's possible that their warriors faced superior enemies, ether in raw strength or technology... As for the ocular device, all I know is that it seems to scan living beings, but beyond that, I have no idea myself, I would be able to tell if I could decipher their language...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake also found 2 papers with notes, one being written in an alien language, and the other one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake... If you have opened this chest to see its contets, it's possible you are further investigating on your origins, or as I had told you, your life is in danger. Either case, here is, your parents packed this armor with you when you landed on this world, as well as a strange thing to wear on the eye, there's also a note written in their language. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I can't take this to anyone to investigate. I hope you can find someone kind enough to help you, and try to learn what were these things for and maybe decipher what your parents wrote for you... I also apologize, maybe I should have told you more about your true origins. I live with no regrets about you though, I hope you can live on to become whatever you want. May God protect you, my son. If I see your parents, I'll thank them for letting me take care of the most beautiful baby I ever met\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma O., September 16, 1997<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's hands trembled -\"She... she wrote this... the day before she passed away...\"- His voice faltered, he couldn't help feel his eyes forming tears, he looked away. Joana hugged him, and John said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I am sorry... I had no idea about the implications for you about finding these things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's ok... I was going to find this one day anyway...\"- Blake said after regaining some composure -\"Those are the last words of the only person who took care of me, so, you can understand why I don't feel all too well...\"- Blake took another deep breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you don't mind, I could use this note to complement the one foudn with Joana, maybe with these 2 I can decipher their full alphabet... also... where's your spaceship?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was never told about it, thinking about it, maybe it's still hidden in my house...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can later investigate about it. Hey, umm, I know that Joana is well above human capabilities, but, what about you? From a biological standpoint I'd say you as a male should be stronger but, it's another species, and for different evolutive reasons maybe only one gender does the fighting...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm up to whatever challenge...\"- Blake said and went to his room's bathroom, a few minute slater he came out of it, fully dressed with the armor, with the exception of the ocular device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So this is what your people may have looked like... yeah it seems to be something suited for a war, but why?\"- John wondered -\"Anyway, let's go to the lab to perform physical tests on both of you...\"- Johnwas saying when a powerful sonic boom interrupted him, and they all ran outside and saw 2 spherical spaceships traveling through the sky, falling toward the Earth like meteors. These ships were like Joana's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't stop you, but be careful, both of you... Joana, you may want to put on your armor suit as well...\"- He said, and Blake started running in the direction for which the ships headed. Joana would take a few minutes to also put the armor on and run, following Blake, who stopped when the ships made an impact, Joana caught up to him while he waited for the explosion to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what we are going to find, so, be ready for anything, the expected, the unexpected... who knows...\"- Blake said, and begain walking toward the crater that was a few hundred meters ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... The 2 saiyan women came out of her spacepods, looking around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, with the exception of our landing place, it seems this planet hasn't sustained any major damage... so, Kakarot did not conquer this world after all...\"- Sharotto commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did we land here though?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I found 2 power levels that may belong to Abakku, now, let's look for him...\"- Sharotto said as she noticed a silhouette from afar, she pushed her scouter's button<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power level is 2,000... could he be?\"-</span></div></div>",

That's pathethic for a high class warrior!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This planet seems to be fairly peaceful, and we didn't send him here to fight anyway, it's understandable his power may not have developed as much as ours. What mattered back then was that he would be safe until the day we could come back for him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me take care of this...\"- Sharotto's daughter said, and walked to meet the unknown individual, upon finally getting to a closer distance, she could see him -\"Well, well, well, it seems we didn't have to bother finding you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana were staring at the people who came out of the pods, but only Blake advanced, telling Joana to stay back until he knew for sure things were ok. Only one of them was heading toward them, and as Blake got closer and could observe, was a woman, 18 - 20 years looking, with waist length smooth but sorta wavy/spiky black hair. She wore an armor similar to Blake's, but her jumpsuit lacked sleeves, and her armor lacked the shoulder guards, having straps instead, her thigh guards were sky blue, as well as her fingerless gloves, and the tip of her boots. Differently from Blake, she had knee and ankle guards (black with parts in sky blue). She also wore a blue scouter and had her tail wrapped around her waist, although Blake didn't notice this last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're using our armor, and you still ask me who I am? I am a Saiyan warrior, sent here to bring you back to our people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were sent here to be safe until we could come back for you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Safe from what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young female saiyan sighed -\"Our planet was destroyed by a tyrant, the saiyan children were scattered across the universe to be retrieved later, and you're the last one on the list... we will rebuild our civilization and our army to get our evenge on that tyrant...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry to disappoint you but I'm not interested on fighting a war...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! You dare to turn your back to your people?\"- The female saiyan unwrapped her tail, showing it to Blake, who hadn't really noticed it yet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One thing is for sure. I'm not going anywhere...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You little... You're coming with us you like it or not!!\"- With that, the women charged at him, throwing a punch that Blake dodged swiftly. Blake stood in a fighting stance and the female saiyan laughed as her scouter beeped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, your power level is just 2,000... Let's see what you can do with that...\"- She attacked him again, and this time Blake couldn't even see her coming, apparently she landed several punches but Blake never saw them, and fell to his knees in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll let you know that my own power level is of 9,000. Make of that what you want...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Blake got what were those eye things for, but even if he tried to use them he didn't understand the language. He decided not to be scared by the saiyan's boasting either, and focused into the fight. The siayan charged at him again, and this time Blake could barely dodge, and landed a heavy ounch to her stomach, taking advantage, he proceeded to punch her in the face twice in rapid succession, but failed to deliver additional hits as she caught both of his wrists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That hurt a bit... Not bad for such low power...\"- The saiyan taunted him, and kneed him in the stomach, followed by an elbow hit on the back, Blake fell to the ground, but rolled away and got up. The hits he took were very strong, but he could feel that the armor was doing its job. He had been taught by his grandma to fight in self defense, and to be able to defeat people stronger than himself... It was time to put that training to the test like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake waited again for the female saiyan to charge at him, but this time, she disappeared, and before he could react, she was behind him and piut her arm around his neck, only with enough force to prevent him from breaking free<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Poor little Abakku, can't you beat a saiyan girl?\"- She tightened a bit her grip on Blake's neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am not the guy you're looking for... My name is Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Abakku is your REAL name, you know, the name your REAL parents gave you...\"- The female saiyan was going to say more but noticed Blake had gotten a grip on her tail, and was squeezing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you know of our weakpoint? Sorry to inform you that such cheap trick doesn't work on trained warriors...\"- Blake pulled drastically at her tail, causing her a temporary sharp pain, enough to break free and regain his breath. this time, Blake charged at her as she charged at him, Blake managed to land an elbow hit to he back of her neck, but it barely did any damage. Also, despite recently having her tail pulled, the saiyan did not wrap it around her waist, as a sign of arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake attacked her yet again, but she dodhed every single punch and kick Blake threw, and she seemed to be doing so effortlessly, with a swift kick, she knocked Blake off his feet and stood near him with her arms crossed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'd need at least a decade of full training to catch up to me\"- She put one of her foot on Blake's chest, but was only applying enough pressure to prevent his movement. She noticed Blake grabbed her tail again, she huffed in annoyance, increased the pressure of her foot on him and added -\"Did you know that pulling at your big sister's tail is rude?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was enduring the pain but when the saiyan said she was his sister, the shock made him let go of her tail -\"You have to be kidding me... ugh...\"- The female saiyan lifted Blake up, again, having one of her arms surround his neck, this time, Blake was facing her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right little Abakku... I am your big sister, Satomo\"- She spoke softly, yet with a sadistic tone, and tightened the pressure on Blake's neck -\"What's wrong? Can't you take a hug from your sister, huh?\"- The increase in pressure had Blake in pain but unlike most people he wasn't screaming, although he grunted from it. However, Joana, who had been watching, had enough, and dashed at great speed, punching Satomo while she wasn't paying attention, allowing Blake to break free, and stood by his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo looked confused when she looked at Joana, she was too wearing a saiyan armor, hers being black like Blake's, with ochre shoulder guards as well as lateral thigh guards, also with a pink jumpsuit. Unlike Blake or Satomo, Joana had the more typical white gloves, but also had black wrist guards. And like satomo, in addition to boots she had ankle and knee guards. Like Blake, she wasn't wearing a scouter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do we have here? Another saiyan? The list said Abakku was the last one...\"- Then she pushed the button of her scouter -\"The power level is 1,900... bah, not bad, but not enough to scare me...\"- Satomo observed Joana helping Blake to stand up, and both assumed a fighting stance against her, she laughed and said that she had no problem fighting the 2 of them at once, and even commented she was over twice as strong as both of them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana waited for Satomo to charge at them, but she was too fast and hit both of them in the stomach and in the back before they could even see it coming, and proceeded to kick Joana in the back and stomp on her, Blake got angered by this and punched Satomo hard in the face before frantically punching and kicking her, sending her a few meters a way from the finishing kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hadn't seen that strength yet... Oh I see it... You've grown so fast little brother\"- Satomo faked crying in a mocking manner, and merely cleaned the dust off herself. She dodged another kick from Blake but failed to notice Joana behind her, who landed a strong kick to the back of her neck. Satomo stood up and seemed to have gotten angrier, punching Joana in the stomach with great strength, letting her fall to the ground while she writhed in pain, and went for Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just saw what happened to your girlfriend, do you want to suffer it yourself?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's answer was repeated strong punches and kicks on Satomo, but she wasn't even flinching -\"I'm using my full potential, I had been holding back but got bored...\"- She said casually as she yawned -\"Done?\"- She asked when Blake stopped his attacks and was regaining his breath -\"Good\"- She appeared behind him and kicked him with great force, sending Blake flying some meters away. When he tried to stand up, Satomo stomped on his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You got it? You're coming with us you want it or not. At least your girlfriend is gonna be with you as well, so, what worries you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either Satomo could keep on teasing or Blake answered, Joana dashed and kicked Satomo in the stomach, and angrily punched her repeatedly in the face, though Satomo managed to dash away from her, and checked her scouter, which beeped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A power level of 3,000... that's better... Shameful that my brother is weaker than his girl...\"- She fought the angered Joana without much effort, her unpredictability meant that she could land some hits. Meanwhile, Blake stood up and joined the fight. She was dodging and blocking their attacks at once still without much effort, and decided to finish once and for all, with a kick to the back of Joana's neck, she was knocked out, and after several punches and kicks to Blake, the pain prevented him from moving, and Satomo had Blake's head against her chest while her arm pinned his neck</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sharotto had been watching them from a distance, she sighed when she noticed that Satomo began to fight Blake, knowing well that the difference between the 2 was too much. She decided to let her go on until she seemed to be done or before she did any serious damage. She was, however, surprised to find another saiyan along Blake. She didn't get to see much of her as Satomo did short work of both, but she noticed the female's saiyan increase from 1,900 to 3,000, and was able to infer that she was trying to protect Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Satomo had knocked Joana unconscious and had her arm around Blake's neck, tightening her grip a bit to prove her point. While Blake was average/tall (180 cm), Satomo was a head taller than him, and when she was keeping him in a lock this size difference made itself more obvious. She was laughing as Blake struggled to break free<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems nobody will save you this time little brother... But keep figting, it's the saiyan spirit\"- She said in a less mocking tone, and had to release Blake to block an incoming punch from Joana -\"You just don't give up, do you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell to the ground and was catching his breath while Joana was attempting to attack Satomo -\"Who do you think you are to come here and attack us?!!\"- Joana shouted angrily while Satomo dodged every punch and kick she threw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you don't know? I am your boyfriend's big sister\"- Satomo laughed, after which she punched Joana in the face and the stomach, but before she hit her again, Blake caught Satomo's fist -\"Please, are you seriously going to let yourself be harmed for a mere low class saiyan? There are more and better females among our army...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's inability to damage her seriously, coupled with the way she was treating him and Joana, specially Joana, angered Blake beyond ordinary rage. And now that Satomo was enjoying herself while she was punching Joana, it was the last straw. Blake growled in anger and he began to glow in a golden aura, his pupils and irises stopped being visible, his muscles grew and tightened somewhat, his hair straightened and looked reddish (due to the reflection of the aura). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo noticed the change but was confused by it, she had never known of such an ability among saiyans, Blake's hand had still caught her fist and he was increasing the force of his grip, she managed to break free and dashed backwards a short distance, her scouter beeping frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is this?! His power...\"- She gasped -\"4,000...? It's increasing more?!!\"- Her scouter indicated that Blake's power was increasing at a fast rate. when he surpassed 10,000, she was genuinely surprised, but she couldn't believe that it was still increasing, Blake was growling in rage, his aura had grown from a small glow to a greater, proper aura. When his power finally stopped increasing, Satomo's scouter showed that the reading was 60,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"60,000?!! That's absurd!! What kind of form is that?!\"- Satomo was interrupted by a powerful punch from the now really angered Blake, which sent her flying against a large dead tree. Sharotto was near her and walked toward her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems you really did it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!! How could I know he had that weird power...thing, technique, or whatever the hell that was?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your father had once told me that there may be other ways, even for us...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one of the battles in the planets that surrounded the Jigokujin home planet and supplied it with resources, Kailan had managed to increase his power from 11,200 to 32,000 temporarily, he was angered when Sharotto got seriously wounded by elite Jigokujin warriors. His aura was still blueish but id had a fiercer appearance and seemed more erratic, also, Kailan ended up exhausted after that short burst of power, and barely managed to make it back to one of the occupied cities. After recovery, Kailan commented to her that maybe there was a way to increase the saiyan power without a full moon, but he would need more time to let alone investigate into it, and more to master whatever he found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, maybe the legendary super saiyan was actually something like this, and not a great ape as was commonly believed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, some say that guy Broly is the legendary super saiyan, he changes his aura to golden and has immense power, but also becomes even crazier\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah it could be that he's indeed special, but who says we other saiyans can't get a similar power increase? It may eben be a revolutionary discovery if saiyans no longer depended on moons for guaranteed victories\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto had dismissed her husband's thoughts as crazy theories. But she also knew he would insist on proving them and find some way to do so. Saiyan life was all about working full time, conquering planets, exterminating civilizations, and such, so, even the lowest ranked saiyan warriors had a rather busy life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End of Flashback*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that I remember... Abakku's form looks like Broly's when he went total berserk... Be careful\"- Unlike Satomo, Sharotto had not checked Blake's power level and thought he was at most getting closer to his sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh, this just got more interesting\"- Satomo flew toward Blake, and tried to punch and kick him several times but Blake dodged them all, and threw a barrage of punches and finished the combo with a kick, Sharotto's scouter beeped and was also surprised when she saw the reading. She ran toward her daughter, finding her laying on the ground, with some injuries although her armor was still intact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Satomo, are you stupid? He has a power of 60,000!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo merely laughed and spat a bit of blood, wiping her mouth afterwards -\"Heh, a power of 60,000 is still not enough to scare me mom...\"- Satomo smiled as she got up, but was immediately attacked by Blake, who punched her in the stomach and sent her flying a few dozen meters away, he ran after her, but Sharotto intercepted him, saying -\"Abakku that's enough\"- Blake merely pushed her aside and went after Satomo, repeatedly punching and kicking her, until she fired energy spheres at him, though they didn't really damage him, they bought her just enough time to fly. Blake jumped and managed to reach her, but she used an energy beam to push him away. Blake still managed to get a grip on her tail and was hanging from there. (Blake can't fly... yet)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo ignored the annoying feeling and created a white energy ball which she threw upward high into the sky, then she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're gonna regret to be pulling at my tail little brother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy ball exploded with a blinding light, and afterwards, a shining sphere remained in the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An artificial sun?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An artificial MOON dumb little brother... and speaking of little...\"- Satomo stared at the fake moon, and felt her heart beating harder and faster, her canines grew a bit, her eyes went blank, and then her face started to transform into something inhuman and monstrous in aspect. Her eyes became red, her ears became pointy, her body got covered in hair, and she started to grow massively while she roared like a beast. Blake had never imagined such a thing was possible. Satomo laughed, her voice boomed, and was slightly deeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, where was I?\"- Satomo observed that while she was floating in the air, Blake was still holding onto her tail, which now was about as thick as him and a lot longer -\"That's almost cute... BUT I still have to teach you a lesson\"- With a swing of her tail, Blake was sent flying with tremendous force, falling hard against the ground -\"Aww, you can't even fly?\"- Satomoi landed on the ground, causing a small quake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto knew what her daughter was going to do, and there was no stopping her by that point. And allowing herself to turn into a great ape wasn't going to help much, so, she merely looked away, her scouter still informing her about the energy mass floating in the sky. Even destroying that artificial moon wouldn't have an immediate effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the fight, Blake stood quickly back up, and thought that even if that form was big and scary, he still had a greater power he had never felt before, and maybe the size and speed were his advantages. He dashed toward Satomo and when he got slightly past her, he jumped, and gave a powerful kick to the back of her neck, but not only he didn't do any significant damage, he was caught in Satomo's hand. Blake struggled and managed to break free quickly, but, being unable to fly, found himself falling, until he suddenly stopped... Satomo had caught him with her tail, which wrapped itself more around Blake, preventing him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I couldn't let my little brother fall. Isn't it nice to be saved by your sister?\"- Satomo laughed as Blake was struggling to break free. Despite being trained to resist the squeezing and pulling of her tail, it was stilla a fairly sensitive part for any saiyan, and Blake's struggles were tickling it. Satomo suppressed her laughter but couldn't avoid feeling the tickling, and eventually was forced to release Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed toward her and jumped, attempting to kick her in the stomach, and succeeded somewhat, Satomo doubled in pain, and Blake knew this was his chance, he focused on his fists, he dashed toward her and jumped, punching her in the face twice with all his strength. Satomo indeed felt dizzy and fell back, but wasn't quite knocked out yet...</span></div></div>",

However Satomo quickly stood back up and laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I did feel those hits... But it seems it was all you got...\"- Seeing Blake's shocked look -\"What? You thought I only increased in size with this form?\"- Satomo laughed and then added -\"Any Saiyan's power increases by ten upon transforming into a great ape...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't believe it... He was expecting that giant ape form to be all about brute strength and being slow, but if what she said was true, not only she was stronger but also faster and more resistant. He gulped, but resumed his fighting stance, he knew that if he didn't stop her now, there was nobody left on Earth who could even stand a chance. He dashed toward her to try to attack her again, but she swiftly dodged him, and kicked him upward, high into the air, and she caught him with her hand, squeezing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid little brother... Even if by a rare chance you could surpass my power in normal form, there was no way you could surpass the true power of a saiyan\"- Despite being squeezed, Blake wasn't suffering much more damage, and Satomo angrily threw him to the ground and was about to stomp on him. Instead, something attacked her, pushing her away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had curled up in fetal position as a reflex to the incoming stomp from Satomo, but after a few tense seconds he was surprised nothing happened, and head roaring. He could barely believe it... Joana had transformed into a similar giant ape and was fighting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What... THE HELL?! How did she do that?!!\"- Blake thought out loud, and felt a bit more intimidated. He could observe that unlike Satomo, Joana seemed to have gone full berserk and was acting more like a wild beast, something even Satomo mocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, come on, really? A first time transformation? And I was worried for a moment... I forgot you also had still your tails...\"- Satomo saw Blake, who was running away from her but also from Joana 'He must have realized she lost her consciousness.' And smiled, thinking that now there was an opportunity to use her against Blake. Joana attempted to punch and bite Satomo, but the more experienced saiyan could dodge all of the attacks, and with a kick she knocked Joana off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremor from her fall also knocked Blake off his feet, and he fell near one of Joana's arms. The fall made him hit his head somewhat hard, which stunned him for a few seconds, then he heard a growl, and noticed Joana looking at him. 'Now, let's see... my only friend asked me out... I find out I'm an alien, and she too! Also I apparently found or was found myself by my older sister... who wants to force me to go out of this world, even going as far as to transform herself into a 100 foot tall giant ape... AND for unknown reasons... now my girlfriend has turned into a similar monster, but lost self-control, and right now is looking at me, maybe I look like a snack... Nope, THIS IS NOT MY FREAKING DAY!! GOD, WHEREVER YOU ARE, I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!!' Blake thought, and started to run like hell, but despite his effort he was caught in her hand right before he escaped 'For a beast she did anticipate my movements more than I anticipated myself... seriously, this is the worst day ever...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Satomo was conscious of her acts, there was no further danger in struggling or attacking her, but, seeing that Joana may be about animal level intelligence as of now, depite his heart beating hard and his brain going in panic mode, he remained still, he knew very well that a drastic move or an attempt to attack any animal would only trigger attack/self defense responses, which would be pretty nasty coming from a 100 foot tall ape of sorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sharotto flew up to Satomo's head level -\"Now you really did overdo it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh, don't worry so much mom, If she tries to eat him I can stop her... In the mean time, this is gonna be fun. His own girlfriend will do the damage from now on\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't EVER recall educating you with such a dark sense of humor...\"- Sharotto complained, with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know, you can also go great ape and stop her yourself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am NOT going to transform into a great ape... on this planet...\"- After that, Sharotto flew down back to the ground and kept watching from a distance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's grip on Blake was a bit rough but at least she wasn't hurting anywhere near as much as Satomo did. Joana looked at him for several seconds, and proceeded to sniff him a few times. Blake was remaining still but still tense, his brain almost shouting him to escape, and his heart beating madly. Joana stared at him again, and Blake could almost sense that her look was one of confusion, and he calmed himself down, enough to deactivate his transformation. When he stopped glowing, Joana seemed surprised and brought him closer to her eyes. She stared at him some more and after some hesitation, she licked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remembered that just earlier that day Joana had done that in a sort of playful manner 'I seriously hope this means that she can recognize me. If she's getting my taste, I'm screwed...' Joana licked him a few more times and put him back on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Thanks for not eating me, I guess... If you can understand a bit of what I'm saying, I'd like to point that there's a dangerous monster over there...\"- Blake himself was interrupted by a stomp from Satomo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"UGH!! It seems that I have to do things myself after all!!\"- Satomo was grinding her foot on the ground, and Joana roared angrily, tackling her while biting her shoulder. For the first time Satomo roared in pain and started to punch Joana in the head, but she wouldn't let go. Blake saw this and focusing his thought on anger, he managed to transform yet again, he grabbed 2 small rocks, using one to sharpen the other quickly into a makeshift knife. While Satomo was struggling with Joana, Blake climbed into her tail and shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HEY YOU GIANT MONKEY... Don't you wonder what happens if I remove your tail?\"- Blake touched her tail with the sharpened edge of the stone, to let her know she wasn't bluffing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You... wouldn't...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will if you don't do as I say, first, I want Joana to get back to normal, and second, I want you to get the hell out of this planet...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You sure have some nerve to dare to demand things to me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hit Satomo's tail with the blunt edge of the stone, but by reflex she stopped in her tracks and was visibly scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were saying?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo growled -\"Fine... All I have to do is destroy the fake moon I made and... wait, what?! where is it?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto appeared flying near Satomo's head -\"I destroyed it some minutes ago... you were too busy toying with him and expecting the other saiyan to attack him...\"- Soon after that, both Joana and Satomo went back to their humanoid form, although Joana was exhausted and fell unconscious outright. Satomo complained of the bite wound she got on her shoulder. -\"Serves you right\"- Sharotto commented. Blake (who had deactivated the transformation again, having no more strength to keep it anymore) immediately went to check on Joana to see if she was ok. She was tired and unconscious, but she seemed to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww... I was going to play some more...\"- Satomo complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was not playing... and like I said I don't remember educating YOU like this...\"- Sharotto was saying as she was walking toward Blake -\"I'm sorry, Satomo apparently got carried away... My name is Sharotto\"- She said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I did NOT get carried away!! I was enjoying myself!!\"- Satomo shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's a big difference between a sparring match and a brutal beatdown young lady!\"- Sharotto shouted back, and observed Blake's confused look -\"Saiyan affection usually consists of a sparring match between friends or family... but she got it wrong... Are you ok?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I take being alive as being ok\"- Blake said, and Sharotto laughed a bit. However, Blake was thoughtful for a moment, and could recall that Satomo had called this other alien woman mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes, Abakku, I am your mother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-Wait... What?!! How did you...?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A mother can tell what her child thinks just by looking...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you take offense if I say this is the weirdest day in my life?\"-<br>\r\nSharotto laughed at Blake's remark, and proceeded to try to explain him what happened, she told him that he was indeed a saiyan, and a high class one at that. But they found out a galatic tyrant who goes by the name of Frieza was going to destroy their planet, Blake's father, Kailan, the highest ranking general of the saiyan army, had managed to learn of this due to a vision from Bardock, and reunited as many saiyans as possible to fight back. They faced both Frieza and another of their enemies' army, the Jigokujin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite they were defeating the enemy armies, Frieza himself formed an enormous energy ball which he launched toward the planet, and the saiyans themselves. Sharotto also told him that the whole battle also allowed the scientists and some saiyans who weren't in the battle to send all of their children across the universe, meant to land in planets classified as very weak. Also, that despite their best efforts, the saiyan warriors were unable to stop the gigantic energy ball and were eventually killed by it. Sharotto also added that Kailan wanted her to stay alive so she could one day find their son...</span></div></div>",

The backup data from our computers got corrupted due to the damage they experienced, and the data about you was lost... I had to sneak in the Jigokujin's home planet to try to learn where you were... I remembered very well that you were sent to the same planet a saiyan called Makotsu was sent to\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"ANOTHER ONE?!\"- Blake was a bit exasperated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was on accident, the ships were being sent almost randomly across the list of weak planets, and nobody bothered to fully check the reports... you see, Makotsu is a sort of mutant among us... His father was said to be the legendary super saiyan, someone very powerful but also bloodthirsty and crazy... At least you haven't found him, that means he may have left the planet, died, or is simply minding business somewhere else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, It has been nice to meet you, mrs. Sharotto, but I need to take back Joana to her house...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm your mother. Why don't you just call me mom or something?\"- Sharotto commented with a fake anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not used to that... All my life I've been an orphan for all I knew... No offense meant though...\"- Blake said as he put Joana on his back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait... Let me see your friend...\"- Sharotto got closer and inspected Joana, her face, her armor, her earrings... -\"Those are saiyan earrings... and not any saiyan's... This is Haisaku's daughter, Reinari. I'm sure of it...\"- Sharotto looked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By this point I'm not surprised if you tell me she is a princess or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, almost, she's from one of the saiyan noble families and a high class warrior... Hey, Abakku...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I go by the name of Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nonsense! Abakku is the name your father and me agreed upon, you were named after your grandfather, a great saiyan general, and you should be proud of that name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I guess you'll still call me that then...\"- Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I was saying... Umm, is Reinari your girlfriend?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed -\"I think so... why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit\"- Sharotto huffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is something wrong? If you mention anything about an arranged marriage I can tell you I'm not going to do it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, no, it's not that, it's just that back on Planet Vegeta, Haisaku had made a bet that Reinari would be your girlfriend or wife later on... Since Reinari was a year older than you I was mostly sure I would win the bet... Now I owe her a full day of food...\"- Sharotto laughed slightly -\"I wonder what did she see to know about this... You weren't even raised as saiyans, you were in a primitive alien world and yet you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm you're the aliens here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a matter of perspective, but whatever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began to walk back to Joana's house, and could hear Satomo shouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're letting him go?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's going to get medical attention for Reinari... Which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't fought them in the first place... However, you're right... We'rre going with him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just what I needed... More aliens in the house...' Blake thought, it hadn't gotten fully through his skull that those aliens were his mother and sister, and just proceeded to walk while Satomo and Sharotto caught up to him. Blake had a distrustful look regarding Satomo, and noticing this, Sharotto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry about her. She's not going to hurt you, if she knows what's good for her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right... spoil him just because he's a boy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's your younger brother, he's nowhere near as experienced or as strong as you, so I WILL protect him regardless of what you say... Today was a small maturity test for you, and you failed it miserably...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! Mooom!!\"- Satomo complained in a sort of childish tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the recently reunited family had to stop when someone appeared in the sky before them. It was a tall guy, sort of long black hair (shoulder length), no shirt, and just some damaged pants. He wore a golden necklace with a blue gem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's one of Paragus' familiar jewels...\"- Sharotto gasped -\"This is Makotsu...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo quickly pushed her scouter's button, and the reading revealed a power of 15,000, she exclaimed -\"His power was 12,000 according to the Jigokujin!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's obvious he had a zenkai...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A what?\"- Blake was yet more confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After we saiyans recover from near fatal wounds, we get an increase of power. We're going to take care of this one, Abakku...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto and Satomo stood in a fighting stance, Makotsu charged at them. Satomo barely dodged him, while Sharotto started an exchange of fists and kicks, fightng near evenly against the psychotic saiyan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you dare use another fake moon!! He has a tail too\"- Sharotto said upon noticing Makotsu's tail, unlike the other saiyans, he didn't wrap it around his waist. While Sharotto and Satomo fought Makotsu, Blake had a bad feeling about him, and put Joana under a tree's shadow, deciding to go help his mother and sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you think you're doing, Abakku?\"- Satomo half angrily asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If that guy is stronger than either of you, there's no point on running. My best bet is to help take him down...\"- Blake, despite being tired, stood in a fighting stance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He wasn't raised in the ways of our people... yet, he has the spirit of a true saiyan... Kailan would be proud...' Sharotto thought as she noticed Blake's determined look. Makotsu managed to send both Sharotto and Satomo flying away frome meters with a short but powerful burst of energy. Then, he looked at Blake... he could almost feel an immediate anger and an urge to kill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Makotsu were born the same day, at different hours though, while their mothers rested, the babies were put on cradles and also had their strength measured. Most saiyan babies after birth were usually tired and slept peacefully, but it wasn't Blake's case, he was crying loudly and incesantly. The doctors commented on this, praising the newborn Abakku (later known as Blake) for having the spirit of a warrior, it was also understandable because he was Kailan's son, their highest ranking general and one of the strongest saiyans of their time (not counting Broly, as he was labeled a mutant/abnormal saiyan). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other babies were bothered by Abakku's crying but Makosu was the one suffering it the most, he was already born as a mutant, with a power level of 4,000 at birth. Broly had been banished to space along his father Paragus to space some time ago, and the mother died while giving birth. That, and that King Vegeta didn't want to deal with another one like Broly, originally had ordered to have the baby executed if he displayed any trait reminiscent of his father regarding to power. Due to this, Makotsu had been left in the cradle almost all day, nobody would feed him or attempt to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End of flashback*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakotsu roared in rage and charged at Blake, who tried his best to fight back, however, he was no match for the berserk saiyan, Makotsu punched him in the stomach making him spit blood, followed by a punch to the face, sending him some meters away, but as he dashed towards him to keep attacking, Blake was able to land a double kick on his face, but this only stunned him for an instant and angered him further. Makotsu punched again Blake in the stomach with great force, and sent him several meters away from a kick, before he stood back up, Makotsu fired a barrage of energy balls at him, but didn't notice that Sharotto and Satomo fired their own beams at him. Satomo's beam was blue, Sharotto's was pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite taking the full force from the impact and their explosion, Makotsu ignored tha attacks and kicked Blake in the ribs, thankfully, his armor was still doing the job and decreased the damage somewhat. Makotsu grabbed Blake by the neck and lifted him up, and punched him again in the stomach. Only that... his fist never made it to Blake's stomach. Blake stopped it with his knee, and was able to transform yet again, his eyes going blank, his hair straightening up, glowing with a golden aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He did it. AGAIN!!\"- Satomo was surprised to see it happen yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"His power is increasing madly...\"- Sharotto commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake punched Makotsu in the face, with even greater strength, sending him about 50 meters away... and ran towards him, kicking him like a football. Not stopping there, Blake jumped and punched Makotsu downward, making a hole in the ground. Blake stood near there for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'His power is 60,000 no doubt... but what is this... could it be, the super saiyan from the legend?' Sharotto wondered 'Sadly, that power is far from being able to challenge Frieza alone... maybe the legend glorified the facts a bit...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakotsu stood back up with some difficult as his body ached, angrier than he ever was, and shouted -\"ABAKKU!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Another one who can't apparently spell my human name...\"- Blake remarked, and when the angered saiyan charged at him, he punched him through his abdomen. Sharotto and Satomo were shocked, not at the brutality, but to the demonstration of sheer power. Makotsu spaat out blood and fell to his knees. Blake kicked him upward and jumped to catch him in the air, he grabbed him from the tail and began to spin him, until he was able to throw him away with tremendous force, pulling his tail off in the process. They all managed to see Makotsu crash into some large rocks. Blake landed on the ground and fell, completely exhausted.</span></div></div>",

About as durable as Bulma's version if not more. Only high class saiyans had access to this kind of armor.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo and Sharotto sought shade under some trees and rested there, also allowing Blake and Joana to get some rest. An hour has passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up, he felt very tired but still felt the ned to wake up. He was still near the place where Sharotto and Satomo landed, and noticed that he had been resting on Satomo's lap of all people. He stood back up while shouting -\"WHAT THE FREAKING HELL?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! I fight you, you complain, I try to be nice, you still complain?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked at Sharotto expecting some counter argument, to which she replied -\"Sorry, but she has a point...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess you got me... This time...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Satomo doesn't hate you, Abakku. If she really had meant to kill you she was more than capable of doing so with energy beams... So, just like I told her to stop her brutal behavior, I ask you to give her another chance...\"- Sharotto spoke in a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still have the feeling that if I'm ever left alone with her I'm going to suffer in some way...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You better stop that attitude...\"- Sharotto said, and without bothering to see Satomo's face (she actually had a mischievous smile), added -\"And YOU better don't get any 'funny' idea...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! I was trying to be nice for real... And also, I bet you wouldn't have complained if it had been Reinari's lap rather than mine\"- Satomo remarked, making Blake blush for a split second. She noticed this and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Joana, who had been resting onder another tree's shadow, woke up, although she was feeling extremely tired and saw everything blurry, Blake immediately went to help her. She hugged him tightly despite her current sleepy state and asked softly what had happened, to which Blake replied that it wasn't the best moment to explain, all that mattered is that she was ok. Without warning, she kissed him on the lips and wrapper her tail around his waist and fell back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Going great ape for the first time is both an exhausting and a traumatic experience... What she's doing is completely natural...\"- Sharotto commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can guess...\"- Blake was still blushing madly as Joana was asleep but wouldn't let go of him. Satomo laughed but added in a more serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She managed to recognize you even while in that state... That means she cares a lot about you... Usually for a first transformation we attack anything that isn't another great ape on instinct...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd appreciate not to be reminded anymore of that ape thing... I'm already going to need therapy to forget about this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why? It's a natural thing... for saiyans... which you are...\"- Sharotto commented, when suddenly her scouter beeped and she looked at the direction it indicated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A power level of 15,500 is on its way here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That guy Makotsu again?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not possible, you practically killed him, and even if he survived, he can't heal that fast... also, a zenkai would have given him greater power than just that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then who could it be? Is there any other of you in this planet?\"- Blake asked, in a somewhat exasperated tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... reports said a saiyan called Kakarot had been sent here 4 years before sending you here. It had been assumed he may have conquered this planet, but it's obvious he didn't... We don't know if he's loyal to Frieza or has gone independent... we better be cautious...\"- Sharotto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whom they saw resembled saiyans in no way... it was a teenager-looking guy, with extremely pale skin, a demonic tail, and long white hair, which even covered his eyes. He wore silver colored metallic armor with some golden adornments, one of which was an Omega symbol on his left shoulder. He was covered in armor except for his head, had a sheathed sword on his back, and also, wore a scouter, but it looked different from the ones Blake had already seen, this one's lens was red, and the scouter itself was black, with some small lights and an overall more advanced aspect to it. He also noticed Satomo and Sharotto standing up quickly, ready to fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jigokujin scum... How dare you show up on this planet?\"- Sharotto asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My, what a lack of manners... heh, what can be expected of a race of talking monkeys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo growled in rage at that remark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's my mission to exterminate any saiyan on sight, you actually have saved me the work of having to look for each one of you\"- The Jigokujin laughed, he noticed the sunlight in the surroundings -\"I appear to have arrived earlier than expected... ugh...\"- Then he noticed Joana hugging Blake while sleeping, and he laughed -\"Oh, did I interrupt something?\"- Blake was the one to growl angrily this time. The Jigokujin's scouter beeped and checked all of their power readings -\"1,900... 2,000... 9,000... AND 14,000... not bad... perhaps I can have a little fun for once...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me a good reason to not make a fake moon and stomp that puny bastard flat right now\"- Satomo whispered to her mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only for an emergency, if we can take him down as our normal selves that's better... Also, the sun will set soon, and the Jigokujin are most dangerous at night\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Remind me why\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They can transform in the absence of stellar radiation, aka, night... They also get stronger while in darkness even if they don't transform...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm in a hurry, so, shall we begin already?\"- The Jigokujin spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomo and Sharotto stood before their enemy, Blake behind them, in a protective manner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I would have thought the male would be the first one to take me on. but whatever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight started, Satomo and Sharotto took on the Jigokujin, attacking him at once, they were giving him some trouble to dodge their punches and kicks, in the mean time, Blake was trying to get Joana let go of him without disturbing her much. By gently tickling her tail he managed to do so, and rushed to help in the battle. Taking advantage of the Jigokujin's distraction, Blake landed a punch to his face greatly angering him. His response was a purple energy blast that pushed Blake away several meters and exploded. He was largely undamaged as his armor protected him. However, the explosion woke Joana up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was confused and surprised to see everyone fighting, and had thought the saiyan women had gotten reinforcements, but by observing, she noticed that Blake was fighting a new mysterious enemy, and the saiyan women were fighting him as well, when the alien punched Blake away, sending him near her, she asked him what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Short story, those 2 alien women are my mother and my older sister, the weirdo is someone who wants to exterminate our race...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Humans?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Saiyans. Us. People with tails...\"- Blake had his own tail on one hand while pointing at it with the other one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth observed as the Jigokujin and Sharotto exchanged barrages of energy blasts, while Satomo attempted to attack him while he was distracted. Blake and Joana went to attack him as well, but he was dodging them all effortlessly and fired a purple energy ball at Joana, which Blake intercepted himself with one of his arms. After the smoke cleared, he noticed that his arm was still intact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd have sworn that cheap armor of yours wouldn't have resisted that... But it won't resist this for sure!!\"- The Jigokujin commented, and fired a purple beam aimed at Blake's chest. Satomo appeared suddenly before him and deflected it with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That hurt a bit...\"- She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you do that?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I'm supposed to protect you, stupid baby brother...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake only had an annoyed face at her answer, Joana giggled, but they immediately resumed fighting. Sharotto demonstrated her great skill with energy, firing beams that tried to home on their target, as well as beams that would split into several smaller energy balls and again try to home on their target. The Jigokujin's armor proved to be as good as the saiyans' Then, they noticed the Jigokujin smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It has been interesting, but I sall put an end to this fight...\"- He created a black sphere of energy in his hand. Everyone was shocked as nobody knew what was that. The Jigokujin laughed as he threw the sphere up into the sky, where the sun was still shining, and proceeded to ecplise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Apparently this guy stole your trick...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stole? This technique is more ancient than your entire race!!\"- The Jigokujin laughed maniacally, as now their environment was in darkness, his eyes glowed, revealing them to be red, and unsheathed his sword -\"What a shame, to have to contaminate my own blade with the blood of mere monkeys... Feel honored as I, Blaze, the great prince of the Jigokujin, will be the one murdering you tonight...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze dashed toward Blake, intending to impale him with his sword. However, that did not hapen... Satomo took the hit herself, getting impaled in the stomach, Blaze removed his blade, causing further damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why... you?!\"- Blake's voice faltered a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Told you already, stupid little brother... I am... suppossed to protect...\"- She fell unconscious before finishing her sentence. Blake clenched his fists, and while Blaze was laughing, he suddenly glowed in a golden aura, his hair straightened up, and dashed at great speed, punching Blaze in the stomach, cracking his armor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"- His scouter started to beep like crazy -\"His power is... growing... how?!! There's no moon yet!!\"- Blake punched him in the face, leaving a golden flame that burned Blaze a bit afterwards. -\"60,000!! This makes no sense!!\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake furiously punched Blaze repeatedly, further cracking and breaking his armor. Blaze attempted to dodge or block the attacks but they were too fast for him. With a powerful kick, Blake shattered the armor on Blaze's left arm, which he had used to attempt to block it, and punched him very hard in the face, destroying one of his eyes in the process. Blaze dashed away but Blake appreared suddenly behind him, kicking him and breaking his torso armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze attacked using his sword, managging to cut Blake in an arm, but it wasn't a very deep wound, and Blake only replied with more brutal attacks, punching him repeatedly, punching through him at the end of the combo, while grabbing him by the throat with his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kill him now!!\"- Blake shouted to either Satomo or Sharotto, and after a brief moment of shock, both charged their energy beams and fired them, Blake escaped at almost the last possible moment, letting Blaze be struck by the full force of the blasts. When the smoke dissipated, however, they could see Blaze was still standing there... His arms had been disintegrated by the energy beams but part of his damaged torso and his head were still alive, and his lower body was largely intact, he spat blood and growled in anger. He focused on Blake, who was standing some meters away, and shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will see the form of the true terror. Do you think your race is the only one that can transform?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh god, not another 100 foot tal ape again\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm far above that brute form of your kind\"- Blaze regenerated his arms and healed his wounds, including his destroyed eye, he opened and closed them a few times before going on to release a powerful dark purple aura, which made the ground tremble and start to break apart, the rocks floating away. 2 large black feathered wings sprouted from Blaze's back, his fingernails turned to claws, his canine teeth grew, and his eyes now glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The power level is... 96,000!!\"- Sharotto was more than surprised 'That's about the power of Frieza's elite forces... this guy is a monster...' And she was even more shocked when she saw Blake impaling him with his own sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What...\"- Blaze said as he felt the pain from the sword stabbing his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've had enough of space freaks for a day\"- Blake said coldly as he thrusted the sword further. He noticed that Blaze's scouter was damaged but seemed to be still working, and saw small lights flashing in it while it beeped. Blaze slashed at Blake's chest with his claws, causing some wounds that bled, he also pulled his sword out of himself, and instead of attacking Blake, he dashed toward Joana and slashed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake managed to push Joana away from Blaze's incoming attack, receiving the slash himself in the face... It cut a straight line that went from about an inch above his eyebrow to an inch below his left eye. Sharotto managed to fire a beam that blasted through Blaze's chest. However, Blaze's spaceship (small and triangular, more similar looking to an advanced one-manned airplane) came to him, creating a powerful energy shield that surrounded itself and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ugh... enjoy the time you have left, monkeys... the next time you see me, you'll die\"- Blaze almost crawled to his spaceship and while keeping the force field on, took off to space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I really will look forward to killing him when our great army begins war\"- Sharotto growled, as she saw Blake laying on the ground with a wound in the face, which was bleeding rather profusely. Joana was a bit stunned by Blake pushing her away but then she saw why, and hurried to pick him up and carry him on her back. Sharotto did the same with her daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where can they get medical attention?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My house, follow me\"- Joana ran desperately, closely followed by Sharotto, until they arrived to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Joana's house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU WHAT?!!\"- Sarah screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We kinda knew this day may come at some point... If Joana's real parents came for her, we have no right to stop her... Also... Blake IS an alien of the same species as Joana, though she beat me to finding that out... How? Honestly no idea. My point is that she didn't go alone anyway\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been an hour since that happened\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the argument went on, Joana arrived to the house, with Blake on her back, still conscious but very exhausted. Both her adoptive parents were already shocked to see both of them with wounds, and got an even greater surprise when seeing a woman they saw never before, with a similar armor to Blake's and Joana's, carrying an unconscious girl on her back. John noticed that she had a tail like them, wrapped around her waist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry for appearing like this but we have quite an emergency\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not to be rude, but who are these people?\"- Sarah asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Sharotto. I'm Abakku's mother\"- Noticing both John and Sarah's confused looks, she added -\"You call him Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of surprise, John led them to the medical section of his lab, where he could attend their wounds. The first he noticed upon checking on Satomo was that her armor looked intact, despite being soaked in blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Our armor can self-repair via nanomachines, but only as long as it's not completely destroyed\"- Sharotto commented, and indicating John to remove Satomo's armor. John removed their torso armor without as much problem but stopped after that, hesitant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm, does she have any clothes under the jumpsuit?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was looking down -\"Maybe you should proceed with the rest... Here are bandages and disinfectant\"- Sharotto was thoughtful for a moment and then she laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you telling me you can't see my daughter naked?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn almost felt like fainting from that utterly direct question -\"Well, by human etiquette rules... it's not the most appropiate thing to do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Screw that, just remove her jumpsuit so you can put her in a healing tank\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's a healing tank\"- John asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto facepalmed herself -\"Nevermind, just do it and attend her wounds however you people treat wounds\"- Sighing, John had to do as she said, he first applied disinfectant to the wounds, and proceeded to suture them. Sharotto was a bit annoyed from seeing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So primitive, to sew one's flesh as if it were cloth'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter suturing the wounds, John dressed Satomo with a hospital gown and went to check on Blake. He was conscious but exhausted, and his wound wasn't too deep, John confirmed that his eye was not damaged, so, after disinfecting, a piece of gauze and bandage over his eye was enough to take care of it. Joana stayed by his side the whole time, and John left to talk to Sharotto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... you came for Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes\"- After that, John asked about their people and culture, commenting that he was curious of why would they send their childrren to Earth. Sharotto commented that it was because it was labeled as a weak planet, its inhabitants were no threat to their race, and thus, their children would be safe there. Then Sharotto told him the story of their race and how they ended up as they are nowadays. (John would write it all down later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry for your losses\"- John said, noticing a hint of sadness when Sharotto told him of the death of most of their kind, her husband among them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright, they died as proud warriors, fighting to death bravely, defending their world, their comrades, their blood, their pride... They died as true saiyans\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's been of saiyans these days?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We are supposed to be extinct, so, we can't show ourselves in many planets... We live as space nomads, raiding planets for resources to supply us with... while we retrieved all the saiyan children across space. Abakku, my son, is the last one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn already had learned that they were a warrior race that killed people and fought wars for a living, and them being space nomads didn't surprise him as much, but wondered what would happen once Blake was retrieved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We will fight again. Frieza will pay for all the saiyans he killed that day. The Saiyan Army will rise again. We're also going to absolutely destroy the Jigokujin. Those were also implied in the attack against us, and won't be forgiven... Don't worry though. I'll make sure that your planet gets spared. But I can't guarantee it won't be annexed to the saiyan empire afterwards\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was honestly a bit scared but decided it wasn't in his power to do much to stop such a thing, and right now his best bet was to attend the daughter's wounds and hope Sharotto keeps her promise about Earth. John later asked Sharotto about Joana, and she answered that she was thought to have been lost, as the data about her location had been lost due to corruption of the saiyan children registry files. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Her saiyan name is Reinari, and she is the daughter of a good friend of mine. I can't imagine how happy will be after learning her daughter was finally found... She's been looking for her all these years and just recently gave up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, John would mention the ocular devices whose function he couldn't figure out, Sharotto laughed and told him that these were scouters, devices that can read the power of living beings, they're most useful for battle and to communicate, or track and find particular objects. Over the years the scouter technology has advanced and the current scouters saiyan use won't overload like those worn by other races, and their communication and tracking fucntions have been improved. When John showed her the note that came with Blake, she gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is Kailan's writing... He was always bad at handwriting\"- Sharotto laughed for a moment, reading the note -\"I'll read this to Abakku after he's recovered\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharotto's scouter beeped, indicating someone with a power level above human average was approaching them</span></div></div>",

At least that punk died along with goku, but ryan asked piccolo to train gohan for the saiyans\u2019s arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ryan watched them fight before getting an idea and he ran over to get to his god-brother. He got to the pod without much trouble and he looked at the control panel near the door of the pod before pressing a certain pattern of keys. The door opened and the fight stopped briefly with goku and piccolo smiling and smirking respectively. Raditz was looking at him with surprised and shock to see a human open a saiyan spacepod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever let someone get behind you.\u201d Was heard behind raditz who eyes widen from the mistake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHidden Technique: 1000 Years of Pain.\u201d Ryan said before raditz felt something up his ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt propelled him into the air before face-planting the ground and his ass was hurting. Goku and piccolo looked to see ryan used his foot to kick his ass and they were laughing and chuckling. He walked over to gohan and got down to his level before patting him on the head with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohan, can you do something for me?\u201d ryan asked his god brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, ryan?\u201d he asked curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your dad fight and if he gets hurt, get really angry and use a full power head-butt into that man\u2019s chest over there.\u201d Ryan said pointing to the same man he kicked his ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan seemed to think about it before nodding and he went into hiding behind a rock to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d Ryan said before seeing raditz getting up and his face was red from anger and the fact that a human got the drop on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did you do that?\u201d raditz asked before charging at ryan who was looking at him with a glare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m just a human, then you are wrong about that.\u201d Ryan said before gathering his power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said before checking his power level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA power level of 5,000?\u201d was asked before ryan smirked and he punched him in the face sending him into a tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Was ryan really holding back during our spars?~ goku thought slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know ryan was holding back, but what reason.~ piccolo thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just have to use this much of my power.\u201d Ryan said stretching his body making it crack loudly as he sighed in relief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~He clearly not a human, but maybe one of us if this is his limit.~ raditz thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sensed you near another power level that felt like it was younger than me.\u201d Ryan said getting serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoku, why does his name sounds like radish?\u201d he asked without taking his eyes off his opponent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was chuckling as piccolo rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know ryan.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiccolo thought of something and he smirked before taking a stance with placing his index and middle fingers to his forehead. He started to charge his energy for an attack and ryan knows what he is planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~He is going to use that attack and he will need five minutes.~ ryan thought before charging at his opponent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was about to help ryan like a friend he is, but he caught a look from ryan and goku ran passed him towards his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ryan and piccolo have something planned so I have to help some way.~ he thought before getting behind radizt and grabbed him by the tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I feel weak?\u201d the brother asked before turning around to see goku holding onto his tail smiling at his bit in the plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you two can hold him for five minutes while I prepare a final attack?\u201d piccolo asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think goku can hold him for that long.\u201d Ryan said smirking at the fallen brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned his head off to a direction sensing something of a few power levels in a fight and he would have to look into it later. While ryan was distracted, radizt gathered what left of his energy and blasting ryan with it in the form of a weaken Saturday Crush. When ryan got hit, he was sent flying to the ground a few feet away and that made goku lost his focus. Raditz felt the grip on his tail loosen so he smiled before kicking goku away from him. Ryan was getting up from the cheap shot as he saw the older brother stomping on goku\u2019s ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Gohan has to act now.~ ryan thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohan, now.\u201d Ryan called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan was seeing his father being attacked and that was making an inner rage burn within him. His power started to rise as his power was forming a sphere around him and he charged at the person attacking his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave my daddy alone!\u201d the young boy screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d raditz asked as his scouter picked up on the rising power level<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaditz stopped and turned around before getting nailed in the chest by gohan\u2019s head-butt. Only that attack was able to crack the saiyan\u2019s armor and ryan grabbed gohan before raditz could attack the boy. Ryan was smiling before he started to hear the sound of static and he sees piccolo was still charging his final attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, gohan.\u201d Ryan said before looking at raditz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat kid must die.\u201d He said limping over to the kid as both ryan and goku got a hold of the brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about done charging, ryan, goku.\u201d Piccolo said as ryan nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was thinking of something in the next few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m going to keep ryan alive even if I die with raditz.~ he thought before pushing ryan away from radish and putting him into a full nelson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay hello to uncle nelson.\u201d Goku said with a ryan like smile as ryan was getting up from the force of the push<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What is he thinking?~ ryan thought before seeing what goku was doing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~So he saved me from dying along with him.~ ryan thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers were talking before piccolo was done charging his final attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Never thought I would get to use this on goku like this.~ piccolo thought with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohan, be sure to protect your mother and listen to what ryan tells you.\u201d Goku said to the confused boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, daddy?\u201d gohan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see in about a minute or two.\u201d Goku said as piccolo aimed his attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial Beam Cannon!\u201d piccolo called out his attack as he fired it at the brothers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku\u2019s friends felt something relating to their friend and they went to him. Ryan was holding gohan before looking at piccolo withan irritated look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiccolo, can you train gohan?\u201d ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was about to answer when they heard something coming towards them and they knew it was his friends. Raditz is hanging on by a thread, but enough to hear them talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo goku died protecting his son and his friend.\u201d Master Roshi said sadly as ryan nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma had an idea that will work and cheer them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, why don\u2019t we use the dragon balls to wish goku back to life?\u201d she asked as ryan nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d raditz asked as piccolo and ryan turned to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiccolo is explaining the dragon balls while ryan was watching him and he noticed something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank for that bit of information now my two comrades will be here in a year\u2019s time so they can wish me back.\u201d raditz said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~That was a trap.~ ryan thought before piccolo killed the older brother as the others were around the dying goku<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, goku\u2019s body disappeared meaning goku will be doing something for kami. Ryan noticed gohan was looking at him and he hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother, daddy will come back right?\u201d he asked as the others chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know you will get stronger for him.\u201d Ryan said smiling at him rubbing his head<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n: End flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed to meet again in a year of training to fight the incoming threat. </span></div></div>",

Why are you here? Where is goku and my little gohan?\u201d she asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there what happened at kame house, but I met up with goku and piccolo for a battle. They were fighting an opponent as I went to save gohan and I helped out a little in their fight, but in the end goku pushed me out of the way so he could protect me and his son. Bulma and the others are going to wish goku back to life and gohan is on a training trip with piccolo.\u201d Ryan explained with a serious look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you go after him, I think it would be a good idea since he would learn how to protect himself and he wants to make his dad proud of him.\u201d He added before looking to see tears in her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you me to do while my son could die?\u201d she asked getting hysterical<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust piccolo and you trust me, but you can have gohan work on his studies after he finished his training.\u201d he said and she perked up at the word studies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but I don\u2019t want my gohan becoming a delinquent.\u201d She said agreeing with him and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan had a bite to eat with chichi so she would have company and he was about to take off to see about that energy from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are you going?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to look into something and maybe convince my family to move here for a change of pace.\u201d He said before waving her off and flying into the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Now to find that power level from before to where it caused me to loose my focus on the fight.~ ryan thought as he was flying higher so people wouldn\u2019t see him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNote to self: see if mom and dad can help me with restraining my power level.\u201d He said to himself before looking down to see a forest area and he descended to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I think they have something for me to try out.~ he thought before remembering his saiyan training with his family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A young ryan about the age of 6 is trying to make energy blasts with his ki like his mother taught him. His brother and sister are watching him trying to complete the task at hand. He kept his focus until it blew up in his face. They were looking at a face full of soot and one hair on his head had a small flame on it. Rei walked over to him and put the flame out before helping him on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle brother, I think I know why you are having trouble with this easy exercise.\u201d She said as he look at her with wide eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What is it?\u201d he asked wanting to know<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are trying too hard to make it work. Relax before let the flow of you ki into your hands forming a ball.\u201d She explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded before getting into a relaxed position and he started to gathering energy into his hands. Soon when he felt it was ready, he fired the ki blast near their brother who jumped back away from the blast. He glared at him while their sister was giggling at them before patting ryan on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, ryan; but try not to use our brother as a target.\u201d She said as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents were watching them from afar smiling at them as the older kids helping out their younger brother. Their father is chucking at ryan before his wife playfully slap his shoulder with smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the same when you were with bardock, kailin, and Yousei.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months, ryan was able to control his ki and he started to learn from his father and brother how to fight. Ryan was a fast learner during his lessons, but he had speed and he was lacking in power. He spent majority of his time training with his brother while their sister is watching them. All three of them know that they had the ability to get stronger if they got hit from a fatal attack. Ryan has yet to experience it as his parents wanted to get strong enough before they start the real training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~They are going to make training hell.~ ryan thought as he was resting from his last training session with his brother and father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan, tomorrow you will begin the real training.\u201d his father said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to make sure that you will be strong as one of our friends.\u201d His mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBardock.\u201d His father said as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was one of our best friends with two others and their wives.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow strong was he?\u201d ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe had a power level of 10,000.\u201d His mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you make me stronger than that?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we could, but that would mean that you would have to hold back somewhat.\u201d His father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour siblings are stronger than that, but they wear limiters so they don\u2019t have to hold back.\u201d his mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you get strong enough, you will have to use limiters and you can choose what kind you want.\u201d She added as his siblings revealed their limiters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother are wearing a silver pendent around his neck and matching bracers on his wrists. Rei had gold earrings three on each ear and a bracelet on her left wrist. Ryan thought about of getting one set or the other, but he smiled at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want both sets of limiters.\u201d He said as his parents smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you will have to gain a truly massive power level that is close to broly.\u201d His father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Legendary Super saiyan, but I think he isn\u2019t the one of the legend.\u201d His mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan developed a thinking pose of his own and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be the strongest and I will fight him to be the true legendary super saiyan.\u201d He said determined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we have to get you up to 10,000 quickly and have you control it with ease.\u201d Rei said finally getting into help her little brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan had a power level of 500 before he went through with his hell training. Now he has 8,050 through the amount of zenkais he had during a month and he had one last session of the training from hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had five zenkais a day just to get me to his point and this last one will get me to 10,000.\u201d Ryan said as his brother was resting from the session before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, this session might push you pass the mark we set for you.\u201d His father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter if I go pass 10,000?\u201d ryan asked slightly confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot personally, but you might have a harder time controlling it.\u201d His mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded before he got into his stance that he was taught by his father and brother. His family smirked before going their own stance and the final zenkai session has begun. A few minutes into the training, ryan is doing well with dodging attacks and firing a few ki blast with precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~His control is almost perfect, but it will go down when he gets his last zenkai.~ they thought about ryan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Have to do better before they completely overwhelm me.~ ryan thought before charging at his brother for an attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~He really must be trying his best before the usual happens.~ kizaki thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had enough time to block the first punch, but not the second one or the first kick which followed the punch. Ryan smirk as he got his first few hits on his brother, but sense someone behind and moved out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, but it won\u2019t work on me this time.\u201d Ryan said as his father attack his brother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan attacked his father and dodge attacks left and right from his family showing he was learning from them and their tactics. Ryan was winning against them and he was smiling that he was doing better this one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, you are exceptionally better; but you still have much to learn.\u201d His father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family surrounded him like before and he dodging like hell as they were giving him one last usual beating.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n: end flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan remembered that his power level went to 10,000 as promised and then some to round it to 15,000 from his family final training session from hell. He landed on the ground as he was hunting for those power levels from earlier and his search brought him to a forest where strange fruit grow and a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~They must be inside.~ ryan thought walking to the house at a slow pace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when a woman wearing saiyan armor and a scouter walked out to greet him. He raised an eyebrow at her before getting a look of her face. His eyes widen remembering the stories his parent\u2019s missions before they came here to live in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not kakarot, but we call him goku here and you will see him at the fight with the saiyans one year from now.\u201d Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that I could be one of the saiyan you were told about?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents told me and my siblings about their missions before they started to live here. They gave us every detail about the three pairs of parents to Goku, a boy, and a girl. You are the boy\u2019s mother that much I can tell.\u201d Ryan explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are your parents?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir names are Chigumerei and Kazihiro Kasshi.\u201d Ryan said as they woman\u2019s eyes widen from the mention of the names meaning she knows them</span></div></div>",

I hope that explains almost everything, it's in some cases heavily modified from the original story... Not recommended for purists...]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story starts 15 years after Ichigo Kurosaki was born, and 2 months before classes started. It was an ordinary summer day at Karakura Town... Another 15 years old guy was wandering around the town's streets, seemingly without anything else to do. He was 180 cm tall, had tanned skin, and black wavy hair. And was wearing a black open jacket, with a light gray shirt under it, as well as black jeans and tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional to all this, he always wore a silver chain around his neck, with two small silver charms, a chinese symbol for \"light\" (like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.goldenjewelrystore.com/images/chinese-symbols/big/sterling-silver-light-chineb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.goldenjewelrystore.com/images...</a> ) as well as a wing ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://d200fahol9mbkt.cloudfront.net/item/9318761/Wing_1_Charm_1st.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://d200fahol9mbkt.cloudfront.net/ite...</a> ). These had been given by his mother and his father in his 13th birthday, though he wore the chain since he was 5 years old...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to what he was doing, well, he was just wandering around, walking to no specific place, while thinking about many things, walking somewhat helped him to think and to relax. Until suddenly, he crouched, and two thugs crashed against each other in mid air, they had intended to take him by surprise. The guy simply resumed walking until one of them shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't think you'll escape that easily!! You WILL pay for what you've done!!\"- He and the other thug charged toward the guy, who hit both of them in the stomach with his elbows, without even turning around or looking, and quickly, caught a third thug's fist, and punched him in the stomach as well. He walked away, saying no word, and leaving three teenager bullies writhing in pain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom some distance, a strawberry teenager, along a tall dark skinned and brown haired one watched the whole scene, the strawberry blond  said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought we were the only ones with trouble with those guys...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... Blake has been fighting them as often as us if not even more often...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really? How do you know his name, Chad?\"- The strawberry blond asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because he IS in our class, Ichigo\"- Chad replied -\"Never noticed him, huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope...\"- Ichigo scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He doesn't talk very much...\"- Chad added, and Ichigo raised an eyebrow, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you say that, it means the guy doesn't talk at all...\"- Ichigo and Chad laughed at the joke, then Ichigo added -\"But he's popped out of nowhere in our fights some times... and whenever I asked him, he just would say he passed by...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe he tries to be friendly?\"- Chad said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, Chad, I don't know...\"- Ichigo and Chad kept walking, they were just walking on their own as well, and talking about a lot of stuff. Although he always had a weird feeling when Blake was near...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake, who was just wondering what to do, stared at the sky, it was blue, with no clouds. Nobody else knew, but he had been able to see \"ghosts\" or the souls of the dead. Not only that, but he also learned that there existed also \"evil ghosts\" as well, which always tried to devour him or the dead souls. He had also learned that he could transform into a ghost himself, leaving his body behind. He was determined to help the dead people and protect them from the monsters, and also found that he could send those souls to heaven, by touching their heads with his hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, some of the monsters he fought were capable of talking, and some of them kept saying \"Murderer!! Murderer!! You have no right to kill your own kind!!\" Blake, as very young child, was confused by the statement, but didn't let the doubts get the best of him and went on to exterminate any monster he encountered. He thought it was probably just some trick to make him doubt and be devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other monsters would question his actions, saying \"Who gave you the right to judge us?\" \"Who are you to say eating souls is wrong?\" and such. Blake determined to not feel any sort of mercy to the monsters anyway, specially after seeing the horror in the faces of dead souls he wasn't able to save... He felt that it had to be horrible to be eaten like that, to an extent he couldn't probably understand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had noticed that when he was out of his body, his clothing changed to a white open jacket, with a black shirt under it. He also had a white hakama, black tabi (japanese socks) and white zori, quite strange as Blake would know these are clothes from older times. But he didn't really mind, as nobody could see him other than the dead souls and the monsters. Blake also found that he had a small hole in his wrist. It bothered him because it looked like the holes he found in the monsters he fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew up, his abilities had grown stronger, and even in his body, he was able to destroy the monsters, although he preferred to not use it, so he couldn't be seen. Which also helped, because one day, about 5 years ago, he had a strange dream with voices calling him, and woke up with two swords in his hands. Two nodachi, to be more accurate, with golden hilts, and circular tsuba (handguard), one of them silver, and the other one golden, both of them had an heptagram symbol in relief ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://0.tqn.com/d/altreligion/1/0/h/1/-/-/heptagram_acute.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://0.tqn.com/d/altreligion/1/0/h/1/-...</a> ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one with golden tsuba, had a kanji symbol, in gold, although non relief, on its right side, ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.xnvx.com/data/thumbnails/89/Japanese_Kanji_Symbols_Death.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.xnvx.com/data/thumbnails/89/J...</a> ) which was read \"Death\". The one with silver tsuba had a different kanji, in slight relief ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.davidhed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/angel1.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.davidhed.com/blog/wp-content/...</a> ) which read \"Angel\". Blake didn't get what they really meant, but he found the weapons weren't visible to people, and that they were effective to kill the monsters. So, his fighting style adopted the use of two swords, though Blake was self-taught on the matter, and developed his own style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing dead souls, and facing the monsters in continuous fights were things that stressed Blake to some degree, and he increased the frequency of his walks, to seek some relief for his mind. He felt like he was carrying a great weight on his shoulders, and he had found none of the answers for his questions. He kept wondering on all this, when he was forcefully snapped out of it when he got struck by something from above. Blake was really surprised that something caught him off guard like that, and then found it was not something, but someone... a girl... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?\"- Blake mumbled, and noticed nobody could see the girl, and people thought he had tripped. He didn't really know what to do, but the girl probably was another dead soul, and so, he decided to carry her over his shoulders (not that anybody would notice) and walked to his house. He put her on his bed and waited for her to wake up, and in the mean time, Blake decided to stay at his room (to protect her in case another monster appeared), and play some videogames while waiting, as he was usually alone for most of the day. Now that Blake noticed, the girl had fair skin, brown hair, was dressed like him as a ghost... with black tabi, white zori sandals, a white hakama, and a white jacket as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Creepy...' Blake thought, and what scared him a bit was that she was like him, except for the hole in the wrist, nor she had any sword. ' I'll definitively ask this girl some questions' Blake thought. This had to be the strangest thing that happened to him in his entire life, and he of most people had seen many really strange things...</span></div></div>",

I'm just a weird human that can see ghosts...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"- The girl didn't know what else to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way, my name is Blake...\"- He added. The girl was seemingly confused, and Blake added -\"You can call me that. I don't really like to be called by my family name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, almost randomly, a lots of memories flashed in her mind, where she could see she was called Joana by others... She blinked twice, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana... my name is Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just remembered it, didn't you?\"- Blake had a great ability to read other people, despite not showing much emotion himself. He only seemed to care for the dead souls, as he felt he didn't fit in human teenagers' groups. Nor that he really wanted to. The girl nodded in response, and Blake said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. It's a good sign. You might recover sooner than I thought\"- Despite being 15, Blake had a lot of medical knowledge from reading, and had learned some things from the ghosts he had helped... Just then, Blake instinctively pushed Joana off the bed, and when she sat up to ask why he did such a thing, she saw that Blake was stopping a strange monster with his hands... he had pushed her so the monster didn't hurt her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt completely powerless, and looked in horror, as Blake's skin started to show signs of burning. Blake kicked the monster in the face, off the house's 2nd floor. He said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stay here!! If another monster comes just shout...\"- Blake himself jumped off the 2nd floor, landing in his house's backyard, while the monster roared angrily, then, it spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stupid!! I'll eat you both anyway!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, I've been told I have a bad taste\"- Blake replied with sarcasm, and said to the monster -\"Bring it on!!\"- The monster, which was navy blue, with a white wolf shaped mask, with red horizontal stripes on the left side, and seemingly made of bone, dashed toward Blake (in fours, completely wolf-like), who dodged him and kicked him in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster quickly turned around and tried to attack Blake by biting (similar to how a real wolf does) And Blake stopped his jaws with his hands, although they were burning, and even some smoke was visible... Unknown to him, Joana was watching them, and felt terrible when she noticed Blake's hands were burning. He didn't seem to mind too much, as he kept punching the monster's mask, but before Blake gave what seemed to be the finishing blow, other 3 monsters appeared, all wolf like, but differently colored and with different complexions (some were smaller and thinner, others taller but still thinner, and some heavier ones)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made a horrible roar that sounded like a dying wolf, and then they all attacked Blake at the same time. It looked like it was a total carnage, and the blue wolf-like monster emerged from the chaos, with Blake in his mouth, as a sinister prize. Joana couldn't help but let some tears drop, and felt very bad, because she caused the guy who helped her to die. But then she heard his voice, and noticed Blake was still alive, and shoved his fist down the blue wolf-like monster's throat, choking him, and forcing him to release him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then, barely standing, said -\"You ASKED for it!!\"- He fell unconscious, and the monsters started to laugh, until one of them, a green and thinner one, was suddenly sliced in two, and Blake, with different clothing, was standing behind him, with a sword unsheathed. The wolves looked at the lying body in confusion, and the leader, the blue one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait!! No chain of fate!! What the hell is wrong with this thing?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wolf was sliced in two, and Blake, without looking, fired from his hand what looked like a red energy ball, exploding in contact against the monster's face, and shattering its mask, as well as its head. The two remaining monsters, a red one, besides the blue one, got on two feet and tried to smash Blake down with their fists, but Blake stopped both of them with a single hand, and cut the red one horizontally, the blue one just got a bad wound. And growled very angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't forgive this, I will...!!\"- Blake disappeared before his eyes, and before he could finish the phrase, he was beheaded from behind. Blake swiftly sheathed the sword (a nodachi) and walked toward his body. Then Joana jumped off the second floor and ran toward Blake, who was aiming his hand at his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who are you?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I mean, who are you really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just a guy that helps dead souls...\"- Blake answered, while still aiming his hand at his body, and gathering small blue particles, and she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Energy. I can gather it and use it to heal either myself or others...\"- Blake replied, and the wounds in his physical body healed rather quickly, then, Blake put his body on like it was some type of clothing, and blinked once, then added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good as new\"- Blake opened and closed his hands a few times, confirming this. Then, a metallic sounding horrendous roar was heard, and Blake sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Could you take care of it? It seems there are some more ghost bullies that need to be kicked really hard...\"- Blake went out of his body once again, and Joana opened her eyes wide because now that she was closer, she noticed his clothes were nearly identical to hers, except that he wore the jacket open, while hers was more like a long sleeved blouse, although both jackets were long tailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hollow appeared from what seemed to be a dark portal, and it had a feline-like mask, but very muscular, and large (standing on two feet at 9'10\"). It also had very long, thick and sharp claws, It immediately tried to slash Blake with them, but he stopped the strike with his sword, and using his free hand, cut the monster's hand, revealing a second sword, apparently identical to the first one. The monster roared and its hand reformed... Blake had seen that many times, but it disturbed him tat he had the same ability...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that brief moment of distraction, the monster was able to punch Blake and send him a few meters away, although Blake was able to stop instead of being knocked down, and dashed toward the monster, which tried to bite Blake, but failed to realize that Blake had already planned the move, and pierced his head through his open mouth, finishing off with a beheading strike from his other sword, the monster started to dissolve into particles, and Blake sheathed his swords after swiftly removing the blood from them. His body started to get healed. Joana was still hugging his body tightly,  and when Blake came back, she ran and gave him a hug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she thought she gave him a hug... Blake could only feel everything inside him cracking, and said, with the few air that hadn't been knocked out of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Let...go...please...\"- The few minutes Joana was hugging him seemed like an eternity, and when she released him, he fainted, much to Joana's own dismay. About half of an hour later, he woke up, in his room, and mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What a crazy dream!!\"-</span></div></div>",

I didn't know...\"- Joana said with an apologetic tone -\"I didn't know I had such strength...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was insane... None of the monsters I've fought are that strong...\"- Blake added, but noticed Joana was feeling bad for it, and put a hand on her shoulder -\"Don't worry. I guess it's not a bad thing, heh... next time, you can send those things to hell in a single slap\"- Blake said with a smile because of the joke, but Joana realized it was the first time she had seen him smile, and in a lighter mood than before. She playfully pushed him aside with the least strength possible, but still pushed him off the bed, which led to Blake's inevitable \"Ouch!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana immediately helped him to get up, and he said -\"You have to work on that strength of yours...\"- She just looked away in slight embarrassment, then she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did you know the monster was going to attack us?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fast reflexes... After fighting them for over 10 years, I got used to it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana knew Blake said the truth, as he previously killed all those monsters with ease. Then, she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um... did you notice... your clothes were like mine?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was going to ask the same exact question...\"- Blake replied -\"The only thing I know is that I've been always to see both good and evil ghosts, and have the power to face the latter ones... I don't know what it is, or where does it come from...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Joana trembled a little, and Blake was surprised by this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something... is coming...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn...\"- Blake got out of his body once again, and he said, partially in a joking tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, no bear hugs, I've just fixed that body, and it's the only one I have...\"- He jumped to the roof, and noticed several dark holes opening in the air, and more monsters were coming out of them. These ones had many different appearances, but all of them had a hole -usually in the chest- and a bone mask with different designs. Joana could hear the swords' swinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Blake a few minutes, but he finished off a dozen of monsters. He sheathed his swords once again and jumped down to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Geez, those monsters really have a thing for you...\"- He said, and then he remembered, one of the times he was talking to a spirit he was helping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"What does attract these things?\"- A then 10 years old Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Spiritual energy. These things will go after anyone with higher spiritual than the rest... naturally, since all dead people are made of it, these things will go after us instead of the living... and even among us, those who have more spiritual energy are the most chased...\"- A wise old man's spirit replied</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So... her power is attracting them...and there are good chances mine do as well...' He thought, and Joana hadn't said a word because she noticed he was thoughtful for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nevermind...\"- Blake said -\"Do you have any idea about where did you come from?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No\"- Joana replied -\"I just remember escaping from something... and then I woke up here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... Well... Uhh... Do yo have a place to sleep?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... Not really...\"- She looked down in some embarrassment, Blake sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can sleep here if you want...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"- She hugged him again, and then she heard bones cracking, and released Blake, who muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... much... pain...\"- Before he fainted, and after some seconds he got out of his body once again, and said -\"You know, you really have to stop doing that...\"- He healed his body and in a few minutes, he got inside it again. He didn't notice but Joana had blushed slightly, and she got even redder when he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, there's the bed...\"- She started to stutter, until she noticed Blake went to his closet, and got out something that looked like a net, and she noticed a hook in a wall, and another one in the opposite one. Blake set it up rather quickly, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. I always sleep on this... I never got used to beds...\"- Blake just got onto the hammock, for now, he was sitting on it, and said to Joana -\"Before going to sleep, I'll just explain you the rules if you'll stay here...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Rules?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing too complicated, just don't do anything stupid. As I've told you, you're invisible to people, so, if you do anything such as grabbing an object, people will, I repoat, WILL freak out... Just stay in my room while I'm not here... Also, don't talk to people, they won't hear you, nor touch them, because that will scare them as well. Understood?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But if I'm alone, what if another monster appears?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have a good point... I'll think about it. Tomorrow I'll see what can we do about that... Good night\"- Blake laid in his hammock, and closed his eyes. Joana went to the bed and decided to sleep as well. She was surprised that Blake didn't really mind she was sleeping in the same room, nor that he let her stay rather easily... But she knew those things would keep her from sleeping, so, she relaxed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later, she woke up, and it was morning already. Blake was still sleeping, and for some reason, she just smiled, and lied back on the bed. Some minutes later, Blake woke up, and after a brief greeting, he went to wash his face and have some breakfast. After he was done, he went back upstairs, and asked Joana about what she was going to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure you aren't dead?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know...\"- She replied, then Blake got up, and put his hand on her forehead, and his hand started to glow in blue light<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's try...\"- However, after a moment, nothing happened, and Blake was surprised, then he tried with both hands over her forehead, and mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Go to Heaven...\"- However, nothing happened, and after a moment, Blake stopped, and said in a confused tone -\"This is the first time that doesn't work... So, I guess you're not dead...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's good?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess... it's more weird than good though...\"- Blake said, with a thoughtful look -\"However, this is just riskier, as you're a free soul, and the monsters will keep trying to eat you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -\"Oh...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You seem to have some powers. So, I'll teach you to defend yourself...\"- Blake got out of his body, and put it in the hammock, like he was still sleeping. Then, he said -\"Follow me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey jumped off the second floor, and started walking. Now that she was close to him, she noticed Blake had his 2 swords sheathed. After about half an hour, they walked into an abandoned factory, and Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's no people here. This is the ideal place to train...\"- Blake then added -\"Since you don't have a sword, I'll teach you hand to hand combat\"- Just for a brief moment, Blake questioned himself about teaching a girl he just met, yet again, he knew that he couldn't let the monsters eat another soul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with the basic stuff, such as stances (Blake's fighting style was self taught, and developed in order to fight back both at the monsters and the bullies at school). Then they tried a sparring match, but Blake was dumbfounded when Joana was able to dodge him effortlessly, and when he finally could land a hit on her, it did nothing, and his hand hurt instead. She had a worried look, and he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry about this. Keep fighting...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on dodging because she was afraid of further hurting him, and when she blocked, and Blake's fist hit her forearm, the bones cracking could be heard, and she stopped the training. Blake started to gather energy and his hand healed in a few seconds. Then they resumed, but with the same results, Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell? Are you made of iron or what?\"- Joana shrugged in answer. Blake decided to try something riskier, and without warning, he sheathed one of his swords, and tried to hit Joana, and even more strangely, she stopped the tip of the blade with just two fingers!! Blake dashed backwards to get some distance, and tried again, this time, the sword clashed against her left forearm, which she used to block. Instead of blood, the sword's clash created a lot of sparks, and sounded as if it had hit solid steel. Blake now had a O_O face, and muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell did I get myself into?\"- Then, he sheathed the sword, and he said -\"You said you couldn't fight!! How come you move faster than me, and not even the swords can hurt you?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, I swear...\"- Joana said apologetically, Blake sighed, and resumed on hand to hand combat, although he found difficult to teach someone faster and seemingly stronger than himself. They trained for at least 6 hours more (They had gotten up at 8:00 AM, and went to rain at 9.00 AM, so, it was about 3.00 PM when they were done). Joana apologized many times, because she thought Blake was mad at her, despite he said it was ok. When they got outside the factory, Blake noticed more holes in the air, which only meant the monsters had followed them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time, Blake told Joana to fight them as her \"homework\" for the day. She engaged in fight against them, and was able to shatter their masks in single hits. She could even slice one of them with a kick. And their hits and attempts to bite had no effect on her. However, the last standing monster was somewhat tal, and Joana was at level with his chest hole, and she seemed to fall into some sort of trance, which the monster took advantage of, hitting her in the stomach, and throwing her away. Blake quickly drew his sword and sliced the monster vertically. Then he ran to where Joana was, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell happened?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hollows...\"- She said, seemingly still in the trance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hollows...\"- She said again, and Blake thought he referred to the monster's hole, and that seemingly all of them had one. He then tried to wake her up, or snap her out of it, but she seemed to be still on that, until she closed her eyes and fell unconscious. Blake had no other option than to carry her over his shoulders, back to his house. Good thing both were invisible... well, that's what he thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the possibility of being seen, Blake walked past a cafe, carrying the girl over his shoulders, and ichigo, who was hanging out with Tatsuki and Chad, nearly choked  on his drink, and when they asked what was going on, he said he just breathed in a wrong moment. Although, Ichigo didn't really see who was, but seeing a guy in white weird clothes carrying a girl similarly clothed, and his knowledge telling him that they were probably ghosts, still shocked him. He also noticed that the guy had a sheathed sword...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Creepy' That's all he thought, and resumed hanging out with his friends, though he wasn't fully relaxed anymore, well, he had been stressed for long, but he got even more stressed now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blake, he went back to his room, and placed Joana on the bed, and waited for her to wake up again. This time he didn't ply videogames, as he wasn't in the mood, and was actually tired from the training. His body ached a bit because of it, and went to get something to eat. 30 minutes later, Blake was already done, and Joana woke up again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, don't tell me you've just forgotten everything...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? No!! I just... got knocked out, or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You were like in some sort of trance...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. I'm sorry, I guess I shouldn't have made you fight them this early... It seems that the monster's appearance scared you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you say that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you stared at the hole in its chest, and then you got into that trance, and even said 'Hollows... hollows...'. I never thought that would be so traumatic, yet again, I'm not a normal guy to tell...\"- And Joana looked at nowhere, thoughtfully, then, she snapped her fingers, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was not that... Memories flashed in my mind... and I remembered... the hollows...\"- Blake had a further confused look, and Joana added -\"Hollows, that's what you call monsters... they are souls with no heart,,, that's what the hole in their chests mean...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whoah, stop it right there!!\"- Blake said -\"How do you know so much about them?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I just remembered that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you were pursued by hollows before getting knocked and losing your memories?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope. I don't remember clearly, but what was pursuing me weren't hollows. They were something else...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... I guess I shouldn't press on the matter...\"- Blake said. Now he had more questions... the monsters, called hollows, have said he was one of them more than once, and he knows he's always had a hole in his left wrist... 'What does all that mean? Am I really one of them? Does this hole mean I have no heart?' Blake knew he was never an emotional person, and that he was rather cold to people except for the dead souls... He always had the feeling he was more like them than like the living... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he questioned why he didn't look like a monster, nor was trying to eat souls like the rest. He needed to know those answers, and if Joana remembers more, then he might have them. Until then, he could use some some more sparring matches to get stronger. He could barely believe that his sword, which had been able to cut through solid steel, let alone, the monsters' masks, did nothing to her bare skin... And her speed... she dodged him effortlessly, and was probably holding back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wondered if that was the potential he had... maybe she was becoming too strong and the monsters or someone tried to have her killed... That could explain the more frequent attacks, but he didn't want to think further about it. He guessed the best he could do was to keep her staying at the house and eventually remember everything... and maybe teaching him how the HELL can someone not be cut by a \"spirit sword\" (That's how Blake called them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... can we do something else?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I'd like to go for a walk...\"- Joana said, she really didn't remember anything, and wanted to see more of the world. Blake sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine...\"- Blake liked walking, but alone. However he told himself not to say anything about it and they went downstairs and out of the house. There was a nearby park, in which Joana wanted to stop, to contemplate it. Blake climbed to a tree's branch, and Joana looked at him in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you there?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't like people too much...\"- Blake replied plainly, and Joana climbed next to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- She watched all different kinds of living beings, like some birds, dogs and cats... although these seemed to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Someone once told me, that animals can see spirits... Specially dogs, and even try to warn their owners about them...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ghosts are mostly perceived as a threat. Most people think all ghosts are harmful, and vengeful spirits which will bring death and disgrace... The presence of a ghost is never well received by people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course, that's not the truth, but those stories have been passed down by legends... not all spirits are bad... Most of them are just sad, or confused...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like me?' Joana asked herself, and nodded. She also wondered who was the person who told Blake about that, but she felt that since he wasn't mentioning the person's name, he might not want to talk about it. Then, as the sun set, they noticed several teenagers sitting on benches, always paired, guys and girls. Joana was a bit curious and asked Blake about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... they're hanging out...\"- Blake said, but Joana realized that Blake wasn't telling the truth, and asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, why are all of them in pairs?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's some complicated stuff you probably don't want to know...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll say if I don't want to know...\"- Joana replied, and Blake sighed in annoyance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright... those, are 'couples'. A guy and a girl that are in a special relationship, they spend time together and go on dates...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's a date?\"- Joana asked, with honest curiosity, Blake facepalmed himself, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When a guy and a girl go together to do something... nothing in particular, just spend time together...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like...going for a walk together... watch the sunset... go to watch movies...  I don't really know...Hell, how am I supposed to know?! I'm the least indicated person to tell you about that stuff...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I've never done that, nor I'm really interested... Dates aren't the solution to my own problems...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... if dating is that... are we going on one?\"- Joana asked (strangely) innocently, but didn't hear an answer, instead, a loud thud was heard, as Blake had fallen from the tree branch, hitting his head hard. She immediately jumped from the tree branch to help him to get up. Blake said, while rubbing the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you ask such a thing?! Of course not!! You are a spirit, and I'm a human!! That would be so wrong on so many levels...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because it's not right to have a relationship with a dead person!! And except for some really sick people, it's not normal...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What relationship?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighed in further annoyance, and answered the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"People that date, are implied to be in a complicated relationship that includes being 'in love', to have special feelings for each other, and many more complicated things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What complicated things?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"i can't really explain. But implies to feel affection or something for a person...\"- Blake climbed back up to the tree branch, and Joana followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...\"-</span></div></div>",

That's why I can't really describe what it is... Anyway... maybe when we find how to send you to heaven, you would learn there more than I could ever tell you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And why don't you go on dates?\"- Joana asked, blushing a bit, now knowing what it really meant, and Blake gave him an annoyed look \u00ac_\u00ac<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Look at me. I'm a guy, who can turn into a ghost, and I'm on a tree's branch, talking to a dead spirit...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?\"- Joana noticed, looking at him, that he had a scar, a straight line that ran down across his left eye. It was a clean line, and was about 3 inches long, nearly perfectly centered with the eye... Aside that, she also noticed that Blake's eyes seemed to reflect tiring... and not tiring from not sleeping well... a deeper tiring, like he was tired of everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not a normal guy, let alone, one that any girl would go out with... That's why I don't even try... Why to pretend to be someone else? Being myself is always equal to a failure, and eventually any person will grow tired of my problems. Thus, if I cannot be myself, why bother trying?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, aren't you lonely because of that?\"- Joana had already seen some sort of loneliness in Blake's eyes before, like a silenced grief. He was obviously repressing it, and despite she didn't remember many things, she could see Blake's own emotions, something everyone else failed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who cares? I don't... I've always been alone, it's not something new to me...\"- Blake replied, more annoyed, and Joana felt that he was lying, and that he wasn't telling her something, however, they've practically just met, so, she decided to stop pressing on the subject...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't know the sunset was this beautiful... All I remember is night...\"- She commented. Blake found this a bit strange. Even for a dead person, day and night should be a normal thing... That and the fact that she had similar clothes to his own, and was seemingly more powerful than himself rang a \"caution\" alarm in his mind. He thought he better watched out for anything weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you remember anything else?\"- Blake still wanted to know more about where did she come from to answer his own questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not much... just night... and a forest... a dark forest...\"- Joana was really struggling to remember anything she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I really hope she isn't one of those girls that were murdered by those psycho serial killers...' Blake had slight suspicions on the way Joana died... 'Yet, that doesn't explain why do I have the weird seeing ghosts and fighting monsters thing... Unless... No... Even if I were adopted... I shouldn't be dead and alive at the same time, it's not possible...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't remember more. Everything else is dark and vague... maybe with some more time I'll remember other things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake knew it was implied she was going to stay with him, as she had nowhere else to go... And Blake, despite his usually cold attitude, couldn't send an innocent to die... specially someone who seemed to share some traits with him... which made everything a whole lot weirder and more complicated... Blake had never bragged, nor even shown openly, but he's very smart for someone his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he almost doesn't talk to others at all, only his test results reveal his intellectual level. However, when it was about spirits, it was way more difficult to understand, and Blake could only rely on what he could prove, or what he learned from people who really knew about the matter. There were many paranormal books that were just some man's own ideas... or compilations of legends that have been too distorted through time... or attempts at making fables, with some moral lesson... With the years, Blake had learned none of that was the truth, and that nobody would believe the actual truth... Bad people wasn't always punished, not good people always found salvation... Everything depended on actions... only concrete actions could change the reality... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why Blake had decided to fight the hollows, no miraculous phenomenon would save the endangered dead souls, and no magic would kill the hollows out of nowhere. At least that was what he has always believed... After while, Blake snapped himself out of his thoughts, and decided to give it a rest, as he would need lots of time to find more about Joana and maybe himself. He decided to indulge himself a bit, and let himself enjoy such a simple thing as the sunset...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now that I think about it... I think these things aren't appreciated enough by people because it happens everyday...\"- Blake said, it was more like thinking out loud, but Joana heard him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, some people do...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana watched the sunset until it ended, and the sky became filled with stars, as every night, in Karakura town, and in every other part on the same side of the world... Blake jumped from the tree branch, and Joana did as well. They walked some more, enjoying a bit of the beauty of the night sky, until Blake saw the hour in a clock, and they rushed back to his house. Before jumping to the second floor, he said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now, don't do anything while my parents are here...\"- He went back to his body, and she laid on the bed. Blake pretended to be sleeping, and a female voice was heard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake! We're home!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a knock in his door was heard, and a woman with light brown hair and aqua eyes opened the door. Blake pretended to just wake up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, we'll have dinner soon, so, wake up, sleepyhead\"- The woman said with a somewhat cute tone, and left. Blake sighed in relief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That was close...\"- He got up and said to Joana -\"That was my mother. As I've told you, don't do anything... I'll come back soon...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was pretty much like everyday's, although Lith commented that Blake shouldn't have been doing nothing all day, Blake said he had been going to walk outside for most of the time, and that there was nothing wrong with him having a 'day off', also, that he got the highest notes in Mashiba Jr. High and made it to the Karakura High School, coming from the Mashiba Jr. High, it was really something, as \"things were mostly chaos there\", as Blake said several times when referring to his days at school. James, Blake's father, agreed and said they should let Blake be for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes, Blake was done and went back to his room, and waited for a while, then Joana spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... I feel hungry...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- Blake had a confused face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Souls aren't supposed to feel hunger...\"- Blake said, remembering what other souls had told him -\"And I have no idea what a soul might eat... Physical food is not possible... and there's no spiritual food...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Urgh...\"- Joana curled a bit, as the hunger felt a bit painful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry. I have no idea what does a hungry soul eat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they heard a roar, and Blake said, annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Again?! Damn it...\"- He got out of his body, and before jumping off the second floor, he asked Joana to lock his door, just in case, and turn off the lights, so his parents think he already went to sleep... Then, he looked at a grayish bulky hollow -\"Alright. I don't have time for this, let's end this quickly...\"- Blake said to his enemy, and the hollow roared in response, dashing toward Blake, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will be my midnight snack, stupid boy!!\"- Blake dodged him without problem, but when he tried to unsheathe one of his swords, the hollow extended one of his arms, punching Blake without moving. Then, tried to bite Blake again, but he stopped his jaws with his left hand, and in his right hand charged a golden energy ball, and fired it, exploding in the hollow's mouth. The hollow roared, and seemingly ran away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was really surprised, and temporarily lost sight of the hollow, he unsheathed his other sword, expecting a surprise attack, instead, he heard several roars, and smaller hollows appeared, but were devoured by the first hollow that lake was fighting... Blake had never seen a hollow doing that... As far as he remembered and knew, hollows sought to devour dead souls or him, due to his powers, but he had never seen a hollow eating one of its kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollows had been attracted by the gray hollow's power, but their ambition led to their deaths, as all of them were devoured by the gray hollow, whose power started to grow, then, he dashed toward Blake, and while Blake blocked his fist, he was still pushed because of his greater strength. Blake then tried to slice him, but he topped the sword with his hand, and despite it bled, the hollow didn't let go, then, he tried to bite Blake, who blocked the hollow's jaws using his other sword. They were struggling, and Blake was a bit surprised that a hollow was giving him trouble, but after eating at least a dozen of other hollows, it didn't surprise him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt the hollow's strength increasing, and before he could do anything else, the hollow gave a dying roar, and was shocked to find Joana biting it,,,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"What the...?!\"- Blake was shocked... Joana was on the hollow's back, biting the back of his neck... and quickly, she tore off a large chunk of the hollow, who desperately tried to get her off his back. Joana bit again, and the hollow gave one last dying roar, before falling to the ground, and in less than a minute there was nothing left of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was seemingly spaced out, and suddenly she realized of what she had done, and stared at Blake, afraid of how he would react, she didn't even know why she did it... then, Blake spoke, in a serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I Don't know...\"- She replied, looking down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had never heard of anything that fed on the hollow monsters... I need to know, who, or what, are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I'm being honest, I have no idea...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not buying that this time... it's obvious you're hiding something... such as, why did you eat that thing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... I just felt hungry... and when I realized it already happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine. I'll believe you, for now...\"- Blake sighed, and sheathed his swords, he started to walk back to his house, and Joana followed him, after taking a few steps, Blake's mind flashed a memory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-\"These monsters aren't as simple as you think. There exist more powerful species... which are a fusion of several monsters, which results in a hungrier, more aggressive and more dangerous beast... some of these beasts even feed on others of their kind...\"-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened his eyes wide when he remembered, and quickly turned around, and sheathed his sword, pointing it at Joana's throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now I've remembered... You are one of those cannibal hollows, aren't you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H...huh?\"- Joana didn't even know what he was talking about, and the tip of Blake's sword got closer to her throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, that was the trick... you were pretending to be an innocent girl, and distract me so I fought the hollows after you, got weaker, and so you could devour me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? No!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop lying, monster...\"- Blake tried to slash at her, but she disappeared, and reappeared a few meters away. Blake dashed toward her and tried to slash her with his two swords at once, she protected herself with her left forearm, and Blake's swords couldn't cut her. Still, Blake kept hitting, each time, the blades clashed against her skin as if they were hitting solid steel. Blake dashed backward a few feet, and aimed his right hand at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ametralladora*\"- He began to shoot a barrage of golden energy balls from the tips of his fingers, Strangely, Joana wasn't dodging and only used her arms in an X shape to protect her face and chest. Her skin, not even her clothes still showed no damage, Blake growled angrily, and dashed toward her, and tried to stab her from behind, but she disappeared again. Now, she was running away, and Blake pursued her, firing his Ametralladora barrage while doing so, unknown to them, their chasing had taken them farther from Blake's house and nearer to a forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake managed to get close to her again, and tried to slice her with his swords, but his attacks only created sparks. She kept blocking, but gave Blake a look that only showed fear and sadness, while Blake's look showed anger. Joana then grabbed Blake's swords in each hand, and said quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, listen... I'm not one of them... the only thing I know so far is that for some reason I need to eat them to survive...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was struggling to get his swords free, something that seemed near impossible, as Joana's brute strength was far more massive than Blake could handle, he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And who do I know you won't do the same to other souls?! Or the living?! Or me?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wouldn't eat you... you saved me, and offered me your room to stay despite you didn't know me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stopped struggling for a moment, and Joana stared into his eyes, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, stop this... I won't to hurt you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't believe you!!\"- Blake replied, and then, Joana sensed that his spiritual power started to grow stronger, and more powerful... in a few seconds, she noticed that Blake's blades had drawn blood from her hands, then, Blake, in a swift move, did a double slash, which was shaped as an X, and also, wounded Joana in the chest. Blake stuck his swords in the ground, and aimed both hands together, and fired a wide golden beam, which struck Joana point-blank, and the explosion actually caught the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke dissipated, and some fire lingered, Blake noticed that both of them were still alive, although Joana now showed some more serious burns. Blake ran toward her, grabbing one of his swords, and tried to stab her from the front, shouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Die, monster!!\"- Blake felt pain, and noticed, that his sword didn't pierce Joana... and that, its handle had pierced his stomach, due to the enormous strength he had used against her, yet, her skin was too hard for him to pierce, and the force made the sword bounce off, piercing her with its blunt handle... Blake then noticed, that his sword cracked, and broke, he spat out blood, and fell backward, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn...it... I failed... argh...\"- He fell into unconsciousness, and everything went black... after an unknown amount of time, he felt he had waken up, but couldn't see anything, nor move, and realized he couldn't feel his own body... and a voice, which sounded like a higher pitched, maniacal version of his own, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't try to kill that girl again, you heard me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where am I, and who the hell are you?\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're unconscious... and I am someone who actually knows what you're doing... I'll just tell you that. The girl doesn't deserve to be treated like that, and if you keep on that, you'll suffer...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Give me 3 reasons not to kill her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, one, because I tell you, two, shall I remind you about who you are?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that supposed to mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And, three, when you wake up you'll see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hold it right there!! What does she have to do with what I am?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice gave a sort of maniacal laugh while its sound slowly vanished. Blake felt like being knocked unconscious again, and when he tried to wake up, he actually woke up. He was in his room, and lying on his bed... then he sat up, and noticed that he had bandages over his abdomen. This confused him a bit, and then, he realized he wasn't alone... Joana was sitting next to him, but was looking down, and he also noticed she had been crying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had no idea about what to do or say, and he felt ashamed... after all, he got wounded because he tried to kill her, and yet, she took him back to his room, and bandaged him (he was still in spirit form). But the, he thought again, what was he supposed to do to a monster? Thinking again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If she were really to eat me, she had the perfect chance, I was wounded and unconscious... she didn't even fight back, and has probably enough power to beat me with a single hit... Maybe I'm doing wrong... but neither I'm able to kill her nor I'll try again to... unless given a valid reason... maybe...' He concluded that he couldn't kill someone who after what happened, still saved him. Joana must have had sensed he was deeply thinking, and when he went back to reality, she asked, quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Am I... one of them?\"- And cried more, Blake the noticed that his swords were next to him, on the opposite side... one of his swords was still broken, something that had never happened as far as Blake knew... however, he pushed them off the bed, making a clanking sound Joana noticed, and Blake put his hand over her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No... I thought you were, but you're not... Maybe I am the monster myself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana stopped crying, and stared at Blake, who said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't tell what are you exactly, and being honest, I was expecting to find something about you that could help me on finding what am I...You're the first being like me I've ever found... nearly the same race...\"- Blake sighed, and added -\"What I'm going to tell you and show you is something I've never told anyone, it has disturbed me from the day I started fighting the hollows... and it's one of the reasons I wanted to kill you before... But... I didn't tell you all the truth about me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake then showed her his left hand, and she then noticed a hole in his wrist, she gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did I do that to you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's been always there, and it's not a wound, nor you caused it...\"- Blake sighed -\"As you see, there is nothing through the hole... no traces of veins, blood, or flesh, not even attempts of regeneration, nor scars... the only thing I can compare this to is the hollow's hole...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>* Spanish for 'Machine Gun'.

It's just a very high speed dash using raw strength, similar to what Kenpachi and Chad have used, at least in the anime...]</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped again, and said -\"Incredible...\"- She checked her wrists, and there were no holes, and she started checking herself... Blake instinctively looked away, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's a bathroom here, if you need to check anything...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana didn't really get what Blake meant, and he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you have to check your own body, it'd be more appropriate that you do in private, alone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake facepalmed himself, and replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because nobody should see you naked... It's not right... specially a guy...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- Joana had already taken her white jacket off, and had a black tank top on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"EVERYTHING... Don't worry, I'll go downstairs for a while...\"- Blake left, and Joana wondered why he didn't want to be in the same room while she was looking for any hole in herself... while Blake couldn't believe she didn't understand the implications... He sat on the couch and watched some TV, something he rarely did, but hadn't much else to do. Then he heard Joana calling him, and he went upstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I found it!\"- Blake noticed she was still with her tank top, but it was slightly rolled up, revealing her navel,. Blake turned away and closed the door, but Joana opened it again, and asked -\"What's wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Could you put your jacket on?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... yeah, but before I do that I thought you wanted to see...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not really...\"- Blake replied, despite looking away, Joana noticed a slight blush in his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have a navel... It's a hole...\"- Joana added, and showed him that where her navel should be, there was a rather small hole, nearly identical to that in Blake's left wrist, both of them were about 1 inch in diameter, which is very small compared to the hollows' holes, which were wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's the meaning of this?\"- Blake wondered, he hadn't realized but he was staring at Joana's \"navel hole\" while he was deep in his thoughts and she giggled, and Blake noticed, and turned away from her again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know... but you're the same as me... whatever we are...\"- Joana said with a n.n face, while Blake just mumbled 'Uh-huh'. He hid his surprise, but now, a hint was right there... Joana was seemingly someone from the same unknown race or kind of being Blake himself is... Now the question to answer was, what were they anyway? At least Blake could kinda reject the theory of a mere rarity, as he's not the only one... Although, it could be still a rather rare phenomenon, even a curse, or a disease... Which meant that finding her was just luck... None of the other dead souls had been able to tell him anything relevant about what he is, although some remarked the hole, and told Blake to be careful with it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other trait that was different between him and Joana was her odd need to feed on hollows. As far as Blake knew, souls didn't required food, although none stayed for long enough to feel it though. Maybe they got spiritual food in heaven, was one of Blake's personal theories. Still, feeding on hollows was something that disturbed him a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never felt that desire, however, that implied that either he had long suppressed it to the point of never acknowledging it, or that she has a key difference that couldn't be seen... Blake also recognized that she was vastly stronger than him, he could barely catch up with her speed, his 'spirit swords' couldn't cut her, had insane physical strength, and his swords couldn't even stab her, and broke...Blake now thought that had not been because of her amnesia, he might be dead, killed in a single strike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What have I gotten myself into?!' Blake thought, now feeling in a \"Damned if, damned if not\" situation. He remembered that despite he tried to kill her, she wasn't showing any sign of hard feelings or bearing a grudge... She even saved him, put him back in his room, and got him bandages... and stayed with him... Blake hadn't thoguth about that one... now that he realized, being wounded and unconscious, he was a perfect target for any hungry hollow... He looked at Joana, who had put her jacket back on, and noticed she still had the wounds inflicted by him, and that she had some more burns...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, why do you still have those wounds?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... I...\"- Joana stuttered a little, then, she gathered some courage and said -\"I wasn't sure if you would try to destroy me again... and I wanted to show you that I wasn't taking any advantage...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"- This further surprised Blake... this girl, who hadn't even idea about basic things, had a sense of honor... and was expecting him to continue trying to kill her. Blake would've gotten into deeper thoughts again, but he noticed Joana's voice faltered, and he put his hand on her right shoulder, and said -\"I judged you wrong. You're not a monster... I shouldn't have said that...\"- 'At least, not willingly... I've seen her eyes... she wasn't lying...' Blake said to himself in his mind, however he still held a small warning, if Joana lost control of herself things could be different, but he also knew he wouldn't be able to do anything to stop her... so, he mentally prayed to anyone who would listen that it never happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you don't have to worry about that for now...\"- Blake gathered energy in his hand, and began to heal Joana. In a few minutes he was done, and grabbed his broken sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Can it be repaired?\"- Joana showed genuine concern about Blake's weapon, as she had seen he used it to kill hollows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, but I don't lose anything by just trying...\"- Blake replied, and while having the sword in his hand, started to gather energy with that same hand, and he was surprised to see that it worked, and his sword started to reform, it looked like small blue shiny particles gathered together in the shape of the sword's blade, and then solidified. There was no difference between the original part and the newly regenerated part. No lines or signs that it was once broken. The metal also felt the same. Glad that he could repair it, Blake sheathed it as well as his other sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just in case\"- Blake said to Joana, implying that it was to defend themselves if another hollow assaulted them -\"So... what now?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Going for another walk?\"- Joana suggested, and Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah! I want to find where did those strange but cute sounds came from...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 'Cute' sounds?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what they are, but I heard them earlier...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tried to think what could she be referring to... and then, he heard a bird's song, and Joana exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's there again!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... Joana... that's a bird song...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"- Blake was going back to his hammock, and said -\"I don't want to make you feel bad... but, I want to know... did something happen while I was knocked out?\"- Joana sighed in response, then she replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah... several hollows attacked, they were tying to eat you while you were unconscious...\"- Joana then changed her tone to a happier one -\"But I had dinner instead...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had a sweatdrop on the left temple of his head, and with a '-_- face, he thought 'That just makes things creepier...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"However... I had to fight them... and I feel hungry again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!\"- Blake's sweatdrop grew bigger, as he now senses that she was practically saying that she needed to eat even more hollows... -\"So...?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... maybe you could help me... to hunt some...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! THAT'S GOING TOO FAR!! I CANT MERELY SWITCH TO KILL HOLLOWS TO SERVE THEM TO YOU FOR BREAKFAST!! ARE YOU CRAZY?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Pleease?\"- Joana gave Blake a puppy eyed look, and despite he had closed his eyes, he had already seen it, and sighed in annoyance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's answer was a happier face and a nearly crushing hug, after a brief self healing, Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We'll go to search for some hollows... But I don't want to watch you while eating them...\"- Blake's spiritual body still ached from Joana's hug, which confirmed his theory that she was far stronger than himself, but was probably not fully aware of that. And so, they left the house to go look for some hollows... 'Not so different of what I usually do... but knowing that she will eat them still creeps me out...' Blake thought as they walked toward the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, several hollows already were trying to fight him, and he defeated most of them  with little effort, but not finishing them off. He knocked them unconscious and piled them up. After he got over a dozen, they seemingly stopped and retreated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hope this is enough...\"- Blake said, the happy yet hungry look in Joana was the only answer he needed. He jumped to a nearby building's roof. As he didn't want to see her eating the hollows... then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake dodged something that came at him very fast... then he looked, and more hollows started to rush toward him and Joana, he growled in annoyance and sliced them again, and noticed that they kept attacking in waves, Blake kept killing them with his swords, and after 30 minutes, which seemed an eternity to him, hollows stopped coming. He sheathed his swords, and heard someone clapping, and Blake quickly turned and looked up, and noticed a man standing on a building's roof. The man was wearing  geta (Japanese wooden sandals) and a bucket hat, a dark green shirt and pants, with a black coat on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Very well done...\"- The man said, and Blake raised an eyebrow, but remained silent, and the man jumped from the roof, and landed before Blake, who was a bit surprised and confused. The man was looking at him, and Blake realized he was able to see him, and opened his eyes wide, thinking 'DAMMIT!!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you're surprised I can see you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake cautiously kept a hand near his sword's handle, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who THE HELL are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Me? The poor but handsome owner of a small time candy store... But the real question is, who are you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have time for this...\"- Blake turned around and walked toward Joana, who was still eating hollows -\"Let's go...\"- He said to her, and she noticed the man's presence... the fact that Blake wanted to leave had to do something with that man... However, the man suddenly disappeared, and reappeared on the opposite side, a few feet in front of her, Blake extended an arm in front of her, between the man and her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. I'll ask again... who are you, and what do you want?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the same thing I ask you...\"- The man replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does it matter?\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why should I tell you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why not?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Many reasons I won't bother to explain...\"- Blake answered, staring at the man, watching any possible move he could counter. He tried to hit him with his cane, Blake caught it in response, and said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's play...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not in the mood for stupid games. I have more important things to do...\"- Blake started to walk away, and ducked, dodging another cane hit, and unsheathed one of his swords while shouting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright, you're getting on my nerves!!\"- Blake sheathed the sword, and decided to fight the man bare handed. The man didn't seem to be doing much effort dodging Blake's punches and kicks, and even blocked some with the cane. The man dashed back some distance, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is it that difficult to just answer a simple question?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. Common sense tells you not to tell personal info to strangers...\"- Blake replied, and the man laughed, both noticed Joana had a worried expression, and Blake knew that things might get ugly -\"Listen. I'm doing nothing you might be interested about...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can you say that? I'm a very curious person...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took some steps backwards, and whispered to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Run, go to my house... if I'm not there in 30 minutes, you won't need to search for me...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But, Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now!!\"- He said, still whispering, and the man, laughing a bit, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Protecting your girlfriend?\"- In that right moment, Blake had dashed toward him with incredible speed and tried to slash him with his sword, and it clashed against the man's cane<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She is NOT my girlfriend!! And you've just asked for death!!\"- Blake replied angrily, while the man smiled. They began to fight at an amazing speed, Blake's sword and the man's cane clashing constantly. Blake was a bit surprised the cane didn't get cut, but was too angered to really care. He also failed to notice Joana didn't run away... As he was focused on fighting the unknown man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dashed away from each other for a moment, and the man said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You got angry, yet, you aren't fighting with all you've got...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who says?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your sword... It tells me 'I can do a lot more than this' while you only show rage... you're only fighting to gain time, and your sword also showed some fear...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Spare me the poetic trash. None of that is right...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have 2 swords, why don't you use the other one as well?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do I have to?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because of... this...\"- The man swiftly disappeared and reappeared behind Blake, and attempted to slash him, revealing that the cane was in fact a concealed sword. However, it clashed hard against something that sounded and seemed to be very hard. Joana had appeared in front of the man as well and had stopped his blade with her hand. The man opened his seemingly ever-calm eyes wide for a brief moment, and got nearly slashed by Blake, who reacted in no time. Only the man's black coat got very slight damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you to run...\"- Blake said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't want to...\"- Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine. I hold no responsibility over your blood... you'll either die or live on your own...\"- Blake said, although he knew he didn't really mean it. However he also knew that if the man went under the assumption there was something between them, he might attack her to get him to surrender... and it wasn't like he felt anything anyway... Joana gasped at Blake's statement, and the man asked with a mixture of sarcastic and teasing tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Really? \"- The man dashed toward Blake, but at  the last moment, disappeared and tried to attack Joana, but Blake stopped it, having the blade pierce his own shoulder. The man smiled and asked -\"Why are you defending her then?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because this is a fight between you and me. No one else has to get involved... The only lives that are going to be taken are either yours or mine. Nobody else's...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man withdrew his sword, and Blake tried to slash him with one of his swords. The man jumped, and below him, Blake was smiling, and pointing his another sword at him. With almost no warning, an amber colored beam was fired through and from the sword, and the man barely dodged it, it burnt his black coat though... Then he noticed he was bleeding, and Blake tried to stab him, but the man stopped him with his sword, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're finally putting some effort. But it's not all you've got, is it?\"- The man noticed Blake's temper had cooled down a bit and he was fighting while being decently calmed down, despite the wound in his right shoulder. Which wasn't bleeding as much by the way, and now that he paid some more attention, it didn't pierce through him, and it was far less deep than he thought at first. Blake then sheathed his swords, and aimed his hands at the man, and silently said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ametralladora\"- He began to fire several golden energy balls in quick succession, with both hands, which increased his firing rate by twice. Joana was surprised of this as well, she had no idea he could do it with two hands. The man appeared and disappeared repeatedly, dodging all of the blasts, and noticed that the firing rate was slowly increasing, and when he dodged one of the blasts, which would've hit his head otherwise, he felt a piercing pain, and realized Blake had pierced through his chest. He moved behind him, and pierced the man from behind with his remaining sword. On top of that, Blake fired a golden beam, creating a large hole in the man's chest, and he fell down to the ground, seemingly dead... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake? Are you ok?!\"- Asked a more than very worried Joana, Blake just replied rather coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's over. Let's go.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you kill him?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was obviously a threat. He looked for us, and I'm sure he somehow set up the whole thing... The constant waves of hollows, the fact that many gathered in the same place, and he was watching the whole time... it can't be a coincidence...\"- They heard someone clapping, and the man was standing on top of another building, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Excellent deduction\"- He said with some sarcasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The hell?!!\"- Blake asked, and noticed the exact same identical body lying down in the ground, dead, while the man hadn't a single scratch, then, the dead body popped... like a balloon... -\"Oh crap...\"- Was the only thing Blake could add to the realization he failed to kill someone who will be a threat for him... The man jumped again from the building, and landed in front of Blake once again, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can start again... who...?\"- The man was interrupted as Blake tried to slice him from behind, but he dodged, and unsheathed his sword -\"You see? You are just going for the violent option...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Violence, is sometimes necessary...\"- Blake replied, and since the man must have seen his abnormal powers, he decided 'to hell with this' and started firing golden beams in succession, damaging the near environment and the buildings (which were old abandoned buildings by the way). Blake also attacked again with his Ametralladora barrage, keeping some distance between the man and himself. The wound in his shoulder also healed fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he could realize, the man was behind him, and slashed his back. Blake fell to the ground, Joana let some tears drop, and rushed toward the man...</span></div></div>",

The man vanished, and when Blake realized, he was sliced so many times he couldn't count... and fell to the ground again. Joana rushed toward the man again, and tried punching him. He blocked her fists with his sword but she didn't bleed no got cut, and only sparks came out of the clashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also started moving to a speed that he could barely dodge, and while he was dodging her very fast punches and kicks, he also realized Blake, despite bleeding, tried to slash him yet again, and while dodging his sword, got kicked in the face by Joana, who added more punches to the stomach and a kick that sent him several feet away to the combo. Blake was breathing heavily, and his body was regenerating at a slower rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Owww... My nose hurts...\"- The man said, covering the lower half of his face with one of his hands, it could be seen that he was bleeding as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Serves you right...\"- Blake said, and he started to breathe normally and his healing rate increased. Then, he extended his left hand, and fired a golden beam that the man dodged by jumpig backwards and also gained some height, and then, he heard Blake's voice from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bring death to the doomed souls, Shinokama...\"- Blake, now, with a scythe, tried to slice the man, and almost did, but he only sliced in two his black coat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed in front of him as well, Joana was a bit worried, but noticed the increase in Blake's power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you have a zanpakuto...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea what you're talking about, and I don't care\"- Blake held his scythe with his two hands, and it could be seen that it was silver, with a black snath, some golden adornments along it, as well as a golden kanji that read \"Death\" ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.xnvx.com/data/thumbnails/89/Japanese_Kanji_Symbols_Death.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.xnvx.com/data/thumbnails/89/J...</a> ) on the blade. On the opposite end, it had a golden spear-like tip. Blake dashed toward the man, and tried to slice, him, but anticipating he would dodge, he quickly tried to stab him with the other end, and he managed to slash him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can release a zanpakuto and you didn't even know what it is?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not buying your trash, man...\"- Blake replied, and tried once again to slice him, which failed, and the man caught the other end in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let me make things even for both of us...\"- He said -\"Awaken, Benihime...\"- And his sword changed into a sleek, medium sized sword. The grip had a gentle decorative bend that ended at a crimson tassel dangling from the pommel, instead of a crossguard, there is a U-shaped adornment covering the first three or four inches of blade, with a flower petal design just as it meets a red string wrapping, which is wrapped thrice around the hilt, with a three-loop bow on one side and a folded paper decoration on the other. Its blade was straight and slim, with the tip ending in a slanted razor-like edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake dashed backward and fired another golden beam, perceiving the danger, and the man said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nononono... Not this time...\"- He pointed his sword toward the beam, and said -\"Sing, Benihime\"- The sword fired a powerful red beam that exploded in contact with Blake's, thus, cancelling it. Blake growled in anger, but retained some coolness, and he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Before continuing, let's take this somewhere else...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As you wish...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started to walk away and the man followed him, Joana caught up with Blake, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not running away\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have to... There's no use in the two of us dying...\"- Blake replied, while he kept walking, in a few minutes, they were in a nearby forest -\"This place is good enough. Now, let's settle this once for all...\"- Blake said to the man, and Joana stood next Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I will fight along you, either you like it or not...\"- She said with a newly gained firmness in her tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Fine. Then, help me. You go attack him first to distract him, I might pull off something to kill the damn man...\"- He replied, and she nodded in agreement, and when she was dashing toward the man, Blake caught up to her, and elbowed the back of her neck very hard. She fell unconscious immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My, there are better ways to treat a lady...\"- The man said to Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up!!\"- Blake grabbed her, and disappeared, reappearing where the fight started, and put her carefully on a bed inside an abandoned building. He quickly went back to the forest, and the man laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"With that attitude, the girl isn't going to go out with you anytime...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That has never been my intention... If I cared about what others said or thought about me, I would've already looked for a way to get rid of all the weird stuff...\"- Blake then attacked, and his scythe clashed against the man's sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Coldness... Thick barriers to protect you from being hurt... but, you know, you aren't really like that... You're just transmitting fear into your blade\"- The man said while they were struggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I said, shut up!!\"- Blake tried to slice him again, and doing a 360 degree move with the scythe, he managed to slash a piece off the man's bucket hat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww... That was my favorite hat...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake continued trying to attack him, and after several failed attempts, he managed to catch him off-guard, and when his scythe was about to hit him, something stopped it... between him and the man was a hexagonal shaped crimson barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake changed his tactic and started firing his Ametralladora barrage at the shield while holding the scythe with his right hand, and the moment it shattered, the man vanished and appeared in front of him, slashing his right arm, letting his scythe fall, but Blake aimed his left hand at the man's chest, and fired a golden beam, which struck him, and pushed him down against the ground, and exploded after making contact. He landed, and grabbed the scythe with his wounded arm. The man had some slight burns, but he wasn't as damaged as Blake thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good move. But, you almost sacrificed your good arm to do so...\"- The man attacked Blake again, however, Blake swiftly grabbed the scythe with his other hand, and managed to slash the man's left shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wrong!! Both arms are good... I'm ambidextrous, you idiot...\"- Blake replied, and his right arm healed again, despite this, Blake was feeling somewhat tired, even if he gathered external energy to continuously heal himself, the process still put some strain on him, and he wasn't going anywhere... At the current rate, it might take days, maybe months to kill the man... and Blake knew he wouldn't last for that long... although it was probable the man wouldn't either... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to thoroughly heal himself one last time and make another risky bet... adding all the external energy he could gather to his own to further increase his power, strength and speed... at the cost of no healing... 'It's all or nothing...' Blake started to glow in a golden aura, and dashed toward the man, who blocked the attack, but was pushed back a fair distance. Blake jumped and fired his Ametralladora barrage from above, and the blasts' power also increased, making it more difficult for the man to dodge, and used more of his crimson beams to cancel some of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man observed that a part of the golden aura took the shape of wings on Blake's back, and that he was breathing heavily, which meant he was putting all his effort on this. Blake dashed away while in mid air, and fired a golden beam, wider, and more powerful than before. The man cancelled it with another crimson shield, but this time, it cracked. Blake fired another beam with two hands, and it made a greater explosion, this time, the shield broke to pieces shortly after the smoke dissipated. Blake was breathing even more heavily, and noticed the man still had minimal damage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blake tried to dash toward him, but fell to his knees. The man was walking toward him, and Blake gathered strength to keep going, and stood up again, and tried to attack him with all his strength. The man blocked with his sword, and Blake's scythe's blade shattered in contact. He muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn... it...\"- He knew life wasn't going to give him a second chance, and that it was probably his end... In the end, he regretted nothing, as his own death would change nothing, and the whole world would go on, not even noticing it... With those thoughts, he slowly fell into unconsciousness. Before fully blacking out, he saw a blurry Joana, rushing toward himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I failed... again...\"- Blake muttered, too low to be heard by anyone, and closed his eyes, expecting nothing, other than ceasing to exist, and have a final rest from everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was crying, and held Blake's unconscious spiritual body in her arms, then, she glared at the man, who laughed casually, and scratched the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I might have overdone it after all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana's only answer was an angry growl, and when she rushed toward him, he disappeared, and before she realized, he knocked her unconscious again...</span></div></div>",

I just want to know where am I...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the answer to that question depends on what you mean...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean this place, or where you are currently?\"- The strange white guy asked back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't get it\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange guy sighed, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is your inner world... what you would call your soul... our small world...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Our?! How did you get here?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't. I have been always here...\"- The white guy replied, and seeing Blake's WTF face, he added -\"I am that voice that has given you hints about your powers... I am whose powers you've been using the whole time... I am a part of you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean...?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell to his knees in shock, and the white guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know. I'm THAT awesome...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shut up...\"- Blake said, and added -\"Why the stupid hints? Couldn't you tell me what am I? What are YOU in the first place?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know. I've told you what I've found out myself... This place makes quite a nice training ground...\"- The white guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's your name?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh... I don't have a name... Let me think...\"- The white guy scratched his chin thoughtfully, and Blake fell face first to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Hmm... I need to think more about it... I'll tell you later when I come up with a name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Alright...\"- Blake said with a -_-' face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... since you're here, it means you screwed up again, didn't you?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I fought with all I got!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should have let the girl help you, I told you not to treat her badly again...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I actually saved her from getting murdered...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You didn't die, nor I think you would have succeeded... you and me saw clearly she came back before you closed your eyes...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You can see through my eyes?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Only when I feel like it\"- The white guy replied, and Blake clenched his fists in anger and some annoyance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... I'm unconscious or something?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yep\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you so sure I'm not dead?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I can feel it\"- The white guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- Blake asked in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can feel others' spiritual power... even yours, and I can tell you're still alive...\"- The white guy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How the hell do you do that?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't really know\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright\"- Blake said -\"Hey... What are you here for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guessed you'd be confused finding yourself here\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And you came here to help me? I'm seriously doubting that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had the feeling that you wanted to destroy me and take over my mind or something...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no reason for that. I'm quite comfortable with things as they are. Just don't piss me off and you'll be fine\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...alright...\"- Blake didn't want to push further on the matter... if the guy was really the source of his powers as he stated, it meant he was probably powerless here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How about a sparring match? Not everyday I get to play with someone other than that jerk...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What jerk? Is there someone else here?!\"- Blake said, and the white guy sighed, grabbed Blake's sword, and shouted at it-\"YEAH, I MEAN YOU!! STOP PRETENDING YOU DON'T HEAR ME!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you yelling at a sword?\"- Blake said with a o_o face, and further to his surprise, the sword reformed with a humanoid silhouette. It was another guy, with fair skin, brown eyes, and black wavy hair, slightly longer than Blake's. He was dressed in a black open jacket, with a white shirt under it, a white sash, black hakama, white tabi and black zori... essentially, Blake's clothing inverted color-wise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?! WHEN THE HELL DID MY SOUL BECOME A PUBLIC PLACE?!!\"- Blake shouted (This is more or less what his face was like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/berserk_button_FMA_3_3156.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/im...</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cards.theotaku.com/575205-20090809230500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cards.theotaku.com/575205-2...</a> PS: Never watched FMA)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Unfortunately, I'm part of you as well...\"- The other guy replied with an annoyed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, the jerkish part\"- The white guy added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, who are you?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph, you called me and injured me some minutes ago, and you still ask who am I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah!!\"- Blake said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww... poor little baby got hurt, boo hoo... Freakin' grow up you idiot!! When you fight, it's kinda obvious you'll get some damaged!! But that makes a fight more exciting!!\"- The white guy said to the other one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it you too\"- Blake said with a subtle firmness in his tone, as he somewhat regained awareness that it was his world after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does this ring any bell?\"- The guy showed a scythe, identical to what Blake's transformed sword looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shinokama? I thought you were a damn weapon!!\"- Blake said, and facepalming himself, he added -\"I really regret entering my soul just to find it's a mess where seemingly anybody can get in...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!!\"- Shinokama and the white guy exclaimed, and glared at Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway... for how long will I stay here?! The more I'm at this place the weirder it gets, what's next? Ametralladora is another guy or what?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope, Ametralladora is one of my techniques...\"- The white guy explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...?\"- Blake said in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who do you think taught it to you?\"- The white guy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever\"- Blake said -\"I could swear I'm the only person in the entire world that deals with this crap...\"- And suddenly, everything got blurrier, until he finally woke up... And further to his dismay, Joana was on him... yeah, ON him... unconscious as well... and it looked as if she were hugging him while sleeping, althoguh Blake didn't think about it, and just saw it as annoyance and an awkward moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake would've shouted 'WHAT THE HELL?!', as he also found himself in an unknown place, but he didn't to not wake Joana up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good you finally woke up\"- The man Blake thought killed him said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why is she on top of me?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you needed to keep warm, and it was either her or Tessai-san\"- The man said, and Blake noticed a tall, lightly tan-skinned man with cornrowed hair and a large handlebar mustache. He was wearing rectangular-shaped glasses, a white muscle shirt with normal pants and a blue apron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...ok...nevermind...\"- Blake said with a sweatdrop on the left temple of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are really something. Tessai-san didn't have to do much healing on you, you healed most damage on your own...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't change the topic!! We're still back where we began... Who ARE you?!\"- Blake asked angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Kisuke Urahara\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That tells me nothing... what do you want from me?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was just investigating... I've been getting readings of an unidentified reiatsu that has been killing a lot of hollows and performing soul burials...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea what you're talking about. But yeah, I kill hollows, what's the problem?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wanted to find who or what was behind that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm hating you more than I already do, you know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrahara just laughed at Blake's statement, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can actually help you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How?\"- Blake said, and then, he noticed Joana woke up, and when she saw him, beneath her, she blushed, and quickly sat up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry!!\"- She said apologetically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It wasn't your fault...\"- Blake said -\"It was HIS!!\"- He pointed accusingly at Urahara, who laughed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you chose her over Tessai-san\"- He replied, and was struck in the face by a cup of hot tea thrown by Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Bastard!! You did it while I was unconscious!!\"- Blake shouted, and Urahara was holding his face in pain for the hit and the hot tea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It...hurts...\"- Urahara said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Serves you right. Now, let's get the hell out of here before something weirder happens...\"- Blake said to Joana and stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey! You haven't seen my products, I'm offering you special discounts and the best deals in miles arou-...\"- Urahara's speech was interrupted by a punch in the face from an angrier Blake, who shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"All this was so you could sell us your crap?!!\"-</span></div></div>",

She had perceived Blake had indeed a very aggressive personality despite he acted calm before, still, he stopped, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you trying to sell?\"- Blake immediately regretted asking, as Urahara regained his cheerful tone rather quickly, and brought what looked like anatomy models, as well as some pills and before he continued, he asked again -\"What the hell is this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"THIS is a Gigai, a body, to interact with the human world, I can sell you two for the low price of-mmphh...\"- Blake punched him in the face again, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already have a body, stupid!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh really? Can you get out of your body at will?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why?\"- Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Impressive\"- He muttered, then he added -\"Alright, I still can sell you one for the lady... even make a fully customized one...\"- He started \"measuring\" her only to be kicked hard in the stomach by Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Careful with the hands, old man...\"- Blake said -\"I am NOT buying that anyway...\"- He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would lessen the hollows' ability to track her, and they wouldn't pursue her as much...\"- Urahara said, rubbing his stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!!\"- Blake and Joana were both caught in surprise, and Blake asked, still angrily -\"How do YOU know?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You are going to need these, soul candies... they will help you to get out of your bodies and replace you while you're out...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait, wait wait... Why would I need that?!\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Doesn't your body get unconscious when you are out of it?\"- Urahara asked back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, so what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Say, hollows wander around during school time, wouldn't it a little suspicious that you suddenly got unconscious for no reason?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess... but I don't trust those things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're harmless, in fact, I'll bundle everything you'll need...\"- He quickly called two kids that started getting together the gigai, a pink pill, a black pill, and two cell phones<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are the phones for?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They'll help you to detect hollows, as well as allowing you to communicate like any other cell phone...\"- Urahara quickly typed in his cash register, and said -\"Everything will be, with the discount, 30,000 \u00a5...*\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started to laugh, and Urahara stared at him in apparent confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no money you idiot. I never said I wasn't going to take any of this...\"- Blake said, and Tessai began to walk toward him, in a somewhat menacing manner, but Urahara waved his hand, gesturing him to stop, and fanning while speaking, he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That won't be a problem. You can still pay this, with work...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about it. there's no way IN HELL I'm going to be your employee...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you won't work at the store. You'll actually do the same yo usually do. Slay hollows, with your zanpakuto...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My what?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your swords...\"- Urahara said -\"You'll have to register them so you can get bounties from the hollows you slay, with those earnings you'll pay for all these things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I still don't agree...\"- Blake replied, still annoyed at the mans persistence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Aww, come on!! I'm trying to be nice here!\"- Urahara said, giving Blake and Joana a puppy eye look. The latter couldn't really resist, and kinda felt bad for him because of the many times Blake had punched, kicked and thrown things at him in such a short time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This could help us, Blake, why don't we just agree?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because I don't need any of this stuff... anyway, if you got a physical body, you'd have to get somewhere else to stay...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't stay at your house anymore?!\"- Joana asked in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake facepalmed himself, and said -\"It's highly likely my parents wouldn't even agree... and it would seem SO wrong...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll explain you later...\"- Blake said, and turned away to walk out of the store, and Urahara said, with an overly dramatic tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When you go to the school... you'll be away from your house for 7 or 8 hours... think about it, 7 or 8 hours she will be alone and vulnerable... easy prey for the hollows...\"- He then changed to a more serious tone -\"Do you really want to run such a risk?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you so much...\"- Blake said, sighing, and taking all the stuff... -\"I swear I'm going to make you pay after this is over, mad hatter*... do something stupid, and you'll have this cell phone shoved down your throat...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana laughed nervously, as she wasn't sure about Blake's attitude, he might get them in trouble. Urahara just hid the lower half of his face with his fan while laughing, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No worries. The phone will tell you when you need to go to action...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop trying to make it sound like as if I were a superhero or something...\"- Blake sighed -\"Fine, let's go...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By the way, Blake-san, I've already registered the lady at your school and she'll be in the same class you are... She'll only need to give her full name\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU WHAT?!!\"- Blake was about to rush and probably cause physical damage to Urahara, but Joana stopped him (she was now a bit more aware about him being more than they thought)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was the obvious thing to do. You'll be like scorting her at all times. Not like you wouldn't anyway...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You bastmffff...\"- Blake was interrupted by one of Joana's hands covering his mouth, although he managed to speak a bit -\"I mfmfmfm swear that I'm mfffmfmfmfmf going to mfmfmfmfmfffmf you and will mfmfmfmfmfffffmfmf  and mfmfmfmfmfmffffffm in your mfmfmfmfmmmfffff!!!!\"- Joana put more effort covering Blake's mouth, but her strength was pressing him against her body and that didn't let Blake breathe. In a few seconds he was starting to turn blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ermm... you should let go of your boyfriend if you want him alive...\"- Urahara said, laughing, and Blake fell to his knees, gasping for air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...AM...NOT...HER BOYFRIEND!!!!\"- Blake shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, Blake.san, I won't tell anyone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're asking for it, aren't you?!\"- A vein popped comically in Blake's forehead while he waved his fist menacingly, while Joana stopped him again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Also, Blake.san, you should try out the soul candies to learn how they work... I'd recommend testing it first on the lady's gigai...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Couldn't YOU get us an instruction manual?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hahahaha.... Sorry about that... I don't have enough money to do that... and... nobody reads the manuals these days...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I hate you much more than before, you know?\"- Blake said, still having his arms restrained by Joana, who seemingly learned from the previous accidental suffocating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good luck\"- Urahara waved goodbye while Joana dragged Blake away with a hand and with the other one took the bag with all the stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>*As far as I know, it hasn't been mentioned what currency do Bleach characters use, but since it's located in Japan, I guess it's reasonable to assume they use yen..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: A little fact: Instead of Hat'n Clogs, in the latin american dub, Ichigo refers to Urahara as \"the Mad Hatter\" which is what gave me the idea of Blake calling him that in this story...</b></font></span></div></div>",

Please wait\"- Urahara said, with still a somewhat annoying mockery in his tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm so tempted to become a serial killer right now...\"- Blake muttered in anger -\"Go inside and wait if you want, I have no idea about that fake body thing he calls gigai, so just do what they say, if he tried anything weird scream and I'll be kicking that mad hatter's ass...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think I'll be ok...\"- Joana said a bid nervous and went inside back the store, Blake sighed and waited patiently, he was so angry he wasn't even thinking about what excuse to make, all he wanted was to punch Urahara's lights out and leave. He then heard the sound of a cane hitting the ground... Urahara had walked outside, he noticed Blake clenching his fists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, calm down a bit, I'm here... that means Tessai-san, Jinta and Ururu are doing the gigai work... So my hands aren't near anywhere near inappropiate\"- He spoke, first in a joking tone but by the end of his phrase he really meant to comfort Blake a bit -\"I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but maybe by doing these things you may find answers to your questions...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"By how you speak, it appears to me that you may know them already...\"- Blake commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah. I'm just the poor owner of a small time candy store...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That also sells ghost-hunting equipment and weird crap like fake bodies for souls...\"- Blake remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You just had to ruin the moment...\"- Urahara said laughing a bit more nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's alright. If you ever want to tell me I'll hear it. If not, maybe I'll find the answers through battles...\"- Blake looked at his sheathed swords<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, there was just silence, until Tessai said -\"Done\"- And Joana came out, this time with a more casual dressing, a white blouse, with a brown jacket on top, as well as black jeans, basically, a female version of Blake's human clothes. Blake's jaw dropped for a moment, but he regained composure quickly, although he still blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"W-why those clothes?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She chose them herself\"- Tessai said while pushing his glasses up, Joana gave Blake a n_n face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... whatever... Now, I have to think of an excuse to convince my parents to let you live in my house...\"- Blake began to walk back home and Joana followed him. The way felt longer than it actually was, as Blake was very tense and even walked a bit slowly to give himself time to think. When they finally arrived to his house, he sighed and opened the door. It was no surprise that his parents were already there, apparently when they had no more work tey could get out early... In the living room, Blake's mother was laying on the couch while reading a book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi...\"- Blake said in a non enthusiastic tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi\"- Blake's mother replied in a happier tone, and noticed Blake's mood, but before she asked him, she noticed the girl behind Blake, who was blushing a bit and seemed nervous -\"Umm... Blake... who's the young lady?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An exchange student... They sent her earlier so she could get used to the different things here and whatever... school guys called me and I had to go pick her up...\"- Blake said, ironically, his non enthusiastic tone made the excuse seem real as Blake would be annoyed by having to deal with people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good afternoon, Mrs...\"- Joana was saying politely but stopped at Mrs. because she had no idea what was her surname, and Blake's mother laughed, replying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, you can call me Lith\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My name is Joana\"- She gently shook her hand, still a bit unsure of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, try to feel at home,whatever you need I'm sure Blake will help you, or you can ask me...\"- Lith then winked at Blake before resuming her reading. Both he and Joana blushed a lot and pretended it didn't happen. After they go to Blake's room (there was no guest room) James came from the kitchen, drinking a glass of water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I heard we had visits...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, Blake brought a girl...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As a father, I would feel proud... but as HIS father... I consider it's a bit... weird?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hormones can kick-in late...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shouldn't we...?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, let him be...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, you had him inside you 9 months, if anyone knows, i guess it's you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Blake's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wiped a bit of swweat from his forehead -\"Phew... that excuse actually worked... and I suck at acting but nevermind... well, as long as nobody asks too many questions, we're fine...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I have to go to school?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, that's what Mr. Mad Hatter said... creepy weirdo...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Urahara was checking his inventory, when he suddenly sneezed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you have a cold Urahara-san?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not! Someone must have spoken ill of me... maybe...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake's room again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway school isn't such a big deal, basically you go there to be bored to death for 8 hours and then you're free to go home, not without some annoying to do homework which everyone rips off the internet anyway. However... by your looks you may have to deal with creepy weird perverts...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What looks?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gulped, he couldn't dare mention Joana's bust or hip size, and so, after sighing, all he replied was -\"It's something only guys understand, but yeah you may be a target for sick weirdos, but don't worry, I'll kick their ass for free\"- Both teenagers laughed at that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"School is still 2 months away so, IF you can control that strength of yours, I MAY teach you to fight back so you can give them a lesson yourself... It'll be your homework for this time to learn to control it...\"- Blake was saying when his cellphone suddenly rang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually, Blake-san, you don't have to worry about that, the custom made gigai I got for your beautiful female companion *ahem* for the lady, suppresses her powers to average human levels...\"- Urahara said over the phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT THE HELL MAD HATTER?!! ARE YOU SPYING ON US?!!\"- Blake shouted on the phone, and Urahara replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, spying is such an ugly word, let's say I just keep a close eye on certain people...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Soul Society...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHOEVER PUT THAT CAMERA IN MY SHOWER HAS 2 CHOICES, DEATH, OR MORE DEATH!! FIND ME WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IMMEDIATELY!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain petite female shinigami captain angrily shouted to her soldiers, who shouted \"YES CAPTAIN\" before leaving hurriedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Blake's room, yet again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Keep going on and I'll shove both this and your phone down your throat!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Calm down! calm down! I promise I won't be misusing these capabilities of mine, I'll only contact you for serious reasons...\"- Urahara said before ending the call<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I SWEAR I'll never get used to that...\"- Blake sighed -\"Well with the exception of that maddening hatter, i think life wouldn't suck so much, school is boring, we'll probably deal with a lot less hollows with that fake body, and the biggest threats we may face are probably just the sick perverts at school lusting after you, for reasons I'm not going to comment...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Umm... I'll still need to feed... Mr. Tessai said that human food wouldn't provide enough for me because I'm not an ordinary soul...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I still have to hunt hollows for every breakfast?! God seriously hates me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry...\"- Joana said, a bit ashamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's ok, it's not your fault. Nobody chooses what they are, look at me, I'm a human that can turn into a ghost and deals with dead souls and evil dead souls... you know it almost seems material for a book or a tv series... Anyway, the point is none of us chooses what we are so it's not your fault, and well, at least it's to put those bastards to good use\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake laid on his hammock, leaving the bed for Joanaa to sleep. He was still almost surprised his parents didn't say anything further, but he's thankful for not having to explain more. Blake just became this girl's full-time bodyguard, until he can figure out what she is, and how to send her to heaven. Incidentally she may help him answer his own questions about himself, but at least a difference is obvious in that he is a live human somehow mixed with Joana's species, while she seems to be a dead soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, I have a question...\"- Joana asked -\"I saw your parents sleep both on the bed... so... why do you sleep on that hammock instead?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question made Blake fall from his hammock and flat on his face, he sat up and sighed -\"Remember I told you about couples? Well, a couple consists of 2 people involved in a relationship, usually adult people in a serious relationship who live in the same house will sleep on the same bed...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But why?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took one of his sciences books and searched for the pages with information on those adult themes, and handed it to her -\"Read under your own risk. I'll just make clear that such things involve 2 HUMAN adults over the age of 18 according to laws...\"- Blake took out a PSP and began to play while Joana read the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To think I almost had to explain her about human things not even I am familiar with... well, at least she's innocent and doesn't have more than pure curiosity, maybe I should try to help her later if she asks something'Blake thought, reconsidering his harsher reactions from shortly ago</span></div></div>",
