            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura had an annoyed look on her face. \"NA-RU-TO!\" she started as she began to crack her knuckles to give him the beating of his young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait Sakura! I didn't k-know you were behind the bush! Honest!\" sputtered out a nervous Naruto, hoping to avoid the fiery pinkette's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping an annoyed look, she eventually slipped into a calm pose. \"Fine,\" she finally answered, much to Naruto's relief. \"But check before you start throwing kunai next time!\" she added in a sharp tone. Seeing Naruto nod his head rapisly in compliance, she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few tense moments, Naruto decided it was safe to ask. \"So Sakura, what were you doing behind that bush anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting him a rare smile, Sakura started. \"Well, I finally figured out a way to see if Sasuke is the right one. I was looking through the library, when I found this old scroll. It said that if performed just right, this jutsu would reveals your true self,\" she finished with a glazed smile before Naruto interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sakura, does that jutsu tell you how it turns you into your true self?\" asked Naruto with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready to deck Naruto for asking a stupid question, she then thought about it for a minute. \"You know what Naruto, that's a pretty smart question, for you that is. In that case, could please test this jutsu for me?\" she asked while giving Naruto a pouty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Naruto would have jumped at the chance. But ever since Kakashi told him to think things through, Naruto has begun to show a rarely seen intelligence streak outside of battle. \"I don't know Sakura. It seems kind of dangerous. Maybe we should ask someone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprised that her teammate was actually thinking, Sakura would have been impressed if she wasn't so eager to perform the jutsu. Thinking of a way to catch Naruto off guard before he reason any further, she blurted out, \"If you help me, I'll go on a date with you!\" Seeing the gobsmacked look on his face, she pressed her advantage. \"That's right Naruto. If you help me with this, I'll be very happy. And I'll go out on a date with to Ichiraku's Ramen. Heck, I'll even pay. So what do you say, Naruto?\" she finished with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was estatic at this point. Ignoring the nagging voice in the back of his head, Naruto gave Sakura a wide grin. \"Well what are waiting for? Let's test this bad boy out,\" he yelled out, much to the chargin of Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tone it down a bit?\" she asked in a polite tone. She would have decked Naruto by now, but she really wanted to test this jutsu to find out whether or not she was going to marry her precious Sasuke, before another idea struck her. \"Naruto, I'm going to get a few things. Just look over the scroll for right now,\" she said in a hurried tone before taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the scroll, Naruto began reading through its contents. Skimming over the text, he found the necessary hand seals and began to memorize them. It wasn't until an hour later before Sakura came back, but this time had Ino, Hinata, Tenten, Temari, Kurenai, Anko, Shizune, Tsunade, and Kiba's sister Hana with her. Looking confused, Sakura began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to get Ino and Hinata to show them the jutsu, when Tenten and Temari overheard us. After I explained what the jutsu did, Anko, Hana, Kurenai-sensei, Shizune-sensei, and Hokage-sama heard us, and decided to see what the jutsu did.\" Seeing Naruto giving an uncharacteristic annoyed glare, she quickly added, \"If you do this Naruto, I'll go on three dates with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was about to say something, Naruto cut her off. \"Okay Sakura-chan!\" he yelled out with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsunade or the others could say anything, Naruto went through the hand seals and slammed his palm on the ground like he usually did with the Summoning Jutsu. A sealing array unlike any the older kunoichi have seen before formed around the Naruto. The arrays then began to glow pink, and Tsunade went through hand seals rapidly before yelling out \"Earth Style: Earth Shaking Palm\" in order to break the ground and interrupt the seal array. To her and the other kunoichi's surprise, the technique had damaged everything but the ground under the sealing array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to get scared Naruto formed his familiar seal for the Shadow Clone technique, but nothing happened. Instead, the seal absorbed the chakra, and began to glow a brighter pink, and some the seals began to crawl over Naruto's body. \"Guys, do something. I feel funny,\" he yelled in a panicked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, the younger girls jumped back before Tsunade and the others went through rapid hand seals before bullets of fire and water accomponied by huge pillars of earth crashed into the barrier created by the seal. But it was useless, as the attacks didn't even make it waiver. Naruto was continuously trying to gather chakra for the Rasengan, but the seal kept absorbing the charkra until the seals glowed a bright white. The seals on Naruto then began to glow dark pink, before he was engulfed in whitish-pink pillar of light, blinding the kunoichi. After a few seconds, the pillar died down, and sealing array vanished. Opening their eyes, the kunoichi were suprised at who was standing where Naruto was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was obvious Ino had more experience at these kind of things than Sakura did, so she decided she would follow Ino's lead. If Naruko still had a male mindset, she would probably regret that decision later on. In any case, the first thing they did upon arriving was get a drink before heading to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the three girls decided to dance by themselves, and they were having a good time, Naruko was surprised how fun it could be to dance to mindblowingly loud music. Of course three girls as good looking as Naruko, Ino and Sakura were bound to attract plenty of attention, so it was only about ten minutes before a few boys decided to join them. Ino was the first to start dancing with the new guests with Sakura following after. So Naruko followed their lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna dance?\" Naruko looked up to the person asking. He was a handsome guy, probably around two years older than herself, he was a head taller than she was and had short brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no reason to decline, Naruko went along with the man and danced with him. They were dancing closer than Naruko would have been used to and the man wasn't afraid to get into her personal space to grind against her, something that Naruko couldn't help but feel a little hot over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the man decided to speak up again, \"You want a drink? I'll buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko nodded and followed the man to the bar where he ordered a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ichriou, what's your name?\" Ichirou asked while taking his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Naruko.\" She answered while gulping down her own drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your first time here?\" Ichirou asked while ordering a few more drinks and offering it to Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a couple of friends convinced me to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou wrapped an arm around her shoulder, \"Well I'll make sure you enjoy yourself, how about some more drinks!\"</span></div></div>",

Test passed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes to arrive at Ichirou's apartment, it was a regular sized apartment you would expect from a man living by himself. Naruko noticed shinobi equipment lying in various place, and a jounin flak jacket hanged near the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou lead her to living room where he sat her down on the sofa before he went to get more drinks, \"something more powerful now,\" he mused to himself, as he looked around his kitchen. \"Ah, sake, perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to Naruko and sitting next to her on the sofa, he offered her some sake which she gladly took taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Naruko was now really drunk, the strength of the sake was much greater than the alcohol they were drinking at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou meanwhile, was happily watching Naruko as his hand was rubbing her back affectionately, he hadn't been drinking nearly as much as Naruko, wanting to be in control. He leaned his head into her neck kissing it softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you've had enough drinks, don't you think.\" He said, gently licking along her neck and nibbling at her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko moaned at his touch, \"D-did you have something in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered my putting his lips on hers, catching her by slight surprise but didn't resist as he explored her mouth with his tongue. His hands were not idle either as he lifted her up to sit on his lap, one hand fondling her breasts, and the other cupping her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned as he released the lip lock, seeing Naruko's glazed look, \"Something like that.\"</span></div></div>",

He then quickly took off her skirt so she was left in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's body was moving on automatic by now. She didn't have any experience at this and just went with Ichirou's lead. As Ichirou stared at her almost naked form, Naruko brought his head down for another kiss and started to open the buttons on his shirt before taking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou, now bare chested, quickly took off the rest of his clothes as well as her underwear so they were both completely bare. He sucked on one of her breasts while using his fingers to play with her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~ ahhn!\" Naruko let out a moan at the touch, a few minutes went by and she could feel herself becoming wet and starting to ache for something bigger to fill her. \"N-no more, put it in..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou chuckled, \"Well aren't you eager?\" he said lightheartedly, before deciding she was wet enough and plunged his dick breaking her hymen in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh!\" Naruko let out a louder squeal at the penetration. Ichirou stayed inside for a bit swirling his hips slightly before pulling out his cock slowly and thrust it back in, getting another squeal from Naruko. As Naruko got used to the feelings, she started to moan more in pleasure as Ichirou built up a steady rhythm and she rocked back her hips to match his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ichirou's movements became more frantic, \"Naruko, I'm gonna cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko wasn't paying attention to him wrapped up inn her own pleasure and as she started to tighten up around his cock, bringing Ichirou to his own as he shot out his sperm into the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchirou got off of Naruto to lie down next to her as Naruko curled herself into his chest, satisfied but too tired to say anything else to her lover, she closed her eyes and went off to sleep with Ichirou following her.</span></div></div>",

She filed away that thought for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko sensed Kiba nearby, he was obviously peeking at them, but he was paying more attention to the newest female Naruko. Rather than expose him as she would have done in the past, she decided to give him a bit of a show. She stretched her arms out while arching her back to push out her naked breast.

She drooled a little at seeing the three men. All three of them were well built, even the businessman who shouldn't have any shinobi training. She trailed her eyes down to their groins watching their manhoods. She couldn't tell their size from this distance, but she could tell they were big.

She decided to wait until everyone was asleep before she'd make her move. She already knew Kiba was a late sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night in Kiba and Shino's tent, Shino was fast asleep. Kiba was feeling restless, ever since seeing Naruko's naked body, he's had a raging hard on that just wouldn't go away and he hadn't had a chance to jerk off until now. Not even the times he had seen Hinata naked got him this worked up. If he had been paying attention would have noticed a familiar scent coming towards him, but he was too preoccupied to realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to reach for his 9 inch cock, a smaller hand wrapped around it, a thumb stroking it idly. \"Now now, you shouldn't waste your cum like that~\" A silky voice whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head slightly, he was met with the smirking face of his fantasy, clad in nothing but a flimsy bathrobe, 'Who would pack a bathrobe in a mission like this?' he thought idly before Naruko leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko knew Kiba was set to take her, so she leaned in to capture his lips and immediately shoved her tongue into his mouth, tasting him. Kiba wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her closer to deepen the kiss. After they released other Naruko whispered again, \"I have an itch, help me scratch it?\" Before she walked out of the tent not even looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was left staring as she left, eyes on her ass as the tent cover blocked her from view. He was now VERY hard. He took a quick look at Shino who was still asleep, put on pants (just in case) but didn't bother with a shirt, and then wasted no time in following Naruko out. She wasn't near the tent, but he could smell her a short distance away, probably so no one would wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he had walked past a few boulders, he was immediately grabbed and pulled into a heated kiss. Naruko was obviously very horny, Kiba noted. He felt her run her hands along his muscular chest as they made out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a nice tool.\" She remarked as she stroked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, \"Hah, I'm an Inuzuka, a big dick is guaranteed.\" He boasted as he pulled of the bathrobe she was wearing and fondled her breasts, savouring their feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko slowly went down on her knees, pulling down the Inuzuka's pants to reveal his very hard erection, she couldn't help but gasp a little at the size, \"This will feel good.\" She whispered as she took the head into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned as he felt Naruko coil her tongue around his dick. He put his hands on her head as she bobbed up and down the shaft, never going more than halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yeah, that feels good Naruko. Keep sucking like that.\" He encouraged with a wide grin as he looked down at the horny girl giving him a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling encouraged by his words, she took him deeper inside into her mouth and down her throat. It was only with sheer will, (and lust) that she fought through her gag reflex as he continued to suck his great cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kiba had been hard for most of the day, it wasn't long before he came, tightening his hold on Naruko's head as he did so, involuntarily forcing her head deeper down his dick. She choked a little as enormous amounts of cum exploded straight into her throat, before she released him. She wasn't able to swallow all of it and some of it dripped out of her open mouth, her eyes glazed over. The sight alone was enough for Kiba to instantly become rock hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled up Naruko, absently chuckling at her cute yelp. He could tell she wanted it rough so he had no problem providing. He turned her around and bent her over the boulder and rammed right into her sweet hole. Naruko came instantly as he put it in and screamed in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't let her scream deter him and continued to pound away at her pussy, loving how her orgasm made it even more slippery and wet. It was so warm and he enjoyed her moans of pleasure each time he thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Ah. Yes. So good.\" She gasped out in between thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, \"You're such a slut, you led me out here because you knew you would be screaming so loud didn't you?\" He said as he thrust into her. \"Do you like it, being taken roughly like this from behind?\" He added making sure to thrust extra hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES. Yes. I've been waiting for this for so long. I just want to be taken like a bitch in heat.\" She yelled as she thrust her hips back to meet his every thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your cock is so big, I've never been so full.\" She gasped as he lifted her leg to rest on the boulder she was leaning on. The effect made him able to thrust even deeper into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this rough sex, Naruko eventually tightened up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I'm cumming!\" She screamed as she came around Kiba's hot sex. Kiba couldn't handle the feeling of her cunt tighten up and soon came with a loud groan as he emptied out his seed into her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay there sweating, satisfied from the hot sex, Kiba pulled out his dick with a satisfied sigh as Naruko collapsed on the boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was amazing that they never got caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the Hokage tower, Kiba whispered into her ear, \"Come over my place any time you want\" He said as he squeezed her ass, before he left with a cocky grin on his face.</span></div></div>",

He was wearing some kind of red robe that revealed his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kyuubi?\" Naruko asked with a shocked face, never having seen this form before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyuubi ignored any questions she had, wanting to get to the point. \"You must be wondering why you've been so horny lately, right?\" He asked with that same vicious smile he would wear in his giant fox form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's eyes widened at his words, now that she thought about she was still feeling horny even now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi only chuckled at her expression, \"Yes, you're much more tolerable as a girl. I've been stuck here for so long, so I haven't had a woman for so long, I decided I'd just take you instead.\" He chuckled as if remembering something funny. \"Unfortunately you were still inexperienced so I made your body more open, lowering your inhibitions to break you in. I don't really enjoy trying to squeeze into a hole to small for me.\" He finished as the clothes he was wearing swirled out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this were a few weeks ago she would have been outraged at his manipulating fox .. man. As it was however, she was feeling horny and wanted some sex, so she could only gape and let her pussy wet itself as she stared at Kyuubi's huge dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the sight of my dick is enough to get you aroused now.\" He laughed. \"That's right, come here. Into the seal.\" He grinned as she walked towards him, her clothing also vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came close he took her hand and placed it on his dick, letting her stroke it on her own. He played with her breasts making her moan each time he pinched a nipple. \"I'm surprised you would get a body like this, Naruko.\" He said as he started to squeeze her ass. \"You're such a good slut. No, you'll make a good toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed her down on her knees getting her to finally come face to face with his erect cock. It was a monster at 12 inches, was it possible for her to take in inside her? Despite thinking about how painful it could be, she couldn't help but get even more wet at the thought of getting fucked by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you surprised?\" Kyuubi chuckled, \"I am the Kyuubi, the strongest of the Bijuu, did you expect any mere human to compare to me, in <i>any</i> way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Naruko's head and forced her down his shaft. Naruko wasted no time as she began sucking on his dick dutifully. Kyuubi groaned in pleasure. \"Yess, it's been so long since I've had my cock sucked.\" He said as Naruko bobbed her head up and down his hard shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi held her head with his hands to control her movements as Naruko's tongue eagerly licked every inch of his dick. He started to thrust his cock into her mouth and into her throat. After a few minutes he felt his orgasm and shot his seed down her throat while Naruko started to choke from the throat abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi licked his lips as he looked down at her, \"It looks like you're plenty wet enough already.\" He said as he got on his knees to line up his cock with her entrance. \"Do you want me to fuck you, girl?\" He smirked as he rubbed his dick on her walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Was her immediate answer. Kyuubi chuckled seeing she had no hesitation, she really was a slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, ask properly.\" He chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please fuck me Kyuubi-sama! I need your cock! Fuck me!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi grinned, \"You're lucky you've taken the practice girl, because I won't hold back.\" He immediately thrust his dick inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko screamed as she felt the monster of a cock enter her, her eyes watered up and she clinged to Kyuubi when he started to thrust inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh Yes!\" She cried as she started to get used to the feeling of his cock. It was huge and she had never been so full in her life. Her legs wrapped around Kyuubi's waist as she tried her best to buck her hips against his thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Fuck me Kyuubi-sama!\" She moaned as he started rocketing inside her even harder than before. Her breasts bounced with each thrust, capturing Kyuubi';s attention as he brought his mouth down on one and suckled on it roughly. His other hand played with her other nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko wasn't paying attention when he flipped her over on her hands and knees and started fucking her from behind. By the time she did notice she was moaning in bliss. She could feel herself coming close to her peak as Kyuubi was speeding up his thrusts, no doubt coming close to his own peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I'M CUMMING!!\" She screamed out as she tightend up around Kyuubi's cock. The tightening around his cock caused him to lose control as he frantically thrust into her a few more times before he erupted inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both their needs satisfied, Kyuubi let Naruko vanish out of her mind, seeing as she was in no condition to even talk after that fucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, She'll make a good pet.\" He mused. \"I'll get free eventually, and I'll take her as my bitch when i do.\" He laughed.</span></div></div>",

Despite this the party was actually quite enjoyable, there was some music and there were plenty of food and drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade told her disguises wouldn't be necessary as she needed the Daimyo to know she was from Konoha, so she was dressed in an elegant black gown that was transparent at the shoulders, freely showing her curves and went down to her knees. She would have preferred to wear less, but sadly this was a formal occasion and she wasn't stupid enough to wear such clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting inside was pretty easy despite it's importance. Apparantly she had made quite a name of herself as the hero of Konoha. Of course there were questions such as 'aren't you supposed to be a boy?' She had solved those saying that those stories were falsely spread and she was definitely a woman. They seemed to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Naruko had another expectation at that the Daimyo was supposed to be a fat slob. Thankfully this wasn't the case as the new Daimyo was a handsome man in his mid-twenties. he was quite tall and had a good and regal figure as should be expected from a young Daimyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother good point was that she was probably one of the sexiest women present at the party. So much so that most of the men, including the new Daimyo, couldn't help but stare at her. There of course plenty of other women, mostly daughters of other Daimyos and leaders hoping to introduce them to the new Daimyo, but they didn't compare to Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, it wasn't long until said Daimyo made his way over to our heroine with a charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening.\" He said with a truly charming smile which could only have been practiced for many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko immediately got herself ready, remembering her 'etiquette' lessons. She gave a small bow and a curtsy, \"Good evening, Daimyo-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Daimyo chuckled, \"Kira Mikazuchi. Please, just call me Kira.\" He said, Naruko could tell he was interested in her, well that was good, it made her mission much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko giggled, \"I am Naruko Uzumaki, please call me Naruko Kira-sama\" She replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Naruko? I have heard the famed hero of Konoha was attending, so that is you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I'm flattered my name is so well known.\" She inwardly chuckled, she was awesome! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I hope the land of Honey would have good relations with Konoha.\" He said as he drunk his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade would be so proud of her skills right now. She recalled Anko's methods of seduction. There were some men who liked the flirty seductive type. Then there were those who like the modest and shy type. Judging from the conversation so far, he could be attracted to both but who knows?</span></div></div>",

Naruko had no idea what kind it was, but assumed it was one of those 'fancy' types for rich people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then please drink with me Naruko.\" He said handing her a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Kira-sama.\" She replied before drinking it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made conversation like this for a while drinking down more. Eventually Kira asked Naruko to dance with him to which she happily accepted. It was a slow dance so Kira held her close and Naruko took the opportunity to push up her breasts against his hard chest. Naruko in her slightly tipsy mind noted the discretely wandering hands of the Daimyo but made no move to resist, it would make her job easier after all, and it felt good too. She leaned against him and purred softly and even guided his hand lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the song changed and that dance ended. Kira leaned in to Naruko's ear, \"I grow tired of this, accompany me to my room.\" He whispered while cupping her ass firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how tempting...\" She whispered as sensually as possible.</span></div></div>",

Both slightly tipsy, their tongues were already dueling for dominance as Kira kept pushing her up against the wall, getting a good feel of her body as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko moaned, \"Mmm, you're eager aren't you~\" Naruko slurred out sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira cupped her breasts with his hands, \"I can't help it, I want you.\" He leaned back down to kiss her again, sending his tongue to explore her mouth. Caught off guard by Kira's fondling, she didn't resist as Kira dominated her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira snaked his arms around her until his hands were resting on her firm ass. He gave it an experimental squeeze, feeling its softness in his hands, getting a light gasp from Naruko. He quickly cupped her ass and lifted her up pushing her against the wall. Naruko instinctively wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck as they continued to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira turned around and carried Naruko to his bed where he put her down before climbing on top of her. He didn't waste time as he took off her dress leaving her in her underwear. He took of his own clothes before taking off her bra leaving her perky breasts free. He leaned down to lick the nipple of one while groping the other. He suckled on her breast and pushing her panties aside with one hand before he started to finger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko gasped, \"Kira-kun.\" She moaned as Kira pleasured her, feeling it grow more intense as she was already approaching her climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cumming!\" She gasped out before tightening around three of Kira's fingers. She panted lightly as Kira sat up and removed her panties. Recovering, Naruko grabbed Kira before he could do anything and flipped over so she was on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly got rid of his boxers to reveal his large dick. She stroked it licked it every where getting it hard at 10 inches. Naruko almost drooled looking at its size before engulfing it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira groaned as Naruko started sucking on his cock while using her hand to stroke it at the same time. She bobbed her head along his shaft, taking it down to her throat like a pro and using her tongue to pleasure every inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until Kira felt himself coming close. \"I'm close.\" He warned her. Naruko seemingly ignored any warning as she only went faster and sucked harder. He then exploded right in her mouth, down her throat and Naruko swallowed every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Kira said. \"You're good.\" He panted from the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko crawled up to him with a seductive purr, \"We still have all night, Kira-kun.\" She whispered licking along his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira grinned before he flipped them over with his erection already at Naruko's entrance. He pushed in slowly until all of his cock was sheathed inside of her getting a drawn out moan as he did so. He started thrusting into her, getting moans of pleasure from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko wrapped her legs around his waist to hump back against his thrusts. She moaned every time she felt his cock fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~, You feel so good inside me.\" She moaned to Kira's pleasure. He started thrusting faster at that getting Naruko to start yelling in pleasure. He took hold of her legs and pushed them against her chest and around his shoulders, before he started pounding away even harder than before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Yes! Fuck me faster!\" She yelled as Kira was hitting her even deeper in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of flesh hitting flesh kept echoing around the room as well as continuous screams of pleasure until they were both approaching their climaxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko, I'm going to cum.\" Kira groaned as he started thrusting thrusting even faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Inside.

Her orange pants legs were a mismatched length, with the left covering her legs fully while the other cut off at her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking with her feet bare, Naruko walked around the alley looking for something, anything to wear on her feet to avoid stepping on broken glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need something, then I can walk out to figure out what's going on ...\" she muttered in a distraught tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurveying the alley some more, she noticed a glint in the fading daylight. Moving as quickly as she could, she was slightly confused by what she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's Shoes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6c/20/4a/6c204af2985abaae9d1de1c9a18e0bef.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6c/20/4a/6c204...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it\u2019s  not sandals, but I can't really be too picky.\" Making up her mind, Naruko strapped the heels around her feet. Taking a moment to get used the new footwear. She began to walk out the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Two Hour Later</b></u><br>\r\n'It's no use!' she whined in her head as she leaned against a lamp post on the corner of the village. The area she was in now had flashing neon lights. Some places smelled weird while large throngs  of people passed by. Some were dressed casually, while others had on flashy clothing or stood around chatting up people who passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can talk,\" she muttered in frustration. She asked for help from a few of strangely dressed women, but they either told her to \"Beat it skank! I'm working this beat!\" or sadly smiled and shooed her off. One of the women was kind enough to pretty her face up while saying, \"If you want to succeed here, you need to look the part fully lil' miss~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruko was interrupted from her thoughts by a man dressed in a fine kimono and his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you jii-san?\" she asked while remembering some of the strange advice she received from one of the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from her to his son, the man smiled. \"Yes you can, little lady! My son recently became a shinobi for Konohagakure. Since he is becoming a man, it\u2019s only fair that I help guide him to the proper that in life.  Would you care to help me with this task?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you need my help with this?\" she asked slightly confused. She didn't see how this affected her in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the decency to look slightly flustered, the boy spoke up. \"My name is Shizou, and my father was i-inquiring about the services you offered, n-nee-chan,\" he said while blushing, looking at the pavement to avoid eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i guess I could help. What would you need?\" she asked while taken aback by the shy boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's smile grew wider in response. \"I just need you to come with m'boy to hotel room I have rented across the ways and spend the night with him. Teach 'em what it means to be a man, and I'll make well worth it for you. Come along now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot getting a chance to respond, Naruko watched as the man took off with his son following in his shadow as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Naruko do?</span></div></div>",

Her hips grew outward a fraction, giving a slightly more defined figure.

Her face remained mainly the same, with only her lips puffing out a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into a nearby mirror, Naruko felt herself go numb at the girl looking back. Her shirt had ridden up a little further with the tear grown in size, leaving a view of her new C-cup breasts being cradled by a lacy purple bra, the frills barely seen through the tear. Her body was now closer to an hourglass figure, with the two straps of a her new thong hugging her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i look like a-a-a ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><b>Prostitute</b></i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a strange haze grow in her mind, Naruko gained a small but seductive smirk form as she placed one hand on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, I aren't just a <i>bad</i> girl?\" Blowing a kiss to the mirror, she sauntered to the door to get the job done.</span></div></div>",

Taking Shizou by the hand, both he and his son walked quickly to avoid dealing with the issue any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko stares at the large amount of money in shock. \u201cWhat... just happened?

Plants are know scattered around the apartment, while two rooms completed the same basic layout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the new purse and putting Ageha down, Naruto clicked his tongue while thinking. \u201cNow what to get for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to a cabinet near the stovetop, Naruto pulled out two containers of instant ramen. \u201cThat\u2019ll do!\u201d He moved around the small kitchen, preparing two bowls and a set of chopsticks while waiting on the ramen to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha watched the entire time, her eyes never leaving Naruto. As she watched in wonder, a new scent wafted through the air to tease her nostrils. Her stomach gurgled loudly, catching Naruto\u2019s attention from the sound. \u201cYou must really be really hungry, huh kiddo!\u201d As he spoke, the prepubescent tone of Naruto began to grow softer and mature. \u201cWell don\u2019t worry! It may not be much, but I\u2019ve had instant ramen many times! It\u2019s really good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a ding from the microwave, he emptied the containers into the bowls and set them on the small table near the couch. Motioning towards Ageha, the little girl nearly fell over as she climbed onto the table. Splitting the chopsticks, Naruto grabbed a second set for the girl. \u201cNow pay attention dear. The way to eat ramen is simple. We use the chopsticks to hold the noodles and meat to eat.\u201d Naruto demonstrated while slurping down the noodles. Ageha had some trouble at first, but copied the movement. Slurping the first bite, her eyes went wide. \u201cSo good~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched in amusement as the little girl began to eat with gusto. He then began to attack his own bowl. But something was ... different to the taste. Taking a slower bite, the salty flavor of the food bothered him. Eating at the slower pace, Naruto didn\u2019t price his Adam\u2019s apple slowly vanish. The fact that his lips slowly plumped out was also lost as the taste continued to perplex him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was delicious~\u201d Ageha was bouncing in place with her belly full. Naruto only smiled in response. \u201cThat\u2019s nice sweetheart. Now let\u2019s get you in the bathroom, while I clean up dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, Naruto took the next few minutes to draw a bath while cleaning the small mess left behind. Checking the bedroom, he saw the bath was ready. So he pulled out a clean shirt and shorts leftover from his childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgeha, it\u2019s time for a bath!\u201d The shinobi called out, and the little girl came running with  stuffed bear in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d She began to strip in front of Naruto, but felt a hand stop her. Looking up, Naruto frowned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for a girl to change in front of another person. Especially a boy,\u201d he said with a warning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha was confused by the tone Naruto took. \u201cBut, __________.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Most people just assume that you\u2019re a boy since you look a bit like both,\u201d Ageha finished, beaming with pride at her reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, however, felt a sudden dread as a strange sensation made them go rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLURP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather her. As her new insides rearranged themselves to compensate, her legs and arms lost and distributed muscle and fat throughout the body. As her nipples darkened and pushed out, the pectoral area hardly pushed out and was covered in wraps. His waist inclined slightly, leaving an androgynous appearance. Finally, her face turned slightly more feminine as eyes widened a bit with longer eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking conflicted at her new appearance, Naruto\u2019s body went on autopilot as she led Ageha to the bath. When she really felt in control again, she found herself naked in the tub with Ageha. The little girl splashed about while just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This isn\u2019t right. This girl ... my ... sister, can\u2019t be right about this!?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Her sister!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to wash Ageha as the transformation further altered her mind. \u2018Of course she\u2019s my sister. I mean, not yet. But she will be. Just need to talk to Tsunade-baaaa-sama about adoption tomorrow.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she washed herself and Ageha off, it wasn\u2019t only the grime that came off. The minuscule amounts of hair and rough skin turned smooth, leaving a pale sheen instead. Shampooing both of their hairs influenced it to lay flat and reach her neck, while rubbing it in caused her nails to grow slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the tub, the drying off didn\u2019t leave many changes. It just left her nipples slightly puffier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing Ageha in her smaller kids clothes, Naruto just changed into her usual attire. Laying out a pillow and large blanket, she began tucking Ageha in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, my little imouto,\u201d she cooed to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, onee-chan!\u201d she chirped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the lights, Naruto went to sleep early to prepare for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

It reminded her of being left out in the streets as cold rain chilled her to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a bunch of moving shadows, her fear was too much! She ran as quickly as she could to Naruto\u2019s room, practically ripping the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me! I\u2019m scared!\u201d She nearly hopped on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groggily opened her eyes, staring at Ageha. \u201cMmph ... what\u2019s wrong sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big boom! Loud lights! Scary shadows!\u201d She said while shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, Naruto just shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a storm dear. Nothing bad is going to happen. Go back to sleep,\u201d she yawned while getting ready to settle back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! The monsters are gonna get me!\u201d Ageha  pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up once more, Naruto saw the same scared face from earlier in the day. \u201cOkay then. Climb up into bed with me, and no monsters will get you. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha then did as she was told. Slipping into the bed, Ageha scooted closer in. Wrapping her arms around Naruto\u2019s neck, she lay her head on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you okaa-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... love you too, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last of the transformation began. Her height grew to a modest 5\u20196\u201d as her legs gained supple fat and muscle. Her waist curved inward as her thighs and ass grew wider and plump, giving the definition of an hourglass figure. Her puffy chest swelled out as fat gathered, pushing out to a firm E-cup. Her face matured as her hair grew out and settled towards her now heart-shaped derri\u00e8re, bangs cupping and framing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha simply hugged her closer, as the new woman subconsciously wrapped her hands around her new daughter. The apartment began to shift as the final changes settled into Konoha proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Kushina and Minato never married because Minato had taken his training to be more important here. Thus, slightly more effective in disposing of the Kyuubi through seals.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up for his paperwork, he smiled at the two new arrivals. \u201cGood morning ladies! What exactly brings you before me today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha looked nervous, but a reassuring smile from Tsubaki calmed her. \u201cWell you see Lord Hokage, it began just yesterday ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later (Literally an abridged version of the story minus the transformation detail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... and that is why I came to you,\u201d she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked thoughtfully at the story. \u201cWell, it is a bit unusual to go about an adoption this way.

Did the matron kick you out of the orphanage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking timidly at the man, Ageha nodded. \u201cY-yes!

Bending down to her level, Minato gave her a reassuring smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid little one. No one is going to do anything to you. Just take a deep breath, and tell me what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha sniffled a bit, but began to speak. \u201cT-the boy ... Hiro, he get hit by the matron. T-two scary m-men came by and g-grabbed him. The m-matron told everyone t-that if anyone said a-anything, s-something bad would happen,\u201d she finished as she began to hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato gave her another calm smile and patted her head. \u201cThank you for telling me this, young lady.\u201d Walking to sit back down, he turned his attention back to Tsubaki. \u201cAnd thank for bringing this to my attention Ms. Watanabe. I am going to have someone look into this after our meeting. As for your request for adoption, I normally do not handle such things. But in this instance, I can get the proper paperwork started immediately. It may take up to a week for this to happen, but little Ageha can still stay with you until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki gave him bright smile in response. \u201cThat is very generous of you Lord Hokage! I would appreciate any help you can give me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato simply waved off the praise, blushing at the praise. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all! Investigating this grievous allegations means Konoha can end this potential exploitation of children quickly.\u201d<br>\r\nGesturing towards the door, he continued on. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you require of me, I will get the process started with the end of this meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki inclined her head in gratitude. \u201cYes. That is all we came for. Thank you for taking the time to help me with this issue Lord Hokage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeha, having calmed down, looked up at the village leader. \u201cWill my friends be okay?

Until then, enjoy the rest of your day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in response, Tsubaki walked out of the office.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They arrived at a small two story house with a roof deck. Naruto couldn't shake the feeling of familiarity while looking at it. His thoughts were interrupted when Emiko tugged at him. \"What you waiting for? We're here.\" Naruto opened the door and they stepped into the genkan and took off their shoes. Naruto felt compelled to wear a pair of slippers. Naruto felt like he was at home. He had a feeling he knew where everything was, but the reason eluded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked further into the house and saw the living area, the staircase, the dining table and the kitchen in the places he expected. His exploration was interrupted by a growl. He turned to Emiko who was looking at him with pleading eyes. \"I'm hungry,\" she whined. Naruto asked, \"What would you like, sweetie?\" \"Can we have ramen?\", pleaded Emiko. Naruto laughed because it was also his favorite, \"Of course, anything for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto intended to get cup Ramen, but as soon as he stepped into the kitchen he walked to the refrigerator instead. When he saw all the ingredients for Ramen he felt a sudden headache. When it faded he knew how to prepare it. As if possessed he started taking out two pots and cutting boards. Next he washed his hands to prepare the meal, as he scrubbed, his hands became smooth and hairless, his chipped nails repaired themselves, and the calluses disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was glad that some ingredients were already prepared. It would make the process faster so his little girl didn't have to wait too long. \"Wait, his little girl?\", thought Naruto. He wasn't sure where the thought came from. Wasn't he supposed to find the child's mother? What was he doing? He felt Emiko tug on him, again causing him to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko looked at him curiously, before asking, \"Can I help?\" Her cute expression made Naruto's heart melt. \"Of course, dear.\" Naruto filled the large pot with water, and turned on the stove. While it was heating the large pot he placed another pot on the stove for the broth. While it was heating Naruto working the noodles. He instructed Emiko to put flour on the counter after giving her the scoop. When Emiko was about to spread the flour she slipped creating a cloud of flour that covered their faces. The flour caused them to cough. With each cough Naruto's voice became higher as his Adam's apple disappeared and his larynx changed. When he stopped coughing Naruto saw Emiko's face and he started giggling. His voice was high and soft. Emiko also started to giggle realizing she wasn't being punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto washed his face to remove the flour. As the flour came off, his face lost its whisker marks, and it became softer and more feminine. His ey Naruto helped Emiko clean her face. He returned his focus on the dough. He worked it into noodles much to Emiko's delight. Naruto checked the water in the pots. He called Emiko to help with the toppings, \"Come Emiko, I'll let you prepare the toppings.\"  Naruto guided Emiko to cut various toppings. He felt immense pride in her. a feeling that was becoming normal and comfortable. Naruto, while keeping an eye on Emiko, took the pots off heat, and finished the meal. He helped Emiko place the toppings on. Emiko rushed to the table and shouted, \"Yay, Ramen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took their places in the dining room and prepared to eat. They put their hands together and exclaimed Itadakimasu!, and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I\u2019ll *hic* be free to eat all the buttered toast I please!\u201d Orochimaru laughed as he nearly knocked over his equipment as he took another swig from an unmarked bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Orochimaru... don\u2019t you think this is a little... much?\u201d asked Kabuto nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru froze up briefly, before turning around and giving Kabuto an insane smile. \u201cTrying to keep allllll the toast for yerself eh Ka-bu-to?\u201d he hissed as his eyes narrowed. Walking towards his  increasingly scared assistant, he continued to predate. \u201cYou truly believe you can stop me boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto was sweating as fear blanked his mind. \u201cN-no, Lord O-orchimaru! Just c-curious about the c-current plan, my liege?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru looked at his assistant with poorly concealed menace, before laughing and taking another sip. \u201cRelax, my boy! I was simply kidding about the toast!\u201d He then gave him a serious look. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t joking about defeating Jiraiya. T-the fool keeps interfering with my plans, and I\u2019m done with it! So... I\u2019m taking him and Konoha down by using his kryptonite!\u201d he declared as he cackled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd his weakness is...\u201d lead on a skittish Kabuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWomen! More specifically cougars! I will turn the entirety of Konoha\u2019s current generation of ninja into powerless civilian women to cripple him!\u201d he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabuto looked... disturbed to say the least. \u201cBut, my lord... how would that even work? And what do you mean his weakness! Anyone with large breasts and an ass is a weakness to him!\u201d he nearly screamed as the ridiculousness of the situation finally broke his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, dear Kabuto! While what you say is true to a degree, I know his preference is for, in his words, \u2018mature vixens who still got a rockin bod. Yeah!\u2018 It was always that way, first with Sarutobi\u2019s wife, then the Damiyo\u2019s wife before she let herself go, and finally Tsunade. Why do you think he never got married, despite the fact he\u2019s rich of his smut?\u201d asked a now bored Snake Sannin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but... that still doesn\u2019t explain how!\u201d Kabuto stammered out as shock overrode his better judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. Quite simple. The virus I have developed is a simple one. It utilizes chakra to shift the cell and bone structure of the body into a malleable shape, based off Akamichi and Kaguya dna strands of course. The chromosomes of males will shift from XY to XX, while the rest of the virus rapidly ages and molds the victim into that of a slightly older woman, ranging from late 20\u2019s to her 40\u2019s. The virus then causes such stress on the chakra network, that becomes akin to that of, ironically kind you, a civilian woman who has no shinobi background whatsoever,\u201d he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but how will you do it!? From what you described, it sounds like a monstrous amount of chakra! Not to mention how the older, more powerful shinobi will react!\u201d he said as he tried to reason with mad, if slightly impressive, plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the help of the Kyuubi of course. The slightly more insane portion of the village always like to blame the fox for everything! So, using that train of thought, the massive reserves of energy will react with minuscule amounts leftover from the attack! It will spread rapidly, consuming the village within an hour while affecting the young and those born after the Kyuubi\u2019s rampage. And as for how, well, the virus will also result in various pheromones being released. The build up and exposure will leave everyone present in the village very... hormonal, before submitting to base instinct-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and having a village-wide orgy,\u201d finished a shocked Kabuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. The best part is the Kyuubi will have all its power drained, thus depriving them of a way to attempt to reverse it,\u201d added a now bored Orochimaru. \u201cNow, take this vial and go \u2018visit\u2019 our unwitting accomplices so I may plan our next move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the vial with reverence, Kabuto bowed deeply.. \u201cYes my liege. I will not let you done.\u201d He then vanished in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting a minute, Orochimaru looked around for anyone left. Sensing nothing, he cackled as he brought out a loaf of bread, a stick of butter, and a large toaster. \u201cThat\u2019ll keep that little brown nosed and idiot pervert distracted! No one\u2019s gonna steal my buttered toast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru then took another swig from the unlabeled bottle, unaware of the chaos he\u2019d unleashed in Konoha for the foreseeable future.</span></div></div>",

A field full of test cases, and the subject is knocked out.\u201d Seeing a faint red aura intermingled with... pink!? \u201cYou know what? This day is already weird enough as is. Just gonna use the vial and get the hell out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping a syringe full of the contents, Kabuto pushed the needle into Naruto\u2019s vein. Injecting the contents into Naruto, he immediately took to the trees as a familiar chakra began to surge outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack in the sewer again. I\u2019m getting REAL sick of this,\u201d muttered the oblivious nin as he walked towards the seal. \u201cAll right, fox! What do you want now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry rumbled met the boy as a red blur escaped the cage. Grabbing him by the front of his shirt, an angry redhead girl with fox ears pinned him against the wall. \u201c<b>YOU\u2019VE DONE IT NOW YOU STUPID LITTLE SHIT! THE WHOLE IMPRISONMENT STHICK AND DEMANDING CHAKRA WAS SOMETHING I\u2019M USED TO.

You were a giant fox the other day, but now you\u2019re a girl! What the-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stopped as a fist slammed into his gut, causing him to cry out in agony. \u201c<b>YOU DO NOT GET TO SPEAK!

INSTEAD, I\u2019M NOW STUCK IN THIS USELESS FORM, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, ONLY ABLE TO USE A QUARTER OF MY POWER IN THIS FORM!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping him, Naruto tried to scramble away from the enraged fox turned girl. Taking a longer look, she did look to be around his age. Red hair reaching her back with developing figure, the only thing out of place was the fox ears. \u201cWait... where\u2019s your tails?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping her internal ramble, the foxgirl instantly set her eyes on the boy. A set of predatory eyes caught the prey in its gaze. \u201c<b>Were you checking me out, boy?</b>\u201d she growled out. Taking his silence as a yes, an evil smile graced her face. \u201c<b>YOU. ARE. DEAD. PERVERT.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to crawl away further, but a red chakra tail wrapped around his waist. Pulling him in front of her, the Kyuubi prepared her claws as she mentally planned a slow death for her dumb container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the pipes representing the chakra system began to glow pink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>REALLY!? AGAIN WITH THIS SHIT?</b>\u201d roared the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Naruto fell to the floor as the chakra disbursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKa-clink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kyuubi and Naruto\u2019s eyes widened as a huge wave of red chakra escaped the open seal. Before it swept them up, twin cries of \u201cOH SHIT!\u201d echoed throughout the mental sewer scape as the virus began to do its work.</span></div></div>",

He also felt hair tickle his neck. Naruto tried to brush it away it, but it was longer than expected and when he grabbed it he noticed it was long vibrant red hair that reached his chest. This lead to a new discovery, the swell of sizeable breasts. In disbelief he moved his hands to confirm their existence. He removed the hospital gown and rushed to the mirror to examine the rest of his new body. Naruto stumbled off-balance when he stood up. He felt the way his hips swayed, and the weight of his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror revealed a well-toned, but distinctly female body. Her face had familiar blue eyes and smooth whisker-less cheeks. She had long waist-length hair with a striking red color. Her arms with narrow shoulders were slim and well-muscled. Strong legs that were long and slender. Large breasts, full and round. Below it a lean abdomen. The hips flaring outward making room for her uterus. Her pubic hair forming a triangle emphasizing her vagina. She was well on her way to being strong, stunning woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYA!\" Naruto screamed as reality came crashing down. Hearing the scream the attending nurse returned with Tsunade in tow. \"Brat, I see you discovered your new self. I already chewed out Sakura for goading you into using the scroll. Before you ask this is permanent.\" Naruto sat back down on the bed. \u201cBaa-chan, why did this happen?\" a conflicted Naruto asked. \"Brat, you're always attracting trouble.\" Naruto glared at her halfheartedly. He then confessed to Tsunade, \"As strange as it sounds this doesn't bother me like it should. I feel conflicted because I feel like I should be fighting for my manhood, but I no longer feel like a man. In fact it feels weird when I call myself male.\"  \"It sounds like the transformation also affected your brain.

She would have to adapt her taijutsu to her new body to fight potentially more muscular men, like Tsunade. Shikamaru was not among them, she laughed at that thought. Mentally, her thoughts and self-doubt had disappeared and her emotions were calm. Her thoughts were interrupted when Tsunade returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a set of clothes. This is the best I can do on short notice. A short-sleeve shirt, standard shinobi pants, and sandals. I also brought a sports bra and matching panties.

Wait Baa-sama?\" \"Yes, I used to call her baa-chan before but I'm Kasumi now, I'm more mindful of what I call her, so I'm compromising.\" Sakura noted, \"You're still calling her old.\" \"Like I said <i>more</i> mindful, both girls giggled at that.\" No offense but your more tolerable as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I get my shinobi clothes. I'll get you set up.\" Sakura called for help, \"Nuno-san, Kasumi here would like to be fitted for new clothing.\" \"Kasumi-san this way please. So what are you looking for?, Nuno asked. Kasumi told her. \"I'm looking for new clothes and a properly fitting bra.\" Certainly, We'll take of it.\" Nuno answered cheerfully. Follow me please. Nuno took Kasumi into a back room filled with cloth, pins, and thread all neatly organized. Nuno warned her, \"Nui-sama is our best tailor, but be warned she has high standards and she's a bit prickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuno-san, what do have for me this time?\" \"A new customer, she needs a complete makeover.\" Kasumi feeling she'd regret any disrespect, introduced herself, \"Nui-sama, I am Kasumi,  pleased to meet you.\" \"Mm, at least you show respect, now strip.\" What? Kasumi was unprepared for the older woman's overbearing personality. \"Are you deaf girl. I need to get a look at you.\" Kasumi stripped and stood naked under the scrutiny of Nui's eyes. \"Not bad, I guess you do have something going for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNui took out a tape measure. \"I see, good proportions. Hm, breasts on the larger size, but not unreasonable and nice hips for bearing children if she retires. Good muscle too.\" Kasumi was blushing in embarrassment at the scrutiny. Nui's next comment snapped Kasumi back to reality, \"By the time you leave you will expect you to express yourself as an elegant and capable Kunoichi. Your lucky girl I don't see just anyone. You know, there's something about that red hair of yours that reminds of someone. Kushina Uzumaki, that hellion that wouldn't respect anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi made a note to see Tsunade afterward to find out who this Kushina was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Note: <b>Nuno </b>means cloth. <b>Nui</b> means thread.

They were our strongest allies before war destroyed them. They were known for their sealing prowess, longevity and red hair a trait your mother shared. Your mother was sent to Konoha because she was the best person to contain the Kyuubi.\" Kasumi gasped as Tsunade continued, \"I didn't know her personally because I was bitter at what I lost, but she had a reputation for her temper. Your mother wasn't the first to hold the fox, the first Hokage's wife Mito Uzumaki was the first. She sealed the Fox into herself when it broke free from Madara's control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi was struggling with several emotions. She went from feelings of Betrayal and anger to sorrow to happiness and even confusion . Anger from being lied to about her lineage. Sorrow from never having known her mother. Happy knowing about her and that her transformation and the fox gave her a greater connection to her mother. Confusion about the fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? How did she die? asked Kasumi apprehensively. \"Kasumi, what I going to say is classified, you are forbidden from sharing it with anyone. If you do I won't protect you. Now, Kushina died on the day of your birth. She was taken to a secret place to give birth. Somehow someone found out. The med-nin assisting in your birth had their throats slit. Your mother had the fox extracted. The perpetrator was an unknown Uchiha who his Sharingan to control the fox. We assume he's still out there. As for your father I'll let Jiraiya tell you. They gave their lives for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi chuckled darkly, her hair came out of it's tie resembling nine tails, and her eyes glowed red, \"I guess I understand Sasuke's desire for revenge a little better, but I won't let it consume me.

They heard Teuchi ask, Kushina? No, my name is Kasumi. Teuchi apologized, \"Sorry, you look like someone I knew.\" Kasumi asked for her usual. Unlike her previous visits to Ichiraku, she ate at a civilized pace and finished earlier than before. Sakura decided it was a good time to test Kasumi's sexual orientation. Kasumi saw Sakura's expression and grew nervous. \"You haven't had time to consider who you like.

Lee was interrupted by Neji. \"Lee you're making her uncomfortable.\" Neji turned toward her with a gentle smile, \"I am Hyuuga Neji, I apologize for my friend's enthusiasm.\" Kasumi was no longer focused on Lee.

I was thinking the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at their Training field where they became genin. She remembered letting her anger get the best of her and the humiliation from being tied on the point, but the memory was strange because her transformation made her female in mind, body and soul.

Sakura broke her out of her thoughts, \"Hey didn't you want to spar.\" Kasumi apologized, \"Sorry Sakura, I was just saying goodbye.\" Sakura was confused, \"Goodbye?\" \"To Naruto.\" Oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's go Sakura. Kasumi did a few stretches, and was surprised by her body's flexibility. She was excited to get back into action. Kasumi and Sakura stared intensely into each others eyes and sprang into motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura made the first move and slammed her fist into the earth sending chunks of rock toward Kasumi. Kasumi dodged the first rock, she decided to attempt a Rasengan one-handed and was pleased to find it forming in her hand. Her jutsu made short work of the second chunk of stone, and closed the distance. Sakura abandoned her long distance attacks and engaged Kasumi directly. Sakura threw a punch and Kasumi found herself off balance, she forget her only reference for her movement was when she was Naruto. She took a hit in the midsection. Kasumi disengaged and adjusted her attacks considering her center of gravity. She easily blocked the next strike. Sakura's strike's had substantial force. Knowing she couldn't sustain too many hits Kasumi changed her strategy, she threw some shuriken to force her opponent to back off. She decided to use a favorite of hers, the shadow clone jutsu. Several clones popped into existence. Sakura held off the first two clones, but the third broke through landing a hit. Kasumi was enjoying the rush of adrenaline. However, In the middle of the spar another presence arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi and Sakura broke off their engagement ready to defend each other. \"Yo, how are my cute genin doing.\" They relaxed having recognized their Sensei.</span></div></div>",

A dark thought entered his mind, \"Why shouldn't I be, she's constantly abused me.\" Startled Naruto sped up toward his apartment. His mood got worse when his skin started to itch, and the sun seemed to get brighter. He hissed in pain, and his eyes flashed red.  </span></div></div>",

In his weakened state he wasn't able to dodge the punch. The man taunted him, \"Aren't you going to fight me fox? You've become weak haven't you\" He struck Naruto in the gut and he collapsed. The man grabbed a kunai, and stabbed Naruto's shoulder. Naruto's gaze was fixed on the blood. His eyes dilated and turned red. His nose detected the metallic scent. It was intoxicating. His fangs ached for blood. Naruto latched onto his attackers throat ignoring the shinobi's shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt his strength return after each gulp. He couldn't get enough of the rich, tasty blood. His enemies screams became muted, and his life drained away. Naruto was satisfied by his meal, and he didn't think much about his victim.

Since her transformation she hated bright colors, they reminded her of the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered a clothing store with gothic imagery. Benihime found something she liked. It was a dress with a leather corset. It was short enough not to impede her movement. She also chose stockings underneath knee-high leather boots with heels instead of Shinobi sandals. Lastly, she chose elbow length fingerless gloves with black lace. She changed outfits and discarded her previous clothes. Benihime walked toward the exit, but was stopped by the clerk, \"hey, you have to pay for that.\" Benihime's eyes glowed as he gazed into his eyes and they glossed over.

I expected some poor little girl to come across my little experiment, but certainly not you,\u201d hissed Orochimaru through his snake medium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing his eyes turn yellow, Naruto hissed back. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Before covering his mouth as the changes began to affect his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA simple, if not fascinating look into my own immortality jutsu, The Power of the White Snake. It uses my human base to convert the subject into a human-snake hybrid. The only problem is that only female DNA is compatible with the process. Not a problem for me, since I can easily swap bodies. But for you, well, there\u2019s a bit of waiting process,\u201d he hissed in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could barely follow the snake\u2019s musings as his body began to convulse as organs began to shift to something more serpentine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck, young Naruto. I look forward to seeing how you develop and grow,\u201d hissed the snake as it vanished in a poor of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to move as his body convulsed and shift, he finally felt his perspective shift as he finally began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wriggle free of the now empty skin as a golden snake slithered out of the mouth of his former body. Slightly larger than a an average anaconda, instinct briefly took over as Naruto analyzed the surrounding area. But his eyes widened as the weight of what Orochimaru said cake crashing down on him. \u2018Wha-what\u2019s happening to me? I-I\u2019m a snake? But how?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic overtook as he struggled to adapt to his new body. Seeing his former vessel, Naruto attempted to slither over when a piercing scream echoed throughout the training ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNARUTO-KUN!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was staring at the snake in horror, then looked back to the downed body of her teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at his horrified teammate, and attempted to speak to her. \u201cSa-sakura,\u201d he struggled to hiss. But instead of his usual voice, a seductive feminine hiss cooed the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even hesitating, Sakura tossed a kunai she was reaching for, nearly clipping the snake as it swerved to avoid the knife. \u201cDIE YOU DAMN SNAKE!\u201d she screeched in rage, reaching for another kunai or shuriken to strike the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct once again overtook the fearful snake. Hissing, Naruto slithered into the tall grass as fast as it could. Finding it still had access to chakra, the snake moved sleekly as it bolted across the field to flee the vengeful pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura! What the hell is going on?!\u201d asked an incredulous Tsunade. The younger kunoichi were struggling to wake up as the older ones were regaining their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsunade-sama!

He isn\u2019t moving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was torn between wanting to escape and address Sakura, but a pulse a chakra rocked through Naruto\u2019s serpentine body.

What\u2019s happening?\u201d asked a concerned Kabuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his assistant, Orochimaru sighed as he massaged his scalp in frustration. \u201cOne of my more... progressive experiments was finally beginning to take off when the snakes of Ryuuchi cave decided to claim it. Manda was especially persistent, citing \u2018payment for the foolish loss of my kin during the Konoha Crush.\u2019 He\u2019s still angry about the battle against Tsunade and Jiraiya,\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kabuto was curious. \u201cWhat could possibly so interesting that Manda and the snake summons would claim one of the experiments for themselves? Surely we could negotiate or use one of the more loyal snakes to spy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, not this time. It\u2019s not only Manda who intervened, but the White Snake Sage who expressed interest. No one will go against her, so we\u2019re out of luck unless we wish to invite the entirety of their wrath. Best to wait until later,\u201d he said, wondering how the new female snake would survive Ryuuchi Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a dark cave (Ryuuchi Cave)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a poor of smoke, a confused Naruto was summoned to large cavernous area. Feeling confused, but strangely at ease, the snake looked around before seeing a large mass of snakes staring back. Nearly eeping in spite of itself, the snake collected itself before calling out. \u201cHello?\u201d it hissed, finding it easier to communicate in hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud booming voice greeted her back. \u201c\u2018Hello?\u2019 She says? No even a demand for like \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019 or \u2018Where am I?\u2019! Joy, the snake picks a meek little mouse to masquerade as a snake!\u201d A large purple snake with green eyes sneered back as he slithered down, judging the new arrival with its piercing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it could respond, a second voice stopped Manda in its tracks. \u201cYou seem awfully cavalier with your attitude Manda? Need I remind you who is really in charge here already?\u201d hissed out a soft, but deadly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared up at massive snake sitting a stone plateau. The largest snake it had ever seen stared back, a purple turban with a red jewel sitting upon its massive head. Smoking from a massive cigarette holder, it breathed out smoke before continuing. \u201cAllow me to clarify for that foolish hatchling, my dear. You are in Ryuuchi Cave, the home of all summon snakes. And you\u2019ve been brought here as a curiosity on my whim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke coalesced around the young snake forming into a genjutsu showing the history of the cave. \u201cMany have come to study senjutsu, or natural energy, to augment their power and failed. They would often turn into stone or snakes themselves, depending on their constitution of course. But you, are the first to become a snake via Orochi-Chan\u2019s little experiment. So we claimed you as our own in order to see if this new method of conversion is viable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was shocked as the information processed. \u201cThen what are going to do with me?\u201d it hissed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManda, having remained silent, took over the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ll be used as breeder, you fool! You can barely move and communicate as is, and would be useless as combat breed! Besides,\u201d he hissed as he shrank to Naruto\u2019s size,\u201d you look especially fertile. A few rounds with me, and you\u2019ll most certainly lay a good couple of clutches of eggs,\u201d he hissed as he wrapped around the now frightened snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but, I-I\u2019m a boy,\u201d it whispered as Manda\u2019s head came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what you were then. Whatever Orochimaru did, it converted you into a snake. A female snake. And I haven\u2019t had a good breeder in years. You\u2019ll do well,\u201d he hissed, preparing to mount the now female Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a large white tail cuffed Manda\u2019s head, wrapping around his shrunken frame while holding him in place. The White Snake Sage stared him down, glaring at the struggling snake. \u201cAGAIN, MANDA? You forget your place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManda was thrown into the deeper recesses of the cave, a scream echoing as he traveled down.</span></div></div>",

An ingrained loyalty began to manifest, causing the female snake to answer In a curt tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. You must be hungry from the ordeal. Allow me to arrange a meal for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief tap of her tail summoned a typical Oto goon in a poof a smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPic: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/6/65/Otogakure_shinobi.png/revision/latest?cb=20150215164744\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naru...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud \u201cWhat the-\u201c was uttered before Hebihime reared back, consuming the disposable goon whole. With a swift couple bites, her venom easily killed and broke down the remains of the unfortunate ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was left of Naruro had been shifted and repurposed by the sage-empower genjutsu. She hissed contently as she turned back to her new liege. \u201cThank you, Sage-sama,\u201d she hissed our in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood my dear. Now it\u2019s been six months since our last conversation. Concerning your role in the clan...,\u201d trailed off the Snake Sage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the new snake choose?

Activating her Byakugan, she scanned the field and surrounding underground for any sign of movement. Passing over the snake being hidden in a camouflaged den, she sighed as the search turned up nothing. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, no one is hiding,\u201d she managed to get out before emotion began to overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grunted in annoyance. \u201cThen we have to assume they\u2019ve either hidden themselves or have escaped. Kurenai, secure the r-remains,\u201d she ordered, only hesitating when addressing the body of the boy who inspired her to become Hokage. \u201cAnko, keep an eye on the field. You\u2019re the most experienced when dealing with Orochimaru\u2019s tricks, so there may be a clue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the genin present, who were in varying degrees of shock and grief. \u201cWhat happened here is considered classified until further notice. This is an S-rank order, meaning failure to comply means death upon the reveal of the secret. I understand some of you may be in shock or grief, but this is a matter that will be restricted to prevent an information breach. Is this understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at Tsunade in either shock or sad understanding, so Tsunade continued. \u201cVery well. Leave this field in small groups in case an enemy still lurks, but not too large to draw attention. There will be a later debriefing to gather as much information as possible while giving you time to come to terms with the events. Dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade turned to address Anko further, leaving the girls to silently disburse as ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

This is my room and my home. Those are my parents. I have a crush on Sasuke. I'm book smart. Doesn't that mean I'm Sakura.\" Subconsciously she had accepted the logic. Another one of her fears came true, the name Naruto had become foreign to her. </span></div></div>",

She yelled at him, \"How many times do I have to say no, Naruto.\" Naruto, grumbled, \"I don't see why you like the jerk.\" Sakura felt her anger flare up. \"Naruto!

Making her way to Kushina's redone apartment, she was surprised to hear giggling. Bracing herself for what would be one of Kushina's, formerly Naruto, famous revenge pranks, she knocked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" called out Kushina in a slight sing-song tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, Shizune was surprised to see Hinata and Kushina watching a romantic comedy on some civilian network while doing ...

The sound of metal cutting through air reached her ears, forcing her to roll to the right as a salvo of kunai and shuriken pierced the ground where she was standing. A bandit appeared on top of a tree branch, garbed in a green flak jacket, black combat pants, shinobi sandals, and a Kumogakure headband with a slash going through the symbol. He was tall, standing around 6 feet with dark skin, brown hair in a crew cut, and slate grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well well, look what we have here.

She flipped backwards, just barely managing to avoid the jutsu. She peered forward, unable to see through the dust and debris that the jutsu had tossed into the air, her chains hovering in front of her as a makeshift barrier..

He and several other bandits were quick to bring her to the largest tent before removing what remained of her dress. Kuro ushered one of the bandits, a missing shinobi like himself, who kneeled beside Kushina and rolled her over so she was laying on her stomach. He pulled out an ink bottle and brush, and then began to draw an intricate set of seals on the small of her back. \u201cOne more stroke...alright. The seals are finished Kuro.\u201d The bandit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Ganju. Alright boys, let\u2019s wake this bitch up and show her a good time!\u201d Kuro yelled, his proclamation generating a roar of laughter and approval. A bucket of cold water was thrown dumped on Kushina, shocking her awake. She moved to jump away from the group of bandits, only for Kuro to knock her to the ground, a vice like grip on her wrist. \u201cNow, now, now, there\u2019s no need to leave just yet, we were just getting to the good part!\u201d He punctuated his sentence by tightening his grip while another bandit slapped her ass. \u201cYa see, the way things are for you right now, I figure that you owe me and my friends a little...appreciation. So why don\u2019t ya get on your knees, unless you want to end up like your escorts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina stared defiantly at her captors before reluctantly nodding her head and getting onto her knees. In the blink of an eye, the bandits had disrobed, their cocks standing at attention in the presence of the stunning red-head. She gulped as Kuro\u2019s 13 inch long, 4 inch wide cock rested in front of Kushina\u2019s mouth, the musky scent filling her nose. She opened her mouth to protest, only for Kuro had grabbed her silky locks and pull her head forward, lodging the first 8 inches of his cock in her throat. \u201cOh yes...that\u2019s a nice tight throat ya got here!\u201d Kuro moaned, his hips a steady blur as he attempted to bury the entirety of his cock in Kushina\u2019s throat. Tears built up in Kushina\u2019s eyes as her protests were muffled by Kuro\u2019s cock. Kuro\u2019s use of her throat seemed to set off an unseen signal, as her hands were pulled away and forced to stroke two cocks. Behind her, Ganju positioned himself at her entrance before thrusting forward, his rough entry forcing Kushina into orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro\u2019s thrusts finally paid off as he managed to bury the entirety of his cock in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m cumming bitch!\u201d he roared, his already large cock inflating and further stretching her throat as he pumped a pint of cum down her throat. He pulled out, two more globs of cum shooting out and covering Kushina\u2019s hair, face, and breasts in the sticky liquid. She was given a brief reprieve as Ganju pulled out of her, only for Kuro to flip her onto her back. In addition to the two cocks she was forced to jack off, another bandit had replaced Kuro and begun to fuck her throat, while another began to fuck her breasts. Ganju had gone underneath Kushina and proceeded to fill her ass with his large member, causing Kushina to scream in pain as her anal virginity was taken. Kuro positioned his cock in front of her cunt and shoved it in, Kushina\u2019s screams sending vibrations through the cock of the bandit she was currently deepthroating, causing him to cum prematurely and be replaced by another bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, each of the bandits had been replaced by another except for Kuro, who was still pounding away at Kushina\u2019s sopping cunt. Kuro\u2019s plundering had forced her into dozens of orgasms, and pushed her sanity to the breaking point. As is, she was just barely able to form a coherent thought.Another bandit came down her throat, filling her stomach with another load of cum before pulling out, freeing her mouth for the first time in half an hour. Finally, Kuro\u2019s thrusts began to speed up and become more erratic. \u201cHere it comes ya slut! A nice big dose of piping hot cum!\u201d he roared, Kushina\u2019s eyes widening in horror at his proclamation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Please pull out! Pull out or you\u2019ll get me pregnant!\u201d she screamed, but it was too late. His cock twitching before unloading an immense amount of cum, flooding her womb. After two minutes of filling her abused cunt, he pulled out, tears falling from her eyes at the thought of this monster impregnating her. The other bandits pulled out of Kushina and stood over her, their hands blurring over their erections. Within moments, Kushina was covered from head to toe in hot, sticky cum. \u201cI-is it over?\u201d she asked meekly, her throat sore from the constant abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits, minus Kuro, left the tent, only for another group to enter, each sporting large erections. \u201cOver? Slut, this is only round 1!\u201d he proclaimed, Kushina whimpering as the men approached her once more.</span></div></div>",

He was formerly a powerful shinobi that was an expert with a sword and Metal Style ninjutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oooooooooh.\"</i> Kushina moaned out as she cupped her breasts in her hands before wrapping the towel around them. \"That would be good to have for mine and Hinata-chan's perfect child.

The week had passed since that night and Kushina was able to complete her mission. And she did enjoy it since it was much easier to seduce the politician, leading the two going at it for a single night. \"That was a good night.\" Kushina thought, getting slightly horny at remembering. Kushina was also able to get a sperm from him like he did with Darui where on the trip back to Konoha, she fused the politician's sperm with Darui's. \"Mine and Hinata-chan's child is gonna be the best. . .after Hinata-chan's been <u>altered</u>.\" She thought.

It took everything Kushina had to keep herself from squealing as she imagined squeezing that little cutie to her bosom. Running out of the Hokage tower Kushina created a few hundred Shadow Clones and had them transform into birds. Sending her feathered clones out Kushina only needed to wait for a few minutes before an influx of info came to her, letting her know that Hinata was currently at her favorite bakery enjoying her favorite treat. Kushina licked her lips thinking about Hinata and cinnamon sugar together. She could already imagine all the naughty things she'd do to the sweet girl. Knowing that her clones were keeping an eye on her target, Kushina casually strutted down the dirt roads leading towards the bakery.<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wrong! She knew that. Yet she couldn't help but, watch from the shadows as the little Hyuga happily snacked on a fresh cinnamon roll. She was just so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina blushed as she watched Hinata nibble at her delicious treat. She just wanted to jump the poor thing! She was so adorable that frankly it should be illegal. Kushina smiled at that thought. She wondered how the girl would take being handcuffed and sent to the jail cell that was Kushina's bedroom for breaking the cuteness law. She nearly started to drool at all the naughty role play they could do with that skit alone before Kushina simply screwed the girl to blissful unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe refocused just in time to see Hinata take a bite of her frosted treat and caught sight of the white frosting now spotting around her mouth. It made her think of something else that could leave the girls face covered in white frosting. <i>'Of all times to be missing that one piece of male equipment.'</i> Kushina thought in building sexual frustration. <i>'I need to get to her now before I simply try and jump her in public. As kinky as that would be I don't think many people would appreciate a 21 year old hottie trying to sex up a 12 girl in public.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring a direct approach was needed, Kushina took a deep breath and marched out towards her target and soon to be lover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-chan!\" The young girl looked to her in surprise before blushing lightly. \"H-hello Kushina-san.\" That wouldn't do at all. \"Hinata-chan, didn't I tell you to call me Kushina-chan or even Kusa-chan.\" Asked the red headed goddess, making sure to give a little purr of delight at the end. Hinata blushed a bright cherry red as she subconsciously picked up on the hint of lust in Kushina's voice. Well it was that or the fact that she couldn't seem to stop staring at her breasts. The attention was truthfully making Kushina quiet wet in anticipation and her nipples hardened enough to be visible through her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping herself down right next to the very flushed and clearly excited girl, Kushina put her arm around her. \"I just got back from this really long mission and feel like having some fun. What do ya say? Want to join me?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata couldn't remember a day that she felt this happy, not since her mother died had she felt this much joy! Due to her shyness, Hinata didn't have very many people she could open up to. She had friends yes but, she still had a hard time opening up too them. She would admit that something as simple as spending 'girl time' with Kushina, a woman that not too long ago had been a young boy that had unknowingly stolen her heart, could end up as one of the happiest moments in her young life seemed rather sad. Still, she wouldn't trade this day for anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell maybe there would be one or two things she'd wish to change. She had always admired Naruto and as she grew older she had fallen for him. But now Naruto was technically gone, nothing more then a memory and a past life of the beautiful red haired woman that she was spending time with. She wished she could have her Naruto back but, at the same time she didn't want to lose Kushina. It wasn't just because Kushina was the first real <i>'girl'</i> friend that she had ever had. No, it had more to due with the fact that as wrong as she knew it was, she was starting to look at Kushina in the same way she had looked at Naruto. Kushina, just like Naruto, made her feel better about herself; she made her feel that no matter what happened she could be strong too. The fact the she was so beautiful didn't really help to keep Hinata from gazing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the shopping... Kushina just had to try on all these different clothes that accented her goddess like figure and pose in them for her. Hinata idly wondered if Kushina knew what she seemed to be doing to her? During their time together, Kushina had taken every excuse she could get to brush against her or hold her. It felt wonderful and yet... Hinata didn't like how the slightest touch seemed to make her body burn with this odd want. It had only taken half the day together but Hinata realized what that burning was. Lust. Lust and desire. Hinata felt disgusted with herself. She was desiring the touch of another girl. Not only that but it was an older beautiful woman that her body craved, one that Hinata cherished as a friend. Why would someone as beautiful as Kushina want to do such things with her? She wasn't pretty, she didn't have a wonderful hourglass figure (at least she didn't think so), and most of all, she was nothing but a child in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata struggled to hold back the hot tears at these thoughts. It wasn't right for her to feel this way about a girl, much less one that was older and so much more beautiful. She would always cherish this day but, right now, she wanted nothing more then to curl up in some corner and cry about the unfairness of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never noticed the knowing look that passed through her red headed companions eyes.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina wasn't a mind reader but, she didn't need to be to see what was happening with her little friend and future lover. She decided not to bring it up while they where out and about though, so the sex goddess skillfully maneuvered things so that she'd have an excuse to bring the girl home with her. It hadn't taken much pushing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time inside Kushina's apartment it was decided that they should take a bath as running around and enjoying themselves had left both girls rather sweaty. Well in truth, Kushina was the one to decide they need a bath together, Hinata's sputters and protests had been ignored in favor of seeing that adorable blush. Soon enough, Kushina had striped both of them down to their birthday suits, making poor Hinata so embarrassed and nervous that she nearly broke down in tears. Kushina hadn't ment to scare the poor girl but, even as Naruto she had always found a warm bath enjoyable and she hoped that she could use the bath to help Hinata relax. Not to mention Hinata needed to be comfortable seeing her naked before the redhead could even try to show her the joys and pleasures that another girl could give you. Getting to see that mouthwatering young body with its creamy white skin, surprisingly large breasts for a girl her age topped with a delightfully pink nipple, like a cherry on top of a scoop of ice cream, and squeezable looking tush had simply been icing on the cake when it came to this part of her plan.</span></div></div>",

It had taken a few minutes but, Kushina had finally gotten Hinata to calm down and even got to wash the girls back! Kushina swore that if she had been closer to Hinata's current age then there would have been very little keeping the redhead from taking the chance to fondle the shy girl. Hell, she might have just gone ahead and made love to her. Sadly, the age gap would only serve to scare Hinata if Kushina had tried such a thing. The fact that Hinata seemed to be fighting with herself about wether or not she should acknowledge that she had feelings for another girl would've only made it worse. If Kushina had been closer to Hinata's age then she could get away with it, saying that they where girl bonding and experimenting like all girls that age did. Sadly that was not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf opening an eye, Kushina peeked at the shy girl who seemed to be tense and trying to take up as little space as possible in the tub by curling in on herself. Now that just wouldn't do. \"So,\" began the redhead as she had to fight back a frown at seeing Hinata jump. It was as if Hinata expected to be hit or something. Why she would expect that bothered her as the girl had done nothing to deserve such treatment. Kushina made a mental note too be on the look out for any other odd signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anything new or exciting happened while I've been gone?\" True it wasn't the best start but, it was only meant to help break the ice and get Hinata to start relaxing before Kushina started probing the girl and get her to admit what was bothering her. \"N-no. Nothing wort-th not-ting.\" Squeaked out the nervous preteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame,\" admitted the woman as she leaned back a bit more, inadvertently pushing out her massive E-cup breasts. Kushina nearly smiled as she saw the shy girls eyes immediately lock on to her soft yet firm bosom. It was just so cute seeing the girl try and fail to look away from her chest. Kushina made note of how curious the girl seemed to be about them and would be sure to use it to her advantage shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of soaking and idle chitchat, Hinata seemed to finally relax enough to start asking the questions. \"Ano (Um). . . Kushina-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally smiling and cheering at the small victory, Kushina was quick to answer. \"Hmm, yes Hinata-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ano...\", squirmed the young girl, clearly not sure if she should really ask this. \"H-how did you adjusted to t-turning female so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina gave the poor thing a small smile, letting her know that she not only didn't mind the question but, encouraged her to ask more. \"Now who ever said it was easy? I've lived for twelve years as a boy only to suddenly find myself turned into a voluptuous 21 year old MILF.\" Kushina giggled at how Hinata squeaked and turned bright red at hearing what the older woman called herself. \"To be completely truthful Hinata, being a female feels pretty good.\" Her smile then filled with mischief, \"Besides, it gives me an excuse to feel myself up. I mean look at these babies!\" Emphasizing the last statement by cupping her breasts, her hands nearly getting lost in the soft and supple flesh and giving them a good jiggle just for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's \"Eep!\", was soon followed by Kushina's giggles as Hinata tried to hide her red face in her hands. Sadly for her, the image of Kushina playing with her supple mounds was one that Hinata knew would be visiting her in her dreams tonight. After a few minutes Hinata finally calmed down, though her face was still bright red and she refused to look at Kushina out of fear that her wandering eyes would start to stare. \"W-was it. . .scary? The changing I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . At first. . . I mean it's not everyday that a boy suddenly finds his hair turn red or breasts start growing from his chest... but after a little time, I eventually realized that I wouldn't change back into a guy, so I better get used to it. You visiting me before only helped to make me see that being a girl wasn't all that bad.\" Hinata seemed shocked at the last part but, slowly her shock melted away into a small smile. The girl couldn't help but, feel all warm inside at the words her once-secret-crush-now-highly-attractive-woman had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you say we talk about something a bit more important? Like how I know you are sneaking looks at me? Or maybe we should talk about why you seem so depressed at feeling attracted to an older woman?\" Suggested Kushina. For Hinata it was like her world had suddenly come crashing down. Kushina had noticed and now Hinata was sure that the woman was going to yell at her or tell her how disgusting it was that she was crushing on a girl. Then Hinata would get thrown out and lose the first close friend she'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what Hinata had expected would happen. So when she felt Kushina wrap her in a warm hug, full of kindness and understanding it had shocked the poor girl to tears. \"It's alright Hina-chan. It's alright. There's absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed or ashamed about your feelings.\", whispered the woman as she held the sexually confused girl close while running her hands through her soft hair. It wasn't long before Hinata felt better but, made no move to leave the warm and accepting embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hina-chan, there is no shame in you finding another girl attractive, nor is it unusual that you are feeling so confused or even curious. These sorts of things are natural. So please no more crying. The only tears that should ever fall from those pretty full moon eyes are tears of joy and pleasure.\", cooed Kushina. \"I know a way we can sort this all out if you want?\" Offered the redhead causing Hinata to look up at her in hope. \"I know that your curious and the only way it's ever going to leave you alone is if you satisfy that curiosity. So how about this. You stay over here tonight and you can try out anything that comes to mind with me. It will be our little secret until you feel like share it with others. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked up at the woman, her friend and source of all these confusing feelings; and the goddess that was offing to let her have free rein to do to her body anything that she wanted. Hinata knew that anything that happened between them would never be heard of from Kushina and if she didn't like doing these things to a girl then at least she'd finally have some piece of mind. But still! \"Y-you want me too...\" Whispered the girl, shocked that this beautiful woman would even make such an offer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Kushina took the girls tiny hands and placed them against her massive breasts, causing the younger girl to blush once more. \"I want you to do whatever you want with my body and too enjoy yourself, I know I sure will.\" Hinata had nothing she could say to that, so with an unsure glance at Kushina's encouraging smile Hinata gave a soft squeeze...</span></div></div>",

M-Me!?\" Hinata stammered out with her face going from a light pink to a soft red blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'SOOOOOOOOO CUTE!'</i> Kushina squealed in her head again. \"Of course Hina-chan, you really shouldn't sell yourself short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Hinata got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina nodded as she kissed Hinata's forehead again. \"Really. I mean it Hina-chan.\" Kushina waited a few moments to allow Hunata to calm down before continuing. \"So... Is there anything else you'd like to try?\", she asked while leaning closer to the rapidly reding girl. \"Or do you just want to keep playing with my boobs?\", the aroused older woman whispered into the impressionable young girls ear. Hinata nearly fainted at both the question and the level of lust that even someone as inexperienced as her could easily pick up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what other kinds of things are th-there?\", asked the girl as she desperately tried keep her body under control. A difficult thing to do when ones own body is reacting to the lust of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was surprised at the response Kushina had given her. So surprised in fact that it took a few moments for her mind to catchup with what was happening. Lips, soft and enticing, were pressed against her own. Even though it only lasted for a few moments, it felt like an eternity to the young girl as her brain slowly rebooted from the unexpected kiss. Then Kushina pulled back and Hinata felt a sense of loss fill her as their lips disconnected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Hinata raised a hand up, brushing her lips gently with the tips of her fingers. The tingling sensation on her lips left behind from the kiss left her speechless. Lifting her eyes upwards, Hinata locked sights with the beautiful red haired woman that had just taken her very first kiss, confusing made apparent in her questioning gaze. Kushina giggled at the look and swooped down, claiming the young girls lips once more, this time in a slightly more passionate manner when compared to the small peck from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon pulling back Kushina spoke, \"Hina-chan, your such an adorable girl. I can't believe I never noticed it when I was a boy. I clearly must have had brain damage to have not seen you before. But now I do and I don't plan to ever let you out of my arms.\", admitted the older woman as she moved Hinata so that she was sitting on her lap. Kushina was most pleased to see Hinata make no move to stop her as she pulled the younger girl into her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she realized the position she was in, poor Hinata blushed so hard that she nearly turned purple. In truth, Kushina was a little worried at the sight as she couldn't help but, fear that the poor girl would die from blood loss with all the blood rushing to her head. The red head decided to simply wait and let Hinata get use to this before for she continued on. Kushina was very curios to see where Hinata would draw the line and ask to stop. Till she did, Kushina planned to try and go as far as she could with the girl. She doubted that she'd get the young girl to sleep with her tonight, unless it was truly just sleeping but, Kushina admitted that the girl may end up surprising her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe a little oral play once we really start off? She's a bit to small to try 69 position but, that will come once I manage to age her... Hm, come to think of it, I wonder if she even knows what masturbation is? She's so innocent that I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't.'</i>, thought the woman as her hands started to unconsciously wander and gently explore the young girl in her arms. Hinata's startled <i>'eep'</i> followed by burying her face in the woman's bosom snapped Kushina back to the present. Almost immediately seeing what the cause was, Kushina couldn't help but tease the shy girl a little. \"What's wrong Hina-chan? Do you not enjoy this?\", she asked in an innocent manner while giving the soft skin in her hand a small squeeze. Hinata's only response was to release a small whimpering moan into the breast as Kushina fondled the girls rump with one hand. <i>'Who would have guessed that she was so sensitive?'</i> the woman cackled inwardly. She was going to have so much fun teasing the poor girls body in the nights to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Kushina realized that they would need to get out of the water soon or they would end up all pruny. \"Hina-chan,\" whispered the woman into the girls ear, \"we are going to be getting out of the tub shortly. Is there anything else you'd like to try? If not, then I plan to show you a few things we can do together. It will be a hands on method of learning though.\" She gave the girl a few moments to think while continuing to play with the girls presently soft yet, firm rump. \"Which shall it be my dear?\"</span></div></div>",

No, she was not alright for two simple reasons. First was that she was horny as hell for her sweet, lovable Hinata. The raging fire burning deep within her core could only be quenched by the loving touch of her soon-to-be lover and future mother of their children. The second reason was that she did not have this adorable girl panting and moaning in her bed, yet. If she played her cards right, maybe she really could get a night of sexual bliss and passion with the younger girl. It all hinged on being able to gently nudge Hinata into the act without scaring the poor girl. Could she pull it off? Kushina certainly thought so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina turned her heated gaze upon the younger girl she so desired with all she was. Even now, with that innocent face and concerned expression the sight of Hinata only proved to tempt the redhead all the more. Without thought or warning Kushina soon found herself holding the startled girl close to her; their soft lips pressed together like they were meant for each other. Idly Kushina also noticed that both of them had somehow lost their towels during the spur of the moment make-out. Feeling Hinata's arms wrap around her neck as the younger girl started kissing back Kushina smiled and allowed one of her hands to squeeze that young supple tush as she ran her tongue across the girls lips. Hinata squirmed in her arms in response as Kushina easily carried the girl back to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the aforementioned room Kushina climbed into the bed, never once removing her attention from the younger girl she was currently in the middle of a tongue war with. Gently lowering herself forward Kushina settled herself over the young girl making sure to position her arms and legs so that she wasn't placing her whole weight on to the smaller girl. Hinata might be strong for her age, but having someone of Kushina's size laying their full weight on top of her could still hurt the girl. Finally Kushina and Hinata parted but neither tried to move their lips further then a few inches, both girls wishing that they didn't need to separate just to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow!\" Kushina giggled gently at her soon-to-be lovers reaction to their first makeout kiss. Hinata's face was flushed a pinkish-red while her beautiful and innocent lavender eyes seemed glazed over as the younger girl tried to come down from her blissful high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's just a small taste of what I plan to do with you my dear.\" The lust and desire practically radiating off the red haired goddess. Her words however brought Hinata back to the present, making her fully aware of her current position under her friend and maybe-love-interest. Her nervousness immediately returned full force as she wondered what the red-haired beauty planned to do to her.</span></div></div>",

He continued walking, and when he heard it again he couldn't help, but growl this time at the noise in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It has to be the bastard that pranked me this morning!'</i> Naruto assumed, thinking that was the reason why he heard it. <i>'Forget a 100 Fold!

It wasn't much at the moment, but it was clear that they wider then what they were a while ago. His butt also began to swell slightly along with his thighs, not that their growth was anywhere near noticeable at the moment. The budding lumps on his chest grew slowly, that by the time that he finally got to the training grounds, his chest now had small A-cup breasts that were still growing slightly larger by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that he noticed as he walked closer was that everyone else was already there, even Kakashi to his surprise. Naruto sighed as he knew that he was about to get chewed out by Sakura and maybe even Kakashi-sensei. As he walked closer to them he stopped suddenly, and stared at his teammates and sensei. Something seemed...different about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Was there something different about them?)</span></div></div>",

His butt had also swelled slightly along with his thighs, not that their growth was anywhere near noticeable at the moment. He also had budding lumps on his chest that slowly grew larger, and were currently large A-cup breasts that were roughly the same size as Naruto, and were still growing larger by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help, but begin to laugh. When it wasn't him it was kinda funny. \"What happened to you teme?

If he didn't manage to get a few luck hits near the end of fight then he would've lost. Kakashi congratulated them both, and was amazed at how well Sakura used her new sword and promised her that he would get his friend to help train her as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her loss she looked quite happy about that. To his surprise Sasuke had asked him if he was okay at the end of the fight, and looked at him almost as if he cared for him. He awkwardly replied yes and Sasuke nodded his after a few moments of taking in appearence and looking for any signs that he was hurt. Naruto noticed that Sasuke seemed a little older, as if he was around his mid to late-teens.His body looked like it had more muscle and facial features were sharper, and looked slightly older. After that Kakashi began their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the training Naruto needed to stop to adjust his clothes, because of how uncomfortable they were getting, not paying much attention to himself to actually notice his transformation, if he was less enthusiastic about his training and payed more attention to his body then he surely would've noticed his body's change, and the growing weight on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour passed Naruto's feet had finished changing, and were now cute feminine feet.His legs had grown taller as his thighs had plumped up until they were twice as big, leading up to a set of wide sexy hips, and a small sexy slim waist, his butt was almost down growing. The only real sign left of his former gender from the waist down would be his male genitalia, but that would soon be gone as well. In all he had a sexy lower half that get much attention. Throughout the hour his breasts had grown into C-Cups as well, and added quite a bit of weight on his chest, and were still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't the only one that had changed in the hour that had passed however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the hour Sakura's skin had paled slightly as her figure got more defined, her figure growing. Her hips grew wider as her legs and thighs did as well,they were bigger Naruto's though not by much, and her butt had grown larger as well, she now had quite the blimp of a rear. Just like Naruto's her breasts were now C-Cups as well, and just like Naruto's were still growing, but they were slowing down now and would soon reach their final size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto noticed her changes though, and wondered if it had anything do do with her sword. Her face and eyes were still roughly the same, but he wondered how long before they changed as well. He noticed Sasuke looking at him and then looked over at Sakura, who hefted her sword over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, make sure that Naruto gets home alright,\" Sasuke said, though it sounded more like a order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto demanded. He heard Kakashi giggle and looked over at him, wondering what was going through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will,\" Sakura said, nodding her head, surprising Naruto, who gaped at her. \"I'll make sure that Naruto-sama get's home safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything else to refute that Sasuke and Kakashi left, leaving a mentally stunned Naruto at what she just called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto-sama? When did she start calling him that? And why did she start calling him that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wish to do now Naruto-sama?\"</span></div></div>",

His finger nails grew and fingers looked more petite as the skin on is arms and the rest of his upper body was smooth to the touch. The fat seemed to have gone straight to his breasts, because they quickly grew from a C-Cup. into a small D-cup and were growing quicker then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he enter Konoha he felt a great pain hit his crotch, almost as if he was being stabbed with a hot knife and quickly put his hands down there, along the way his hands collided with two large mountains on his chest. He wondered what it was and looked down and saw two large D-Cup breasts that were still growing before his eyes, and his jacket and shirt were having a hard time containing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitantly grabbed one of them and gave it a light squeeze and moaned as a surge of pleasure went through his system, causing his pert nipple to erect. Needless to say that whatever doubts that he had about them being his own were gone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at a nearby window and ran closer to see his reflection, and for a moment thought that he saw that girl, but saw several differences and realized that it was his own. His lower body would soon be exactly the same as the girl in the reflection this morning in a few moments if he guessed right.His face was still his own, but it was softer then it was this morning and his whisker marks looked fainter. The breasts were also not quite as big, but he knew without a shadow of a doubt that they would be as big as the reflection's if they were given enough time, because they were still growing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the organs inside his body change as his balls turned into ovaries and were sucked inside of his body. He felt the last of his male genitalia go inside and now felt a slit in its place, female genitalia. He was no longer a boy. He was a girl now. A she. She felt her throat hurt a little and reached up and felt that were adam's apple was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and looked over her shoulder to at her butt in the mirror, which was now quite the large bubble butt, and was almost comparable to a blimp. Her butt was huge! And her pants didn't do anything to hide it, in fact it would be more appropriate to say they empathized her large butt, and it would be appropriate to compare her pants to a pair of small yoga shorts that were several sizes to small. They clung to her rear almost like a second skin and showed off how big her butt was and even showed the top of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped and gave his butt a light smack and watched the mounds of flesh attach to her waist jiggle until they stopped a few moments later. She gave out a small faint feminine moan, and realized what had changed about her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even my voice now?\" she said, her new voice was sensual, but also had strength behind and a aristocratic tone to it, as if she was a noble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-sama is something wrong?\" Sakura asked. Naruto eyes widened even more when he noticed that her face had changed as well. She now had softer features and higher cheek bones, not only that, but unlike Naruto her breasts had finished growing as well and were now large, perky, D-Cup breasts, that were now smaller then her own bust. The only thing that Sakura's new form had that bested her own would be in the butt department which was bigger then her own. The only thing left to show of who Sakura used to be was her eyes which were still green emeralds, but he doubted that they would last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Will he look for help, or head home and see if he can find the scroll.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly took of running, back to her apartment to find the scroll to look for it, and then it bring to to the Hokage, no doubt she could fix this and turn her back to normal. There was no doubt in her mind that her sudden action surprised Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-Sama!\" She heard Sakura call after her, but ignored her as she continued to run home. She wasn't Rias her name was Naruto, but she knew that she meant her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she actually knew what had happened with her body the small bounce that she felt was more like a large one now. It kind of hurt the way that her breasts bounced up and down now without any support. As she ran she found it rather hard to breathe and lowered the zipper of jacket, showing a lot of cleavage. Her shirt was barely able to keep her breasts from flying all over the place, but her perky nipples were pointing through her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran she could feel her face changing and brought one of her delicate hands up to her face and felt whisker marks fade away until they were completely gone, as if they were never there in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help, but gape at the large mansion that was there in place of the old apartment complex where she used to live back when she was a boy.<br>\r\nThe old apartment complex that she used to live in was now replaced with a large mansion with many windows with a iron fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the pressure on her breasts finally stop getting larger and looked down at her breasts and felt that they had finally stopped growing and were now massive E-Cup breasts. She let out a sigh of relief, glad that they had finally stopped growing, but still wished that they were smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-Sama!\" She heard Sakura call. She looked over at her and could see the worried expression on her face. She noticed that the last vestige of Sakura's appearance was gone now, and her eyes were now a piercing dark-yellow. \"Rias-Sama, why did you take off like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast Naruto decided to roll with it for now and remembered her outfits struggle to contain her new body and decided to use that as an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Rias trailed of as she looked down at her outfit, but could only really see her massive valley of cleavage, and blushed a little. Sakura was quiet for a moment and then really looked at her outfit and blinked when she realized just how revealing her current attire was on her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rias-Sama I understand now,\" She stammered, realizing why she took off now. \"Last thing you want to do is give any perverts any ideas and let them try to cope a feel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no i don't Sakura-Chan,\" she laughed weakly as she rubbed the back of her head sheepishly. To her surprise Sakura sighed at that for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-Sama, my name is Xenovia now,\" 'Xenovia' said. \"I haven't gone by Sakura in years, not since you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still be Sakura to me,\" Rias said. \"No matter what you go by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Xenovia said as she rolled her eyes. \"I have to remind you of that occasionally despite my protests.

Unlike her old room this was one filled with books, a chess set, and some movies. It looked more like a tomboy's then a normal girl's room from the color and the belongings, something that he was happy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the dresser and took off her ill-fitting clothes, and let a sigh of relief, glad to have those clothes off of her from how tight they were. She pulled out a  black bra and panties and put them. The panties she had no trouble with, but when she tried to get the bra she had quite a bit of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble again Rias-Sama?\" Xenovia asked, no doubt smirking from her predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" She said blushing. She heard Xeovina come over and grab the clips of the bra and hook them, causing them to stay. She sighed in relief happy that her breasts wouldn't be bouncing all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you should get dressed Rias-Sama,\" Xenovia said. \"We have plans to meet up with some of the other rookies later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias made her way to the closet, and was annoyed that despite her bra her breasts still bounced, but not as much. She opened the closet and found a set of clothes she was willing to put on. She pulled out a short-sleeved white blouse and a pair of blue shorts that went up to her mid-thigh. After she got them on Rias let out a content sigh, happy to finally have clothes didn't feel like they were crushing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard knocking coming from the door and turned toward it. Rias wondered who it was. Could it be a servant or something? She could believe that since her new and identity seemed to be that of an heiress or noble lady because she seemed to own this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that must be one of your parents or the servants,\" Xenovia commented, not noticing Rias stiffen at the word parents. Xenovia made her way to the door to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who was it at the door?)</span></div></div>",

She moved to the side and let her parents enter the room and Rias could only gape at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked a lot like her, and could only be her mother. She had a slender, but feminine build, with fair skin, and large E-cup breasts that were around her own size, violet eyes, and the same fiery red hair that she had that went down to her waist. She wore a a plain grey dress that had black lace around her shoulders. The woman was beautiful and definitely a head-turner, but it was the man next to her that caused her to gape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The Fourth Hokage!'</i> She thought amazed as she stared at her hero.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had her old spiky, blond hair and jaw-length bangs that framed both sides of his face. He wore a stylish black suit with a gold trim, a green flak jacket, blue forehead protector, and blue sandals. He wore a short-sleeved long white haori over his normal attire, closed in the front by a thin, orange rope. The haori was decorated with red flame-like motifs on the edges, with the kanji for \"Fourth Hokage\" written vertically down the back. He also had the same bright blue eyes that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xenovia I told you to call me by my name,\" Minato sighed. \"Not by my family name. Honestly I get called Gremory-Sama, Lord Gremory, and Minato Gremory enough at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies Gremory-Sama,\" Xeonovia apologized, causing Minato to sigh. \"I suppose that the servants or the seals let us know that it was us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seals,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina ignored the two as she made her way to Rias with a bright lovely smile on her face, that pulled at Rias's heartstrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-Chan its good to see you,\" The older redhead said smiling as she hugged her daughter tightly, and unintentionally pressing her own impressive rack up against Rias's own impressive bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias didn't say anything and just hugged her mother back. As she hugged her she felt a strong warmth go through her body, unlike anything that she ever felt before in her life. She felt so....happy. She loved every second of the hug. It took all of her willpower to not break down and start crying right then and there in front of the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had a good day,\" she replied, smiling at her mother as she reluctantly broke the hug, a part of her wanted to hug just a little longer. <i>'Aside from the fact that I've turned into a girl.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, no one tried anything that they shouldn't today did they?\" He asked, and from the tone it sounded like he was ready to destroy someone if they did. Kushina didn't say anything, but seemed to smile in agreement with her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no,\" Rias replied. \"No one tried anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear my little Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess,\" Minato said as he hugged her and kissed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did training with Kakashi go?\" Kushina asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias and Xeovia told them about what had happened throughout their day and what had happened during their training session. Rias left out her transformation from her old male body, because they would no doubt not believe her and they would probably think that she was going crazy. Rias enjoyed the little talk with them because of how much they genuinely loved and cared about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get going now Rias-Sama. We don't want to keep the others waiting now do we?\" Xenovia asked. Rias didn't know what she meant but she guessed that it must be a meeting with her friends or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no we don't,\" she replied weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good time with your friends now princess,\" Minato said, scratching her head affectionately. Just like the hug, Rias enjoyed that as well and felt the same warmth from earlier, and couldn't help but smile brightly. Was this what it felt like to be loved and have family? If it was, then would enjoy every minute of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good time dear, I love you,\" Kushina said, as she hugged her once more and kissed her cheek. Just like the first time it took all of her willpower to stop herself from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a jacket in case you get cold dear,\" Minato said as he held out a black and orange jacket for her. She grabbed it and put it on. It was large enough to fit her comfortably and she reluctantly followed Xenovia out of her room, even though a part of her wanted to stay with her family.</span></div></div>",

Just like her earlier Xenovia's outfit didn't change at all when she transformed, and her clothes looked rather tight on her, something that she was familiar with only a short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you should Xenovia,\" Rias said, sympathizing with her. \"I'll just wait for you  by the door while you go change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you,\" she said. Xenovia then quickly ran off to go change, while she made her way to the front entrance. She was lost in thought as she made her way to the front door and stopped when she was in the entrance hall. After her changes she gained a new home, a family, everything she ever wanted and then some. It was all quick to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria-tan!\" A male voice called out breaking her out of her thoughts. Before she could do anything she was pulled into a bone crushing hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need air!\" She said as she struggled with her hugger until she managed to push him off and breath again. When she did she saw his face she could only stare at it in surprise, because the man who hugged her had her old face, back when she was a man, back when she was Naruto. From they eyes, the hair, and even the whiskers. He wore a expensive looking black suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria-tan?\" He said, noticing her stare. \"Ria-tan is something wrong? Is there anything that your Onii-Sama could do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What oh sorry... Onii-Sama,\" she said awkwardly. \"I just have something on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no matter what it is remember that your Onii-Sama will be there to help you out,\" he said, laughing cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Naruto-Sama,\" a maid said, interrupting them. \"But Kakashi-Chan has arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but, stare at the transforming Kakashi. He, or more likely she, had gotten shorter and it seemed to have gone straight to her figure. She had a set of wide hips, slim waist, and a flat stomach, and her breasts were probably round the D range, and they were still quickly growing larger. Her hair was flatter then it was a while ago and seemed to flow all the way down to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned happily as he made his way over to her happily and cried. \"Grayfia-Chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Grayfia,'</i> Rias said, burning Kakashi's name into her mind, as Grayfia's breasts finished growing into F-Cups.. That's when Rias's mouth dropped and saw something on her finger. She saw a simple golden band on he ring finger. A wedding Ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-Sama,\" Xenovia said, bringing her out of her stupor. Rias turned saw that Xenovia's new outfit consisted of a black, skin-tight, short sleeved unitard that hugged her figure, with black pauldrons, matching fingerless gloves that extend to her biceps, and thigh-high boots, all of which are adorned with straps, underneath a white hooded cloak with gold and blue accents. \"I'm ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does something happen on their way to meet their friends or not?)</span></div></div>",

Rias turned toward where Xenovia was pointing and saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata retained her straight, hime-style haircut, but she had let her hair grow to reach her lower back, while the short strands that frame her face had grown to shoulder-length. Her figure had also grown to become much more womanly. She wore a loose fitting, lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour with navy blue pants and black, low-heeled sandals, and she still wore her forehead protector around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Tenten,'</i> Rias thought, recognizing who was changing into Akeno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with Sakura earlier, Tenten's body was changing as well. She still had her black hair, but it was much longer now, and was held up in a single pony tail that reached all the way down to her legs with two strands sticking out from the top and sloping backwards, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place. She wore traditional miko attire, consisting of a white haori with red accents, a red hakama, and a pair of z\u014dri with white tabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's body was now much more voluptuous then it was before, with sexy thighs and a smaller waist. Her shirt was pushed out as it struggled to contain her growing breasts, which were now currently C-Cups and still growing. Her hips were wider and her butt was growing bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Tenten saw them and made their way over toward them as Rias and Xenovia walked toward them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"Hello Onne-sama,\" Hinata said respectfully, smiling at Rias. Rias was surprised by how Hinata greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara, ara,\" Tenten laughed. \"Your happy to see your Onne-sama Hinata-chan aren't you. It's good to see you Rias-sama.Hope yo had fun today. I certainly did during my mission. I'll tell you more about it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten gave a smile to Rias that reminded her of that crazy snake lady that she met during the Chunin Exams. Rias shivered as a cold chill went down her back.

Rias followed Xenovia, Hinata, and the transforming Tenten as they led them to their usual meeting place. She wondered where they were going exactly, and as she did she couldn't help, but watch Tenten's transforming figure, her hips, and butt had grown larger, and her breasts were still goring if she were to guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stopped Rias's eyes widened when she realized that it was the hot springs. She had often tried to peep on here back when she was a boy, and had even used some of the women that he had seen to help make his Sexy Jutsu. They walked in and a middle aged woman by the desk saw them and smiled happily at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't some of my favorite customers,\" she said. \"Do you want the usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Akiko-san, four keys please,\" Hinata said, paying for their lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the keys for your lockers ladies, have a good time,\" Akiko said, smiling at them as she handed Xenovia the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Hinata replied as Xenovia took the keys. They walked into the changing room and Rias realized that they were going to go be naked soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the lockers and began to undress themselves and as they did they placed their clothes into their lockers. Rias noticed that Tenten's eyes had changed and were now violet instead of their usual brown color. Tenten took off her bra and let out a sigh of relief. Her bra had been rather tight lately and digged into her back and breasts, hurting her slightly. After she took off her bra Rias could tell that Tenten's breasts had finished growing into D-Cups, and continued to swell larger at a steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias looked and watched Xenovia's and Hinata's naked bodies and Rias blushed at the sight of all the naked flesh, the exposed breasts, and the secret gardens, to the point that her face matched her hair. For a moment Rias was glad that she didn't have any real indication on her body aside from her face to show what she was feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we waiting for?

He made his way to leave, but a glint of light hit his eyes causing him to cover and look at where it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw that the light was coming from underneath some bushes. He made his way toward it and moved the bottom of the bush reavealng that it was actually a hilt. He grabbed the hilt and pulled on it, pulling the rest of the object out of the bushes, revealing that it was a sword in a light violet sheathe. The sword wasn't particularly long, and it was unusually wider then most swords that he had seen and its handle was silver wrapped in a purple cloth, and its guard is as wide as its blade, with three small holes on both ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, a sword,\" Naruto muttered in awe. \"Did someone leave it out here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the sword and pulled it out of the sheath, revealing that the sword was longer than its sheath, and has the distinction of being completely hollow in the middle, essentially consisting of nothing more than the edges of what would otherwise be a normal sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get some sword supplies first,\" Naruto muttered to himself, but his stomach decided to make itself known and let out a loud growl, reminding him of how hungry he was. \"Or I could get it afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way they were rather close to one another and he could head straight to the other one after going to another. He placed the sword back in its sheathe made his way to leave the training grounds with a smile on his face, happy with what he had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him his fate was sealed the moment that he touched that sword and pulled it out of its sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Where does he go first?)</span></div></div>",

Along the way underneath Naruto's jacket his stomach began to flatten, and his organs began to rearrange and change themselves inside his stomach, causing some discomfort, but nothing that would stop him. He chalked the pain up to his hunger and ignored it as he walked faster to get to Ichiraku. The sooner that he got something in his stomach the sooner his pain would be gone.

You got it oldman!\" Naruto replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Teuchi was finished cooking his ramen Naruto eagerly grabbed it and began eating it like no tomorrow, and quickly passed through it as . As he ate his hair had grown a little longer and passed the tips of his ears and had gotten a little shaggier. As he was about to finish eating his meal his organs had stopped changing and rearranging themselves, and the pain that he had felt had stopped. When he was finished eating he let out a content belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the food old man!\" Naruto said as he payed for his meal and then left the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm stuffed to the blacksmith!\" Naruto exclaimed, making his way there to get some cleaning some supplies and maybe buy a sheathe that fits his sword.</span></div></div>",

He walked inside the store and saw Tenten working at the counter with a plain grey apron covered in soot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tenten!\" Naruto greeted as he walked to the counter. Tenten noticed his hair and just brushed it off, thinking that he was growing it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto what can I do for you?\" She asked. \"Wow nice sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I found it earlier and need some cleaning supplies, and maybe a new sheathe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, just give me a sec and I can get the cleaning supplies,\" She said as she went to the back of the store. After a few minutes she came back with a wooden box in hand and gave it to him.

Naruto payed for the items as his skin had finished changing and was smooth to the touch, and then shook her hand in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day Tenten!\" Naruto exclaimed as he left the store his hair starting growing down to the bottom of his and several large stands touching his nose. After he left Tenten looked down at the hand that had shook Naruto's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Did Naruto always have such smooth skin?'</i> Tenten wondered, remembering how soft and smooth Naruto's skin felt when she shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Where did Naruto go afterwards)</span></div></div>",

It was his favorite place to be in the entire village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began running to get there as fast as he could, and as he did he began to grow a little taller in height, his legs growing once more, but this time they began to take on a more feminine look on them as they nearly tripled in size.

As he made his way toward the monument his eyelashes grew thicker as his hair began to have several braids in it, finishing its change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the top of the monument he made his way toward the Fourth Hokage's head and and sat down on it as he looked over the village.

His feet thinned out and got more petite as his thighs built up and became a sexy pair of thighs. His ass grew larger and larger as it rounded up and took on a heart shape until it stood out like a shelf on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, this is good dattebayo!\" The boy declared happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next change happened between his legs. His penis and balls slowly got smaller and went back into his body, and as they did his balls turned into a pair of ovaries as his penis inverted into a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he finished his food as he laid back on the bed. \"Man that was good dattebayo.\" Naruto sighed out in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid down on the bed the growing mounds on his chest had finally stopped growing and were now large E-cup breasts. The massive mammies struggled against his shirt, making it hard for him to breathe as his nipples poked through his shirt, letting everyone see just how big and perky they were.</span></div></div>",

He kept trying to look for Kiba, but every time he tried to find him he got hit before he could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Tunneling Fang</u>!\" Kiba exclaimed and nailed Naruto in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Damnit!

Naruto moved to the left and dodged a punch that Kiba threw and then punched him in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I can see his attacks better!'</i> Naruto exclaimed mentally.

Naruto jumped and managed to avoid Kiba's attack. When Kiba landed Naruto charged at him and started to deliver punch after punch to Kiba.

As he made his way to the hot springs his legs began to change, and gain a curve to them. His feet shrunk and turned into a dainty par of feminine feet.

Naruto smiled brightly as he went inside one of free changing stations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hearing this, Ino could only squeal in joy. \"Yes! Naruto was finally getting it!\" She exclaimed in her head with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto put on the new outfit her stomach changed. Her stomach slimmed down, and become a flat sexy toned core, as his waist curved inward, and give her body the faint appearance of an hourglass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto came out of the stall. Ino could only gape in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Naruto had any breasts then the tube top surely would've showed off them off for all to see. Everyone could see her smooth stomach. The assless chaps let everyone see just how sexy and thick her legs were. Naruto smirked and spun around, letting Ino get a good look at his flat butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is a outfit!\" Ino exclaimed happily. \"It suits you perfectly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what they say! If you got it flaunt it!\" Naruto answered, getting a nod of agreement from the other blonde.</span></div></div>",

After Ino payed for her new clothes the two left the shop happily, and walked down the street.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thanks Ino for the clothes,\" Naruto thanked, smiling broadly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Ino replied. \"We need to do this again sometime, though I'm not paying.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto laughed in response, but then gasped in surprise as she she felt someone suddenly grab her ass, and begin to fondle it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the pervert roughly handled her butt, her hips begin to widen, and her butt begin to  grow larger. Her ass grew larger and larger along with her hips, making her hourglass figure more pronounced and noticeable. By the time it finished growing Naruto had a wide set of hips and a bubble butt that would cause heads to turn left and right to get a view of her ass. Especially because of how hard the bikini bottom strained against her booty, and the assless chaps let everyone get an eyeful.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto dropped her bags of clothing and grabbed the offender's hand tightly. The man let out a gasp of pain. Naruto looked over her shoulder and saw that it was a young man in his early 20's. Naruto smiled at him, and he shivered at the sight of it. Her smile then turned into a smirk as she squeezed harder, and he started to hiss in pain, causing her smirk to grow. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know that's quite rude of you,\" Naruto said sarcastically, only the faintest sign of a blush on her face. \"I could understand why you would want to cop a<br>\r\n feel. I mean just look at this booty! But didn't your mother teach you any manners?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe young man nodded his head, and her smile grew, and she said in response. \"Really? Well looks like I'm going to have to give you a rehash for her on why you keep your hands to yourself!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRight after she said that Naruto slugged him as hard as he could across the face, dislocating his jaw. The man easily fell down and Naruto kicked him in the nads for extra measure. The man groaned in pain, and Ino followed up by kicking him in the face for good measure.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You deserve that and more you pervert!\" Ino huffed as she crossed her arms under her bust.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

The men could only stare at her bouncing buttocks in wonder and awe. They could look, but so long as they didn't touch without her permission it was fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" Their significant others said angrily.

Before the change, <i>Naruto's</i> apartment was kinda broken down and shotty from not having anyone else living with her, but now it was different. It was cleaner, more fixed up and seemed a bit more mature, and feminine with brighter furniture, drapes, and cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home.\" <i>Naruto</i> got out as she hummed a cheery tune while she made her way to her room to put her new clothes away in the closet for now. She soon opened her closet and the contents inside were different, not that <i>Naruto</i> noticed these changes either. Before, her closet was filled with several black shirts and jumpsuits, but the clothing inside it was now clearly meant for women as it was now filled with several outfits that would clearly show off her body, such as smaller shirts, undershirts, skinny jeans, bikinis, and even bras, panties, and other such lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, <i>Naurto's</i> stomach growled, causing her to sigh in regret. \"Wow, for the entire day, I forgot to eat.\" She remembered really should've grabbed some Ichiraku's with Ino while she was still out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, guess I'll just have to raid my personal ramen storage for now!\" She then added in excitement to the thought as she then headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ino had arrived home as she headed to her room to pack her stuff.</span></div></div>",

She soon went over to her fridge and opened it as she looked for something inside to drink. Her eyes landed on the carton of milk and grabbed it. Before she took a sip she looked for the date, and was relieved to see that it hadn't expired yet. She didn't need a repeat of what happened on her first day as a Genin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. . .never again. . .\" She groaned out in remembering that event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto</i> then opened the carton up and began to chug the cool liquid down her throat. The moment that she did her nipples became erect as her chest began to grow. They grew larger and larger by the second as she drank more of the milk. They quickly passed the A-cup, and B-cup range, and continued to grow larger by the second. The growing mounds on her chest continued to grow larger and larger by the second, causing her tube top to strain against their growth, and the top of her growing cleavage to be revealed for all to see. Her breasts were now D-cup, and were passing into the DD-cup zone. She was nearing the end of the carton when her breasts grew into E-cups, and the moment that she finally finished the milk off her breasts had grown into large, perky, F-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the empty carton on the counter and sighed in content. The tube top valiantly held up it's mistress's cleavage, and gave everyone a great view of the top her mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh,\" <i>Naruto</i> sighed in content, not paying any attention to the large glorious mountains on her chest, and acting as if they were always there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good.\" She soon added in relief that her thirst was quenched. She stretched a bit and her bust jiggled up and down from the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>DING!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto's</i> head then perked up as she looked towards the microwave and smiled in excitement with stars in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAMEN TIME!\" She squealed with delight.

That popping represented Ino's growing hips.

She grabbed her breasts, and began to rub them. As she rubbed them her breasts began to grow larger and larger. They grew from their C-cup, and were soon D-cup, and quickly grew into DD-cup. Her breasts grew larger in her hands until she could no longer contain all of them. They grew into the E-cup range, and stopped growing when they became a F-cup. The same size as Leone's own bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can have some real fun with these photos.\" Ino admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Leone questioned, wondering what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could probably sell them to make some money,\" Ino revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like those model books?\" Leone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded in response to that. \"Yeah, we could be 'The Blonde Beauties of Konoha',\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that!\" Leone answered, grinning cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would,\" Ino giggled as she continued posing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone continued to take the pictures as she looked at her fellow blonde. \"We are indeed beauties.\" She complemented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno then went into what seemed to be a crawling position as she gave sexual smile. \"Yes we are.\" She replied. \"And it was well deserved.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is,\" Leone agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Leone's room, the purple gleam from her belt stopped.</span></div></div>",

I just knew I had to bring her along when I saw her.\" The blond punctuated this by tightening her hug around the slightly flushed Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly Naruto found her friends interaction amusing but she also saw how Hinata was more and more flushed in embarrassment at Ino's affectionate teasing. \"Alright Ino, that's enough. We all agree that Hinata is the most adorable of rookies. There's no need to squeeze her like one of your plush toys.\" Yes she'd admit that teasing Hinata while playfully telling Ino to stop teasing her was wrong. In her defense, Naruto and Ino really did think Hinata was the most adorable thing on the planet. It was actually taking everything she had to stop herself from joining in on hugging Hinata and screaming 'Kawaii' at the top of her lungs. <i>'She's just so cute when she blushes that I just can't help myself.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Ino was of a similar mind as a twinkle in her eye caught Naruto's attention. \"But Naruto-chan, she's just so Kawaii! And listen, she even makes adorable sounds when squeeze her just right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl could have stopped Ino if they tried, though Naruto honestly had no real reason to want to try. Before Hinata knew what was happening Ino had cupped her surprisingly large breasts through her jacket and gave them a squeeze. The sound Hinata gave off was something of a cross between a squeak and her normal 'eep' sound. Sufficed to say and resistance that Naruto had been hold against Hinata's adorableness quickly shattered with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAWAII!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata soon found herself as the meat in a busty blond sandwich as both girls hugged her close to themselves. She would have passed out if she didn't know that would only make things worse. So with a defeated sigh and a cherry-red face, Hinata buried her face in Naruto's bosom and simply tried to enjoy the moment of loving affection that her two closest friends lavished upon her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next hour or two, the girls laughed, joked and teased each other (mostly Hinata because the blondes found her reactions absolutely adorable). They were now in Naruto's bedroom wearing their sleeping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the three, Hinata was of course, the most conservative, wearing a full pajama set with pants and a thin, long-sleeved button-up pajama top. If the girls noticed that she wasn't wearing a bra underneath, they made no mention of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was showing off more skin than Hinata, with a pair of shorts that only reached halfway down her thighs and a pink top that honestly looked more like a training bra with how it only covered her chest, leaving her shoulders, upper-back and stomach bare. The top was still loose enough that the girl's still growing breasts had plenty of room to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first prize for most visible skin however, went to Naruto who was still wearing her black bikini bottoms, and a black low-crop tank-top shirt that would have been very loose on anyone else. On Naruto however, the cloth only barely reached down to under her ribs, leaving her luscious orbs so tantalizingly close to being visible. In fact, if Naruto stretched out her arms, the others girls would get a generous peek at the bottom of her massive mammaries. Her clothes showed the proof that Naruto was now fully female in form, not that anyone seemed to really remember that 'she' was once a 'he.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls,\" said Ino, pulling Naruto and Hinata's attention towards the other blond in the room. \"Now that we are all nice and comfy, how about we play some games? Maybe one of the classics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, who sadly, due to her clan, had never been to a sleepover before, was curious at what sort of games Ino was talking about. \"W-what did you have in mind?\" The poor girl had no idea what sort of horrors she may have just unknowingly unleashed upon herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I was thinking,\" from her bag, the blond pulled an object and slammed it down between the three girls. \"Truth or Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two stared silently at the bottle Ino had placed between them. A grin found its way onto Naruto's face. Though she had never actually played the game, she knew how it worked. <i>'This could prove fun.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, how do you play Truth or Dare?\" asked Hinata in a small voice, clearly feeling stupid for having to ask how to play. Thankfully, Naruto was quick to come to her rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, Hinata-chan. I only know how to play because I've listened in on it before. The game itself is very simple. A person spins the bottle and whoever it lands on has to choose either 'Truth' or 'Dare,' hence the name. If you choose 'Truth' then you'll be asked a question, which you then 'have' to answer truthfully. Similarly, if you choose 'Dare,' then you are given a challenge to complete. Dares can be very embarrassing or downright crazy depending on what limits you set up beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy then turned towards her fellow blond. \"And on that matter, I'd like to set some limits to what we can dare each other to do and add a little something to make this game more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling interested in what her friend had planned, Ino motioned for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I have two limits for dares. First, no dares that take us outside my apartment room. Second, no potentially life-threatening dares. I've heard some pretty stupid things like trying to balance on a kunai with your tongue, or eat a spoonful of cinnamon. If you want to make a person strip nude and do a funny dance then that's fine, but nothing dangerous.\" Seeing neither girl disagree, Naruto continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idea will require something, so give me a sec,\" she said as she got up and ran out of her room. Confused and curious, Hinata and Ino looked at each other, wondering if the other had any idea what Naruto was planning. Well Ino was, Hinata seemed to be on the verge of a panic attack at the idea of having to dance naked in front of her blond friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Knew I still had this somewhere. This is what we will be using,\" stated the sexy blond as she reentered her bedroom with a rather suspicious looking bottle and what looked like three shot glasses in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto-chan, is, is that...\" Hinata couldn't bring herself to finish as Naruto sat back down, a smile on her pretty face. \"Damn right! Hey, I figure if we're old enough to kill, then we should be old enough to be allowed to drink and get laid. Seeing as how we aren't planning on the latter, we can still do the former.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno looked at the bottle and the shot glasses with a look that said she was considering it. \"How does this fit into Truth and Dare, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's grin only seemed to widen. \"Simple. Whenever it's our turn, whether it be giving a question/dare or receiving said question/dare, we take a drink. So if I made a dare to you Ino, you and I would take a shot. Then on your turn, you and whoever is your target, take a drink. This simply continues till the game ends.\"</span></div></div>",

Shake it, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game had been going on for a little over an hour, and all three girls were getting tipsier by the minute. They were also starting to learn a few new things about each other. Like how Ino had lost her virginity a few months back to \"some guy named Kanto\" while on assignment in Amegakure, and had seen her teammate, Shikamaru, naked, and that he was every bit as twiggy and unimpressive \"down there\" as he was everywhere else. Or how Naruto was in fact <i>not</i> the mystery streaker who ran completely naked past the Hokage's tower all the way to the Naka Shrine half a year ago, but she was open to possibility of doing something similar in the future. And how Hinata frequently used her family's distinct abilities to literally undress people with her eyes. Or how Hinata had masturbated for the first time at the age of five. Or how Hinata was the proud owner of a vibrating egg. Or how Hinata did secretly harbor an attraction towards girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor Hyuga only ever chose truth, and she only ever revealed it in the quietest of whispers. Judging by the redness in her face that never went away, she completely regretted not taking the dare every time. She really wished they would take a shot of sake after they made their plays, not before, because she really needed a drink for every dark secret she unveiled about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, whatever gumption the blunette built up to take a dare fell off whenever the two blondes did some really crazy stuff. Like what Naruto was doing right now: a poledance for her girlfriends. Now, Naruto's apartment didn't actually <i>have</i> a pole for her to dance around, but she made due. She mimed the act of spinning around it, grinding her crotch into its slick surface while throwing her head back to pant loudly as if was really getting turned on, and clinging to the imaginary object as she shook her rump in Hinata and Ino's direction. She swayed her ass to and fro, letting the large luscious orbs of girl flesh jiggle lightly from the tight confines of her bikini bottoms, which were tight, left little to the imagination, and were sinking deeper and deeper into her cleft, exposing even more flesh for her captive audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, who had dared her into doing it, was acting appropriately, cheering Naruto on and throwing imaginary wads of cash at her friend as though they were really in a strip joint. Meanwhile, Hinata just watched on in quiet awe at how...free-spirited Naruto was. She was really a lovely girl, amazingly well-developed for someone her age, and she wasn't ashamed to show it off at all. Hinata wished she could be that confident and good-looking. Then maybe she'd be worthy enough for...for...ugh, the alcohol was making her brain hurt. If Hinata was anything like Naruto, then she wouldn't hesitate to go right up to her right now and GRAB THAT BOOTY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata liked to think she was disguising her emotions well enough, but Naruto saw through it. The sake was doing its work unhinging the usually reserved girl's rigidity. She might not have been hooting and hollering excitedly like Ino, but the tilt of her head indicated she was definitely interested in Naruto's dancing in more ways than one. As was the dopey grin nearly splitting her face in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's give them an encore then!</i> Naruto thought with a grin. She stood to her full height, spun around the imaginary pole one last time to face her friend. Then she reached for her top, pulled it off, and twirled it in the air before tossing it upward and letting it land directly onto Hinata's head while her now bare bosoms bounced freely out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'll be here all week!\" the former boy exclaimed as though she was addressing a crowd. Ino applauded her while Hinata absently pulled the tank-top off her head and stared at it, still wearing that uncharacteristic smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is going to be a hard one to top!\" laughed Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And on that note,\" said Naruto, who hadn't bothered to collect her top from Hinata and was more than content to let her girls get some air, \"it's time for another spin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hadn't paid attention to any of this. She was merely looking at the shirt in her hands. <i>Naruto-chan was wearing this. This had touched her breasts, brushed into her nipples. And now I'm holding it. Now I'm...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata,\" said Naruto, interrupting her thoughts. \"It's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga turned her attention away from the shirt and looked ahead to see the still topless form of Naruto extending a shot glass of sake to her. Knowing the drill, Hinata took it and downed the drink in one gulp, her throat no longer burning as the alcohol poured down her throat. Man, this sake was the stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'll it be Hinata?\" said Ino. \"Truth or dare?\"</span></div></div>",

She was a little drunk, but still mostly in control. And that meant she still wasn't ready to do a dare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could already sense the disappointment emanating from her two blond friends. She hadn't completed one dare at all tonight and she was becoming predictable. However, the frown on Naruto's face faded as a grin that spoke of both mischief and sensuality spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata,\" she said, shifting her position so that she was sitting on her knees with her hands on the ground like she was some kind of cat, a pose that displayed her naked boobs fully to the girl. \"Earlier, you said you liked girls, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga shifted nervously. \"Um, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto leaned forward a bit narrowing the space between her arms so that her boobs would squeeze more tightly together. The drop in Hinata's eyes on them did not escape Naruto's notice. \"Then will you tell us what <i>kind</i> of girls you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime froze for the Hyuga girl. What was she supposed to say to that? That she had been harboring a crush on the buxom girl before her for as long as she could remember? Or that she may have some feelings for the more slender Ino, who was quite pretty herself and, while she could be demanding at times, showed she had a good heart when she willing to help a shy insecure girl like herself? How would they react to those answers? With disgust? Would Naruto throw her out of the apartment? Would Ino want nothing to do with her? The blunette's mind was spinning at a mile a minute, but she had to think of an answer fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like blondes!\" she all but gasped, before seizing the bottle of sake and taking a very long deep draught of it. The bitter drink hit her with all the force of an anvil on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey!\" Naruto cried, pulling the bottle away with a pout. \"We didn't even spin the bottle yet! You're only supposed to drink that after it points at you!\" She shook the bottle to test how much was left. \"Hinata, you just downed three shots worth of sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked as the world started to turn hazy all around her. \"Um...sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno just smirked. \"Well then. I guess this means that Hinata's just going to have to take the next three turns for herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. That wasn't good. That wasn't good at all. Hinata hoped that she'd pass out before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Naruto, the devilish grin returning to her face. \"And I have just the right ideas of what they're going to be. Hinata, truth or dare?\"</span></div></div>",

She had been doing nothing but telling the truth all night, and already, just about every embarrassing secret she had was now known by these two, and what did she get? A lot of humiliation and some looks of disappointment. Well she wasn't gonna' do that anymore! Ino and Naruto, the two girls she was most attracted to, thought she was a wimp. Well, she'd show them! She'd take whatever they'd throw at her! If they told her to take off her clothes, then she'd get naked! If they made her eat a disgusting concoction of ramen, ketchup, kiwi, banana and lamprey brain, she'd ask for seconds. She was Hyuga Hinata, bitch! And she deserved respect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pairs of blond eyebrows rose in surprise. Ino and Naruto hadn't expected to hear that. But fortunately, the latter was fully prepared. After Hinata had downed that much sake, it was inevitable that she'd start to act at least a little bolder. And the blonde had a dare she knew the Hyuga would not refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. For this to work, I'm going to need you to sit on the couch there. Think you can manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded so heavily, her normally neat hair bobbed sloppily over her face. She pushed herself up onto slightly shaky legs and took a few short steps to plop down on the couch. Seeing this, Naruto pushed herself up, and sauntered straight over to the blunette with an exaggerated sway to her hips that did not go unnoticed before she sat down on the smaller girl's lap and straddled her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata bit her lip to suppress a gasp. Even in her inebriated state, the action caught her by surprise. \"N-Naruto-chan? Wh-wh-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply looked at her with hooded eyed filled with lust. \"Hinata, I dare you...to let me show you a good time.\"</span></div></div>",

Right when he was talking to lovely women. He loved his godson, but times like this gave him such a headache. \"What I wouldn't give for the little brat to see things my way. . .\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that thief!\" Someone called out, getting Jiraiya's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his sight, there was an elderly man on the ground as a masked man was running away from him with what looked like a scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya narrowed his eyes. He would've preered if it was a cute woman, but that doesn't mean that he wouldn't stop some idiot who thinks he could just steal from people. \"Alright then, it'll get my mind off of what happened.\" He casually said as he rushed after the thief with barely any effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flew back from the blow and skid for several feet. The man groaned and Jiraiya walked forward and pinched a nerve knocking him out cold. Jiraiya grabbed the scroll and looked at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you sir.\" The elderly man got out in graditude before he then recognized him. \"O-Oh my, your Jiraiya of the Sanin!\" He then got out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I see you know me,\" Jiraiya commented, smirking. \"I believe this is yours.\" He then stated as he handed him back his scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly man happily took the scroll back. \"T-Thank you Jiraiya-sama.\" He thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local shinobis soon came around and after a quick explanation and several eye witness accounts, they took the man away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the thief was dealt with Jiraiaya's mind went back to Naruto and he couldn't help, but let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong Jiraiya-sama?\" The old man asked with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking about my god child,\" Jiraiya muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldery man nodded to that. \"Ah, some kind of problem?\" He then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya sighed once more to that. \"Yeah, he just can't see things my way.\" He then revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh trust me I know the feeling well.\" The man replied with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya chuckled back to that. \"Sometimes I wish I could make that brat see things my way.\" He then admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed out loud and said. \"We all wish for that at times.\" The man put his hand into his pocket and revealed what looked like a black shiny gem. \"A friend of mine gave me this and told me that if you wish on this, then you're wish will come true eventually. Though I never used it to make a wish, just as a reminder of him.\" He then revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya chuckled more to that. \"That does seem to be far fetched.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right. He always did have a thing for his stories. Like you to have to have it for helping me out today.\" The man said, holding out the gem for him to take. \"Here', a reward for getting my scroll back.\" He then offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya then once more looked at the black gem. \"Are you sure about this?\" He then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have made the offer if I wasn't sure about it.\" the old man countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Jiraiya admitted. He then scatched his head. \"Alright then, I'll take it.\" He soon decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope it brings you some comfort,\" the man said. He left, leaving Jiraiya alone with his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya held the gem in his hand and rubbed it. \"Nah, there's no way. . .\" He said to himself with a chuckle as he held it. \"I wish that Naruto could see things more my way.\" He jokingly wished with a chuckle as he placed it in his pocket. \"Though I wish I had a nice girl who values a women's body like I do.\" He then muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto walked around he began to feel off for a moment. \"Weird dattebayo. . .\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What changes next)</span></div></div>",

If he knows Granny and is a disciple of the Third, then he has his stuff to be a teacher. So why doesn't he just help me? He said he is interested in me, but all he does is look at girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Naruto was a little angry right now is an understatement. Jiraiya was a great shinobi, but the boy couldn't understand why he was so obsessed with checking out women. It was true that the young jinch\u016briki wasn't exactly at the age where he would try to check out members of the fairer sex, but it was still aggravating for him that he seemed to pay more attention to random girls rather than his own pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around after calming a little bit, Naruto found himself in an unfamiliar neighborhood, as he was now in an area which he didn't really frequent as much. Coincidentally, it was relatively close to Ichiraku Ramen, his favorite hanging spot, but he was now a very good distance away from where he had his argument with Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... I ran too much and I don't know where I am. Well, I guess the place does look a bit familiar, so I should be able to get back to the main road eventually.\", murmured the boy to himself. As he looked around to familiarize himself with his surroundings, he noticed two older girls, probably in their early twenties talking with each other on the side of the street. What was special about them was that their outfits showed a good amount of their curves, as one of them put one arm under her bosom, emphasizing their rather large size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about girls that that the pervy sage likes to look at them so much?\" Normally, Naruto would just walk pass them without much interest, but the more he gazed at them, the more he found himself taken by their looks. When one of them was posing for a bit, and said something about buying new clothes to draw more attention, he couldn't help but feel a little attracted. \"Well... I guess she does look a little nice. Medium brown hair, pretty face, nice figure. I wonder if Sakura would look like that when she grows older.\", thought Naruto before he saw the girl put a hand on her chest, showing the outline of their breasts a bit. \"No, most definitely not. There's no way her chest will be that big if they didn't started growing until now. Maybe Ino or Tenten will be like that, although when it comes down to butt or hips, I don't know who will have them bigger... And the other one looks pretty nice too. Her chest is a little smaller, but the longer hair and smaller waist kind of makes up for it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to try to stop, or even notice Naruto checking the two girls out. Not even the young women themselves, as despite taking a few gazes at the boy, who was quite close to them, they didn't seem at all bothered, and continuing their conversation. As for Naruto, he was finding himself drawn more and more by the pair's figure, and was about to come closer to them, before stopping himself, and shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... weird. First I felt off for a second, and now this? Whatever, I am sure it's nothing. I should just keep walking until I get to some place I know.\" Before leaving, he took one more glance at the two women before he left, with a small, but a little perverted smile on his face. \"Although this whole thing with looking at girls might not be too bad actually. It is pretty fun... Perhaps I should apologize to the pervy sage when I meet him again...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he continued to walk, Naruto tried to take in his surroundings and saw that the place seemed to be a lot more packed with various stores then he thought initially. One would easily mistake it for the shopping district, but despite being quite far from the city center, the street was apparently frequented by people who had a bit more money in their pockets. In reality however, he couldn't really pay too much attention to what was going on around him, as he was a little lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since looking at the two women from before, he had a hard time not thinking about their figures. Soon, his mind wandered from the pair, to the girls he knew, and started to carefully analyze them based on appearance. There was a part of him that was genuinely confused why he was suddenly interested in the same things as Jiraiya all of a sudden, but he didn't seem to acknowledge anything alarming for the moment, and instead let his imagination free for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so Ino has a good shot in terms of butt, and the chest is kind of promising too, so I guess we will wait and see how it becomes. Tenten also looks like she has a good bust, but I doubt she will be bigger than Ino. Hinata is kind of a mystery, as she never takes off her jacket, but I am not going to take her out of the running just yet without taking a proper look at her first. And Sakura... yeah, not much to expect there. She isn't developed in any way anywhere, expect probably her hips, but her chest will most likely not grow too much, judging on her training. And she acts all cute and girly, but it's obvious how much of a tomboy she is underneath. It is kind of charming, but in terms of figure, she isn't really winning me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about his crush like that was something that uncharacteristic for Naruto. Normally, he would appreciate her good features such as her determination and care for her teammates, and would most likely than not omit most of the negative thoughts he would have about her during one of his daydreams. But now, he seemed a lot more keen on focusing on her physique, which seemed quite lacking. And paired with an attitude that one would most likely describe as \"tough as nails\", seemed to make the boy not feel as attracted to her as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, while it was subtle, the color of his hair seemed to lighten a little bit, while the spikiness of his locks was gradually going away. His usual greasy hair seemed to disappear, as his mane was slowly starting to look glossier and softer. In addition, his forehead protector was slowly shrinking as well, with the metal plate containing the emblem of his village becoming smaller as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, I know it is weird for me to think about all this stuff all of a sudden, but I can't really seem to stop. Is it really because of something the pervy sage said, or am I suddenly interested in girls look like?\", asked Naruto to himself as he wondered the origin of his new thoughts, before dismissing his worry. \"Nah, I am sure it's nothing really. Perhaps this might be a sign I am growing up, which is perfectly fine with me. Heck, perhaps the pervy sage can now talk more freely with me about what he likes in girls without the mood getting too awkward. And besides... I know the girls from class are all cute and all, but I think I know who that dirty old man is looking at. Granny Tsunade might need to lay off the sake more often is she wants to find a man, but in terms of body, I think she has no equal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" The sudden question broke his focus, just as he put on a perverted smile on his face, and turned around to see who called to him. </span></div></div>",

Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I asked my question first.\" With how neutral the replay came, Naruto couldn't help but make a small scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was just looking around this place for a bit before you came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? This isn't really a place I would imagine you spending much of your time at. Knowing you, I think you just had a fight with your mentor and decided to run away in frustration. After all, while I do like to stroll from time to time, I know for a fact you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the blond was ready to pop a vein. There was always something that irked with you Sasuke was talking, sounding almost he was getting scolded by him. He wasn't really wrong in his assumption, but there was no way Naruto would ever give his rival the benefit of goading about something. Judging by his expression, he wanted to hear a reply, most likely to then say he is too childish once again. He was about to say something back, when suddenly some of the irritation he felt evaporated, and instead of a yell, a sigh came out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I just... don't want to argue with you right now. It doesn't really matter why I am here, no? You said you came here to take a walk? Well, that's okay, I wanted to do that too. Let's just walk together until we get to the main street and not fight for five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" The Uchiha was left stunned a little by how his friend acted. He didn't expect Naruto to cool off so quickly or that he would propose to walk together, given their usual bickering. They weren't so bad as they were in the beginning, but Naruto seemed a lot more amicable than usual. Without much else to talk, the two slowly began to move once again. While his teammate was looking around at the shops, Sasuke kept looking at him with a little suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with him all of a sudden? It's very rare for him to not complaining about anything, and would rather rant about either me or someone else that annoyed him. But he seems a little more calm than I thought. Don't tell me this guy suddenly decided to act more mature... There's no way he would be thought something like that by Jiraiya. And was he thinking before I got here? He seemed to be quite distracted and... Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was a little confused by the fact that Naruto's usual spiky hair was now laying flat on top of his head, and also it looked a lot more taken care of than usual. And he couldn't see it just yet, as he wasn't looking down, but both his hands and feet started to shrink and slim down, but they didn't appear to lose any of its callousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to his hair? Did he use the wrong shampoo or was he pranked by someone? Either way, it is a little strange that he didn't say anything about it just yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sasuke was pondering about what was wrong, Naruto continued walking without paying much attention to him. He was for a second distracted when his sandals seemed a little big on his feet, but he quickly adjusted them without noticing the state of his feet. Once he was done, he took a small glance at his friend, as he gave another small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, why did he have to pop out like that anyway? I guess just walking around and doing nothing is something he would do, but even so... why did I have to meet the most antisocial guy from class around? I don't really mind him being here, but I wish he wouldn't be so critical all the time. And his attitude needs a lot of improving too. The guy doesn't even see that Sakura and Ino have a thing for him. I mean, I don't really mind him being someone who is uptight and whatnot if he could just be nicer. I want to be better friends with me as well, and I want to help him if possible... I just wish he would be a better person, who could understand me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he uttered those words in his head, he accidentally bumped Sasuke's shoulder. The next second, the young Uchiha felt a small electric current coming from where he was bumped, but paid no mind to it as he continued to walk. Since Naruto was a jinch\u016briki, hic chakra was a lot denser and stronger than normal, which made the effects of the original wish splash onto Sasuke upon contact, due to part of the chakra being released when Naruto made his wish. While certain details about Jiraiya's desire got onto him too, he was now mostly being influenced by Naruto, as he would soon fit the profile as the Uzumaki's best friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is this some kind of jutsu at work? That idiot either doesn't realize what's going on or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sasuke.\" The Uchiha's thoughts were stopped as Naruto turned to him. \"Mind if I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he tried to not look distracted before, and maintained a straight face, this time, Sasuke could only raise his eyebrows in wonder. \"What brought this up? Did she or Kakashi-sensei told you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it was on my mind for a while and I wanted to know. I just couldn't bring it up when the others were around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?... Well, other than thinking of her being our teammate who tries a little too much to be liked by others, who has issues keeping her calm and acting almost as childish as you at times, I am not sure what else is for me to say.\" It was kind of obvious where his stance on Sakura was, with the pink-haired shinobi being more of an annoyance to him than anything else. Naruto, who now was looking at him with a bit of anger in his eyes was about to say something, but Sasuke suddenly felt compelled to say something else. His voice cracked a bit at the start, and the words that came out of his mouth went an octave higher, but he didn't think much of it. \"I... I think however that she works quite hard and is quite studious. And her short fuse aside, her optimism is welcome. She has what it takes to be a shinobi, it's just that she's like a diamond in the rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure where the last part came from, but Sasuke suddenly saw a lot more good points in Sakura than before. He wouldn't exactly call it a change of heart, as he still found her short temper and aggressiveness a little too overbearing, but he was now thinking of her in a much positive light than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, Naruto grinned a bit as he was a little proud at how his friend finally said some good points about their teammate instead of the usual complaints he had about her. After chucking softly, he gave him a thumbs-up. \"There you go! It's nice to see you appreciate others for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do that after I evaluate them. Offering empty praise to someone is not something I like to do. I made those comments about Sakura after looking at her long enough to realize her better side, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you had your eyes on her? I take it you do have a thing for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. Just because she is a little likable doesn't translate to me liking her. But why are you asking this anyway? Do you have feelings for her and want to see if you have competition? I do recall you taking a few glance at her every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was the usual Naruto, he would immediately say \"yes\" in a heartbeat. But given his new tastes in girls, he wasn't so sure that was the case. \"...Maybe? I am not sure. I guess I kind of had a thing for her at the start, but it's not much right now. And those times you saw me looking at her? It was just to study her body figure. I wanted to make sure how good she would look in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That sounds really superficial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not even you would date a girl that doesn't look pretty, right? I know people say that looks aren't everything, but it doesn't mean they have no value. You have to agree with me that some of the other girls we know look more attractive than others, and I wanted to make sure who is better, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have spent a little too much time with Jiraiya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, perhaps, but that doesn't mean I can't have his tastes, you know? I just tend to look for something other than personality.\", said Naruto with a grin, while Sasuke only sighed and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't occur to the two that their usual bickering seemed to be a thing of the past right now. There was still a little bit of tension between them, but it was a far cry from their usual arguments. Sasuke also didn't seem bothered by Naruto's hair anymore, while his own mane started to grow, with his bangs straightening out completely and laying down flat on his head, while the blonde's still had a few unruly locks here and there. It also gained the same sheen as Naruto's as it now looked a lot more well-maintained than before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They continued walking, occasionally looking at the various shops that were on the street, neither expecting such variety in a district not so far from the academy. Naruto was also partially distracted by the girls that passed him, looking at their figure, and especially their breasts whenever he got the change without them noticing, while Sasuke, rather than looking confused by his friend's behaviour, he only shook his head, slightly exasperated by his antics. During this time, any strand of hair that was below their eyebrows fell off their bodies, leaving their skin smooth and peachy, with Sasuke's complexion tanned a little bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however, both heard a small growling coming from their stomachs, which made the two realize they were getting a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... Maybe I should have eaten more before I left. Should we go to Ichiraku Ramen and eat there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am also feeling a little famished but it is a little too early for lunch. Maybe we should stop at one of the food stores and look for something there. From what I've seen so far, the prices aren't too big, so the cost shouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Hopefully we'll find something good around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began looking around at the various street foods the vendors offered, taking note of both the aspect of the food, as well as the price. As they did that, neither noticed how they both started to grow a little. It wasn't too noticeable at first, but they both gained a few inches in height in the span of less than five minutes. This was because their bodies were maturing at a very fast pace, as they both grew up to fourteen years old. In addition, Sasuke's hands and feet changed the same way as Naruto's as they slimmed down considerably, before both of their calves tingled a bit as their muscles became a lot more compact and leaner, without losing any strength, and in the blonde's case, actually became stronger. This had the effect of making their clothes feel a lot smaller now, both of them pulling on them a little as they tried to make them less uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, both stopped at a vendor who was serving different types of dango at a reasonable price, with some people making a small line in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Skaruke? Are you okay with some dango?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I do Karugo. I hope they have some Chadango.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do you really like green tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I do have a little craving for it... But I am mostly curious how it tastes, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want, I am not going to stop you. I'll just go for the usual Anko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went to the line and patiently waited for their turn. Neither noticed the strange way they called each other a moment ago, because they both now firmly believed those to be their names. Their minds continued changing as they waited, as Karugo's wish to be Hokage and Skaruke's desire for revenge were both slowly getting less of a priority for both of them. Also, other than the blonde's new interest in women, he also began getting a little more perverted with his thoughts, idea of groping one sounding more appealing with each passing moment. As for the brunette, his darker and gloomier thoughts were getting rewritten with more positive ones making his expression look less sour the more he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there were only a couple of people left in front of them, they heard someone calling them. \"Naruto? Sasuke?\" Upon noticing the familiar voice, they were a little surprised when they saw who it was.</span></div></div>",

Seeing Naruto with wavy hair instead of his natural spiky look was indeed strange, but she would normally think it ended up that way due to one of his hijinks, but For Sasuke's locks to look as straight as they currently do was something she didn't see coming. She was about to ask if he was somehow roped in one of Naruto's plans before the blonde came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura, nice moment to drop in!\", said Karugo. \"Say, do you want some dango? We were about to buy some for a little snack. What do you say? I'll pay for you if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little taken aback by how her friend acted. He didn't seem as annoying as before, and seemed to take a manner of speech similar to Ino's, which made her wonder if something happened to make him look more upbeat than usual. However, her eyes widened as she saw how his features seemed to soften a bit, with his eyes being bigger and nose becoming a little smaller. But what was more strange was that his cheek marks started to fade away, the bottom one almost completely vanishing, and yet, he did not even seem to mind or notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took a look at Skaruke who stood back to keep the line and saw that like Karugo, his face looked a little more feminine. What was unexpected what that instead of the normal brooding, disinterested look he usually had in his eyes, the Uchiha seemed a bit more cheerful, seeing a small smile on his lips. Despite his face looking different, the idea of seeing her crush giving her a smile made her blush a little bit. However Karugo didn't seem to notice this and put a hand on her shoulder, which made her flinch a little as she felt a small spark coursing through her body, but was too distracted by the how close the blonde came to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice to ignore people you know? I know you like looking at Skaruke, but I wouldn't mind paying me a bit more attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karugo, please don't scare her, she just got here.\", said the brunette to his pal while crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sorry for being so direct Sakura.\", said Karugo a he scratched his cheek in embarrassment. \"I think I got a little ahead of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No worries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyway, do you want to eat with us? It's not going to be an issue, right Skaruke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. It would be nice if we could share a meal together. What do you say Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I accept...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! You should hurry and decide which flavour do you want fast though. They have plenty and the line is moving a little fast too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe absentmindedly nodded as Karugo lead her back to the line. Sakura managed to hide it pretty well, but there were a million questions running through her head right now. \"What's up with the way they are calling each other? Can't they hear how weird those names sound? And why is Sasuke okay going through with all of this? Even if this was some elaborate prank made by Naruto and he was somehow coaxed, there's no way he would act like nothing is wrong... And haven't they noticed that their faces are now more girly? Is this some new form of Sexy Transformation Jutsu they are practicing and they thought to test it?... Something really weird is going on right now. Perhaps I need to talk with Lady Tsunade later if this keeps going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Skaruke continued to take a few worried glances at Sakura, not sure why she appeared to be confused and flustered. Karugo shared his feelings, as he kept looking at his friend in slight bewilderment rather than worry. Neither were aware that their arms became smaller, as their muscles shrank a bit, but their shape remained mostly lean and toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why she's nervous all of a sudden. Is it really because Skaruke's around? It doesn't seem to be that way, as she didn't start bothering and clinging onto him just yet, but if it is that the case, she really needs to stop. I mean, he just said he only sees her as a reliable comrade, and I highly doubt there will something special between them. Skaruke's a bit guilty for not noticing until now, but Sakura has to get better at controlling her emotions.\", muttered Karugo under his breath, remembering the times when she would often pester Skaruke to show her more affection, while he got mostly ignored. In combination with how abrasive and short-tempered she was when she was barely angered, made the blonde shinobi why he actually got a crush on her in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of wish Sakura wasn't so emotional. I think that knowing when to stop having your feelings take hold of your thoughts is something she needs to learn. I am sure that more guys would be around her if she were like that. If that was the case, I would consider dating her despite her undeveloped figure... Heck, I would do that even if she was almost emotionless.\" Upon thinking that, since he already made contact with her, Karugo's changes also moved to Sakura, who like Skaruke, was going to become someone who fit his desire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura was pondering if she should just make up an excuse and leave. She was worried that either one of their jutsus, mot likely Karugo's, ran out of control somehow and is now affecting the boys, or what's happening is a result of an enemy's attack. If that was the case she could go to Tsunade or Kakashi and tell them about what's going on. But before she could talk, Skaruke asked her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, is something bothering you?\" Seeing her crush look at her with so much care and worry made her heart skip a beat for a second. While it was strange to see him with such a girly face, she couldn't deny that it kind of made her warm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, I am fine, it's just that you two look... kind of different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do? I don't think I did anything special to change my appearance. What about you Karugo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Of course not. Unless it's a special occasion of sorts, I don't see why I should change the way I look.\" He then turned to Sakura, as he put a hand on her shoulder \"Look, I don't know what exactly you saw that made you all flustered, but there is nothing out of the ordinary. If you aren't feeling okay, we'll help get you get some home to rest a bit. Just say the word, and we'll leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wasn't sure why Karugo was suddenly a lot more caring all of a sudden, but she couldn't deny that he acted more mature than before. But she didn't like how he suddenly felt a lot more normal to touch her so much. She didn't know if it was due to whatever jutsu was affecting him, but she wanted him to let her go. But then, she felt a small spark in her brain that made her thoughts change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was feeling of calmness that took over her once Karugo finished talking, making her feel more at ease. She no longer felt confused, panicked or flustered, as she was a lot more in control of her emotions than before. \"I-I am fine. Don't worry. I was just a little weirded out, that's all. I guess I saw you look different and I thought a jutsu was affecting you. But it looks like my eyes have been playing tricks on me.\", said Sakura in a more monotone voice, as the roots of her hair turned to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well we are both alright and fine, right Skaruke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we are. I am not sure why you thought like that, but I can assure you that there is nothing wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and if there was a jutsu at work, we would have at least notice when stuff started getting weird. So you can relax now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll take your word for it. I apologize for worrying you.Now, you said you wanted eat some dango with me? I was feeling a little hungry myself to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's more like it.\", said Karugo with a grin, to which Sakura replied back with a nod and a small smile while Skaruge looked at the two, relieved that the situation was cleared out and a bit proud at how Karugo made sure to calm down their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued waiting for a few more minutes before their turn finally came. The vendor welcomed them with a smile and let them take a look at his food before asking what they wanted. During this time, their forehead protectors disappeared, but in Karugo's case, only the metal part vanished, while the blue cloth that held it continued to become smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want three Chadango please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three Anki for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as Karugo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Don't you want to try something else? I mean, you do like sweets don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not in the mood for something sweeter right now.\", replied Sakura in a neutral tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vendor gave them their order, and after Karugo paid for them, the three headed towards a small bench where they sat to enjoy their small snack.</span></div></div>",

The guy selling them sure put a lot of effort in making these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they do taste very good. No wonder so many line up to buy his food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. He did an amazing job with the green tea as well. I would have liked to buy a few more, but I think we should pay close attention to our weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Skaruke, are you really going to worry we will get fat with the training we do? I can't really see us putting on a lot of weight from just a few dangos. Unless we're really pigging it out like Choji there's no way we can ever get so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make any remarks like that. I don't want to have such an image in our head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed a bit at Sakura's words as they all continued to eat. However, unbeknownst to them all, their bodies actually began putting on more mass as they ate. Their thighs slowly expanded as both muscle and fat were pouring into them. They could feel their legs become stronger, especially in Karugo's case, but while they looked good on Sakura, it was more than a little strange for the boys to have legs that seemed to belong to their girls. Also, they could feel like there was something else they gulped at one point other than the dango, which was in actuality their Adam's apples, and yet neither seemed to be perturbed by how their voices seemed to raise in pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Karugo, what were you doing here anyway? I don't remember seeing you around this district before.\", said Sakura as she took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of had an argument with the Pervy Sage about him not training me enough and then I ran out in frustration and got here by accident...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I feel like the reason for you leaving is tied to your shared hobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say it like it's an issue Skaruke? It's not like I go and yell how good a girl like do I? What do you say Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?... Oh. I guess I don't really mind it. Just don't be an idiot and stare too much or people are going to think to are much more of a pervert than you let others see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! And that's exactly why we got into a fight in the first place! I get it, admiring the good looks of a woman is something great, but he did that non-stop ever since this morning. What was all that practice for if he doesn't teach me anything? I was all fired up and ready to go and he isn't even in the mood for it. If it was going to be a \"looking at girls\" training he should have said so from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me not to ever join you on one of your sessions... I swear, for someone who was Tsunade's teammate at one point, you would think he would act a lot wiser than he does. And yet, for him to act so perverted and shameful around women...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to jump in, but Tsunade's also quite the alcoholic and is almost always disinterested in work. Perhaps these are just their quirks and leave it at that. I am not really interested what are they usually thinking anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fair point I suppose... And you Sakura? I don't really see you going for a stroll that far from the academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to go and pick something up for Tsunade before meeting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not going to do it anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know it's most likely some sake, and Shizune did tell me not to bother about it, as she was already partially drunk when she told me to go. I went out just to not get on her bad side, but I think Shizune is going to handle the situation anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really needs to simmer down. Too much alcohol is very bad for your health...\", sad Karugo as he shook his head  as Skaruke also nodded in agreement, both giving a long sigh. \"If that's the case, do you want to hang out with us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with it. I was curious what else they had in here anyway. It's been a long time since I've been here, so a nice walk might not be too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then let's finish eating and let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkaruke giggled a little at his friend's enthusiasm, seeing that he raised his fist with a determined look on his face, while Sakura just smiled, slightly amused by Karugo's behaviour, as all three of them hurried to finish their snack.</span></div></div>",

They weren't looking for anything in particular, but since neither hasn't visited the place before to check out the different shops in the district, they were curious to see if there was something interesting on sale, while Karugo also took this time to check out the women that passed them, making sure neither of his friends would catch him in the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt at first like she shouldn't be just strolling around and should hurry back to Tsunade, but as time passed, she was no longer alerted by the guys' appearance, and thus she no longer thought she had to head straight to her office. Her thoughts on her also changed, becoming a little bewildered by her behaviour. She still respected her a lot and admired her strength, but she couldn't really understand why she was so obsessed with alcohol and had such a short temper despite the fact that at times she was a lot more mature and composed than the ones around her. She wasn't really irritated by her, but she now found her attitude to be more tiresome than before. In addition, her crush on Skaruke was slowly shifted to Karugo, as the former no longer seemed to be as attractive to her as before. Instead, she was showing more interest in the blonde's more open attitude and less childish demeanour. Sakura wasn't sure why she was feeling this way, but she didn't appear to object to the new feelings she had, as she felt more in control of her own emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the exploration, the boys became older once again. Their hips widened and put on a good amount of fat on them as they began swaying them the more they walked. Their waists caved in as well, as while they remained mostly flat and toned, there was clearly a lack of muscle development in the area, making their clothes feel a little loose. The feminine features also became more pronounced as the cheekbones went higher and their eyelashes grew longer. Sakura joined them, as she too grew up, with her figure starting to become more womanly. Her hips and rear became pronounced while her small A-cup breasts grew one size bigger, as the mounds became more visible through her top. Lastly, her facial features changed a bit as well, with her eyes becoming sharper and her expression turned into one which looked more neutral and mature. In the end, the boys were left at sixteen, and Sakura at fifteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued walking, Karugo found his jumpsuit to be straining against his plumper thighs and felt quite loose against his torso. He frowned, because he knew this morning his jumpsuit didn't feel off like it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but my clothes feel a little off right now. What do you guys say, doesn't it look a bit ill-fitting?\" Karugo's question made the two to look at him, and after a few seconds they nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does. But it's not only you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is something wrong with your clothes too Sikure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it feels oddly tight all around, especially at my chest and butt. What about you Ikaruke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my pants are a little tight, but my shirt feels a little loose to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... I know I haven't got any new clothes recently, but I didn't thought I'd be needing new ones already. Fortunately, we are surrounded by a bunch of shops right now, so we can go and buy new garments right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am down for it, but I don't have much money on me Katruago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... And it's such a shame because I earned quite a bit after the last mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can pay for you if you want. The Pervy Sage gave me some extra yen, so if we find something we like, I can buy for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katruago... Thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I appreciate it.\", said Sikure with a tiny smile on her lips, while Ikaruke blushed a tiny bit at their friend's kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a little strange was that it wasn't just Sikure, but Ikaruke was also interested in the blonde, despite the both of them being boys. And yet, he didn't seem to mind the idea too much at the moment. As for Katruago, he wasn't showing any particular interest in either of his friends yet, other than Sikure's chest, although he did feel a lot closer to them than before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Sikure's didn't grow, the also became a bit more wavy, like the blonde's as the green spread out from the roots and now covered a quarter of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatruago hoped to find a store that was popular, as he didn't know too much about shopping for clothes in general. and thought that out of the three of them only Sikure would be good at it. But since their tastes wouldn't overlap normally, he or Ikaruke couldn't just ask her for advice on what to wear. As he continued looking, he stopped as he found a shop that was quite unlike the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Katruago, did you find something interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that...\" He pointed towards the store that coughed his attention, and upon looking at it, they also became as surprised as he was at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building itself looked like all the others, but the clothes on display were quite different than what they used to. They looked a lot more modern and stylish than the usual shinobi garb one would expect. While there were kimonos and battle armor among them, there also was what appeared to be a track suit, a leotard and a multitude of frilly dresses, all custom made to provide mobility despite their strange appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is unique, that's for sure.\", said Sikure flatly to which Ikaruke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... I wonder where did they find the materials to make some of the garments they have here. Some of the pants look very tough while some shirts look like they are made from silk... To find something like this is quite unexpected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is a little weird. It kind of makes me think how come no one talked about a shop like this when there is no other like it in Konoha. Although I am a bit curious to see what's inside. Are you also interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll look just to see how crazy the stuff they have in there is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'll just look okay? Let's not spend money on weird things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Ikaruke, you never know, you might find something in there that you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio entered the building, and just as they expected, the inside was filled with even more strange clothes. They couldn't really understand why no one from their class or the teachers made any mention about such a place, when it was obvious it was one of its kind. And it wasn't like it was deserted either, as a few girls were looking through the aisles as well. Interested in what they could find, they began to search for something they could wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, their eyes were slowly changing as specks of a different color began appearing in their irises: bluish green for Katruago, blue for Ikaruke and amber for Sikure. Their memories shifted further as aspects from their past were replaced with new ones. Katruago and Ikaruke never bickered with each other too much when they were little, and their disagreements appeared only when the former started to show a little too much interest in women's bodies.There was also Ikaruke's lone wolf attitude over the years as it appeared like he was more reserved than outright cold to others. As for Sikure, the crush she had on the Uchiha ever since she was small was gone, as she recalled a lot more times when she trained rather than playing with other kids, with Ino being one of the very few individuals she interacted more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they continued looking at the clothes, Sikure noticed something a little peculiar. Most of the clothes in the store were for women, and the ones that looked like they would fit a boy were unisex at most. This seemed to apply to both armor and casual outwear. And yet neither Katruago or Ikaruke seemed to mind as they paid attention to quite a number of girl clothes among the many ones they looked at so far, including skirts. She didn't know why they cared so much about any garments that wouldn't suit them, but rather than bringing it up to their attention or chastise Katruago for the few perverted glances he made when he looked at some of the clothes, she was perfectly okay with it, not finding the situation too confusing as her mind changed a bit more to make their behaviour seem normal. At the same time, she was unaware that her own preferences changed, as she now gravitated less towards the more feminine garbs and bore towards the boyish ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ikaruke stopped upon finding something that appealed to him. It was an outfit consisting of a white gold-trimmed jacket with six buttons and a few golden tassels strewn across with an armband pinned to the left arm with Hidden Leaf Symbol on it and a short gold-trimmed white skirt and boots of similar colors to the jacket, completed by black tights. It was quite an unusual combination that the normal Ikaruke would scoff at and complain of how unsuitable it was for a real fight, but something inside him seemed to resonate with the outfit, and he gently picked up from the rack the skirt and jacket in one hand, and the boots in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I like this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Doesn't it look a bit too formal?\", asked Katruago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it does. I just looks really nice to me for some reason. I think I'll go and see if it fits. My pants have been straining for quite a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it did, as it was now showing quite a bit of his butt, especially after it grew once more to a delectable size that would made many girls jealous, while his waist compressed even further, losing a bit more of his muscle as well. In the meantime, Katruago's rear also grew into a large bubble-shape like his friend, before his hips spread a little further apart, giving him the full bottom of an hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get what you're saying. But are you sure this is what you want? I don't know it looks more like a school uniform rather than an actual shinobi garb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean, but there is no need to worry. I just want to test it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" The blonde was about to ask where Sikure has gone, before they saw her bringing an outfit that once again was unusual to say the least in terms of a battle clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried a pair of blue jeans that has gashes and rips with a red snake motif on the left side, together with a grey and black belt, and a dingy torn up yellow and black striped shirt with a snake patterned and black frill trim that is very short. In all honesty, with the exception of the brown shoes she brought with her, the rest of her clothes looked like they were mauled a wild animal and then taken from the trash bin. Sikure gave them a curious look upon noticing the dry glances they were giving her, but neither bothered to try and bring up the way the outfit looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see both of you found something to wear... as strange as your picks are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what's the issue. I thought you said we should pick something that's easy to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think yours offers a bit too much movement...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we wait for you to find something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just give me a moment...\", said Katruago as he took another glance at what was around him and quickly picked a white shirt with blue outlines that came with a blue tie and a blue plaid skirt. Ikaruke looked at him awkwardly while Sikure just raised an eyebrow as the Uzumaki came back to them. \"Don't give me that look. If you can pick skirts and ripped shirts, I don't see anything wrong with my choices. And besides, I think that we could spend another hour looking around, but just want to get out of these clothes right now, so let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends didn't try to object, as they too felt their outfits strain quite a bit against them. But just before they went into the changing rooms, a small surge of energy came from Katruago and spread to the other two, as a portion of the seal that held back the Nine Tails disappeared, creating an influx of chakra that made the trio age up once again, their bodies growing up to seventeen years old.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt his mind buzz for a bit, as he now believed is name to be Katrurago, as more of his memories changed, his lonely past of being ostracized by the people for being a jinchuriki, was replaced with a happier one, where he had several friends, including the Uchiha youth, and despite still being like a small joker, he didn't get in trouble nowhere near as often, which made him and Iruka grow a bit closer as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a cold breeze? Weird, well, let's get out of these things, they are actually starting to hurt a bit.\" He quickly disrobed himself out of the tight clothes and remained only in his underwear as he looked at his reflection. \"Damn, I look good. I didn't really have any time lately to just look at myself in a mirror like this, but I guess all that hard training did good for me in the end.\" He seemed to be completely unaware of the changes to his body, or the fact that a third of the seal on his abdomen was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began pose a little, some of his positions emphasizing his larger hips and bountiful butt. He still felt that his underwear was a little tight but it didn't compare to the unpleasant feeling he had from the other clothes. \"I didn't really realize why so many took glances at me back at the academy but now I think I get it. My body may not really compare to Granny's, but my face and my hair may be why so many boys and girls like me. Heh, listen to me, how narcissistic I got all of a sudden. Sure I look nice, but I don't really compare to Ikarukae, and no matter how neutral she looks, Hikure has a lot of fans too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, his own features feminized further as his face now mostly resembled a girl, as another whisker mark vanished. His hair grew at a very fast pace until it reached his mid-back, with a few bangs coming into his view, before brushing them aside. As he thought about his friends however, he sported a slightly perverted grin a tent was now visible through the underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of looks, those two certainly got my attention. Strict as he is, Ikarukae is starting to look amazing and he doesn't seem too bothered to let his figure be seen. Firm butt, toned legs, small waist... too bad he is kind of lacking upstairs... And Hikure started to smile a bit more often too. It's nice that she's more open now, and she's been growing up nicely too. There is still room for improvement, but it's already a nice head-start. But man, I can't wait when they will start growing more. There's no way it's just going to stop after how good their figures are. It kind of looks incomplete and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrurago felt a little dizzy, as his vision got a bit blurred. His mind for some reason got into overdrive and began making him think of making out with Ikarukae and Hikure. In spite of the fact that this thought came out of nowhere and he should feel disgusted at the idea of kissing Ikarukae again after the last incident, he found himself actually liking the idea, and with Hikure in the mix, he didn't had any objections, and let his mind wander. In the meantime, his manhood was slowly diminishing the more he fantasized, as the appearance of his two friends also changed inside his daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boxers were shifting as well as they quickly lost their legs and became softer while its color drained completely until it was pure white before horizontal blue lines started to appear on it. This had the effect of pressing harder on his manhood, hastening the pace of its shrinking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she didn't show any particular emotion, he could tell she was as excited as he was. The best part was that Hikure was actually letting him grope her, the softness he felt from each fondle stimulating him as much as her. Ikarukae then joined in, and it seemed he wanted to be shown as much attention as Hikure, judging from the small frown on his face. Katrurago could tell he was more awkward and shy, but it was in a way kind of cure to see the normally stern Uchiha look a lot more vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis length continued to shrink as he let himself enjoy his fantasy. The boxers then lost their legs and became a bit softer as they morphed into a pair of panties before gaining some horizontal blue lines over the white it was at the start. This made his testes feel a lot tighter in the confining underwear as they were slowly pushed inside his body, while his manhood grew ever smaller. This also caused a new cavity to form in his abdomen, while his hips stretched further apart, becoming large and womanly in compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrurago's head was buzzing, as the appearance of his friends were gradually changing, with Hikure's figure becoming more voluptuous and Ikarukae's more womanly, completed with a pair of breasts that were slowly getting bigger than Hikure's. In addition, more memories were altered to fit the his new identity, with most of the times the town ostracized him vanishing completely from his head, and while he was still a bit too free-spirited, he no longer tried to gain the village's approval, as he already had it. During this time, what was left of his headband thinned further and two ribbons appeared on each side of his head, while the Leaf Village's symbol was now engraved on it in white on its left side. The clothes he stripped off also disappeared, with only the garments he took from the store being the only ones left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrurago was however unaware of all of this, too distracted by his dream, while his manhood was getting increasingly smaller, and a lot more sensitive, as it now barely poked through the panties. In his fantasy, more girls joined in, all wanting to have him feel their chests, much to his delight. But despite the fact that their names were kind of eluding him right now, his friends were still in the center, and were the only ones that really mattered out of the entire group. In fact, he seemed a lot more accustomed to their more feminine appearance in the dream rather than the way they looked in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure look amazing... I kind of wish I would the part as well... I know I am a boy but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe give out a small moan as what was left of his length completely disappeared and a new flower bloomed between the new girl's legs. She needed a few moments to recover, but as soon as the euphoria was gone, she looked at herself in the mirror in slight confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What was I doing?... Why did I need to strip down anyway? I thought my clothes were tight before, right? Nah, that couldn't be it... Well, better not to keep the others waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrurago then began to put the clothes she took before from the shop, while thinking that these were the ones that she had all day. She put the pleated skirt on perfectly, but curiously decided to leave the shirt open, revealing a good portion of her torso, followed by the tie, which hanged over her exposed chest. Before leaving however, she noticed a pair of armored greaves that were in the place of her shoes. She didn't seem to find anything weird about them, as she quickly put them on, together with the white socks that were near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I had to get almost naked just to see if this tie and headband suited me. Maybe I was thinking about something else and got distracted... I sure hope this is the last time this happens. Last thing I need for me to space out in the middle of the street... Well, I do kind of do that when I look at girls, but that something completely different...\", laughed Katrurago sheepishly as he excited the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His grudge against his older brother Itachi continued to go away, as he seemed to gain a more level-headed mindset with each passing second, his wrath being consumed by a desire to understand his motives. Likewise, his more antisocial behaviour was replaced by an attitude, that while still a bit distant, he was a lot more respectful and approachable to his peers than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was only in his boxers, Ikarukae checked his reflection in the mirror, noting that there didn't seem to be any fat deposit on his body that would cause his clothes to strain him as much they did. He felt his underwear was slightly constricting, given his butt's and thighs' new plumpness, but he still thought his legs looked normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd... I wonder if I underwent a growth spurt recently. It doesn't look like it... I wonder if Katrurago and Hikure have the feeling as I do.\" He absentmindedly began caressing his flat waist and thicker thighs as he looked at himself, ignoring how his hair fell down to his back, his hairstyle becoming a longer variant of Hinata's hime-cut. \"It looks like all the training I did helped considerably in keeping myself fit. In the end, I think Katrurago was right about doing basic exercises during the day beside the shinobi training. It is nice to know that all the labor bore fruit in the end, and I have to admit, my body seems to have grown quite well in the last few years.\", thought Ikarukae with a small smile before glancing at his chest, when he started to frown. \"Although, it looks like one past hasn't grown... I can already picture Katrurago pointing it out to me as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering his friend's obsession and how unbashful he has gotten recently, he got slightly annoyed. \"I swear, the more that boy grows, the more perverted he gets. I understand his feeling of appreciating a girl's looks and not saying insensitive things to them directly, but he is getting more and more like Jiraiya. I don't want him to ruin his reputation if he takes things too far if he continues to act this way, but I doubt he will ever listen to me. Kakashi-sensei can tell him to stop for a while, but that is only a temporary measure... And yet, somehow I feel irked for a different reason as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkarukae closed his eyes as he recalled how much Katrurago paid attention to Hikure lately after her last growth spurt and how he constantly gazed at her developing chest, while he mostly ignored him when the three of them were together. In this time, the clothes he put aside disappeared, while his nipples lightened to a soft pink and widened considerably, before a black bra materialized over his chest, his boxers becoming the same color as his top in the process. \"...I know I am not as developed as Hikure, but until recently she wasn't too endowed either. It just happened that this year her chest to grow a lot. But even since then, he barely looked at me in the eyes whenever she is around. I try to throw him a bone and let him look as much as he wants at a girl's chest if he doesn't lose control and starts groping them, and I don't pester him all the time, but he doesn't seem to listen whenever he is \"in the zone\" as he calls it... Sometimes I wish I would have bigger breasts just for him to pay more attention to me... not that I have any other motives to want something like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to not blush too much upon thinking of the last part, Ikarukae suddenly felt his chest heating up, his nipples pressing into the bra as small fat deposits started to form under them. Despite trying to understand what was going on and try to maintain his composure, he couldn't deny the feeling was quite nice, so without thinking he started to caress the growing mounds.</span></div></div>",

Ikarukae was starting to realize he was seeing his friend in a more romantic light than before, developing a full-on crush on him. While he should feel disgusted at the idea of liking a guy, he found himself not minding dating the Uzumaki heir. The main reason was that he slowly didn't consider him to be a guy, as more and more thoughts of him being a girl instead, were getting more prominent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why does thinking about Katruago-san makes me feel so warm?... I-I should stop, but... maybe a few more minutes wouldn't be so bad...\", said the changing boy to himself, still unaware that his hands were rubbing his growing C-cups. He also felt the warmth reaching his groin, but he felt compelled to not touch that area, and instead focus on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe no longer found his kiss with Katrurago as disgusting and revolting, but rather embarrassing, as the mental image changed with both of them blushing and looking at each other awkwardly, with both trying to conceal their blushes. The fact that despite putting up a front, the blonde may have been attracted to him for a while made his heart flutter. Ikarukae could now recall the moments where they acted affectionate, such as them holding hands sometimes, snuggling up to each other during the winter and at Katrurago's insistence, sometimes sharing their meals together. His breasts grew into D-cups and were almost at their final size, however, he found the sensation of massaging his breasts much more stimulatory than before, which made him give out a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his relationship with Katrurago changed further, so did more of his memories. Together with Hikure, they formed an odd group of misfits that usually wouldn't be together, but they somehow the three of them stayed quite close over the years that made his childhood after Itachi's departure and his family's death much more bearable and he felt comforted by how his friends were there for him when it counted. It was during that time when he grew a crush on the boisterous blonde, something he managed to keep a secret to himself for a long time. He wasn't sure when he would tell him his feelings, but after enrolling at the academy and seeing his interest in Hikure and the other girls with larger assets, he decided upon himself to steel himself and be more aggressive, but also more open to his antics to try and remain close. Ikarukae would never admit, but he was glad his chest grew as much as it did, which made him be more noticeable to his crush. It was embarrassing sure, it was also gratifying to know he was attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost took a hand to deal with the increasing heat from below, but the moment his breasts grew into E-cups, he almost lost himself when he brushed one of his nipples. As soon as the hills on his chest stopped growing, Ikarukae felt his body temperature was returning to normal, and after cupping his bosom one last time, he let go and opened his eyes, unaware of what he did in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That was... quite nice. I felt my chest get warm when I thought of Katrurago-san... but I think I need to better control myself. I don't know why I felt a little aroused before, but I must make sure not to happen again. I can't let myself acting indecent in public\". Despite chastising himself over his immodesty, he couldn't deny he felt a bit good when he thought of the Uzumaki girl, the gender of her friend switching when his breasts got to their final size. As he put on the uniform, he seemed to perfectly put every article of clothing on him like he already wore the outfit before. He had a few issues covering the boxers which almost peaked out of the skirt, but otherwise, he had no other issues. However as he finished buttoning up his top, he noticed a sword sitting next to the mirror. \"What's Hien doing here? Didn't I leave it at the entrance? Oh well, better take it with me before I forget.\" After grabbing his blade, he looked again at the Konoha armbad he put on his top, and smiled at how it fit the rest of his outfit, before leaving.</span></div></div>",

There was a thought in the back of her mind that told her she wasn't as endowed as she currently was, but Hikure didn't seem to bother to think as to why, and was rather more interested in the color of her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they pink? They look strange on me.\", said the girl flatly to herself. Normally, that normally wouldn't be a statement she would honestly think about, given her desire to look more feminine, and colors like pink or red would be among her favorites when it came down to clothes. And yet, those colors were a lot more dull to her, and was slowly getting less interested in girly clothes or accessories. \"It doesn't suit me, and it feels weird to wear pink. I wonder what Katruago would think? Maybe the same as I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikure felt like Katruago's opinion was a lot more important than her own in this situation, given her new disinterest in what to wear. There were in fact several things in which she had the blonde sharing his thoughts with her since she was very neutral about mostly everything. She then spaced out, not paying any attention to her reflection, and thus she was unable to see how her hair was now completely green or that the usually trimmed bangs were wilder and wavier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began thinking of Katrurago, or rather their shared past, which was a little strange for her to remember the past now of all times, but she didn't have anything against it and simply rolled with it. Inside his memories, aside from staying friends with Ino, most of her past changed considerably. Instead of the outgoing, cheery and slightly short-tempered girl she was before, now stood a youth that was a lot more introvert, cold and calculating. Her own emotions seemed to have been stunted from a pretty young age, given that she didn't try to make any progress in terms of relationships with most of the other kids or sometimes her own parents. Even her own \"inner self\" was now absent, given that the usual irritation, anger and frustration was missing from her psyche, as she developed a more cynical and serious mindset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA multitude of thin, black necklaces formed around her neck while her complexion became rather pale in comparison to most of her friends. She did feel a tiny jolt of pain as two earrings in the shape of snakes appeared on her ears, but she ignored it in favor of seeing where her mind would take her. And she was quite happy as she saw her many interactions with Katrurago over the years. Despite her preference for solitude and focus on training, the blonde didn't seem to be willing to compromise. He wanted to make her smile or at least try and be more open or emotional, and she couldn't deny that beneath her mask of indifference she was a little ticked off by his insistence. And yet the first time she told him to stay away from her, the boy smiled, as he accomplished his goal already. While surprised at first, Hikure couldn't deny that the first time he showed genuine emotion to someone other than his family was a very novel experience that made him want to talk a bit more with Katrurago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was barely visible, a small blush appeared on her cheeks the more she continued thinking of her friend. She could feel her chest getting warmer when she thought of him although she couldn't really say why exactly. Aside from that, her underwear seemed to move on its own a bit, almost massaging her, which made her blush deepen just a tad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More of Hikure's past was changing, her long-time crush on Ikarukae vanishing from her head, as her overall attraction towards boys in general was dwindling. While she wasn't against the idea of dating someone, she no longer seemed to prioritize it as much as before, as she was more focused now on developing her talents as a shinobi. In addition, she became a bit more open to the idea of being attracted to girls, no longer finding gender that much of an issue anymore., which made his interest in Katrurago feel more natural as she was starting to perceive him as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unaware that the more her lingerie was massaging her, the more it changed. Their color slowly went from pink to a mix of yellow a bit of white and black as a few snake designs appeared on it. Her undergarments then began to feel less tight on her as they both began to get bigger, starting to actually get a bit loose on her. Her facial features changed considerably, making the cute visage she had prior seem like a distant memory as her face, while now looking more mature than before, didn't resemble any of her parents anymore, as her eyes turned into a bright amber, with her pupils looking a lot like a snake's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few details regarding her childhood were changed, as her friendship with Ino no longer being seen as strained or tense over the years, given that the two were no longer fighting over the same love interest, which made them remain relatively close, despite the fact that their current personalities were very different. And speaking of love interests, for most of her life Hikure didn't find someone she could actually see in a romantic light, her new attitude making her a lot more distant than before. However, Katrurago was getting a lot more prominent in her memories, and she couldn't deny that she was getting a lot more attached to the blonde as time passed. She had a rocky relationship with Ikarukae for most of the time as he was much more strict and uptight, which contrasted her more laid-back and passive nature. And yet, the two still remained friends over time thanks to Katrurago bringing them together. Although she did notice that lately, her chest seemed to tighten whenever her friend were doing things without her, and when the Uzumaki spent more time with the brunette than her, while she felt happier when her and Katrurago were together and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" was the only thing that came out from her mouth, and while it sounded pretty neutral, it was something important that clicked to her just now. \"So I like Katrurago and I want to date him... That's why I feel so warm when he's around... I am happy I realized.\" The small blush on her cheeks and the faint smile made her girl resemble a bit of her previous self, as she now felt more attracted to her teammate, and since now she was now when it came down to romance, it made her feel like she had butterflies in her stomach. However she was confused as to why she was feeling this way only now. \"...But didn't I like him before? It is a little weird that I think of him this way so suddenly. Didn't I start to like him when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to ponder more on it, but as the massage continued, her breasts jumped on cup size, bringing them to mid C's, while her butt plumped up some more, making her rear almost as big as Katrurago's and her hips also spread out a little more as well. She felt a tiny bit aroused as she was thinking of her new crush, but as soon as the small sensation of euphoria was over, she opened her eyes, unsure of what she was doing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Was I thinking about something?... Was it about me liking Katrurago? I don't see what's there to think about. I've liked her for a long time... Whatever, I already spent too much time. I need to change and join the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put on the ripped jeans, she let her pants unzipped all the way and her belt unbuckled, which in tandem with the torn top gave her quite the punkish look. She also put on a few leather constricts on her pants and arms that contained several knives that she used frequently instead of the regular kunai, as she thought they were easier to handle. She made sure there was nothing left inside as she left but while pulling the curtain away, she couldn't shake off the feeling that her clothes were a bit loose on her. It wasn't so bad with her pants and panties, but she felt that her chest was feeling quite roomy for the size of her clothes. Than again, given that she let one of her shoulders bare, she merely thought it felt that way due to the position of the bra and small sleeve, and thus didn't think much of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, everything returned to normal as they now got a good look at one another, which prompted Katrurago to whistle a little at Hikure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's sure a lot of necklaces. Did they come together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but they were sold at a pretty low price, so I bought a few. My neck would just feel a bit too bare if I bought just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly give off a rebel vibe, that's for sure. Between your necklaces and Ikarukae's armband, I don't know which one looks more stylish.\", said the blonde to which his friends blushed a little at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you Katrurago-san, but I only picked something that would go along with my uniform. Rather, your headdress is a lot more unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think I've seen you wear anything in your hair before, so it certainly stands out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to have something to add some originality to my wavy hair since I can't really go with Ikarukae's or Hinata's style, so I settled on this for some extra flair. I know It's not as drastic as Tenten's ox horns, but you get what I'm saying, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a nice touch. And you always manage to look god in blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks, but of course I'll go for my favorite color. But who knows, maybe in the future I'll come out one day in an orange jumpsuit.\", joked the boy, with the pair giggling a little at his remark as they headed towards the counter. They made no comment in regards to the new clothes or gear they now had as their stay inside the changing rooms as well as the outfits they had before seemed to have disappeared from their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Katrurago and Ikarukae's figures continued to develop as the former's waist pinched in further while maintaining a toned core, while the brunette's butt grew in mass until it became a pair of large sensitive, but also firm buns that complimented his lower body. Their assets were pretty much similar in size now with Katrurago's being slightly more developed than her friend. On the side, Hikure looked at them with a hint of envy managing to appear on her neutral expression, a desire to be more developed popping into her head. While she wasn't as jealous of more well-endowed girls as before, she still wanted to have a figure that would be on par with her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady at the counter welcomed them with a smile as they told her what they wanted to buy. \"So a headdress, an armband and four necklaces, all having the emblem of Konoha, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. I have to say I've never seen a place like this that sells clothes like this. Some of the stuff you have here looks quite... interesting to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's because we have several people that have traveled all around the shinobi world and even further beyond to gain inspiration for these outfits. And from what I remember, some were even initially custom made for a few shinobi schools overseas before the designs were brought here and modified a little. So you could say you are wearing now international shinobi garbs\", said the clerk with a grin as the trio nodded their heads in understatement, all slightly surprised that people in other countries would wear some of things on display are battle equipment. \"So which one of you will pay? Or do you want to share the bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's on me.\", said Katrurago as she glanced at the others, showing she didn't forget his promise, making Ikarukae's cheeks a bit pink while Hikure gave a simple smile. After taking some yen from her dragon-shaped wallet and paying, she joined her friends as they said their goodbyes to the clerk before leaving.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would speed up the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing paperwork.\", responded the green haired girl flatly. \"And I don't really understand what they say most of the time... Not to mention there will be a rant about how many documents there are and about me not bringing alcohol back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well... I guess that is something she would say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about granny Tsunade for now.\", said Katrurago to the others. \"How often do we get to spend time together like this? I say we tour around the place some more before we leave. The pervy sage already gave me the day off, so I say we should enjoy ourselves a bit. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" was Hikure's immediate reply. \"Beats sitting around watching the Hokage rage at the amount of paper she has to sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still want to train a bit... But I think it can wait. You are right Katrurago-san, we should try and take advantage of our free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, glad to see you agree. Well, the let's go!\", said the blonde as she put her arms over the pair's shoulders, both being slightly surprised by the action before Ikarukae blushed and Hikure smiled with a hint of pink also hitting her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, their bodies grew up one last time to 18 years old. Ikarukae's and Katrurago's bodies filled out further, making them look almost like models if it wasn't for the small bulge in the former's skirt and the flat chest in the case of the latter. Hikure's body also developed more, her curves getting quite close in terms of size to those of her friends, with her wide hips, large and firm butt and small, but toned waist, giving Tsunade a run for her money. Her breasts grew into large C's, but she could still feel there would be room for improvement. However these changes only paved the way for the mental and reality adjustments that came with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatruragi's parents, Minato Namikaze and his wife Kushina were still alive. While they were still left in a coma after the Kyubi attacked their village when he was but an infant, they managed to barely cling to their lives as they protected her from its attack. As a result, the Kyubi wasn't ever placed inside her, as only a significant portion of its chakra was being stored in her body, so that her mother, who still housed the Nine-Tails wouldn't strain her body to do so in her condition. As a result, the seal on Katruragi's stomach, which was now even smaller than before, only served as a means to hold back her power in case it would somehow run rampant, as another whisker mark vanished from her face to prove how much less of the beast's chakra he had in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruka's past, while still marred by Itachi's betrayal and his clan's demise never became a lone wolf or the bitter avenger he was before as the village supported him a lot in the aftermath of the tragedy. After Hiruzen asked the people to accept him as part of their community in spite of what happened, and being privately told of a supposed mission he was assigned regarding the safety of Konoha before made his heart more at peace and decided to not pursue the path of revenge and focused on steeling himself for the day he would meet Itachi again. After that, he was taken under Hiruzen's wing together with Katruragi as he lived a much happier life with many people being there for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikuge's life was changed the most as she was no longer the Haruno's biological daughter. She grew up on the streets without meeting her real family, needing to fend for herself against thugs or unruly shinobi for most of her childhood. This made her the coldhearted girl that she was today, her difficulty of being able to express her emotions and actually find enjoyment in life. After she was adopted by Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno, her life started to slowly brighten. As the couple never had a child, they doted on her and cared about her as if she was their own, which triggered a wave of confusion as to what she should feel about people being nice to her. But after meeting Katruragi and becoming friends with her, she finally managed to open up to the few people she cared about, much to her parents' joy. While she still questioned her fashion sense and her quirky tendencies, the three managed to bond together a lot in recent years.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio continued walking through the district, looking at the various shops and stands and the multitude of things that were on display. While initially they didn't remember going through this place before, new thoughts of them visiting the neighbourhood before filled their heads. In fact it became one of their usual hangout spots after graduating the academy, this also being the place where they bought their uniforms after becoming chunins. They were very different from what most shinobi would wear, especially in the case of Katruragi and Hikuge, but no one seemed to mind too much what they were, as they were currently one of Konoha's most active teams that not only produced good results in the many missions they completed, they even aided some of the teams in training at the academy, much to many teachers, such as Asama's, relief to be helped in grooming the new generation of shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, with the last age increase, Ikaruka was finding himself more attracted to Katruragi than before. While he had only a small crush at the start, and then was considering the idea of asking her out at the shop, right now he was actually infatuated with the blonde. While she still exasperated him with her perverted antics at times, he couldn't deny that her charisma positive attitude and kindness made him feel a lot happier when she is around. He was glad Katruragi was into both boys and girls, and his massive breasts did help garnering a lot of her attention, but sometimes he wished his body wouldn't feel so alien to him and that he would be able to say what gender he was without any shame... It was a similar situation for Hikuge. She was a lot more expressive only around her parents and Katruragi, and after several long weeks of pondering her feelings, she came to the conclusion she liked the perverted, yet cheerful girl and wanted them to try and be together. Although she still wished she was a bit more endowed so that she wouldn't feel inferior around Ikaruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Katruragi, despite her interest in boys, she still was more inclined to date girls, as she never found a guy that would be \"fitting\" for her yet, despite looking for one for four years already. She had to thank Jiraiya for broadening her horizon and getting interested in girls too. Who would have thought that looking at a young lady's body and touching their bosoms would feel so nice? Deep down, she had her sights on someone, however based on a talk she had with her mentor before, she wanted to see what her friends would say first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, by the way, do you like someone?\", asked the girl unbashfully, making her friends stop in place. Ikaruka began blushing immediately while Hikuge's cheeks also reddened slightly despite trying to cover up her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why are you asking that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought I would like to know. I had a talk about liking someone with the pervy sage before. I wanted to know what some of his words meant, but he got drunk and then he went on a tirade about granny Tsunade and other women he dated before. And I saw you two sometimes look absent-minded and seemed to always be pondering ... well, more than usual in your case Hikuge, but you get what I mean, right? You like someone, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, a white a blue bra with the same design as her panties formed on Katruragi's chest, which was pretty well masked by the shirt to not be seen while Ikaruka's black boxers morphed into a pair of black panties, which made his manhood slightly more visible in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well... I-I don't think it matters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does. We're teammates, aren't we? You can tell me, I won't say to anyone, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not that,  it's just that I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" The two looked at Hikuge who seemed to have a more intense look in her eyes than usual before grabbing their hands. \"This is not the place for this. Come with me.\" She then dragged her friends after her just as a black snake tattoo appeared on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? Hikuge, where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, to a place that we can talk about it.\"</span></div></div>",

She understood that it was a pretty personal subject, but it wasn't uncommon for people to talk about their crushes in public, which made her feel slightly confused. As for Ikaruka, he blushed as soon as he realized why they were there. Hikure was a perceptive person when she actually cared about something enough to show interest, and given that they were all part of the same team, she knew he also had his sights on their friend, which worried him how things will play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting a good distance between themselves and the main road, they finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take us here Hikuge? We could have talked in a corner if you wanted some privacy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if I did, I couldn't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, the greenette was a blur as she quickly moved to Katruragi and kissed her on the lips. The blonde opened her eyes wide in shock at the sudden display of affection while Ikaruka gawked at them, his jaw dropping as he looked at the scene with his face crimson, but also green with envy. Katruragi could feel how Hikuge was exploring the inside of his mouth, but despite the initial surprise, she didn't fight back and let the kiss continue as the formally emotionless girl embraced her. She felt a spark come from her chest as her nipples widened and thickened to a size that was more befitting of her gender, liking the extra sensitivity they got while they rubbed against her bra. Meanwhile, Hikuge felt how her breasts finally growing a little, going into C's with another snake tattoo appeared on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 seconds of intense kissing, the two finally broke off, with the Uzumaki heir breathing heavily still in mild shock over what just happened, while Hikuge  licked her lips and seemed to yearn for more. She still eyed her friend hungrily and wanted to continue, but first she had something to do. She turned towards Ikaruka who was also recovering from the sight he saw and called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?! W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb. I know what you want. You should just do it. I am not going to stop you... And to be clear, I not doing it out of pity, but because I think it should be fair for you to have a shot. Besides, we both know you'll regret it if don't do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to protest, deny or argue with her, but his envy and desire made him stop himself. While not really knowing what was Hikuge's game, he didn't really care, admitting that this would be a one in a million chance he had right now, and thus he acted on impulse and went for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? Ikaruka, what does she-\" Katruragi was unable to finish her sentence or recover from her surprise as the brunette pressed his lips against his. Being kissed two times in a row by different people was the last thing she could have expected to happen, but having her brain nearly overload at the sensation she felt again, she could notice that Ikaruka's kiss felt different. It wasn't as forceful as Hikuge, and was much more delicate. At the same time, she couldn't deny that feeling Ikaruka's massive bosom on her chest felt awesome, especially after she began growing her own breasts, the hills on his chest going into small AA's, but this was the prelude of what was to come. At the same time, Ikaruka's testes began feeling tighter against his groin as his manhood began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they both felt the need to breathe, their lips finally separated, with the almost-girl felt his cheeks still warm, but felt happier and almost a little giddy, while Katruragi feeling like she would go crazy over the kisses she received before Hikuge approached the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, didn't I? You wanted this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I think I should thank you for the chance you gave me, but it still feels a bit strange to do this right after you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just consider it a means to motivate you and nothing more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you two... What's going on?! Why did both of you kiss me like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the blonde's question made Hikuge sigh, turning to his other teammate and giving him a nod. He had an idea what the Haruno \"snake\" had in mind, but in all honesty, he didn't seem to mind it too much right now. After taking a deep breath and giving a nod back, the two looked at Katruragi straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am not ashamed to say that I have fallen for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Katrutagi wasn't flustered before, she sure was now, eyes opened wide as saucers and face beet red. The normal confidence and pervertedness she showed whenever she was around now, was now replaced with pure embarrassment, with a small tinge of joy also being present in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're not pulling my leg, are you...? S-Since when?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you became my friend. If I am to be honest, everything was a lot brighter after I met you. It's true that I realized my feelings only recently, but the reason I didn't have  eyes for any boys until now was because I was always looking at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had a crush on you for a few years actually... After Hiruzen-sama took me in, the moments when we spent all of our time together were simply... the happiest I've ever felt ever since my brother left. I am sorry for not telling you this sooner... I just didn't have the courage up until now to say anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came down to romance, the Uzumaki heiress gained a reasonable amount of knowledge during his training with Jiraiya, but never before was she in this situation. The boys and girls that flirted with him before did so only on the spur of the moment, but this time Ikaruka and Hikuge were telling her in the face their honest feelings. She didn't know whether to feel shocked or happy, since she also had a thing for both of her friends. Initially she was attracted only to Hikuge, finding their bonding time to be the moment when she began thinking of dating girls, especially after both of them hit puberty. But soon, Ikaruka's gentle disposition, care and his role in keeping her in line when it counted made her see him in a different light. Combined with the fact that they both were very close to him and even put up with her constant groping was just a few aspects of the many that made her have a lot of steamy dreams about them when she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir minds underwent a few more changes to fit the new past, focusing on the few years they gained after the transformation began. Orochimaru didn't become Ikaruka's master, but rather Hikuge's. But her lack of desire to harm the village, her mentorship lasted only a year and a half, with the Sannin taking her as his pupil only to satisfy his curiosity regarding her abilities. Even if his plans never came to fruition and was waiting for a time to reemerge, he couldn't deny that he had a bit of fun training the \"green-haired snake\", which she also admitted was quite helpful to develop her skills before receiving help from Kakashi to further improve her skills. Ikaruka was instead trained by Tsunade in medical ninjutsu and a bit on taijutsu, while she continued her sword practice on her own, creating a variety of techniques that benefited her fighting style. She was also mentored by Hiruzen before his passing at the hands of the Akatsuki rather than Orochimaru, and under his guidance he managed to temper both his mind and his blade. As for Katruragi, while she was still tutored by Jiraiya, their time together was less dedicated to arguing with each other in regards to how hard she had to train, and more about her being introduced to the amazing world of admiring the woman's body, much to the joy of the sage. But that didn't mean they shied away from what she was promised, which was a grueling training regiment in which she learned how to better control her flow of chakra not just for the Rasengan or the Shadow Clone Jutsu, but also for being able to better use her greaves, which had the ability to channel her chakra into her legs, a gift from Jiraiya during her apprenticeship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the blonde still frozen from their confession and how red she was, Hikuge chuckled a little before quickly moving behind Katruragi's back before she could figure out what happened, surprising her and Ikaruka as she held her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I thought I should do how much I care about you... Are you also in Ikaruka?\", asked the greenette, which made the almost girl go stiff. \"Like I said, I don't think it's fair to leave you out. And I am content to share, so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of hesitation, the brunette steeled himself and also moved to hug his crush from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait... What are you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't make me say it out loud... I just wanted to do this for a long time now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Consider this a  reward for your kindness... and payback for all the times we let you play with our bodies.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't know where he suddenly had the courage he had right now, but was very thankful for it as the kiss deepened, with him pushing his weight on his partner, the bulge in his panties pressing slightly against the blonde's plump thighs as it tingled with delight, already losing a bit of its length. In the meantime, Hikuge was kissing and licking Katruragi from the back, as she moved her hands over her nipples, gently rubbing them as her chest grew puffier, small swellings already developing underneath them while one last snake tattoo, appeared on her waist on the same side as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatruragi had no idea how things got to were, but she had nothing to complain about it. Despite feeling embarrassed for being on the receiving end of physical affection for once, and internally apologizing for the times she got a little \"touchy\" around her friends in public, she was now very happy with the current development. She felt how her small breasts were being massaged by Hikuge as she pressed herself on her back feeling both hers and Ikaruka's bosoms at full power, her own hands moving on their own to cope a feel, making the others moan a bit as well. She felt how the greenette's breasts were seemingly growing in her hands much to her joy, but she was also bewildered by the small bump that she felt from the front that was rubbing against her leg. Ikaruka chest also didn't seem to grow, which made her pause for a second before the girl that pinned her moved to grope her butt and the beauty in the front gingerly moved one of her hands over her chest, which erased all the worries she had right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three let their desires control their actions, with all of them enjoying every second of their make-out session, while the final changes were almost done. Katruragi's chest quickly passed through the cup sizes thanks to the groping, easily getting into C's and then went into D's with little effort, slowly pushing more and more against Ikaruka's, the size of her mammaries slowly reaching the same size. At the same time, Ikaruka's manhood continued to shrink, with his testes already being pulled inside and converted into ovaries, which made him whimper a bit, as soon there was only a small bump the size of his pinky left. As for Hikuge, her chest also grew bigger, although not as fast as Katruragi's, reaching large C-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of them stopped as the final few mental changes took place, cooing happily as their bodies underwent the last few modifications needed, before the jinchuriki seal emitted a faint light that spread across the world for a brief second, signaling that reality was being altered to better fit the new shinobi that were in place of the old. Katsuragi's breasts surged forward one last time to F-cups, becoming larger than Ikaruga's own while her legs felt a little weak after the new flower bloomed between their legs, while Hikage's chest also crossed into D-cups as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new reality there now were three beautiful 18 year old girls that were already certified shinobi, and which at one point were Team 7 before they graduated. And right now, they all took the first step forward in strengthening their relationship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few more minutes of hugging, the trio finally broke apart. Hikage looked as stoned-faced as usual, but had a small blush over her cheeks, while Ikaruga's previous confidence seemed to have taken a step back and reverted to her slightly more reserved side, although she was also a bit red, both from embarrassment  and happiness. As for Katsuragi, she looked quite sheepish and her cheeks were still crimson right now, although she was a bit more in control of her emotions this time than a few minutes ago. After scratching her cheek she turned to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that just happened... I have to admit, you really surprised me with this one. Especially you Ikaruga. Never thought you have it in you to act like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's... I-I was just going with the flow, and Hikage-san said it's fine to do a-and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, I am not mad. Just surprised... I guess I had it coming after all the times I got a little too excited around you, but man it felt weird to be on the receiving end... I am not sure how to feel about that even now. Although... I admit it felt a little nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your answer? Are you accepting our feelings?\", asked Hikage to which both her and Ikaruga looked at Katsuragi with anticipation. After a long sigh, and recovering a little from her shyness she replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say \"no\". Why would I even say \"no\"? I've liked both of you for a long time so why wouldn't I be happy about it?\" The answer was a bit unexpected, as neither girl thought the blonde would be so open with her response. \"I mean, I've liked you Hikage for a long time. I like girly stuff, but because I was such a tomboy back then, I didn't really feel close to any girl before I met you. I don't remember because I thought you were so cool or that you didn't get mad at me easily, but I admit, I've fallen for you before my training... As for you Ikaruga, I admit, we had a rocky start at first, but after a while, spending time with you felt natural to me. It was almost like... I don't know, you were out there for me whenever I screwed up and you cared for me a lot, maybe even more than the Pervy Sage... I just thought you were this awesome girl with a sword that is strict but very caring and mature... and I kind of fell for you for quite a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi was slowly getting flustered again the more she prattled on, but the others didn't really care. Ikaruga was blushing as much as she had before, but was genuinely happy that her friend saw past the whole thing with being attractive only physically and liked her personality too. On the other hand, Hikage merely gave a nod and a small smile, glad that her feelings were reciprocated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That would be enough Katsuragi-san. I think you made your point clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You don't have to go on another half an hour telling us how much you like us. We got the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was trying to just say all that was on my mind okay?... Anyway, are you really okay with this? I mean, you did say you don't mind sharing a few minutes ago, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel the same.\" That answer made the other two look at her in shock. \"I am still your first love, and you see me as a girlfriend, so that's enough for me. And besides, I don't mind sharing you as long as I get the attention I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is that so? T-Then I also have no problem. Polygamous relationships are very rare, but they are accepted. I am happy you respect my feelings Katsuragi-san and I am not going to make you choose one of us if you like us both... A-And I am quite interested in seeing how this relationship would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi looked stunned for a few seconds, which created an awkward silence that made the rest unsure what to ask. Suddenly, they found the blonde with her arms around their shoulders with the biggest smile she ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best! Girlfirends! Ever!\" That yell was loud enough to make Ikaruga and Hikage flinch a bit, but they couldn't help but join the Uzumaki girl in her excitement. \"This is the best day ever! Two of the hottest girls in Konoha like me and want to date me? This calls the Ichiraku Secret Menu Ramen! I'll pay for you, don't worry! We can talk what else should we do after we eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Are you only about ramen and beautiful girls? Oh well, I don't mind a free lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist, than thank you for the meal Katsuragi-san... although I hope you won't desire to talk about naughty things or to grope us as we eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya sneezed as he felt a chill run down his spine, a side effect from his having his mind rewritten like the rest of the world. \"Did I catch a cold?... Or is this some sign that Katsuragi finally managed to score big? Haha, if she did, she will rub it in my face, I'm sure of it. Who knows, maybe that guy was right and I might get my wish and she will get the same experience as me when it comes down to women. And if she picked someone from her team? Hoh boy...\", smirked the shinobi as he thought of Team 7 and how quirky the trio he and his former teammates trained. If there was one thing about those three that they all agreed on was that if they would somehow deepen their bond...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then they would surely become invincible. Which given their new status as official girlfriends, they and the rest of the world will soon see how far they will get.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside it was a set of formal yet sexy dress clothes in a light blue color. \"I can't believe this is happening to me dattebayo. . .\" She thought to herself, before being forced to smile as she got the clothes on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put it on, and she started to close the buttons, but when she tried to close them over her breasts she struggled to close them. \"Damn, I just can't get it. . .\" Naruko thought in annoyance. \"Why the hell did Tsunade-sama make my breasts as big as her's!?\" She then muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with it, Naruko thought, giving up on buttoning up and hiding her cleavage. She would just have to deal with perverts ogling her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a hair clip inside as well and tied her hair into a ponytail. \"At least it won't get in the way now.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruko-chan~ How are you doing?\" Tsunade called out in a teasing tone. \"I hope your not having any negative thoughts of your outfit~\" She then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Tsunade-sama!\" Naruko chirped in the forced happy tone. \"Just finished up!\" She then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because you have a lot of training to do.\" Tsunade then revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of training?\" Naruko asked, tilting her head cutely. \"I got a bad feeling about this.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then chuckled with a smirk on her face. \"Oh you'll see my dear, you'll see.\" She replied while licking her lips. \"So you better get here soon.\" She then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Naruko thought, afraid of what kind of training it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then got the light blue heels on as she balanced herself. \"W-Whoa. . .\" She got out as she struggled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade soon giggled to that as she opened the door. \"You'll get used to them, all proper ladies do eventually.\" She remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tsunade-sama,\" Naruko agreed immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's start your training,\" Tsunade said, smirking. \"First off, I order you to say what you think about your new work clothes.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love them!\" Naruko answered, smiling brightly. \"They are uncomfortable!'

Not only did Naruko let her drink alcohol anytime she want, but she also figured out a amazing way to get paperwork done using Shadow Clones of all things. She gave Shizune a long vacation and said that Naruto was out on a solo mission for a while. Meanwhile, every night since the change, she pleasured Naruko in the hotsprings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's time to introduce her to the real deal.\" Tsunade muttered in the hotsprings while fingering the blonde in the vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did you say something Tsunade-sama?\" Naruko meekly got out. \"Ooooh! So good!\" She exclaimed in a pleasure and satisfied filled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just considering something Naruko,\" Tsunade answered as she continued to pleasure her. \"Something that you would probably enjoy.\" She added as she then kissed the blonde's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's blush didn't go away as she was enjoying her experience. \"I-I would enjoy anything you plan for me Tsunade-sama.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind Naruko,\" Tsunade said, as she stopped fingering Naruko, and stood up. \"Now c'mon we have to get back to work, and we are expecting a guest.\" She then statd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai!\" Naruko replied as she stood up. The two of them dried off and put their clothes on, Naruko now wearing a dark red variation of her work outfit and kept her hair down as then returned to Tsunade's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what is the report for today Naruko.\" Tsunade started as she sat at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then began to look through the reports and frowned at one in particular. \"Oh dear, looks like Sasuke Uchiha got a bit to violent during a spar and placed several people in the hospital.\" She revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade groaned to that. \"That Uchiha, he's been a pain in the ass since Naruto had gone on his mission.\" She grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could do what did to me to him.\" Naruko suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade blinked to that idea before she narrowed her eyes. \"Hmm, that would be a good idea, but that little brat is more resistant then you were at the time.\" She reminded. \"Not to mention that he has never done the sexy Jutsu like you used to do in the past.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make him do the Jutsu, after a little hypnotism,\" Naruko then suggested. \"And the Sharingan would allow him to copy the Jutsu perfectly.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. . .\" Tsunade started. \"Actually, I might have an idea.\" She then revealed as a smirk appeared on her face. \"A fake infiltration mission maybe,\" Tsunade thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then raised an eyebrow to that. \"Hmm, a false mission, that way no one will know that he is missing.\" She stated as a smile graced her face. \"Excellent idea Tsunade-sama.\" She praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I got the perfect idea.\" Tsunade soon stated with confidence. \"Naruko-chan, bring me my make up, you'll need it to hide your whisker marks when Sasuke comes here.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai Tsunade-sama! Whatever you're planning I'm sure it will work!\" Naruko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade smiled to that. \"Good, now get ready, this is being executed tonight.\" She ordered. \"And Naruto-chan~\" She started in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tsunade-Sama?\" Naruko questioned in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade's grin didn't leave her face as she looked at her assistant. \"After we succeed with Sasuke's transformation, meet me in my room, it's time for you to learn about another form of pleasure.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's eyes immediately widen to that before they gained a sparkle to them. \"Hai! Thank you Tsunade-sama!\" She excitedly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade chuckled to that as she got up from her seat and strutted over to her assistant before kissing her forehead and slowly brought a hand to her leg as she stroked it. \"Good girl,\" She praised. \"Now get to it my dear assistant.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai Tsunade-sama,\" Naruko replied as she went off to follow her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then sighed in relief to that as she went to her desk and began to work on the fake mission. \"Alright, this has to be legit.\" She stated to herself as she began writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Naruko. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade-sama, you been so good to me,\" Naruko thought in a pleasure filled tone as she strutted down the hallway. \"She gave me my new life, my new job and gives me a wonderful time every night as rewards.\" She then added as she sighed with bliss. \"Tsunade-sama. . .\" She got out with a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde assistant soon arrived to her room and pulled out her makeup kit. \"Ok Naruko, time to hide my birth marks for now.\" She told herself as she began to apply the foundation as she looked at herself in the vanity mirror. \"I am so glad Tsunade-sama taught me how to be a woman.\" She then praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I was changed into a one, my life's been so much better,\" Naruko thought in happiness. \"I love it.\" She then admitted to her thoughts. \"I love everything about Tsunade-sama and what she has done for me.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then looked at herself in the mirror and couldn't help but smile. \"I look so beautiful. Far better then my old self ever did.\" She praised herself. \"I hope Tsunade-sama doesn't make him as beautiful as me.\" She then admitted with a hint of jealousy. She then applied the last of the make up as she looked at herself without the whisker marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sighed in relief. \"No, there's no way. I am Tsunade-sama's assistant.\" She reassured herself as she placed her make up away and started to head back to the Hokage's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the Hokage. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there it is,\" Tsunade muttered, as she finished making the mission legit. \"ANBU!\" She then called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ANBU in a raven mask appeared. \"Hai\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring this scroll to Sasuke Uchiha effective immediately.\" The Hokage ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ANBU nodded to that as he took the scroll from her and vanished in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Naruko arrived in the room. \"It has begun?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tsunade answered. \"Now all we do is wait for Sasuke.\" She then stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai.\" Naruko replied with a nod. \"Tsunade-sama?\" She then started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Tsunade questioned, looking at he fellow blonde curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then shuffled slightly to the attention. \"Um. . .while I was applying my make up, I was wondering something about myself.\" She reveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then raised an eyebrow to that. \"Being?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko then gulped as she calmed herself down. \"How. . .how old am I exactly?\" She soon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade blinked to that as she looked at her assistant. \"Well, your an adult in your mid 20's,\" She answered. \"The Obedence Jutsu accelerated your cells to physically change your age to suit your body. \" She explained. \"It's the reason it's a forbidden jutsu.\" She revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Naruko replied in amazement. \"I was curious and all since I feel older.\" She then admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly natural.\" Tsunade answered. \"The Jutsu also works to mentally adjust a person to the new age. The problem is if the desired age is over 30 of the current age. It would cause an even worse rapid aging that would lead a person to becoming an elderly person.\" She then revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko nodded once more to that. \"I see. . .so that's why it is dangerous.\" She stated. \"So what will be the new age for Sasuke, Tsunade-sama?\" She then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around your own age,\" Tsunade revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko however made frown. \"I. . .I see. . .\" She hesitantly got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade raised an eyebrow to that, but then realized what was going on as she smirked and got up from her seat before going over to the gitl. \"Oh, is my little assistant jealous?\" She teasingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not at all Tsunade-sama! Why would I be jealous of that bitch!?\" Naruko denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade just chuckled some more to that as she then kissed the blonde's forehead again. \"You are adorable when you jealous, you know that?\" She remarked in the teasing tone as she used a finger to stroke her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko smiled as she let out a moan. \"Thank you Tsunade-sama.\" She got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then slowly raised her hand to that as her finger was now near her assistant's breast. \"I'll make sure your shown a amazing time tonight.\" She reassured. \"You will always be my favorite Naruko-chan~\" She then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tsunade-sama,\" Naruko responded as her breast was groped by the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Hokage was gonna go further. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAM! BAM! BAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door being slammed on was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage sighed to that as the moment was interrupted. \"This will have to wait till later Naruko-chan~\" Tsunade stated while removing her hand from her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko nodded to that as she made herself look presentable. \"Of course Tsunade-sama.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two separated from one another as Naruko went to the side while Tsunade got back behind her desk and sat down. \"Enter.\" The Hokage ordered.</span></div></div>",

She was going to enjoy changing him, and getting rid of his attitude. \"It is as the mission describes.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile stood away as she watched the two interact, remembering her past dislike for the Uchiha as it then increase. \"Tsunade-sama better break this brat good. . .\" She thought in a malevolent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just get a woman for this,\" Sasuke asked rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade further narrowed her eyes to that. \"Because I wish not to risk one our actual female shinobis from getting turned in a slave. The man uses a powerful genjutsu that messes with the person's mind to make them believe they are powerless.\" She expertly lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade made a perfect lie,\" Naruko thought in a praising manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke hummed in thought. He could see why he would do this, but why a Genin? \"So why me then?\" He then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade soon smirked to that. \"Because Sasuke, you were the rookie of the year in your class and Kakashi reported that in most of the missions you took with Team Seven that you were the one that did most of the work besides Kakashi himself.\" She then added to the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile resisted rolling her eyes to that. \"Yeah right.\" She rudely thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Tsunade thought. \"Just stoke his ego.\" She then added to her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke meanwhile overconfidently smirked to that. \"That is the truth.\" He then remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could see why I picked you.\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke nodded to that. \"Right, so all I have to do is use the dobe's Sexy Jutsu to attract this guy and then take him out when he gets close.\" He stated while placing his hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't stupid!\" Naruko thought in a enraged tone. \"Correct, since you are his teammate, and that he isn't around, our best deduction was that you at least know it thanks to your Sharingan.\" She then stated in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke then turned to the blonde woman. \"And you are?\" He then questioned in a rude tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Natsuki Okita, my new assistant.\" Tsunade introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile mentally sighed in relief to that. \"Hai, Shizune-san is on a year long vacation and I am her replace for the time being.\" She then expertly lied. \"It is nice to meet you.\" She then greeted with a false smile and a small bow. \"This little brat will get it in the end.\" She meanwhile thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the bow, Sasuke couldn't help but stare at the large breasts in front of him, as a blush formed on his face. \"Jeez, she's as big as the big busted Hokage.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Tsunade and Naruko questioned in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Sasuke answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Tsunade remarked. \"Now then, show me your Sexy Jutsu.\" She then ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need to evaluate it for the mission.\" Naruko then stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Sasuke responded in a somewhat annoyed tone. In a poof of Sasuke transformed. When the smoke cleared they saw the female naked version of Sasuke. Her black hair was still spikey, but was longer now and down passed her shoulder blades. She had large D-cup breasts, and not quite as curvy figure, but they could fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well this is a surprising,\" Tsunade began with a smirk. \"I never would have thought that your Sexy Jutsu would be this attractive.\" She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile narrowed her eyes to that slightly. \"It isn't bad to say the least.\" She admitted. \"Though I'm still better.\" She then added in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Sasuke responded in his female voice. \"I still can't believe I'm actully using that idiot's Jutsu.\" He then remarked in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's eye slightly twitched to that. \"Why that little. . .\" She thought in rising anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade meanwhile sighed as she expected a comment like that. \"Now all we need a name for that form.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasumi, I guess.\" Sasuke decided, not really caring much for in terms of what to be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" Tsunade responded as the smirk started to appear on her face. \"Then we better begin.\" She muttered as she began to make the handsigns from behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I change back now?\" Sasumi asked in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Tsunade began. \"In fact, you never will.\" She then revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Finally!\" Naruko meanwhile cheered in relieved happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasumi meanwhile was confused to this. \"What-!?\" She got out with wide eyes as she readied to change back when. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow, Obedience Jutsu!\" Tsunade declared as she stared at the black haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a white beam of light was shot from the Hokage's hand and made contact with Sasumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What the?\" Sasumi got out as she was about to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Tsunade ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Sasumi became paralyzed. \"W-What is-\" She started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be silent and sleep.\" Tsunade then ordered in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasumi tried to say something, but drowziness struck her as she was forced to close her eyes and was about to hit the floor, but Naruko caught her before she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That worked perfectly Tsunade-sama!\" Naruko praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade chuckled as she looked at the black haired girl. \"You are now a twenty year old female girl.\" She ordered to the sleeping girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that order, Sasumi's body glowed white for a moment before dying down, surprising Naruko at what occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that mean's she now permanently a girl,\" Tsunade revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, did I glow when I change?\" Naruko asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but yours was slightly more since you first changed from a male to a female.\" Tsunade then explained as she looked at the black haired girl. \"Let's place her in one of the guest rooms, she won't wake up until I order her body to.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes Tsunade-sama!\" Naruko exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then picked up the new twenty year old black haired girl as the two left the office, turning off the lights behind her. As the two then walked through the hallway, they began to deal with other matters. \"Oh Naruko-chan~\" She got out in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade went over and slapped her assistant's butt. \"After we place Sasumi here in her new living quarters, come to my room.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do Tsunade-Sama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two went off in their own directions, Tsunade bring the newly made Sasumi to her new living chambers, while Naruko went to prepare herself to experience her next new form of pleasure she was going to receive.</span></div></div>",

He now looked like a human-sized anthro fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as he felt a sharp pain in between his legs and had a feeling he knew what just happened, but was praying that he was wrong. He hesitantly placed her new fury hand down against his crotch and felt nothing except a smooth slit, he let out a small moan as her fingers brushed against it, confirming that he was a girl now. That small touch was enough to make a heat go off in between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it didn't stop and instead continued to grow larger, and she couldn't help, but begin to rub her thick luscious thighs together in a attempt to calm herself down, but wasn't having much success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention her growing E-cup breasts weren't helping her situation, and turning her on even more.

That was when she realized who was behind this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her head and tried harder to changer her thoughts, but the Kyuubi assaulted her mind harder and sent her more images into her mind, like her making out with the Kyuubi as he played her breasts and romp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Inside the Seal</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Everything is going according to plan, but what to do now?\"</b> Kurama muttered. <b>\"Do I simply continue to change her mind, like I originally planned or try to take over her body, but If I do I run the risk of getting THEIR attention.\"</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto was not pleased. \"Are you freaking kidding me?\" he shouted. \"What a rip-off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the thing away like the worthless piece of trash it was. This was just his day. He thought he had just made the discovery of the century, but all he found was someone's crude idea of a joke. \"I bet Konohamaru did this. Only he would come up with a prank this lame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpily, Naruto hopped out of the hole. He supposed that now he should report it to someone in authority. It wouldn't do if some hapless ninjas fell into the hole and broke their necks while out training. <i>Though it might be worth it if it happened to Sasuke</i>, he chuckled to himself evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to go far to find an authority figure. For one had just appeared: Ebisu. \"I should have known you had something to do with that flash of light,\" he said in a disapproving tone. \"Well, out with it. What have you got to say for yourself this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" said Naruto, clasping his hands together to form a familiar seal. In an instant, Naruto transformed into his sexy female form, known for her long and luxurious blond hair, her slender legs, her mature breasts that oozed a raw sensuality that contrasted strongly with the sense of childish innocence in her baby blue eyes, and most of all, her complete lack of clothing. \"Ebisu-sama,\" she whispered in a pleading tone while blowing him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, walked into that one,\" Ebisu sighed before he fell to the ground unconscious, his nose a bloody mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gets him every time,\" Naruto chuckled. Feeling better already, he unleashed the famed and feared Ninja Centerfold technique. Or at least, he tried to. But something was wrong; he wouldn't change back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" he cried in his girly voice. \"Why won't it stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried several times to no avail. Neither his chakra nor his body would do as it was told. When it was clear the transformation would not wear off, Naruto attempted to simply transform into someone else, but even that did not work. He was stuck. \"Oh no,\" he whispered. It couldn't be...had he lost his ability to perform ninjutsu forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to make a Shadow Clone...and it worked perfectly. There was a puff of smoke, and when it cleared, the young ninja was greeted by three identical copies of himself. Only they weren't of <i>him</i> per se: they were all in his Ninja Centerfold form. They were just as female, naked, and confused as Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Naruto, dissipating the clones before they had a chance to protest. \"It seemed that only my transformation techniques won't work. I just need to cover up and find someone to help me.\" Looking over at Ebisu's prone form, the boy-turned-girl realized what he (she?) had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto really didn't fancy the idea of taking off the pervert's clothes as a naked girl. But he didn't have any other choice. It wouldn't do if he got arrested for public nudity. Or more likely, cause the streets of Konoha to run red with blood (from people's noses). Carefully, he pulled off the special jounin's flak jacket, hoping it would be enough, and put it on 'his' own feminine body.</span></div></div>",

The Leaf was filled with people and she could not just roam around in the altogether as she was now. Naruto had to be sneaky. Like a ninja! Which is what she was, thankfully, even if she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Naruto would just leap to it and hope he'd be fast enough to react to whatever happened. He was a man of action of all! But she wasn't a man now, and without any clothes on, she was starting to appreciate the better part of valor. Peering into the streets, of which there appeared to be some bustling activity, Naruto decided that doing any more mad dashes out in the open would be out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up. Hopping on the rooftops might be a good idea. People in general seldom ever looked up, and finding her way to the Hokage's tower would be easy. But then again, that's also where a lot of ninjas, like the Anbu, hung out on high alert. Naruto was an awesomely-skilled ninja...but she had doubts about testing her talents against the Leaf's best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, she could stick to the alleyways. Navigating them would be a bit of a pain, there would probably be the occasional weirdo lurking around them, and there would always be a chance that someone on the streets would catch her. But most of them would be civilians, academy students, or ninjas who were off the clock and thus more concerned with kicking back than looking for trouble.

Normally, she would have been content to simply shrug it off and move on, but ever since the Chuunin Exams, she had been a lot more alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe activated her Byakugan and examined the buildings. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary...besides the very naked teenage girl running around behind them. Hinata blinked. That was unexpected. Who in their right mind would do that? Examining the girl closer, she got her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She looks familiar...oh, it's Naruto-kun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered how he pranked Iruka-sensei hard at the academy, by transforming into an older, butt naked, feminine version of himself.

His prank could be illegal, offensive, and he might get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When has listening to that doormat ever made you feel good?\" said the devil Hinata with a sneer. \"You know Naruto-kun's going to do something awesome, as always.

She was going to see just what Naruto-kun was going to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just about her satisfying her curiosity. One of Hinata's regrets was that she never joined Naruto for any of his pranks.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The good news was that so far, things were going well. The alleys were sparsely-populated and it was easy enough to stay out of sight. Not a soul had seen Naruto in all her naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad news was that Naruto was quickly starting to realize that she was quite lost. One alley looked very much like another, and she could only steal brief glimpses of the streets and landmarks at most. It was difficult to tell just how close she was to the tower, or if she was even going the right way at all. And that said nothing about where exactly these damn alleyways led. They could be leading her around the outer circle of Konoha for all she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she managed to hit some pay dirt when one opening revealed the tower to her. Unfortunately, not only did she still have a ways to go, it looked like she would have to dash across the street into another set of buildings to reach it. And she wasn't so sure she was ready to leave the safety of the shadows just yet. They were the only cover she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should just turn myself in</i>, she thought with a sad frown. It just seemed so daunting to try and cut across the village in broad daylight without being seen. And if she were caught acting all sneaky, then they'd probably be suspicious of her. After all, sneaking around and trying to stay hidden was a sign of guilt for committing one crime or another. Kami knows a lot of people in Konoha would love to subject the demon fox to even more punishment and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook her head to clear those thoughts away. <i>No, I can do this! I didn't get to where I am by just laying down and surrendering! Uzumaki Naruto</i> never <i>gives up!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a large piece of cardboard on the ground, Naruto got an idea. She could use that to at least hide from sight while she moved close to the street to see if the coast was clear. Crouching down on the ground, she held it up in front of her and crept forward, as silently as she could. She didn't seem to hear anything, which was reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the walls on either side of her ended, Naruto took that as her cue to peer around the trash that shielded her from the prying eyes of perverts, peeping toms, and figures of authority. The street before her looked immediately empty. To the left, there was a corner that people would have to round to see her, which thankfully gave a much needed blind spot. However, the right looked a little more hairy; there seemed to be some bustling activity going on. But Naruto was confident that at that distance, no one would be able to identify her as a streaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was as good a time as any to move in the open, and this was as good a place as she was going to find. \"Here goes nothing,\" Naruto whispered to herself as she began her run to the other side.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto wasn't the only young ninja skulking in the alleyways that day. Sasuke was finding them to be a welcome retreat himself. Sakura had approached him earlier to pester him for a date for the zillionth time, and she was being even more annoyingly insistent than usual in pretending she didn't hear his flat refusal. But that was only the start of his problems. Shortly afterward, he had run afoul of several of his former female classmates, who had just caught wind of the conversation. And upon seeing that he was not getting along with the only girl on his team, they all decided it was their turn to have a shot at the Uchiha prodigy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sasuke did the only thing that a brave, intelligent, and highly skillful ninja could do when faced against such overwhelming odds: he ran like the dickens for the nearest hiding place! And since then, he was keeping a low profile while he made his way to the training fields so he could get his exercise routine done for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kami,\" he cursed. \"What is wrong with the women of this village? Can they not see I want nothing to do with them? This is harassment! I should sue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured it was probably high time to get a lawyer. The silent treatment and the cold attitude were not working, and if he resorted to violence, then <i>he</i> would be the one who got in trouble. This problem with the young female population of Konoha had to be stopped once and for all, because it was starting to get out of control from his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when something swift and yellow suddenly struck him. It happened so fast, he couldn't register it. All he knew was that it sent him to the ground, blacked out his vision, and kept the air from reaching his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can't breathe...can't breathe</i>, he silently wailed as panic crept in. <i>Got careless, didn't anticipate an attack.</i> Sasuke gasped some more, struggling to swallow a few wisps of air, but it was all in vain. Two warm and deceptively soft masses had engulfed his face and blockaded both his mouth and his nose. He didn't know what they were, but they were too powerful for him to fight against right now. It looked like...he was going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this how it's going to end for me? Suffocating in the streets of my own village, with my clan unavenged and my brother still free?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" a female voice cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masses released their hold and rose from his face. Sasuke gasped as life-giving air flooded back into his throat. He opened his eyes to see the assailant that attacked him. And when he did, they nearly widened to the size of dinner plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Kami, it was even worse than he thought. It wasn't a random mugger or an enemy ninja. It was another one of his crazy fans! And she was so desperate for Sasuke's heart, that she had tackled him <i>completely butt naked</i> right there in the street! And those mysterious things that had nearly smothered him to death weren't any sort of weapons, or a deadly jutsu, but her...her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke?\" the girl said, looking down at him with her wide blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me, you crazy bitch!\" he roared. \"What the hell is wrong with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I,\" the naked girl stammered. She however paused when she heard the sound of running footsteps coming from down the blind corner. Many footsteps, belonging to the growing feet of what had to be at least half a dozen teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must've gone this way!\" said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait for me,\" said another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Love does not wait for anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, he will be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all appeared, all at once. Several girls that Sasuke had shared a classroom with at some point or another during his academy days. And besides Sakura, he didn't really remember any of their names. They all looked angry and determined...that was, until they saw the scandalizing sight before them of an older blonde straddling their collective heartthrob with not a stitch of clothing on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air turned cold. Silence befell the whole village. A crow squawked in the sky, a dog barked in the distance, and a gasp of horror fell over the entire group. Horror soon melted away to jealousy, and jealousy quickly turned into burning hot hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" said the naked blonde. \"Th-this isnt what it looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you?\" one girl said in a voice that was half a growl and half a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell is she?\" another one demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, she looks familiar,\" said a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill the naked hussy!\" a fourth shouted, raising a fist in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a certain pinkette in a red qipao stood there in complete silence, fists trembling at her sides and steam shooting out of her ears.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata had been watching the proceedings from her secret perch on the rooftops. She didn't quite know what to think. Did Naruto nakedly tackle Sasuke in the street just to rile him up? The way they had both emerged from opposite alleyways definitely looked like the crash had been suspiciously calculated. But then, Naruto seemed to be just as stunned as the Uchiha by their compromising position. Perhaps it was just as accidental as it looked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Sasuke's reaction was kind of amusing in any case. And seeing his face buried between Naruto's naked female breasts definitely put a few naughty images into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how it would feel to have Naruto-kun nuzzling me down there?\" she giggled. Realizing she was getting carried away (and talking out loud), she quickly cleared her throat to get the fantasy out of her mind, blushing furiously the whole time. Now was not the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things took a dark turn when the girls showed up. It didn't take long for tempers to flare and killing intent to spark in the air. If Hinata didn't know better, she could have sworn the entire street had become a whole lot hotter. Unless something happened, Naruto was going to be rubbing a lot of lumps on his head tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had to be done, and Hinata meekly realized she was the only one who could. <i>Naruto-kun is not the type to leave his friends in trouble. So...so neither will I!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving herself a chance to change her mind, the Hyuga vaulted off the roof with a graceful roll, deftly flipped through the air like an acrobat, and made a ten-point landing on the street, with the horde of ravenous fangirls in front of her, and the frightened damsel, Naruto, right behind. Oh, and Sasuke too of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into a combat stance, Hinata stole a glance back at Naruto, and said one single word: \"Run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was stunned beyond belief. One moment, she was bracing herself for the inevitable beat-down she was about to receive. The next, she was watching in stupefied wonder as Hinata of all people appeared out of flipping nowhere and started to fight the fangirls all by herself. The Hyuga knocked out one with an open-palmed punch to the gut, deflected an oncoming fist with a deft parry, and swept another attacker off her feet with a low spinning kick. As if this day couldn't get any weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she doing? She's not actually...defending me...is she?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could mull on it some more, Sasuke threw her off his body. The boy-turned-girl grunted when she felt her bare skin scrape against the rough ground. If she had some clothes on, it wouldn't have been so bad. <i>Man, being naked in public sucks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of here,\" Sasuke growled to no one in particular. \"You're all insane. All of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bolted, he nearly tripped on some large cylinder lying on the ground. Looking on in horror, Naruto realized that the Uchiha had accidentally kicked the scroll, which rolled in such a way that it began to unfurl itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This won't be good for anyone</i>, she thought glumly as she, Sasuke, Hinata, Sakura, and all the fangirls were blinded under another brilliant flash of light.</span></div></div>",

She paid no attention to where she was going, all that concerned the young naked ninja was that she get as far away from...from everyone as she possibly could, and wrap this damn scroll up before it caused any more problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she had been running blindly like a headless chicken for a while now, Naruto stopped to lean against an alley and catch her breath. She needed to get her bearings, find out where the hell she was, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And realize that she had just left Hinata alone to fend off a bunch of angry Sasuke fangirls all by herself. Hinata, who bravely pit herself overwhelming odds, just to protect stupid old Naruto from a problem he (she?) got hirself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a shinobi am I?\" she cried. \"She helped me, and I just ran like a coward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it.

Normally, it was the other way around: whenever Naruto snuck up on her and said her name, it was she who would be startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Hinata, you nearly gave me a heart attack!\" Naruto gasped, turning around. She took in the Hyuga's appearance. She looked a little winded, her hair was scruffier than usual, and she was sporting a few more bruises, but she was otherwise fine. \"Are you okay?\" Naruto asked, forgetting about her own condition for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Hinata panted. \"Just b-burning off the ad-adrenaline.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Hinata was feeling quite surprised with herself. She didn't think she had it in her to take on multiple peers at once. Granted, she had the element of surprise, the scuffle had been over in a matter of seconds, and if not for that strange flashbang that gave her an opportunity to escape, Hinata was certain that they would have overpowered her. But still, the fact that she put on quite a performance filled the normally insecure girl with a rare sense of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And it was all from protecting Naruto-kun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, she was finally able to take her crush in. Naruto was still in his female form, and still very naked. He was also a good deal taller than her, as she was standing near eye level with his mature, tanned female breasts. Being so close to what appeared to be a naked woman in public, who also happened to be Naruto, was definitely very awkward for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Naruto-kun, why are you looking like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck like this!\" Naruto groaned. \"I found that scroll back there and opened it, and there was this flash of light, and then I performed my Ninja Centerfold technique, and the next thing I knew...I couldn't release it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Hinata, not sure she understood what exactly Naruto was saying. \"So, was that flash that happened earlier not a flashbang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was the scroll unwrapping,\" said Naruto. Then, her blue eyes widened in horror. \"Oh no! It must've gotten you too! C'mon, Hinata, now we both gotta' get to the Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, why?\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Granny Tsunade's the only one I can think of who can help us. Well, maybe Pervy-Sage could too but, I don't think he'd be willing to do anything about this,\" she said, looking down at her nude form with a disgusted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Hinata, who was now more confused as ever. Naruto quickly turned away and went to go fetch the scroll, bending over and giving the shy Hyuga a full view of her firm buttocks and womanly slit. Hinata turned red and averted her gaze. It wasn't anything she hadn't seen before, and it was just a simple illusion after all (though a very convincing one), but even so, it wasn't polite to gawk. <i>Even if Naruto-kun is cute as a girl...wait, what am I saying?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Naruto-kun, I could lend you my coat if you want,\" she said, already starting to unzip it. It wasn't much, but it would at least give Naruto's feminine form some dignity, and hopefully keep attention off of them if they were seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother,\" sighed Naruto. \"I already tried to put a few clothes on. They all disintegrated in seconds. I have no choice but to be naked like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see,\" said Hinata. This was getting stranger by the moment. She wasn't quite so sure she could believe any of this, but she decided to go along with it for now. Besides, if something was wrong with Naruto-kun now, then he would need all the help he could get. And right now, she was the only one who could help him.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't thought about that. She supposed they could try sneaking directly into Granny's office.

I-I'm not offended. It-it's just that...oh bollocks!\" A stream of blood spurted out of his nose, and he was out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled again, putting a hand on her bare waist, her fingers gently stroking her petite posterior. \"See?\" she said, turning to Hinata and giving her a playful wink. \"No trouble at all.\" And with that, she walked right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't answer. She could only watch in open mouthed wonder. Both at how effortlessly Naruto had seemingly \"defeated\" those two men, as well as how...adorable she (he?) looked doing it. The frightened, nervous, naked girl was gone; in her place was this confident young sexpot who knew what she had and flaunted it with wild abandon. And looking at her move, with her behind seductively swaying back and forth with every step she took and in tune with her two long pigtails...Hinata was starting to fear that in a few moments, she might end up like the two passed out chuunin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. Hinata shouldn't be thinking that. She was...a girl. And she was supposed to like boys. Nothing about femme Naruto should be getting to her like this. So why was she finding her just as enchanting as normal Naruto?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook here head. That wasn't important now. All that mattered was that they get to the Hokage and fix this mess up pronto. Naruto was already inside and likely waiting for her, so she couldn't dilly-dally for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Hyuga entered the building, the sight that greeted her was a surreal one. It was almost like a horror film actually. The halls were littered with bodies and the floors stained with blood. But Hinata was hot as terrified as she would have otherwise been. Everyone was breathing just fine and no one was really suffering. In fact, they all wore these perverse little smiles on their faces as if they had just seen something wonderful. Which they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ascended the stairs and went all the way to the top floor, where Tsunade's office was. Naruto stood before the door, tall, naked, and proud, with her hands on her hips and her breasts thrust out. The two chuunin guards that served as the last line of defense for the Hokage were down, looking just like the poor souls downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally here, Hinata?\" she said. \"Good. Let's pay Granny a visit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, she pulled open the door and showed herself, <i>all</i> of herself, to the most powerful shinobi in the Land of Fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not get a positive reception. \"What on Earth?!\" exclaimed Tsunade when the naked teenager stomped right in like she owned the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny,\" said Naruto, putting the scroll on the desk as if she didn't notice the Hokage's shock. \"We have something important to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get a chance to finish. Her slender figure, pouty lips, jiggling bosoms, and groomed blond bush held no sway over the Hokage, who took this moment to hit her forehead with a mighty index finger. It was more than enough to send her flying outside the office and all the way to the other end of the hall with a crash. With the intruder dealt with, Tsunade rapidly took note of the bleeding forms of her men right outside, and vaulted over her desk, ready for action. The sage immediately locked eyes with Hinata and glared at her with cold fury as she marched forward, the very image of raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was on her knees in an instant. \"P-p-p-please spare us Hokage! We-we m-mean no harm. We-we-we-we just...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords failed her. She didn't know what to say. All Hinata knew was that she was going to die at the hands of her leader. The only thing that she regretted was that she never tried cantaloupe before. Or confessed her feelings for Naruto. Or reconnected with her little sister after becoming a disgrace to her father and clan. Or redeemed herself to her father and clan to prove she could be a worthy heir. Or in having the courage to tell her father and clan to sod off. Actually, now that she thought about it, there were a lot of things she regretted...and that only made her cry even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it seemed to have an effect on Tsunade, who took pause. \"You're just a child,\" she said, taking a long look at Hinata's silently weeping form. \"But how did-?\" She took a moment to examine the bodies, and soon realized what had happened. \"Bleeding noses? Oh for the love of-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny!\" Naruto whined, limping back up the hall. \"Hinata and I need some help over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just put a lump in your head for storming into my office like...that!\" Tsunade growled. \"I would suggest you address me properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-Hokage,\" Hinata panted, finding her voice again. \"Th-that's Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage blinked at her. \"What?\"</span></div></div>",

She scurried into the back where the Hokage kept her private stash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said the sage. \"Tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto told her the story thus far. She told her of the scroll, how she couldn't revert to her old form, use any transformation techniques, or put on any sort of clothing. She also (sheepishly) mentioned the incident with Sasuke and the fangirls. The Hokage glanced down at the object, picked it up gingerly, and peered at it with a close eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with that, Granny,\" said Naruto. \"You don't know if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade slammed it down on her desk so hard, it rattled every floorboard in the building. \"Do you have any idea what you just found?\" she said in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is that a trick question?\" asked Naruto.</span></div></div>",

Shizune entered bearing a tray with a bottle of sake and a cup. Tsunade picked up the bottle and took a long swig, much to the worried chagrin of both her assistant and the pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...know what it does?\" said Hinata worriedly. She had never so much as seen the man, but the stories that were said about him and his atrocities were unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Tsunade. \"And if what you say is real, I'd rather not take any chances opening this thing. But luckily, I think I know someone who can tell us.\" She pressed a button on her desk to activate her intercom speaker. \"Find Mitarashi Anko and tell her I require her presence immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hokage,\" an androgynous voice answered on the other side of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding with satisfaction, Tsunade turned back to the teens. \"Okay, while we wait for her, let's get you two checked out. Hinata, Naruto, give me your hands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey complied, placing them on the desk. Tsunade clutched their hands in her own and channeled her chakra into them, bathing everyone in a soft gentle glow. An expression of concern fell over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Naruto. \"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There appear to be some irregularities in Hinata's chakra,\" said the Hokage. \"But they don't really seem to be doing anything that I can see. Yet. I don't know what that means, but Hinata, for your own good, do NOT perform any jutsus of any kind for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were in the scroll's flash of light which likely affected you and all the other kids. I'll have to gather all of them together as well. Let's just hope that nothing happens to them until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me?\" said the naked girl. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't detect any irregularities at all in you,\" she said. \"Well, besides you-know-what,\" she added, giving Hinata a careful glance. \"The irregularities are completely absent from you. Maybe because they were never in you...or something happened to set them off. However, I have noticed a lot of changes in your overall chakra makeup as well as general physiology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, say something I can understand!\" said Naruto, who was getting frustrated. \"What's happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you so asked nicely,\" Tsunade said with a roll of her eyes. \"You're not under the effect of an illusion, or a simple transformation technique. Not anymore. Naruto, you're now a perfectly healthy young woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" screamed Naruto. \"You mean,\" she said, fondling her breasts, squeezing them, and bouncing them up and down, \"these are real?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I'm afraid so,\" said Tsunade, taking another long gulp of sake, emptying the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto screamed in horror. \"This is so unreal!\" she wailed, crossing her arms over her chest in a desperate bid to cover herself. \"This is ridiculous! You're bullshitting me, Granny. Tell me you're bullshitting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hinata was rapidly falling into her own world. \"N-Naruto-kun is a girl. Naruto-kun is a girl,\" she whispered. \"That means...she really is...I've been seeing Naruto-kun...n-n-n-nak-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said no more words. Her head thumped down on the Hokage's desk, her eyelids fell shut, and a small trickle of blood poured out of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another one,\" moaned Tsunade. \"Shizune, get me more sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think you've had enough, Tsunade-sama,\" said the assistant. The pig at her feet squealed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you when I've had enough.\" Shizune sighed and left to go get some more booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about this?\" said Naruto, spreading her hands over her whole body to indicate its nakedness. \"Is there anything I can do to cover myself up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" said Tsunade, opening up a drawer and pulling out a piece of fabric. It was a beige-colored skirt that looked like it would reach down to the Hokage's knees if she wore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my emergency skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeat. \"Why do you have an emergency skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you some advice, kid. A ninja should be prepared for any situation the world throws at them. Ever since I took this damn job, I've gone over many hypotheticals in my head. And in all of them, let's just say I'm glad to have an extra skirt around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess,\" said Naruto, leaning back in her seat and looking smugly at the older woman, her embarrassment almost forgotten. \"You were playing strip poker, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" roared Tsunade, fixing a fearsome death glare on the girl. \"Do you want to put something on or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" said Naruto, snatching the garment. \"But don't say I didn't warn you if this thing ends up un-wearable for both of us.\"</span></div></div>",

The skirt was way too big for and way too long, but right now, she would happily wear anything, even one of Lee's hideous green jumpsuits. But soon enough, the thread quickly frayed, the cloth miraculously tore, and the already loose garment became even looser. Soon, it was just a pile of rags at Naruto's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed sadly. She knew that would happen, of course, but she still felt disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata herself had come to during the magical skirt unraveling. The poor girl was as red as a tomato and was doing her best to look at everything but Naruto. But she managed to forget about the very naked teen next to her when she saw the skirt magically destroy itself. \"How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could think of an answer, from outside the room, Anko's voice proclaimed: \"Yo! I'm here to see the Hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't receive an order for your invitation,\" said a chuunin guard sheepishly. He had finally awoken and was trying to act as though nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you shouldn't be sleeping on the job then,\" said the feisty kunoichi. \"While your head's in the gutter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her in,\" said Tsunade, unlocking the door and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Anko said with an impatient sigh. \"I'm telling you, Hokage, something's going on with all your flunkies. They seem to be-\" she stopped when she caught sight of the naked blonde. \"Helloooooooo, what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade promptly slid the door shut. \"Believe me, I plan to have a very strong word with those morons outside. And as for the naked girl, she's unimportant right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply shot her a death glare. When she felt that Anko's eyes were still gawking her form, she transferred it over to her: \"You want to take a picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just comparing size is all,\" the special jonin smirked. \"You're not bad, but I've still got you beat. Maybe you'll fill out fully in few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fill YOU out!\" Naruto roared, getting up from her seat. Hinata had to hold her back from attempting to rip the snickering special jonin's eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there's something familiar about you,\" she said. \"I swear I've seen you before, though I have the distinct impression that you were wearing more at the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted to get their attention. \"Anko, I need you to tell me if you know anything about this scroll that our nudist friend discovered in one of the training fields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing?\" Anko said, picking it up. \"What makes you think I'd know anything about it?\" She began to unfurl it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, don't open that!\" barked Tsunade. The special jonin froze in place. \"And second of all, because I suspect it belonged to your old sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer completely vanished from Anko's face. \"So another one of...<i>his</i> old labs have been found,\" she said in an icy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a lab,\" said Naruto, calming down and planting her bare behind back in the seat. \"It was a seal in the ground that opened up a big hole. The scroll was the only thing in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just a stash where he kept some of his old stuff,\" Anko nodded understandably. \"Those are still potentially very dangerous. My...sensei rigged a lot of them with deadly traps. Looks like you lucked out and stumbled upon one of his far less secure caches. Or at least got out unscathed. Who knows what could have happened, or what horrors you could have unleashed on the people of Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was enjoying the relative tranquility of his team's usual training grounds. There were no distractions around to bug him at all. No orange-clad idiots saying: \"I'm going to be Hokage\" and \"You're my eternal rival!\" No pink-haired fools saying: \"Will you go out with me tonight?\" Hell, there were no females around whatsoever to eye him like a piece of meat. It was only him and his thoughts, just the way he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke had first been honing his ninjutsu skills, seeing if he could increase the range of his fire-controlling abilities. When that was done, he spent time demolishing the training dummies with some basic kicks and punches, to see if he could increase the amount of force he could put into them. And now, he was simply running laps around the field. Not the most exciting or flashy part of his usual routine, but still very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until his feet came down onto empty air instead of the solid earth that he was used to. It only took Sasuke a second to realize that he was falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was: \"<i>Where the hell did this hole come from?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was soon followed by: <i>OW, MY NECK!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko had to suppress a giggle whenever she looked at the naked teenager, who was visibly glaring at her like a petulant child. The sight just had a way of stifling the tension in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say she got out unscathed,\" said Tsunade. \"For Naruto's current predicament, as you can see, is a result of opening that scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, Naruto,\" said Anko thoughtfully. \"Where have I heard that name before? Oh yeah, I remember now. The mouthy brat from the Chuunin Exams. Wait, that's who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you're the creepy proctor with the blood fetish.\" Naruto pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You attitude hasn't improved,\" said Anko. \"But I must say, your outfit certainly has. Tan is so much more stylish than orange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some of this?\" said Naruto, standing up while still trying to cover her nakedness. Hinata silently tugged on her arm, pleading her to calm down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I know what's going on,\" said the snake ninja, turning back to the Hokage. \"Orochimaru came up with something...a jutsu, a seal, don't remember, that could essentially freeze someone's transformation. They would become whatever they turned into, inside and out. They're old form would be gone, and as a side effect, or maybe a fail-safe, the old transformation technique would no longer have effect on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed at the unpleasant memories that began to surface. \"It was...awful, some of the things he would do. He'd turn people into matching twins, just so he could properly experiment on the same genetic sequence over and over again. Or turn people into farm animals, which he would send to the butcher shops. Or he would just turn living souls into inanimate objects, like rocks or kunai. And they'd be stuck that way forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gasped in horror at that revelation, and even Naruto shuddered, her temper completely forgotten. To think, what she could have ended up as if Ebisu of all people hadn't provoked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Tsunade. She pressed her intercom button again. \"Summon the following genin to my office now: Uchiha Sasuke, Haruno Sakura, and, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megumi, Miki, Asako, Nishi, Leiko, and Suzu\" said Hinata in rapid order, thankful she recognized and remembered the faces of the former classmates she encountered earlier today. They were probably still mad at her for her surprise attack, but they didn't deserve to be permanently transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them too. Thank you, Hinata.\" Tsunade leaned back in her chair. \"Let's hope not a single one of them used a certain <i>simple academy level jutsu</i> today,\" she groaned, shooting a reproachful glare at Naruto. \"Your carelessness really has unleashed something on Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm the one who's suffering here!\" protested Naruto. \"If what Blood Lady there has said is true, then I'm stuck as a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, does this mean I can't ever use the transformation technique ever again either?\" said Hinata. \"I'm still under the effects of the scroll as well.\"</span></div></div>",

She agreed to have her name legally changed just as her sex, appearance, and very life all had in one fell instance. Going by her old name just didn't feel...right anymore. And compared to all the alterations she had just undergone, it was very miniscule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade promised that she would do everything in her power to help Naruko. She would research the effects of the scroll, understand its intricacies, and try to find some way to reverse its effects on Naruko's body. But she made no such promises detailing how long it would take. It could be months, years, maybe even decades. And until then, Naruko was just going to have to live with it. Live completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPublic nudity wasn't legal in Konoha, but due to her unique circumstances, it was only natural that Naruko be made exempt from those laws. She was permitted to be nude anywhere and everywhere at all times, and no one could discriminate or refuse service to her based on her nudity. Though Tsunade had to apologetically remind Naruko that even with legal protection, she would still likely face prejudice here and there. Which is just what Naruko needed; more reason for people to give her crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata offered to walk her home, in that usual weird stilted way she always did. It was a tempting offer, but Tsunade wanted to keep the Hyuga girl under observation along with the rest of the genin who had been affected, to see if the irregularities in her chakra would naturally dissipate as Anko explained. Naruko was still invited to stay in the tower to wait it out, but she decided to turn it down for now. She didn't really want to have to face Sakura, Sasuke, and all of his fangirls right now; they were all likely still pissed about that incident in the street, and would be even more mad for the inconvenience she had further wrought on them all (especially if one of them actually did use a transformation technique). And besides, for once in her life, Naruko wanted to be alone. She had a lot to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the old lady wouldn't allow her to leave without an escort. That was why Anko was walking beside her this very instant. She had her eyes on all the people that were looking on in stunned silence at the naked blonde. Many gawked at her. Others scowled. Some laughed. One mother shielded her children's eyes. And a lot of men (as well as some women) lost consciousness from sudden blood loss. But luckily, it seemed like everyone was giving the pair a wide berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, you holding up all right over there?\" Anko asked, stealing a glance at Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko simply nodded. She wasn't feeling like herself (which was natural, because she literally wasn't herself anymore), and didn't really to want to talk. She looked like she was in a trance with her thousand-meter stare, and she walked with a stiff stride. One arm was crossed over her chest while the other shielded her crotch, which was the only surefire way she could have any sort of dignity now. Her butt was still bare for all to see, and while her nipples were covered, her breasts were squished tightly against her arm. Every small step she took caused them to jiggle noticeably. Her weak attempts to cover up were doing little to take away her natural allure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I heard Ebisu showed up in town with only one boot and a pile of rags that used to be his chuunin vest. People were mistaking him for a deranged hobo, especially since he was ranting and raving about some bright flash of light or other out in the fields. Whodda' thunk you had something to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko responded with another silent nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko rolled her eyes. \"C'mon kid, say something already. You're creeping me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko looked down as if mulling over what to say. She regretted the act as it only put her bare body into sight and once more reminded her of the fact that she was naked. Finally, after a moment, she shrugged and said: \"This is...going to take a while to get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you being so bashful anyway?\" said Anko. \"Didn't you take this form precisely so you could do,\" she paused to watch a fruit merchant do a double-take on Naruko before he tripped over his wagon of produce, \"that to people? Hell, the word is you even took out Sarutobi with that technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko shrugged. \"I dunno. I guess it's...I never really considered this form to be, well, me before. It was like I was just putting on a costume and playing a part in a movie or something. It wasn't me, it was someone else. I could turn into a naked girl and flaunt it no problem, but there's no way I would actually strip naked in public. Not outside the baths anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you feel it became 'real' when your change became permanent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" Naruko scowled when she felt her foot plod into something moist and squishy. She almost dared not look down, but when she did, she was relieved to see it was just a patch of damp mud. Without the option to wear shoes anymore, she would have to take extra care to watch where she stepped now. Who knows what disgusting things there were on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slut!\" someone shouted to their left. \"Skank!\" another taunted. Naruko flinched at both those comments, looking like she had been physically struck both times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let those assholes get to you,\" said Anko, putting a reassuring hand on the naked ninja's bare shoulder. She had personal experience with people like them, especially since she didn't have the most modest wardrobe herself. \"They're just jealous they don't have your good looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose there's also that,\" said Naruko sadly. \"People are going to be treating me different now. Anyone who liked or tolerated me before are now going to think less of me because of...well, this.\" She looked down at her body again and shook her arms without removing them from their places, to emphasize her nakedness. \"And just when I was starting to feel accepted for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko didn't know how to respond to that. It was a feeling she herself shared. Being the sole student of the traitor Orochimaru made the ignoramuses in the village cast a lot of suspicion on her, and she could already feel it creeping back in ever since his most recent attack. The fox sealed up inside Naruko likely already put a lot on the teen's plate, and this latest event just added more to the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached Naruko's apartment. Having lost her key to wherever the hell her clothing went when she transformed, Naruko had to crouch down to fetch her spare from where it was hidden under a floorboard. Anko didn't show it, but she couldn't help but feel disappointment when the blonde didn't bend over. She would have liked to have taken a good view of her ass; from what she had seen during the walk, it looked very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid,\" the dark-haired kunoichi said as Naruko entered the apartment, now no longer bothering to cover herself up. The naked ninja turned her head backwards to address Anko with an unreadable expression. \"I know it's only a small consolation, but...you do look very good naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Thanks,\" Naruko said monotonously before shutting the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruko was glad to finally have some privacy. There were no more leering eyes eating up every inch of her bare skin, following the wobbling motions of her hips, and ignoring her face in favor of her bouncing bosoms, among other things. No one was judging her harshly for something she didn't choose, or passing out from sudden blood loss. While Naruko normally enjoyed being the center of attention, it had...proven to be too much during the walk home. And the worst part was that it wasn't the last time she would be dealing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ensure she had complete privacy, Naruko pulled all the curtains in the place shut before laying down on her bed. She winced slightly as she felt the mattress and sheets rub against her skin and mold themselves into her curves. It wasn't an unpleasant feeling. On the contrary, it was very nice. But it was another reminder that she was naked right now. And female. And she was always going to be naked and female now, whether she liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're going to be naked forever.</i> Tsunade's words cut into her again. Over and over they ran through her mind, like some irritatingly catchy commercial jingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agghh,\" she groaned, turning to her side as if that would shake the words out of her mind. All it did was just expose more of her bare flesh to the bed. Her right breast brushed against the sheets, while her nipple squished tightly into the mattress, sending small alien electric tingles straight through the little nub and up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko sat up with a start and looked at her nipple. It seemed to be a little longer than she remembered. Absently, she gave it a slight pinch , which sent another jolt through her body. It was harder too. Odd. It never did that when she was a boy. Then again, she never checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting used to a female body was hard enough. But having it be on constant display to her eyes and the elements, reminding her of every miniscule difference from her old self all the time, was making the effort even steeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're going to be naked forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko scowled. If those words wouldn't shut up, then she was going to make them. How? By proving them wrong as she always did. She was Uzumaki Naruko. She could beat this curse! She marched to her dresser and pulled out a random article of clothing, some black shirt with the symbol of the Leaf on it. She wasn't even able to squeeze her head through before it split apart. She tried putting on a few more things, including a pair of boxers and a sock. The same thing happened both times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" she hissed, fighting back her tears. It was just like back at the academy, when she failed again and again, just like every asshole said she would. Was there <i>nothing</i> she could put on? Was there anything her body would allow to grace her bare skin? Something to make her feel...at least a little normal? A small glimmer at the top of the dresser caught her eye; it was the crystal necklace Tsunade had given her. Naruto had neglected to put it on this morning when he went to go train in that fateful field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this'll work,\" she said, picking it up. Surely, her body would let her wear a little jewelry, right? But when she held it over her head, she stopped. She knew what would happen; it would be rendered un-wearable just like everything else she put on today. And though she figured that maybe just the band would snap the instant it touched her neck, she didn't want to risk damaging the crystal. It was a gift from Tsunade, signifying the sage's blessing for Naruko to pursue her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the nude girl placed it down on the dresser. No, she could not just throw it away. She would not throw it away, not out of some desperate bid for something so...so...inconsequential. So what if she was nude? That didn't mean she couldn't do what she wanted, right? Everyone said she couldn't do this. Everyone said she couldn't do that. And since when the hell did Uzumaki Naruko listen? No, she would rather keep the crystal...even if she couldn't wear it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko looked up and paused when her eyes met with those of her reflection in the mirror. It was odd to see herself like this. The face was familiar enough to her male form, it had the same general round shape, the same small nose, the same blue eyes, and of course, those same whisker-like marks that lined her cheeks. But there were also a great number of differences. They were all small and subtle, with a nip here and a tuck there, but there were a lot of them, and they added up to make her look like a different person altogether. Her chin was slightly more narrow, her eyes seemed to be a tad larger, her eyelashes were darker, her brows were much thinner, and her lips were just a bit more fuller, among other things. It wasn't quite like she was looking at herself, but more like at a long-lost relative she had never met. Which itself was odd, because Naruko should have been intimately aware of every single alteration to her face; she had spent a good amount of time molding and creating it after all. But still, the fact that this was her face now, and not just a mask of sorts as it used to be, was a little hard to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if staring at her feminine face was strange, looking at her body was downright surreal. She was built much more differently from Naruto for one thing. Whereas he felt short and stumpy, Naruko was a good head-and-a-half taller with long slender legs. She knew she was not the tallest girl around, but she was tall enough that she had to back away a bit and lean forward in order to get a good view of herself in the mirror, something she didn't need to do previously. Performing these simple actions made her breasts bounce oh so slightly. Really, it seemed that every action she made, no matter how small, would cause them to jiggle in some capacity; there was just no escaping it. Her breasts themselves, while not approaching the dimensions of Tsunade's, were still appropriately perky globes, round and smooth save for the red nipples that almost brought them to a sharp point. They overlooked a thin but firm waist and stomach that indicated she spent a lot of time working out. Her hips weren't too wide, but they had just enough girth to give herself an hourglass figure. And in between her legs was a small shock of carefully-groomed blond hair that seemed to add just enough brightness to her tan flesh down there. To her tanned flesh of course, as well as the dark slit beneath it that right now was bursting with a hint of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko blushed. Just staring at her body, her totally, completely, gloriously nude body, was having an effect on her. She couldn't explain why, but she was just feeling some need to...touch herself. She turned away, hoping that it would cause the feeling to fade. It didn't. And without even fully realizing it, she could already feel her hands tracing the gentle curves of her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so good,\" she whispered, as one hand trailed her bare side down to her hip. She felt so smooth and round, and her flesh ran like silk through her fingers. Stealing a glance behind her, she got a good long look at her butt in the mirror. She didn't get a lot of chances to look at it, but what she saw was...nice. It wasn't big, but it was round, bubbly, and equal parts smooth and firm to the touch, with a notable flex in her cheeks as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure: she <i>did</i> look good naked. Which came as no surprise; Naruko designed this body to look this way and this way only, so as to be appealing to as many people as humanely possible. And it seemed that Naruto was no exception. And naked she would be, for there was not a single thing covering her body. Every square inch of skin, every rippling muscle, every wiggling toe, every moving joint, every shifting bone, every curve, every crevice...all of it was exposed to the world for everyone to see. To enjoy. From the nape of her neck, to the pit of her navel, to the periodic parting and opening of her poofy lower lips. Everyone could see them. Everyone could notice them. And everyone would, no matter what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're going to be naked forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face the mirror again, Naruko looked her form up and down, drinking it all up and letting it sink in. \"This is my life now,\" she said. \"This is who I am...\"</span></div></div>",

She hadn't had any ramen today, so that seemed as good as anything. And besides, after what happened to her today, she deserved to treat herself. She opened the fridge to go fetch a cup, only to see it was empty. No ramen, no fruit, no milk, no nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I was planning on going to the store today.\" She looked down at her body, which was as bare as it had been for the past couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze up. If she wanted to eat, she would have to go outside in the buff again. And despite her earlier declaration to just accept her nudity...she was suddenly finding it hard to actually follow through with it. It was too soon to go outside, she still needed time to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, her stomach would not allow it. It groaned again, louder this time, as if commanding her to go get more food. \"Guess I gotta face the music eventually,\" she muttered. Chewing her lower lip nervously, Naruko put her hand on the doorknob, squeezed her eyes shut, and swung it open before she could give herself a chance to change her mind. The warm sun hit her naked skin with all the force of a charging bull, and Naruko knew that this was going to be the most harrowing trip through Konoha she had ever experienced.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Naruko wasn't quite ready to face him or his daughter just yet. It was one thing to be seen as a naked girl by complete strangers. It was another to be seen by people she was well acquainted with. More than that, she didn't think she could handle their reactions to her current state. Teuchi and Ayame were nice people who always treated Naruto right. If either of them saw her naked, she would just die from embarrassment! But worse, what if they rejected her? What if they called her mean names like \"slut\" or a \"skank\" just because she didn't have any clothes on? What if they barred their services and food from her? Naruko just knew her heart would break in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe permanently naked ninja wiped her eyes, which were starting to tear up again. Now was not the time to feel sorry for herself. She'd cross that bridge when she reached it, and she didn't need to reach it today. Right now, she just needed to pick up some groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no need to stay completely undercover anymore (but still desperately wishing to), Naruko swiftly took to the roofs to cut across town as fast as she possibly could. A few Anbu needed to remove their masks when she passed them by, for fear that they might drown in their own blood otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Naruko was halfway to the store before she realized she hadn't brought her froggy wallet with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was not having a good day. First there was Sakura's persistent badgering him for a date. Then there were the fangirls. Then there was the naked freak who tried molesting him in the street. And now there was that mysterious hole he fell in. While he hadn't broken any bones, he landed in such a way that his neck was smarting really bad. It felt as if he was being stabbed by a hundred superheated kunai all at once. The only way to minimize the pain was to keep his neck bent at an odd angle, but even then, it was still stinging like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'm going to get to the hospital,\" he groaned through clenched teeth as he limped across the training field. \"And then, I'm going to find the bastard that dug that hole, and MURDER them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhhh, he couldn't wait for that. First he'd flay their fingers one by one with the rustiest blade in his collection. Then he'd shove their face into a fire, and savor the smell as their skin melted in his grasp. Then he'd hack off their limbs, stab them through the stomach, and maybe try doing that \"blood eagle\" thing he read about. For he walked the dark path of the AVENGER! And he would let no wrong go unpunished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his current pace was going slow, and as Sasuke drew closer to the village proper, he realized there were more problems to deal with. At his current state, he really couldn't run, leap, or perform complex jutsus. So if a fangirl, or two, or three, were to find him, there really wouldn't be much he could do. He'd be trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let them see me,\" he muttered. \"There's only one thing I can do to prevent that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasping his hands into the sign of the dog, the Uchiha prodigy began to invoke the transformation technique.</span></div></div>",

The only thing the Uchiha had to worry about was bumping into one of his teammates. Fortunately, the probability of that happening was very low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Sasuke realize is that possibly running into either Sakura or Naruto was soon going to be the least of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to limp his way into the village before he needed to take a breather. Not out of tiredness, but because his neck was really killing him. \"Ugh,\" he grunted in Sakura's voice, leaning against a building. \"When I find who did this to me, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruno Sakura?\" a stoic voice inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked up into the menacingly white mask of an Anbu glowering down at him. \"The Hokage requests your immediate presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\" said Sasuke. \"No, no, you have the wrong idea.

She <i>knew</i> this would happen. She just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hokage-sama, I found one of the genin you requested,\" said the Anbu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Tsunade replied with a fake smile. \"Leave 'Sakura' here and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" he said. \"Shall I continue the search for the rest of the genin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not be necessary,\" said the Hokage. \"Resume your normal duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone, the Hokage wasted no time in dragging the pink-haired Uchiha down the hallway as if he were a disobedient child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow,\" Sasuke moaned through gritted teeth. The pain was getting really bad now. \"I don't know what's going on, ow, here, but first of all, I'm not Sakura. And second of all, <i>something's wrong with my neck!</i> OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stopped and took a moment to appraise him. She looked him up and down with an irritated eye. \"For your first point,\" she said in a dangerously low whisper, \"I know. And for your second,\" she seized the Uchiha by the sides of his head and lifted him off the ground without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Sasuke screamed in his now girly voice as he flailed his arms and legs around. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?! STOP IT, STOP IT! OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJitters of pain were wracking through him like the continuous shots of a repeating crossbow. Every sting felt like it gave way to another one that was even greater than the last. He thrashed his arms about wildly in a bid to get this crazy woman away from him, but her grip never wavered. She simply lifted him up until she was looking him square in the eye with an annoyed expression. Then, with a flick of her wrists, she twisted Sasuke's head to the side. There was an explosion of pain, a loud pop of bones clicking into place, and then...nothing. Without further ado, Tsunade dropped the Uchiha to the floor like a wet sack of potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Sasuke would not have appreciated being treated so callously. Even if she was the Hokage, he would have given Tsunade a sound piece of his mind in the form of a punch to the solar plexus for her behavior. But whatever anger the normally moody genin felt was drowned out by utter relief. The pain in his neck was gone and he could move it again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" said the Hokage in a tone indicating she already knew what his answer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sasuke, taking a deep breath and pushing himself off the ground. \"I suppose I should thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you should,\" said Tsunade. \"But you'll probably want to save it. Because you're about to hear some very bad news.\" She opened the door, and Sasuke, still in the form of Sakura, suddenly found himself staring into the large green eyes of his pink-haired teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" said Sakura with clear confusion. Questions had been lingering on her mind, and nobody was explaining anything to her. Not the Anbu who brought her here, not the doctors and staff that were on wait, and not the Hokage who looked her over. All they did was order her to not cast any jutsus, sealed her chakra to prevent her from doing just that for the next few hours, and locked her in a hospital room as if she was a prisoner of war. It was very odd, and a little frightening to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be forthright with you now,\" said the Hokage as she led the Sakura double inside. \"Starting with this: the young lady who I've just brought in is your fellow teammate, Uchiha Sasuke.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip back to Naruko's apartment really wasn't that long, but the increased time being naked in the public eye was dismaying for her. Worse than that, one problem after another surfaced the very moment she got back. First she had to turn the whole place inside-out just to find Gama-chan (only to see that he had somehow rolled under the bed). Then she realized she had no pockets to put him in. She was able to solve that problem by using an old kunai pouch as an impromptu purse (and was delighted that just draping the strap over her shoulder didn't destroy it). But now that she was tucked away safely in the shelter of her home, Naruko then had to work up the gumption to go outside in all her naked glory again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did it, at the loud insistence of her stomach, and had finally reached the store. And as always, the second she set one bare foot into the door, all eyes were on her. But Naruko couldn't be bothered by them right now. She just wanted her food, and she wanted it now. So without missing a beat or looking anyone in the eye, she simply picked up a shopping basket and went on her way as if wandering around in the buff was the most natural thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Naruko sauntered down to the aisles where the most vital of the four food groups was hidden: cup ramen. Licking her lips in anticipation, Naruko just about filled her entire basket with the heavenly food that only the gods could create. Many would call her a fanatic for her devotion to the noodle, the broth, and the narutomaki. She called them blind lacking faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that anyone here was literally blind. On the contrary, they could see quite well. Naruko never felt the eyes of her fellow shoppers leave her once. They followed her form everywhere she went, drinking in her bare curves every step of the way. They were glued to the bouncing motions of her breasts, the swaying movements of her hips, and the shifting muscles in her limbs. And there was nothing she could do to stop them. She had no way to change or obscure her form. She had no way to even cover herself. The only thing she could do was exist as this naked teenage woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange. Naruko felt incredibly embarrassed to be given this kind of attention, and for certain parts of her anatomy to be given the lion's share of said attention. But there was something else there. She didn't know how to describe it, but it wasn't unpleasant. It was...kind of like she was sitting next to a bonfire. There was a great warmth building up within her, namely in her cheeks, in her chest, in her thighs, and...somewhere deep in her pelvis. And it was making her want to touch herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko tried to banish the thought from her head. She couldn't do that here of all places. It wouldn't be appropriate. Satisfied that she had enough ramen to last her all week, Naruko swiftly departed for the produce section so she could get herself some fruits and vegetables, and hopefully keep her mind on the present. That proved to be a vain effort, for along the way, she passed by a mirror that displayed her body. Her totally, completely, absolutely bare-ass naked female body. The heat in her only increased as she saw her reflection nakedly walk by, and she couldn't help but cop a quick feel on herself, running a hand down her breast and all the way to her groin. She had to bite her lip to keep herself from moaning out loud. Why did she have to feel so <i>good</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked shinobi tried to get her mind out of the gutter, but looking at the fruit did nothing of the sort. A collection of peaches caught her eye, each one the color of human flesh and looking like pliable pair of buttocks. Much like the one she was giving everyone in Konoha a free view of. And then there were the melons, all of them round, firm, juicy, and just the right size of an average human breast. She even managed to find a couple that, upon lifting them up to her chest, were each about the size of her own boobs. She pushed them into her breasts and shuddered as she felt her hardened nipples bend and slide into their firm skins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it, what's happening to me? I'm getting way too turned on here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko hastily dropped the melons into her basket. She then grabbed several other items and threw them in too, not bothering to check what exactly she was gathering. She had no idea what was going on, but the fruit was...affecting her. How, she had no idea, but she didn't want to find out. At least, not in here. She still had some more things to get, and she desperately needed to keep her head in the game. She only hoped she would last that long.</span></div></div>",

That honor belonged to the distinct dampness she was feeling between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I sweating? No, that can't be it, I'm not hot at all. Did some water splash on me? I distinctly remember being completely dry when I came in here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could have a chance to see what was going on with her body, a nasally voice suddenly called out: \"Miss.\" Ah crap. She hoped that wasn't addressed to her. She really did not want to deal with anyone right now. Naruko ducked into an aisle, hoping against hope and silently praying to every god she knew that the speaker would leave her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pattering of footsteps behind her helped to remind Naruko why she was not a spiritual person. \"Miss, you can't walk around here like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko turned to address the speaker. It was a...well, actually, the boy-turned-girl couldn't tell what this person was. He/she wasn't particularly attractive, with a plump build, curly black hair, thick glasses, and androgynous features overall. The stranger, who Naruko assumed had to be some sort of store manager, honestly looked like he or she could swing either way. Even the voice revealed nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, I can explain,\" said Naruko as she shuffled a hand into her makeshift purse.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I don't care what your reasons are,\" said the manager, who seemed to be looking away from Naruko and glaring at the shelves to the left. \"But I will not allow this kind of behavior in my store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko had just been about ready to withdraw the document she received from Tsunade before leaving her office. It described Naruko's clothing-destroying condition, her subsequent right to be nude at all times in the village and its surrounding territories, and contained both the Hokage's signature and official seal to let all readers know it was genuine. By waving it around, it was hoped it would get people to back down when they decided to give Naruko hell for her nudity. However, Naruko was beginning to feel oddly mischievous despite it all. Sure, she could show it to this annoying sexless ass and hopefully be on her way, but where would the fun in that be? If the manager was going to be given an up-close view of Naruko's naked body, then Naruko might as well give him/her something to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the oddest thing, but Naruko was finding herself to no longer be quite so embarrassed by her nudity. She didn't know why either. Was she distracted by the growing heat under her skin and the wetness between her legs? Or was the prospect of once again getting into the character of the sexy seductress she had originally created this body for? Whatever it was, the prankster in her was calling, and she wasn't one to turn it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't?\" she asked, tilting her head while giving the manager a hurt expression. \"Not even if I did something...special for you?\" At this, the naked ninja gripped her shopping basket in both hands and lowered it, causing her breasts to squeeze tantalizingly together. It was a sight that no one could possibly resist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe androgynous manager could only sputter in exasperation as he (Naruko hoped it was he anyway) turned red everywhere. \"Th-this is your last warning!\" he bellowed. \"Get out of my store now or I'll call the authorities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruko was mad as well. Looked like this jerk wouldn't succumb to her charms after all. Standing up straight, she gave the manager an icy glare of her own and said: \"Hmph, fine. Be that way. I'll just have you know that this is a medical condition I have. Here, look at this.\" She promptly shoved Tsunade's document into the stranger's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" he growled, his eyes roaming its text. \"This is a forgery. It has to be!\" He held it up to the light, to see that the right paper was used and all the proper watermarks were in place. They were. \"I don't believe this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko almost retorted with a \"Believe it,\" but she thought better of it. The last time she put those two words together (back when she was a he, anyway) she woke up in the hospital and needed to be fed from a tube for a day-and-a-half. Shaking from that memory, she settled by putting a hand on her hip (and shuddered again from the contact she made with her lovely female flesh) and said: \"If you have a problem, you can take it up with Gra-I mean, the Hokage herself.\"</span></div></div>",

If anyone was looking (and lots of people were), they could almost see the sparks flying between the two. For a solid minute, they both silently dared the other to make a move or back down, standing as still as statues the entire time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell mostly, anyway. Naruko was still feeling very warm all over, very touchy, and there was no more doubt in her mind that the moisture between her legs had been building up. She could already feel a few drops fall from her crotch and spatter on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she looked steely on the outside, Naruko was internally screaming in horror. <i>Ah crap! What the hell is wrong with me? Am I peeing myself right here in the store? I can't be, it doesn't feel like that at all. Oh, I hope nobody saw that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the manager broke contact away from Naruko's harsh blue eyes. He/she roughly handed the paper to her and crossed his/her arms while glaring at something to side as if it was the most hideous thing in the world. The silent communication was there: \"Fine, you win, now get out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko spun on her heel and marched away, satisfied for showing this androgynous jerk what for. She walked with a confident swagger, swaying her butt to and fro with greater intensity, silently retorting: \"Kiss my eternally naked ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager glared at the hussy's impudence, and stepped forward to have another word with her...only to slip on a few drops of liquid that hadn't been there before and fell to the floor with a soft crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko quickly shuffled away, hoping to put as much distance between herself and the cranky person as possible. She only had to get some milk now and then she could be on her way. It was all smooth sailing for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. The refrigerated food section had rows of glass doors lining both ends of the aisle and Naruko could see her reflection in all of them. It was faint, it was dark, but it was there, with her bare breasts, hardened nipples, toned stomach, long legs, and bush on one side, and her firm buttocks and naked back on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kami, I'm so naked,</i> she thought, involuntarily raising her free hand to squeeze her breast. <i>I'm so completely naked and I can't put anything on and nobody can make me-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko slammed her hand on the glass door where the milk cartons were being stored and grit her teeth. She had to stay in control. She couldn't let herself succumb to the...to the...effects her naked body was having on her. <i>Deep breaths, Naruko. Just get your milk and get out of here.</i> She opened the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And gasped when the cold air washed over her bare skin. Kami, this was unreal. Her nipples seemed to have frozen solid in the cold while the wetness in her vagina increased tenfold, as did the tingling sensations shooting through every pore of her flesh. Feeling a flowing sensation in her crotch, she squeezed her legs together in an attempt to stem the tide or at least hide what was happening. It had little effect; she could still feel a flow of something pushing out and dribbling down her legs. And the feeling of her bare thighs rubbing against one another only increased her pleasure and caused even more to want to come out. More and more trickled out, slowly but steadily like water from a spring, and Naruko had to bite her lip from moaning out loud. The sensation did eventually end, but when it did, Naruko was sitting on her knees and her legs were feeling wet and sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I don't think that I pissed myself. But something's happening to me. What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, the high Naruko had previously been feeling was gone. She started to feel self-conscious again. She blushed, not from an inner warmth that was coming over her, but from embarrassment once more. All she could think about now was that she was a girl, she was NAKED, and EVERYONE COULD SEE HER. And judging by the number of unconscious bodies now littering the floor, many people had. But more than that, the former boy was starting to feel afraid about the unknown ways her female body was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed a carton of milk and beelined straight to the cashiers, holding the basket at waist level to at least hide her crotch and the mess it left on her legs. She all but dumped her food on the conveyor belt, wanting to just get this ordeal over with as soon as possible. But fate had other ideas, for the clerk took one bug-eyed look at Naruko's nude body and promptly fell to the floor, blood spurting out of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko whimpered, realizing that she was going to be stuck here a little while longer.</span></div></div>",

But luck eventually found Naruko, and after she had all of her food bagged up, she was out of the store like a lightning bolt. The trip back home was thankfully uneventful. The big bag of groceries provided the naked kunoichi with some coverage from the front. And better yet, a sun shower helped to clean her up a bit and ensured that there were fewer people walking around. But she could still feel all the eyes following her every movement. And at one point, Naruko swore she heard a yip from Akamaru and a lewd comment from Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as always, she persevered. She was finally home, and she couldn't get inside fast enough. She just about kicked her door in and slammed it shut in one fluid motion. Now safe from prying eyes, the blonde slid down to the floor, shivering a little when her bare butt made contact with the cool floor. Kami, this was too much. She thought she could handle being out and about buck naked in public, but that shopping trip had taken it all out of her. She just wanted to lock the door and huddle under her blanket for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer groaning stomach told her to do otherwise. \"Okay,\" she muttered, standing back onto her feet. \"Food first. THEN huddle for rest of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko didn't bother boiling any water; she just poured regular tap water straight into a cup of ramen. While she preferred it hot like most people, she just didn't have the patience to wait any longer now. At least for her first serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the blonde girl slumped at her table and slurped up her cold noodles, all the while trying to ignore the alien sensation of her butt flattening into her chair. It was odd; she was hungry, but she couldn't find it in herself to savor the taste as she always did. She didn't bother rolling the noodles across every square centimeter of her tongue to enjoy their stringy texture. She didn't bother picking out the juiciest bits of meat either. All she did was chew on whatever her chopsticks could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of the trip were on her mind. The feeling of the sun and wind on her every bare inch of feminine skin. The lustful gazes. The bloody noses. And most of all, the weird moistness that came out of her...out of her...ugh. Just acknowledging that she had a completely different set of genitals now was enough to give her a headache. Worse, Naruko had no idea what had happened to...it in the store, but whatever it was, it kind of worried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Plip.</i> A batch of noodles slipped out of her chopsticks and back into the broth. Looking down, Naruko could see why: her fingers were shaking uncontrollably. No, what happened in the store hadn't worried her. It frightened her to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after reaching for her second cup of ramen did Naruko realize that there were tears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been some time since Hinata had been released from the hospital. The effects of the scroll had worn off and she could safely transform again, so all was well with her. However, the young Hyuga didn't seem all too eager to go home just yet. For one thing, she felt she needed to find at least one of her teammates so she could apologize for standing them up on their little get-together. But more than, she couldn't get the image of a certain naked blond girl out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Hinata hadn't stopped thinking about Naruko ever since she left the Hokage's office with Anko. She tried to tell herself it was nothing unusual; she thought about him regularly after all, back when he was a boy. And a lot of the time, her thoughts were...not innocent at all. But it was different now; she was thinking not of Naruto the orange-clad shinobi, but of Naruko the bare naked kunoichi. She burned everything about the blonde's nude body into memory; the swagger of her buttocks, the constant jiggling of her bare breasts, her slender but strong back, her long legs, her gorgeous waist-length hair tied back into girly pigtails, the soles of her feet...Hinata had seen <i>everything</i>. And for reasons she couldn't exactly fathom, she wanted to see it all again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hinata wandered around Konoha, hoping to catch sight of the nude beauty, even going so far as to activate her family's unique ability in the hope that she would catch a glimpse of her transformed crush. Alas, she had no luck this time. It was like Naruko had disappeared like a song in the wind. However, even if she couldn't see Naruko, the Hyuga heard a lot about her. Everywhere she went, rumors were flying hard and fast about a mysterious streaker in and around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was right here, just dashing down the street naked as the day she was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw something above me so I looked up, and she was leaping to that roof over there. Her cooch was fiiiiine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that little slut tried raping Sasuke in the middle of the street! Can you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She masturbated right there on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hasn't the Anbu arrested her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This town could use more girls like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the cup ramen! Cup ramen makes girls hot and horny. She was carrying a whole load of the stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if she's a slave of Anko's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on. Hinata paid them little mind as she padded through the streets all the way down to Naruko's apartment. Wondering if the naked ninja was home, the Hyuga activated her Byakugan to look into the walls. Sure enough, her crush was there, in all her naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders suddenly sagged bit, as though a slight weight had come over them. A slight weight that belonged to two miniature versions of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you shouldn't be...doing that,\" said the angelic Hinata, who was wearing a traditional white kimono with blue floral patterns. \"You know it's impolite to look into Naruto, I mean, Naruko-chan's home like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" said Hinata, feeling like she had just been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. She didn't know what had come over her. It wasn't right to go and look into other people's homes or leer at poor Naruko like some creepy lech, and the blunette had always made a point of never peering inside that particular apartment either. After all, she didn't like it when people looked through the walls of her room back in the Hyuga complex. So with a sigh, she quietly deactivated her technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're listening to that wimp,\" said the devilish Hinata, who was wearing a black kimono trimmed with red flame patterns. It was dangerously short so as to obscure no part of her legs, cut low in the front to show off an ample amount of cleavage, and tied so loosely that it was about ready to fall off at any moment. \"You finally find Naruko after looking all over Konoha for her, and you're going to give up just like that? No way, honey! You go right up to that door, take a nice, looooooong look at her hot naked body, and give yourself something to think about tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can't be serious!\" said the angelic Hinata with equal parts alarm and restrained anger. \"Have you no respect for other people's privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Privacy? Pfffft!\" said the devil Hinata with a roll of her lavender eyes and a rasping of her tongue. \"Look at her! Naruko's all pretty now, and can do what every guy dreams of: go right into the women's bath and gawk at all the nubile flesh without end. So let's return the flavor and gawk at her a little bit. Give her a taste of her own medicine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know,\" said Hinata, looking down as she pressed her index fingers together. \"It...doesn't seem very polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel Hinata nearly sighed in relief, but Devil Hinata did not relent. \"Well, if you don't want to settle for simple voyeurism...maybe you could try letting yourself in? Just knock on the door, let gorgeous extend her invitation, and...see where the rest of the day goes for you.\" The little demon gave her mistress a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned beet red at the thought. Naruko...actually letting her inside of the apartment? They'd be all by themselves. Together. And Naruko would be naked. It was...a very tempting thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her angelic counterpart was sputtering in absolute disbelief. \"Th-th-that's even worse! H-Hinata, you know that isn't proper behavior! Pl-please, don't listen to, to...<i>her</i> again. You know what the right thing to do is.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes, Hinata knew what the right thing to do was. But on the other hand...it wouldn't hurt to take a closer look at her permanently naked crush. And who knows...maybe, just maybe, she'd actually muster up the courage to knock on the door this time. So with a tentative step forward and a bite of her lip, the young Hyuga took a tentative step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Hinata's little angel cried as she stepped forward. She pulled at a lock of her mistress' hair, hoping against hope that it would stall the white-eyed blunette, but she carried on as if nothing happened. \"Stop, Hinata-chan! You're better than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged at Hinata again and again, as hard as her little hands were capable of. That was until she felt something suddenly tug on her in turn. Angel Hinata paused in shock, wondering just what had happened. And then a breeze caressed parts of her that normally weren't caressed. Looking down, she could see why: her kimono was gone and she was completely naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for this?\" said Devil Hinata with an evil grin as she waved the garment at her rival. She couldn't believe how easy stealing it was. The poor goody-little-two-sandals never suspected a thing as she snuck behind her and untied her sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you d-doing?!\" cried Angel Hinata as she crossed her hands over her bosoms. \"G-give that back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me,\" grinned Devil Hinata before she vanished with a puff of smoke and a wicked laugh, taking the kimono with her. Angel Hinata let out a tortured murmur before she followed her, her every inch of bare skin burning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head at their antics. They had been acting really weird lately, but she decided a while ago that it was probably best to stay out of their little squabbles. Besides, she had more important matters to attend to and couldn't afford to give herself an opportunity to change her mind. On a normal day, Hinata would have walked away, unable to find the courage to come so close to her crush. But today, she came too far looking for Naruko to just turn back now. So she ascended the stairs to the former boy's apartment, activated her Byakugan, and got ready to take in the sight on the other side of those walls. The sexy, delicious sight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Hinata didn't quite get that. She saw Naruko naked all right. Naked, slurping up noodles, and bawling her eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruko-chan? What's wrong?</i> Never before had Hinata seen her crush look more devastated. The closest she could recall was on the day of the final exam at the academy. But even back then he managed to maintain some quiet form of dignity almost befitting of a Hyuga. His tears had been slow and his cries were silent. But now, Naruko's tears were practically pouring out of her eyes while she sobbed loudly and uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata deactivated her Byakugan, feeling ashamed for wanting to leer at her crush so perversely. Naruko had just undergone a huge change in her life, and here Hinata was treating her like an object of her adolescent lust. She didn't need her shoulder angel to tell her that she should have known better. The signs had been there; the former boy had been out of sorts ever since the Hokage revealed that her condition (and nudity) was permanent. And Kami knows, if the same thing happened to Hinata, she wouldn't have taken it well either.</span></div></div>",

She was going to do what she should have done all those other times she had seen Naruto wallowing alone in his sadness: she was going to go up and talk to him. Or her, as the case was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took a few deep breaths, hoping that they would steady her rapidly beating heart, and gave the door to Naruko's apartment three steady knocks. It took every ounce of willpower to avoid bolting, but she still had to squeeze her eyes shut as the blood rushed to her cheeks. This was it, this was the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crash of something falling over on the other side of the door, followed by a pattering of feet. Bare feet. \"Wh-who is it?\" Naruko asked as she looked through the peephole in a voice full of obviously forced pep. The uncharacteristic stutter and the sniffling sound that followed only served to make her act even less convincing. \"H-Hinata? What do you...what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tightly clasped her hands over her heart. \"N-Naruko-chan? C-can I...can I come...can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only answer she got was a low murmur followed by the sound of footsteps padding away. Hinata's lip began to twitch and her eyes teared up. This is why she never approached the blonde in the past. She knew this would happen, she knew she would be rejected. Just like she had been rejected by the clan elders, her father, her sister, and her cousin. Hinata had to go now. She had to leave this place. Leave this place and never come back. She rubbed her eyes, wheeled around on her heel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can come in n-now,\" said Naruko as the door creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And fell flat on her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kami! Are you okay?\" Naruko gasped as she knelt down to the fallen Hyuga, ignoring the bouncing motions of her bare breasts. Hinata couldn't hear her though. All that ran through her head were those five little words. <i>You can come in now. You can come in now. She...she actually invited me into her home!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was nearly limp as Naruko pried her up off the porch and half-carried, half-dragged her inside with one arm draped across her bare shoulders. The nude blonde hastily deposited her on the bed and put a hand to her forehead, the dreamy smile on the blunette's face completely lost to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She feels warm,\" Naruko mumbled. \"She better not be coming down with a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruko went to go fetch a damp washcloth to put on Hinata's forehead, the Hyuga finally recovered from her stupor. Shaking herself into a sitting position, she turned her gaze over to Naruko's retreating form, taking in every curve, nook, and cranny of her bare body, particularly at the back-and-forth motions of her butt. Hinata didn't know why the blonde's nude form enraptured her so much. She had seen plenty of nude women in her life and never gave a second thought about it. And yet, just seeing her longtime crush in the body of a girl who had no clothes on was definitely having an effect on her. It was like...well, it was really like all those other times she had imagined Naruto naked when he had been male, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y-you're up,\" said Naruko, returning to Hinata's side with her wet cloth in hand. \"You shouldn't move, I-I think you're coming down with a fever or...something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Naruko's face (and trying not to look down at her boobs), Hinata snapped herself back to reality. She wasn't here to be comforted by Naruko (as much as she would like that), she was here to comfort the former boy. The blonde looked like she was trying to put on a strong front, but Hinata didn't need to activate her Byakugan to see right through it. Naruko's eyes were red and puffy from crying, there was a telltale amount of dampness in them from where tears were threatening to erupt, and her speech was still peppered by the occasional verbal stumble, as if she was struggling to not break down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at the apartment didn't paint much of a better picture; the entire place looked like it had been hit by a tornado. Clothes and rags were scattered all over, the floorboards were scratched and scuffed from where furniture had been moved if not outright overturned, and there were numerous empty cups of ramen on the table. Hinata never had Naruto pegged as the tidiest person, but she figured that even her crush wouldn't normally leave things in such an overtly messy state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's nothing, I'm fine\" said Hinata, mentally slapping herself for her own stutter. Now was not the time to be insecure. She needed to be the strong one for once. \"Are <i>you</i> okay, Naruko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm hunky-dory! Never been better,\" said Naruko, putting on the biggest and most artificial grin possible. It ended up looking more like a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not,\" said Hinata softly. Her tone was not accusatory, but it let the blonde know that she saw through the lie and wanted to hear the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did its job. Naruko sighed in defeat, her fake smile disappearing completely. \"No, I'm not.\" She slid a chair over to the bed and took her seat, straddling it so that the backing hid most of her naked body from view. \"I...I just don't know what to do about...this,\" she said, spreading her arms wide to indicate the entirety of her nude female body. \"I'm a freak! I don't know the first thing about being a woman. I can't put on a thing. I can't go anywhere without people insulting me, perving over me, passing out from blood loss, or just giving me hell for something I have no control over. I feel like I'm constantly on the spot when I'm in public like this, and, and,\" the tears once again began to fall out, \"there's n-nothing I can do about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rational thought left her. The blonde let her head fall into her arms where they were folded on the backrest, muffled sobs pouring out of her lips. Hinata herself wanted to cry. Nothing broke her heart more than to see her crush fall so deeply into despair. But something in the normally shy girl held fast. The blonde may not have known it, but she had always been a source of strength and inspiration for Hinata. When no one else gave her a second thought, she could always turn to Naruto, who never gave up even when the whole world was against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now it's my turn to help you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her arms around Naruko's back and hugged her. It was a little awkward to do with the chair backing between them, and Hinata honestly wished they could be closer. But it had the desired effect. When the Hyuga's delicate fingers pressed into Naruko's bare back, her whole form stiffened and her cries stopped. She looked up, her tear-stained cerulean eyes staring directly into Hinata's pearlescent orbs. \"Hinata?\" she said in a small whisper belonging to a lost child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata, digging her fingers even deeper into Naruko's back, tracing the contours of her muscles and silently savoring the touch. \"I know it's tough. I know it's scary. I know it's even really embarrassing. But I also know...that you can get through this. You've dealt with much worse things before, Naruko-chan. Things that could have killed you. And you never let those stop you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko blushed, not quite used to hearing such praise from anyone, let alone the shy little Hyuga. \"Hinata, I...I don't know what to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and if that's not enough,\" Hinata continued, rushing to finish what she had to say before the strength she suddenly found within herself drained completely. \"I-I just want you to know that...I...I'll be here for you.\" She breathed a quick sigh when she was finished, unable to believe that she had actually said that. It wasn't quite the admission of her feelings that she had hoped for, but it was a start. More than that, she hoped it would be enough to help her crush pull herself together. Even if Naruko was stuck as a perpetually naked girl, Hinata would give anything to see her being her old spirited self again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For her part, Naruko was stunned at the Hyuga's words. Why was Hinata acting so...motherly toward her? From what Naruko knew of her, she was a nice girl, if a little weird, and the blonde admitted they had quite a bit in common...but they couldn't really be called friends yet. Could they? They certainly weren't close enough to try and offer this level of emotional support. Not that she was going to refuse it. If there was one thing she was learning about the white-eyed girl, it was that she always knew just what to say when Naruko was feeling down, provided she actually got around to saying it. Already, much of the anxiety she had been feeling for the past couple of hours seemed to be lifting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko liked to think that she was closer to Sasuke and Sakura, but thinking on it, she was having a tough time imagining either of them going this far. Sasuke was just too wrapped up in his own moodiness to consider the feelings of others, and Sakura, when she wasn't too busy fawning over the jerk-face, just didn't have the patience to deal with others. To say nothing of the awkwardness that her nakedness would cause them both (at best). Besides, Naruko was finding herself enjoying Hinata's touch. The way her delicate fingers gracefully pressed into her naked flesh was rather intoxicating. She almost wished she wasn't straddling her chair like this; she wouldn't mind feeling more of the Hyuga's warmth of her bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when she felt two distinct sensations on her chest. Two sensations literally pricking into her chair that brought her back to reality and reminded her of what was truly disturbing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata, it's not just that,\" she said, pulling away and scooching the chair back to put some distance between them. \"There's something wrong with me. I don't know what it is, but I think I might be coming down with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick?\" said Hinata. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But my body, it's...it acts really weird. It never did anything like this before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But Hokage-sama said you were healthy,\" said Hinata in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too! And I feel normal some of the time. And then something happens to me.\" Naruko flushed. She wasn't so sure if she wanted to continue. But another side of her knew that she had to tell someone about the way her body was behaving sooner or later. \"In fact, it's happening right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" said Hinata, wondering if she should call for an ambulance. If something was wrong with Naruko, she would need a trained professional, or even the Hokage herself, to look at her. It was well beyond her knowledge of herbalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These!\" Naruko cried, clutching her breasts and feeling the telltale pinpricks of her nipples going hard and extending outward into them. \"My tits! They're...they're getting all hard and pointy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata started to blush and a large drop of sweat slid its way down her face. \"Um, Naruko-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not only that,\" said the blonde, not allowing her to continue, \"something...something came out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Came out of you? What? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some...fluid. It came out of my...my,\" Naruko paused, not sure what to say. What should she call her new...organ to Hinata? Should she use the proper scientific word they called it in the textbooks back at the academy? No, that just seemed too icky and crude. Maybe that slang term those naughty magazines often used would be more appropriate? No, that was even worse. Perhaps she could use some fruity word that pervy sage usually wrote in those crappy books of his. Like 'lady flower?' Nah, just seemed corny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh to hell with it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...came out from down there,\" she finally said, looking down at her vagina and hoping Hinata would get the message. She winced once she realized it was feeling moist again. <i>Damn it, not now!</i> \"I...thought I wet myself at first, but it didn't look right. Or feel right. Or smell right. But it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata, who was now as red as a cherry. \"That's not a sickness. That's...normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths. This was not going to be a comfortable conversation for either of them. Frankly, she wasn't so sure she would be able to stay conscious for the whole thing. But <i>someone</i> would have to set the record straight for the boy-turned-girl sooner or later. And since she was here, and she had come for the express purpose of helping her crush, it looked like the task had to fall to Hinata. So the Hyuga gathered her thought, counted to ten, and prepared the words she would need to say that would inform her crush about the perils of the female body.</span></div></div>",

That was a blunt way of putting it, but yes, that was exactly what she had said. She was glad her crush was able to get the gist of her words in any case. Because if she didn't, the blunette didn't think she would be able to stay conscious long enough to explain basic female biology in simpler terms. She was feeling dizzy, dripping with nervous sweat, hot all over, and could tell that every inch of her normally fair skin was burning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Hinata idly wondered if Naruko kept a stash of sake hidden somewhere in the apartment. While she typically only drank a sip of it at formal events for ceremonial purposes, the usually proper girl was suddenly feeling an intense desire to down an entire bottle of the hard stuff then and there. Maybe, just maybe, it would stifle her raging nerves (and hormones) like it supposedly did for a lot of older people in stressful situations. Alternatively, it could possibly distract her from the utter embarrassment she had been feeling for the last half-hour. Or maybe it could just knock her unconscious. Hinata hadn't experienced the pleasure of getting drunk yet; now seemed as good a time as any to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" Naruko breathed. \"I was afraid I had one of those yeast infections I heard about. Huh, I always figured girls had to have some equivalent to us guys. Back when I was, uh, male, I would, erm...sometimes go hard...down there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Naruko had likely never even considered tasting alcohol before, Hinata turned her gaze over to a wall. She could try banging her head on it. Maybe that would help her. Unfortunately, a stray thought deep within the gutter of her mind kept her from doing just that. <i>I wonder if Naruto-kun ever got hard thinking of me? Wait, what am I saying?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, sorry. I guess that wasn't the most appropriate thing to say,\" said Naruko, scratching the back of her head while chuckling nervously. \"But, uh, does it happen to you, Hinata? Do you ever, uh...get wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't really any of Naruko's business, but Hinata knew the blonde didn't mean anything perverse by it. She was just curious about her new body, and like it or not, the Hyuga had taken it upon herself to answer all of Naruko's burning questions. Honesty was now her sworn duty! Besides, they were both girls. They could talk about this maturely...right? \"Y-y-yes,\" the Hyuga said in a nearly inaudible whisper while fidgeting uncomfortably. <i>All the time. RIGHT NOW!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, how do you deal with it?\" said Naruko pensively. \"How can I hide if I'm getting, er, wet in the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" said Hinata, looking down shyly as she put her index fingers together. No, as much as she told herself, she wasn't able to talk about this, not even to another girl. \"N-n-normally, g-girls w-w-wear pan-panties that are...that are designed to-to...absorb moisture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko slumped in dismay. \"But I can't wear panties! I can't wear anything at all! There's no way I can hide my...there's no way I can hide this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had no answer for that. All she could do was sit still, try to avoid looking at Naruko's <i>so adorably</i> feminine face hovering over her <i>completely naked</i> body, and stew in her own embarrassment. She wanted to be glad that her crush seemed to be in better spirits now, but that was overwhelmed by her own desire to just melt into the floor. But she couldn't do that. She was supposed to be the strong one here, damn it! Come Hell or high water, she had to maintain that image for her sake as well as Naruko's. Otherwise, she knew she would do something that both of them would regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't pause</i>, she told herself. <i>Just keep talking. You are the strong one. You have to stay in control. Naruko-chan's depending on you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, N-N-Naruko-chan,\" she said, hoping to kill the awkward silence between them...</span></div></div>",

She could try jumping out a window. That would get her out of here quickly. She would probably break a leg from the fall, or go into a coma, but it might be worth it just to put some distance between her and the bare beauty before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dunno,\" said Naruko with a shrug, completely oblivious to the chaos raging inside her white-eyed friend's head. \"I went out to get food and it...just kind of built up over time.\" She began to squeeze her index fingers together, a gesture that was so unlike her, but very much like Hinata. \"It was like...just being naked was...it was embarrassing and all...but looking back on it now, it also felt really...good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming voices in Hinata's head stopped. Somehow, she had dodged a kunai, for it seemed Naruko hadn't minded the question and was answering it honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never once thought about it before,\" said Naruko, dropping her hands back onto her chair backing and looking up wistfully, her embarrassment briefly forgotten about. \"I never really appreciated the way the sun or the wind felt on me until I felt it...all over me. Sometimes, I would just brush against something too, like a counter, and I would notice, because it felt different than when I was clothed. And when I run, I notice when my, erm, breasts bounce, and I kind of liked that too. And then I hit all the cold air when I opened a fridge, and that's when I, um....you know.\" She trailed off and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see,\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that ever happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata still wasn't comfortable about talking about her turn-ons.

F-for me, it takes seeing...certain people...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Like you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or being touched in...certain places...to, to...get aroused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touched,\" said Naruko in an oddly contemplative tone. That made sense. Having her feminine body be touched by all those things certainly set her off. And so did Hinata's fingers earlier. But she couldn't say that! Hinata would think she was some weird pervert if she found out, assuming she didn't already. But now, for the first time in ever, the blonde was feeling oddly drawn to the dark beauty. Hinata had grit, and Naruko liked and respected her for that. But after being in her comforting presence for so long today, and looking her up and down, she was now starting to notice the girl's natural grace. And she really liked that too, and wanted to feel more of it on her naked skin. And just thinking about it was making her want to touch herself. All over, but mostly in the space between her legs, which was growing moister by the minute. That in turn was making it harder for Naruko to think straight, and thinking was never her strongest suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe to touch my...uh...lady flower?\" she asked, not quite believing she was actually using that stupid term. She still didn't know everything about this woman's body thing, but while she could tell her new organ was very sensitive, she didn't want to do something that would harm it. Naruko might be stuck as a naked girl, but damn it, she had every intention of being a <i>healthy</i> naked girl!</span></div></div>",

Are you feeling okay?\" Naruko asked. She seemed to space out a little there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, uh, I'm fine!\" Hinata stammered. \"I-it's nothing. Naruko-chan, lie down on the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said lie down on the bed!\" she repeated in as authoritarian a tone as she could muster before standing up from where she was sitting to open up more space on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was baffled. What was up with Hinata? The boy-turned-girl just asked her a question, and now Hinata was ordering her around? Did her question offend her? It must have. Naruko had a feeling that if she had asked Sakura such a thing, she'd likely be missing her two front teeth right now. <i>Well, might as well get it over with and take my licks</i>, she though glumly. She got up from her chair, exposing her body to Hinata again, and lied down on her back in the bed. She tried not to shiver as her bare skin made contact with the soft mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread your legs out. Just a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okaaaaay,\" said Naruko. She had no idea what kind of punishment Hinata had in mind for her. Was it some sort of weird custom disciplinary thing the Hyuga clan did? Man, she sure hoped it didn't involve a gentle fist. Those things really hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata climbed up onto the foot of the bed and straddled Naruko's legs. The nude blonde braced herself for anything the Hyuga would throw at her, but nothing came. Hinata took no action; she just seemed to stare while taking in several sharp breaths. When Naruko chanced a look at her, she was only more puzzled. The blunette didn't appear angry at all; she just had this faraway look in her lavender eyes as they focused intently on...wait, was she staring at Naruko's crotch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata?\" the naked ninja asked nervously. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to do it,\" Hinata rapidly said in a hushed tone. \"I'm going to touch your...your lady flower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Naruko wanted to protest. That wasn't what she said! There must have been a miscommunication somewhere. But before she could do anything else, Hinata's hand was already on her groin, her delicate fingers pressing into the bare skin on either side of her lips while her thumb lightly brushed the blond pubic hair above it. \"Hinata, what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't finish that question. Hinata had already begun to stroke the skin in her groin lightly and gingerly, running her fingers up and down the sides of Naruko's slit while her thumb continued to fluff her blond bush. Naruko could only inhale a sharp breath. This wasn't what she asked for. In fact, she honestly knew she should tell Hinata to stop. But she didn't want to. The way Hinata's fingers deftly raked across her flesh was absolutely sublime. From deep within her womanhood, tingles sparked in growing intensity and goose bumps rose on her thighs almost as though something unseen was spiraling out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and rhythmically, the blonde bobbed her hips up and down and in and out, pushing them to and away from Hinata in time with her breaths. She was...enjoying this. Enjoying being touched down there. But it wasn't enough, oh no. She needed more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Touch me more</i>, she silently begged. <i>Touch me more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gap between the Hyuga's fingers narrowed, brushing the edges of Naruko's vulva, where her tanned flesh began to turn pink. Naruko shivered. The feeling, as alien as it was, was absolutely amazing. Hinata had only been working her magic for about five minutes, and already this was better than when she had been in the grocery store. But she had a feeling that the best was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Hinata's fingers rubbed her protruding clitoris. Naruko jolted up with a gasp. That feeling, that was...that was like nothing she ever felt before. She couldn't find the words to describe it. It was like a bolt of lightning hit her every pore, shooting up from Hinata's fingertips and into Naruko's most sensitive womanly parts. Her thighs, her toes, her nipples, her...vagina...everything burned with that amazing tingling sensation. And the fire blazing between her legs only burned brighter, despite the increased wetness that threatened to quench it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what was that?\" she asked, looking directly into the large lavender orbs of Hinata's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Hinata whispered as she softly pushed the blonde down onto the bed, \"is what it's like to be a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman,\" said Naruko. She bit her lip as Hinata rubbed her clit again, shooting more electrifying tingles throughout her unclothed form, but that did little to suppress her moans. She spread her legs wider and thrust her pelvis in and out in time with Hinata's movements with greater force, savoring the prolonged contact with the Hyuga's delicate fingers. <i>Kami, this feels SO good!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pressed on, moving her fingers ever deeper into Naruko's ever-welcoming vagina. In her fantasies, she never imagined that this was how her first intimate moment with her crush would go, but she was not about to complain. If anything, she was rather awed by the whole thing. The Hyuga had given in to self-pleasure many times before in the past using the same techniques on herself that she was now employing on Naruko, and it pleased her to know that if the blonde's quiet murmurs, gyrating hips, and hardened nipples meant anything, it was that she was enjoying her touch immensely. The normally shy girl smiled pridefully to herself, knowing that she could deliver such a small gift to her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took a deep, husky breath into her nostrils, savoring the musty aroma of Naruko's growing arousal while her fingers explored the blonde's pink velvety folds. They were so soft, so wet, and so warm. So much like her own when she touched herself, but also different. And gazing at Naruko's naked body, with her skin shining from perspiration and her breasts jiggling profoundly as she squirmed in the Hyuga's grasp, Hinata was starting to feel tempted to jam her other hand into her pants right there.</span></div></div>",

Naruko's pleasure came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh, oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko, for her part, could no longer keep her lips contained. They broke free from her teeth and parted freely, letting her moans escape loudly into the air. She put up no resistance as Hinata slid deeper into her, preferring instead to writhe around on her bed like a frightened serpent as her loins tingled and burned with ever greater intensity, her hands balled into fists as they held tightly on to the mattress. She didn't know what was happening, she didn't know what Hinata was thinking, and frankly she didn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, she thought back to the events of the day that led up to this moment. How she ran through the alleyways and rooftops of Konoha, up the Hokage's tower, and wandered around the grocery store, naked as the day she was born before everyone's eyes. But rather than feel the fear, shame, and humiliation that plagued her from those events, she could only feel ecstasy about it. Ecstasy for being a beautiful girl, ecstasy for being so brazenly naked for so long in so many places, ecstasy for the realization that she was going to be naked every minute every day of her life from now on. There was nothing in the world to cover her up, and there wasn't anything anyone could do to stop her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're going to be naked forever.</i> Tsunade's words rang through her head again. But rather than being the defeatist words that mocked her from earlier, they now only fueled her fire even more. She grew warmer, harder, and even tinglier just thinking about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be naked forever,\" she repeated, getting warmer just by saying it. \"I'm going to be naked forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be naked forever,\" Hinata whispered back without thinking. Seeing her love fall deeper into the sea of pleasure she herself was drowning her in increased the Hyuga's own arousal as well, to the point where she found herself thrusting her fingers in and out of Naruko at a faster rate than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever, forever, forever,\" Naruko chanted in a breathy whisper, thrusting her hips harder. Her entire pussy throbbed so much it hurt, but in a good way, as though a fiery pressure was building up in her and she could no longer contain it. \"I'm , I'm, I'm...oh KAMI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko grit her teeth, threw her head back, arched her back up, and screamed as she felt something warm and wet gush out of her. It was much like the incident in the store when she opened the fridge door, but with exponentially more force. It happened in waves, once, twice, thrice, spurting out like a volcanic geyser in greater levels of intensity. As it happened, tears poured down her face and she wept profusely like a newborn. But Naruko was not sad or frightened like she had been not too long ago. On the contrary, she never felt better in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko fell limply onto the mattress, crying softly and wiping at her tears as the tingling liquidy sensations in her crotch subsided into nothing more than a slow, gentle trickle. She felt movement to her left as something soft draped across her bare chest. She saw that it was Hinata laying down beside her and pulling her naked body close, all the while looking deep into the blonde's cerulean eyes with her own white orbs, smiling lovingly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what happened? What did you do to me?\" Naruko asked, her head still spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled shyly, but not in that stilted and timid way she always had. \"I made a woman out of you, Naruko-chan. I just gave you your first real orgasm as a girl. Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I,\" Naruko stammered, not sure what to say. \"Yes, I liked it a lot, Hinata. Th-thank you. Thank you for it. Thank you...for everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Naruko-chan,\" she said, kissing the permanently naked ninja girl on the forehead. Naruko knew she should feel surprised by the action, but after everything that had happened, she just couldn't be bothered. For now, she was content to lay by Hinata's side and enjoy both the girl's warmth and the afterglow of her first bout of feminine pleasure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata laid by Naruko's side, watching her face and running a finger along the nude ninja's bare collar in a circular motion. With her deep breaths and nearly shut eyes, the blonde looked like she was about ready to drift off to dreamland at any moment. The Hyuga couldn't help but smile warmly at her. She looked so peaceful now; it was a far cry from the emotionally distraught girl she had been treated to about an hour ago. And the best part about it was that Hinata knew it was all thanks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still couldn't believe that she just did what she did. Hinata reached into her transformed crush's most precious place and introduced her to a whole new world of pleasure. It was a bold move that the blunette didn't think she was capable of. Aside from her shyness, her prim and proper upbringing just made it seem impossible to consider. But then, looking down at her gender-changed and permanently naked crush, Naruko had a tendency to make the impossible seem probable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata remembered Naruko's ecstatic howls as she came closer to orgasm, how she happily proclaimed that she was going to be naked forever. Hinata giggled devilishly. She couldn't help but think about how delicious that would be, to see her dear Naruko run around everywhere in all her glory for the rest of their lives. Sure, it was a shame she wouldn't have the opportunity to see what the blonde's new female body looked like when wrapped up in an elegant kimono or some teasing barely-there underwear. But now, there was nothing to stop her from admiring Naruko's wonderful body whenever she wanted to; not even her own good conscience could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's exactly what she found herself doing. Her lavender eyes ran up and down Naruko's nude form, appreciatively eating up everything they saw. The currently ruffled blond hair, the perfect skin shining under a thin coat of sweat, the breasts that rose, fell, and jiggled with every breath she took, the damp hair right between her long legs...Kami, Naruko was utterly <i>gorgeous</i> as a girl. No other woman would ever compare to her. Even in her disheveled state, the naked kunoichi was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was tempted to run her hands down Naruko's body, to explore it some more. She only got to touch the warm velvety insides of her...lady flower as Naruko called it, and while that was nice, she really wanted to know every inch of her crush's new body. But Hinata pulled her hand back before it could get up to any sort of funny business. If her little shoulder angel was around, she'd likely be sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruko-chan seems to have fallen asleep. It wouldn't be right to touch her just yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sat up a little glumly. She briefly wondered if now was the time to leave and let Naruko have some privacy. No, she really didn't want to do that just yet. She wanted to stay with Naruko and enjoy her company (and naked body) just a little while longer. Looking around at the messy state of the apartment, the blunette wondered if she should probably try to tidy the place up a little while her crush napped. That would give her a good excuse to stay a while longer without coming across as creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb suddenly lit up in her head. <i>Clean up. That's it!</i> Hinata shot up from the bed and scampered over to the bathroom. She knew just what needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko-chan? Are you awake?\" Hinata asked as she softly shook the nude girl in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's eyes fluttered open at the contact to meet the gentle pearl orbs of Hinata's. \"Um, I guess,\" she said with a slight yawn. \"Must've dozed off. How long've I been out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata poked her index fingers together as she always did when feeling shy, but it contrasted strongly with the warm smile that seemed to be glued on her face. \"N-not long at all. I just felt that after...all that, well, I thought you could afford to get cleaned up. So I drew a bath for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't need to do-\" Naruko frowned a little as she stood up and looked herself up and down. She felt a little clammy and sticky, especially between her legs, and smelled like stale sweat. \"Okay, nevermind, I suppose I could use one. Thanks, Hinata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling herself off of the somewhat damp mattress, Naruko stood up and winced as a sudden ache groaned in between her legs. She felt her already shaky legs buckle and for a second, thought that she would fall down to the floor. Fortunately, Hinata was ready and caught her just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Naruko-chan. Here, let me guide you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko mumbled a sheepish thanks as she leaned on the smaller girl's shoulder and let Hinata lead her to the bathroom, the soreness in her nether regions flaring up with each small step she took. The pain wasn't enough to be unbearable, but it wasn't comfortable either. Luckily, the blonde was momentarily distracted from it when the warmth of slightly steamed air hit her naked skin. Her tub was filled with water that was heated to just the right temperature; hot enough to soothe the soul and relax the muscles, but not to scald one's delicate flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, this is heavenly,\" Naruko moaned as she lowered herself into the tub, feeling the water blanket her bare form. The water really hit the spot; she hadn't been in it for more than 30 seconds, and already she could feel her nerves start to calm down for the first time all day long. It was only interrupted when she felt a sharp tug on her hair \"Uh, Hinata, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just letting your hair down, Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata, who had knelt down so she could remove Naruko's hair ties and tend to her other needs in the bath. \"It'll make it easier to wash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Good idea.\" Naruko calmed down and decided to just lean back and let Hinata do her work. Unfortunately, she couldn't help but wince some more. Now that the soothing shock of the warm bathwater had worn off, she was now starting to remember the soreness between her legs. \"Um, Hinata, can I ask you something?\" she said, a blush spreading across her cheeks. She knew she was about to say something that would likely embarrass them both again, but after the past hour, she had come to learn that if she had any questions about the female body and its many peculiarities, Hinata was likely the best person to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Naruko-chan?\" said Hinata as she finally pulled the hair tie free and let half of Naruko's hair drop down freely. She proceeded to work on the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it always hurt...down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked in confusion. \"Down where...oh.\" She blushed herself once she realized what Naruko meant. \"Um, well...it can, at first, when you get started at...touching yourself down there. But it gets better over time. It...stops hurting so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! That's a relief,\" said Naruko. \"I keep on being afraid that there's something wrong with me besides the always-being-naked thing. I guess it's not any different than when I was a boy though. It would hurt whenever I did my thing back then too, but it was never lasting, though it did suck this one time when the skin started to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you have really nice hair, Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata, turning as red as a tomato. This was not a conversation she wanted to hear and she really wanted to steer it away to more pleasant subjects. Pretty subjects. Sexy subjects. Like Naruko's hair. Now that she had taken the second hair tie off, she could finally get a full feel of the long golden mane. It was so unlike what Naruto had back when he was a boy. While Naruto's hair was cut short, perpetually ruffled, and incapable of being tamed, Naruko's was long and luxuriant, almost feeling like silk in her fingers as she ran her hands down its long length and soaked it in the warm bathwater. Hinata couldn't help but feel kind of envious of it really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but now that Naruko's hair was down, it made her seem even more naked than she already was. It was true in a literal sense; the hair ties that held her long pigtails up appeared to be the only thing that Naruko could even physically wear anymore. Now that they were gone, there was nothing left to take off; she was as naked as she could humanly get. But more than that, it was the sense that without those small things to style her hair up, Naruko was now left in her raw and natural state. And Hinata couldn't but think that there was something very sensual about that very idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindedly, Hinata reach for a nearby washcloth that she had soaped up ahead of time and began to softly scrub at Naruko's shoulder. Naruko turned to her with a questioning gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I just thought that I could help clean you up,\" said Hinata nervously. \"Wash your back for you. Why? Do you...not want me to?\" Hinata had set up this entire situation just so she could have a good excuse to touch as much of Naruko's naked flesh as she could, but she couldn't shake the concern that she might end up crossing some barrier between them.</span></div></div>",

Girls are more...accepting of physical contact than boys are. It's normal for girls to help clean each other up in the baths.\" Which wasn't a lie. It was natural for women scrub each other up. She wouldn't ever admit it, but Hinata had at times gave in to her...female curiosity and used her family's unique abilities to peer into the male baths and had seen that men were indeed more aloof towards one another. Though Hinata's babying of Naruko ran far deeper than just simple gender politics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Naruko in a tone that seemed to speak of disappointment, her shoulders slumping slightly. \"I thought that...we were like...girlfriends now.

What you did to me was...a lot more, uh, what's the word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intimate?\" said Hinata in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But I...I guess I was mistaken. We're not girlfriends, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata as she set the washcloth down. \"Do you...want to be my girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was blushing madly now. The Hyuga could see it all over her body; even under the water, every inch of her bare skin had turned a deep shade of red. \"It-it was just a silly thought of mine,\" said Naruko in a very un-Naruko tone of voice. \"Just forget I said anything. I-I know you can't be seen in public with me. I'm a girl like you now for one thing, and I'm a freak who's always going to be naked and that's gross, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko-chan,\" said Hinata as an odd sense of bravery came over her, \"I'd love to be your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wouldn't...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shifted her position so that she could new look Naruko directly in the eye. \"I said...I would love to be your girlfriend, Naruko-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko's eyes widened considerably at those words, as if she couldn't believe she just heard them. Hinata had to suppress a giggle. Even though she was physically an older woman, the blonde just looked so cute and vulnerable right now with her big, shiny blue eyes, dripping wet hair that clung to her skin, and overall nakedness. \"R-really?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" said Hinata, leaning forward and wrapping her arms around Naruko's neck. \"I don't care that you're a girl like me. And I don't care that you have to be naked all the time. Your body is beautiful, Naruko-chan, and there's nothing gross about showing it off at all. I'd love to be your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back, proud of finding the courage to admit her feelings to Naruko. She had waiting to say those words for such a long time, and now that she had, it felt like a huge weight had finally lifted off her shoulders. Well, besides the two sizeable ones on her chest that were still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko didn't say anything at first. She merely looked into Hinata's eyes as her lip quivered. At any moment, it looked like she was about to cry, hopefully out of  joy. Then, without warning, the naked kunoichi threw her arms around Hinata and exclaimed: \"Hinata-chan! I love you!\" And with a sharp yank, she pulled an utterly astonished and still clothed Hyuga into the bath with her, spilling warm water all over the floor in the process.</span></div></div>",

It felt so nice to feel another body press into her bare skin. Her laugh did not subside at all once Hinata's head finally broke the surface mere inches from her own. The Hyuga's normally pristine hair was now a sopping mess, clinging comically to Hinata's normally cherubic face, covering one half in a mass of dripping wet indigo, while the half that was exposed was twisted into a wide-eyed look of utter astonishment that Naruko didn't think she was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruko-chan?\" she sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute,\" said Naruko as she parted the hair on Hinata's face to get a better look at her. \"And pretty!\" She then pulled the blunette's face forward, planting a kiss on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's already wide eyes grew even bigger and a gasp that threatened to escape from her lips was smothered by Naruko's own. She was dumbfounded. Things were moving so fast, she couldn't even comprehend it. She didn't even have time to feel embarrassed as she normally would. And as it was, when she felt Naruko's <i>soft</i> lips press against her own, she didn't even bother fighting it. Hinata just opened her mouth to allow entry...and shot her own tongue out to meet Naruko's halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's happening, it's really happening! <b>I'm sharing my first kiss with Naruko-chan!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on, tasting each other, pressing their forms close together in the bath tub, causing small waves to lap up against its sides. Hinata swore that she would wake up any moment and find herself back in her own bed at the Hyuga compound, drenched in sweat and...other stuff. But it never came. She was really here, in Naruko's home, bath, and lips. The only thing she regretted was that she hadn't taken off her beige jacket first. Not only did it feel pretty off-putting in the water, but it kept her from feeling the sensation of Naruko's nipples poking into her body. And she damn well knew they had to be hard right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they pulled away, Naruko's sapphire eyes looking directly into Hinata's silvery orbs. She was smiling happily, though a small blush was creeping across her face. \"Uh, sorry about that, Hinata-chan. I just got a little caught up in the mommmmmppphh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wouldn't let her have it. She immediately pressed forward, planting another kiss onto Naruko's face, silencing her toxic words and biting down on her lower lip oh so gently to keep it from pulling away. Now it was Naruko's turn to be startled. She half-expected Hinata to slap her in the face for that. Kami knows Sakura would have. But she did nothing of the sort, and soon enough, Naruko was lost in the warm inviting embrace of her girlfriend's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pulled back again breathing deeply as if she sprinted a whole mile without rest. \"I've been...waiting to do that...for such...a long...time,\" she said between desperate gasps for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hidden meaning behind her words were lost on Naruko. Not quite due to any misunderstanding on her part, but because to the naked kunoichi's ears, the deep breaths gave Hinata's voice an oddly husky sound that hit her in all the right places. That combined with the kisses and the feeling of the smaller girl's form pressing into her nude body was starting to have a familiar effect. Naruko's nipples were prodding deep into the blunette's jacket, and a distinct tingling sensation could be felt dripping out from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...not again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata-chan,\" she gasped, suddenly realizing that she was feeling a bit out of breath herself. \"C-can you...do something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Naruko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you...mind doing what you did to me earlier again?\"</span></div></div>",

But she was able to maintain her composure, sopping wet as she was, and expressed her joy through a simple smile. \"Of course, Naruko-chan. You need only ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe propped herself up to as much of a sitting position as she could get in the tub. Between the deep water, Naruko's body, and her soaking jacket, it wasn't easy, and the Hyuga realized she was going to have a bit of difficulty pleasuring her...<i>girlfriend</i> like this. Something had to give, and she knew what it had to be. Hinata reached for the zipper of her coat and pulled it down, exposing the tight sleeveless black shirt she was wearing underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, Naruko's eyes bugged out. Seeing the blunette take off her clothing while dripping wet and on top of her was...it was...really making her loins burn even more. And while Hinata was clearly not naked under there, the water made her shirt cling very close to her body, showing off her figure. And from what the nude blonde could see, Hinata had quite a figure indeed! The girl always looked so small and delicate, so the former boy figured that Hinata was a naturally wispy person. But that couldn't be further from the truth; she actually had a very a very sizeable bust that just had to be more developed than most of her peers. More than Ino, more than Tenten, more than all those fangirls she ran into earlier today. And definitely much more than Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata dumped the garment off the side of the tub, where it landed on the floor with a wet <i>plop</i>. Now that it was off, she felt much lighter. Pleasuring Naruko would be a whole lot easier now. She looked down and took note of the splayed formation the blonde's legs were in. In drier circumstances, Naruko would have her sex on full display. But the rippling water and refraction of light distorted it somewhat, making her groin look like an almost smooth expanse of tan with only the slightest hint of pink. Hinata licked her lips; that only made it look more enticing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruko gasped and jostled her whole body when she felt Hinata's fingers press into her most sensitive place. Water splashed and lapped rigorously at the side of her tub, but she paid it no mind. All that mattered was the electrifying sensation erupting through her very core as Hinata cupped her feminine mound with one hand. The Hyuga ran her thumb through the blonde's pubic hair, stroked her outer lips with her ring and index fingers, and with her middle she...Naruko bit her lip as another pleasurable shock ran through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it, why does being a girl feel so <b>good</b>?</i> She shook her whole form again as Hinata continued to stroke her swollen clitoris with graceful but firm movements, starting with just her fingers before moving on to her entire palm. Naruko flowed with it and grinded her crotch deeper into Hinata's hand. She loved the white-eyed girl's touch, loved the tingling storm that it emitted in her womanhood, and she desperately wanted to feel more of it. On her. <b>Inside her.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ecstasy rose even higher as the water caressed her every inch of bare skin. Her wiggling motions caused ripples and waves to splash all around her, running their way to the walls of her tub, crashing against it and returning back to lap against her sides, her shoulders, and her breasts. Her bouncing, heaving, womanly breasts that rhythmically sunk in and out of the water, tasting the air for a moment before being submerged back into the warm, wet depths of her bath.  Stealing a quick glance at them, Naruko quietly marveled at the sharp red tips that stuck high into the air. They stood so erect, she wondered if they would draw blood if she struck her palms upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko didn't have enough time to wonder. For Hinata had suddenly shot her head down to the blonde's chest and engulfed one stiff nipple into her lips. Naruko jumped again in surprise. <i>What is she doing now? Is that norm-ahhhhhh!</i> Her silent question hung in the air as the Hyuga closed her tender lips around the sensitive nub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata for her part didn't know why she was doing it. She never once felt the need to taste another person's nipple, let alone another girl's. But something about Naruko's called to her. Maybe it was the jiggling of her breasts, or how sleek, wet, and slippery they looked in the bathwater. Or perhaps it was how hard and solid the blonde's tits had become all thanks to her. Whatever the case was, Hinata desperately wanted to touch them. Now. With whatever part of her body that she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoraciously, Hinata ran her tongue in circles around the nub and along Naruko's areola. She marveled at how much the softness of the latter contrasted with the hardness of the former, all the while lapping up whatever moisture still clung to it. This elicited a moan from Naruko, who threw her head back and nearly bashed it on the wall behind her. If she was in any pain, she didn't show it; the only physical sensation Hinata could sense was the nipple growing even harder in her mouth. Feeling like she tasted her girlfriend enough, the blunette withdrew her tongue and with a soft suckling motion, took the rest of the naked blonde's tit into her mouth, and pulled it between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Naruko murmured, her whole form trembling. \"That feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata repeated the action several more times, releasing her oral grip on her lover's nipple momentarily before once again sucking it back inside, scraping the tender flesh along her teeth and feeling its every contour with the tip of her tongue. She couldn't help but smile at the sensation. <i>Why didn't I ever do this before? Naruko-chan tastes so nice!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she did this, Hinata's hand never once left Naruko's crotch. She had continued to massage it, throwing more force into her movements as she rubbed the blonde's clit, even slipping a finger into the naked ninja's warm, wet depths. It had been even easier this time as well, since the water provided a natural lubricant. And while it was Naruko who was shuddering at her touch, Hinata couldn't help but feel a heat rise in her as well. Maybe it was how velvety Naruko felt down there, maybe it was how the muscles contracted around her finger and almost seemed to pull it deeper inside, maybe it was how the blonde's clit molded itself against her palm when she pressed into it, maybe it was how Naruko sloshed around in the water. But everything Hinata was doing to her, she wanted done to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was moaning loudly now, her eyes were squeezed tight, and her head was practically banging on the wall behind her. Hinata knew what she had to do. She released the blonde's nipple from her mouth and forced herself up to a sitting position. After she was stabilized, Hinata took one last look at her lover to make sure she was properly distracted \u2014she was \u2014and jammed her free hand down her pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new experience for the Hyuga, pleasuring both herself and another girl at the same time. And she most certainly didn't think she would do it if Naruko was fully aware; she'd die of embarrassment. But it seemed like a relatively safe thing to do now. Naruko was completely lost in her own world, her loud moans would drown out Hinata's, the water would wash away whatever...mess the blunette made, and even if it didn't, it could all be attributed to Naruko anyway. So it seemed as safe a time as any to indulge her own arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, mmm, mmm, ohhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko cried louder with every caress, every smack, every thrust Hinata put on and into her mound, each one harder than the last. And she did the same to her own with her other hand. Hinata had to bite down on her lip in order to silence her own cries, but she couldn't keep them fully bottled up. Not while her excitement was rising at a rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, ohh,\" Naruko moaned. The time was coming. She was going to burst any second now. \"Hi-Hin-Hina-!\" Her cerulean eyes shot open and her mouth widened into what would have been a loud scream, but no such sound ever came out. Her head plunged underwater, drowning her voice in a cascade of bubbles. And Hinata felt a strong, highly-pressurized stream erupt from deep within Naruko sex, nearly blasting her underwater hand away as the nude girl's whole pelvis thrashed maniacally like a struggling fish, splashing water everywhere. Uzumaki Naruko just experienced her next orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a few short seconds, so did Hinata.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't fully recovered from her first climax, so this latest one made her feel even more achy down there. <i>Damn Hinata-chan and her magical fingers</i>, she silently growled. Reaching for a nearby rack, she grabbed a couple of towels, and handed one to Hinata, only to suddenly realize they had a new predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as Hinata had effectively taken a bath while still fully dressed, she was dripping wet. A towel wasn't going to do her much good. \"Hey, uh, I'm sorry again about dragging you in like that. As I said, I got really caught up in the moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's face was flushed, which wasn't anything unusual to Naruko (<i>She always looks that way to me</i>, she idly thought), but she also seemed a little tired as well. For what, the naked blonde could only guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay, Naruko-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not,\" said Naruko as she toweled herself off. The cloth didn't take any damage as she rubbed it on her skin as she made no effort to \"wear\" it. If she tried to wrap it around herself, it would most definitely fray to pieces. \"You'll have to take off your clothes and dry them out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata froze. <i>T-take off my clothes?</i> Would she be able to do that? In front of Naruko? It was...a reasonable suggestion. Girls wandered around naked in the baths all the time, there was no reason to feel insecure. It was only fair too, as she had been seeing Naruko naked all day. And she would be seeing her naked all the time now too. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I good enough for Naruko-chan to see naked?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had body issues, as most girls her age did. She didn't think she really stood up to most of them, especially Naruko as she was now. And while the permanently naked girl had happily called Hinata her girlfriend, the Hyuga knew she had to face reality: she was not the blonde's first choice. Sakura was. Would Naruko still want to be with her if she saw what her body really looked like? And even if she did, would Hinata be able to keep it together being naked in front of her crush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Hinata-chan?\" Naruko asked with concern in her voice.</span></div></div>",

I just meant that you'd strip and dry off in private. Was even gonna' lend you some of my clothes. I may be stuck naked, but I wouldn't force you to be. Unless you wanted to?\" Naruko started to feel a little bit hopeful. Truth be told, she wouldn't have objected if her new girlfriend decided to show her some skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head, though she felt bad for doing so. \"I'm sorry, Naruko-chan.

She was glad that, despite the odd circumstances that had fallen on her, Naruko could still act like a gentleman. Or would she be a lady? Ah, it didn't matter \"Thank you, Naruko-chan.\" The blonde simply nodded in response and walked out, sashaying her bare behind the whole time, a sight that Hinata burned into her memory <i>To think that those buns are all mine now,</i> she thought with a not-so-innocent giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko reappeared again in short order, carrying a mop over her shoulder and some clothes under her arm. \"Here, you can put these on.

She was in too foul a mood to put up with Sakura's crap right now. Sakura, the stupid fangirls, the hole that just about broke her neck, and now...this was far and away the absolute worst day in Sasuke's entire life. Nothing would ever compare to the constant indignities and humiliations she had been forced to put up with in a small number of hours. Well, except maybe that one time where...that guy she knew, what's-his-face, might have been a relative, did something to a whole bunch of other people she knew...her memory was foggy right now. What mattered was the fact that Sasuke had <b>transformed into her pink-haired teammate!</b> And somehow, it was all Naruto's fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the Hokage didn't give her all the details. She didn't say precisely what Naruto had done to cause this. All she told them was that the dumb blonde had been irresponsibly messing with things he really wasn't supposed to, and that was the reason why Sasuke, Sakura, and \"other people\" were under observation in the hospital. When Sakura had asked Tsunade for specifics, the older woman only cryptically said: \"You'll find out soon enough, once you see your teammate. I'm sure <i>he</i> will give you a much better explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had been more detailed when it came to describing Sasuke's condition, thankfully. She, Sakura, and a few other people had all been exposed to a jutsu of sorts that would make any transformation they made permanent. Everyone had been spared from that fate. Everyone, that is, except for Sasuke. Naturally, the Uchiha didn't believe her. That sounded frankly ridiculous, and she wanted to hear a second opinion. So Tsunade called in Shizune, who said the same thing. Sasuke demanded a third opinion, so they brought in Anko to confirm it. Sasuke didn't think she counted because she wasn't a doctor or a medical nin, so they dragged in a random quack who examined Sasuke and practically said: \"I'm a doctor, she's a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke sputtered, she denied it, at one point, she may have thrown a punch at someone, and she could have sworn that somebody probably punched hard in return. She didn't remember, but her oversized forehead was now throbbing something fierce. But the fact of the matter was that she was now a girl. She had a vagina, uterus, ovaries, slightly wider hips, and a pair of tiny lumps on her chest that had the remote possibility of becoming breasts one day. And there was no way it could be undone in the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade did say she would give Sasuke the chance to change her name if she so wanted, but the now pink-haired Uchiha turned her down.

Because I'm no longer your precious pretty thing to lust over.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But after your little...explosion in the hospital, the Hokage left you\u2013us\u2013direct instructions to stay away from Naruto today. And, uh, I'm sure you've noticed, but an Anbu's been shadowing us from the rooftops too, so I think she intends on enforcing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke instinctively flicked her eyes upward. Sure enough, there was an Anbu wearing what appeared to be a bear mask looking down at them. He or she was not even bothering to stay hidden. The former boy snorted in disgust. She would not let some supposedly elite soldier deter her. \"I'll show her enforc-AHH!\" She grabbed her head and nearly doubled over as pain suddenly flared across her already ailing temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Sakura added while scratching the back of her head uncomfortably. \"And there's the fact that she gave you a large lump, the painkilling jutsu she applied is starting to wear off, and that you really should put that on ice for the rest of the day. Also the Hokage's orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke groaned, still clutching her head. \"Fine,\" she said in a tone of resignation. \"I'll go home now. Kill Naruto later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Sakura. \"Here, lean on me. I'll help bring you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Sasuke would have refused her offer. Knowing Sakura, she would take any form of approval or acceptance as a sign that the Uchiha was ready to return her affections. But this pain was really something else; it was hard to just stand upright, her vision was blurring so badly that she could hardly see, and the thought of curling up in bed was for once overpowering her usual sense of vindication. So Sasuke decided she could probably use the natural pinkette's help. Just this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura draped her transformed crush's arm across her shoulder and they walked together in a steady, if awkward silence. They drew a significant number of stares and double-takes from passerbys who had apparently never seen a pair of identical twins in their lives. A pair of reasonably attractive, bubblegum-haired identical twins who were wearing the exact same red qipao, blue sandals, and form-fitting shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I guess it</i> does <i>warrant some attention.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as they walked, Sasuke had to admit that Sakura appeared to be exhibiting some professionalism for once. Being the usual schoolgirl who likely buried her nose in trashy romance novels and shoujo manga, Sasuke expected the girl to be the type to think that assistance was romantic by default. But it looked like she was treating this situation a lot more seriously, if her stoic expression and forward gaze were anything to go by. There was nary a blush or a stupid love-struck smile to be found anywhere on here face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If she'd stop obsessing over me, she might have what it takes tol make it as a ninja someday. Emphasis on 'might.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, they made it to Sasuke's home in what remained of the Uchiha compound. The pain from the bruise Tsunade gave Sasuke wasn't pounding her head as hard as it had before, so she was able to slip away from Sakura's shoulder and open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else I can do for you, Sasuke?\" said the original pink-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll just...take it from here. Do as you said, put some ice on this and rest,\" said Sasuke. Then, in a lower tone that was almost a whisper, she added: \"And...thanks for helping me here.\" There, she did it. Sasuke may not have liked or respected her female teammate, but far be it from her to not at least express some gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura immediately lit up. \"You're welcome, Sasuke! I would do anything for you! And don't worry. I'm sure, together, we'll be able to change you back. Love always finds a way-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke promptly slammed the door in her face, the little bit of respect she had gained for the pinkette gone in an instant. Damn it, was there anything in this world that would make her stop lusting for Uchiha flesh? Would she remain so hopelessly infatuated with Sasuke, even after he changed sex and turned into an almost perfect copy of her? Sasuke always knew Sakura was crazy. He just didn't know how much. <i>I can only hope that her insanity isn't hereditary.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much time to dwell on it. Thinking about Sakura's loose grip on reality, the changes Sasuke herself had to endure, and how she would throttle Naruto would all have to wait for the time being. For now, she just a huge bruise to nurse.</span></div></div>",

Tonton, who was in her arms, squealed in agreement. \"At least only two people transformed, and they're still physically functional human beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things could have been better too,\" said Tsunade. \"Naruto could have just turned the scroll in like he was supposed to. Or he could have just never found it in the first place. There's going to be a media shit-storm because of all this. If word gets out that Orochimaru still has his little tricks lying around, everyone will tear the whole village up looking for them. And even if it doesn't, I'm likely going to be lynched by the village's moral guardians for allowing a girl to run around naked 24-7. I'm frankly surprised I haven't had to personally pardon the brat from a wrongful arrest yet. Ahhhh, I'm going to feel the aftershocks of this disaster for weeks, and I had more important things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like drink yourself stupid, sneak out to go gambling, and come back home with a lighter purse and fewer clothes on?\" Shizune deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was taken aback. \"No, I-I wasn't going to...no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Hokage-sama. Just remember: Tonton and I are watching you.\" And to demonstrate that, the little pig pointed a hoof at her eyes, and then thrust it in Tsunade's direction with a smug grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" said Tsunade with a huff. \"How about you two leave while I try and prepare what I'll tell the press. They will be coming; I heard gossip about a certain blonde streaker on our way back from the hospital. And hopefully, I'll get some other non-gambling and alcohol-related stuff done in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave you to it then.\" And with that, Shizune and the pig were out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door slid shut, Tsunade pulled the scroll out from a secure compartment in her desk. This thing had caused her no end of headaches, and it would likely cause a few more before the day was done. She honestly couldn't believe Naruto would be dumb enough to open it up like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't help but consider the possible uses the scroll had. True, it was created by Orochimaru and used to conduct his cruel experiments, but that didn't mean it was automatically evil. She hated to admit it, but his wicked creation could indeed be used for more benevolent purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheoretically, it was possible the scroll could heal people who had been horribly disfigured or handicapped, just by simply giving them a more able-bodied form. It also had the potential to instantly turn a weak person into a strong one, an act that could rapidly bolster the Leaf's military capability, which it was sorely lacking ever since Orochimaru's attack. She also had to wonder if perhaps someone could effectively acquire a bloodline limit, like the Byakugan or Sharingan with this scroll. If so, then the Leaf could potentially expand on the number of bloodlimits in its arsenal by taking those that were originally exclusive to the other villages. The possibilities were endless, and the scientific part of the Hokage's mind couldn't help but want to tap into its potential. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean the scroll should just be used willy-nilly, of course. It was very dangerous, needed to be kept under lock and key, and could only be used by a select few trusted individuals, just like every forbidden jutsu that was sealed up in the Hokage's Library. And more than that, it needed to be understood. Tsunade had every intention of studying the scroll, reverse-engineering it, and hopefully finding a way to undo its effects; she promised Naruko that much. But that would require a long period of experimentation herself, and anyone who so much as opened it would be vulnerable to its effects. Even herself.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't real; it was all under the effect of a transformation technique she constantly employed on herself to hide her real age. It did the job most of the time, but if she expelled too much chakra at once, it would fade away. And there was only so much it could do; it made her look young, but it didn't actually make her young. Old age caught up to everyone eventually, Tsunade was well aware that she had reached her physical peak a long time ago, and she already shaved many years of her life away when she used the Creation Rebirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But with this...I could really become young again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No, no, no! She couldn't just jump right into that. That would be abusing the scroll's powers for her own selfish gain, which is the kind of thing Orochimaru would do. And it was too reckless. Who knew what kind of long term effects there could be? Besides, she already had a couple of \"guinea pigs\" in Sasuke and Naruko, both of whom had undergone wildly different transformations. Even if Tsunade were to use the scroll to change herself, it would be much safer to put it off and observe the two new girls for at least a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the both of them, Sasuke's permanent transformation was easier to grasp, especially since Tsunade was even able to give the newly-transformed girl a thorough medical examination. Overall, she was normal, just like the person she had turned into. All of her organs were working, she could mold chakra, perform techniques aside from the basic transformation, it looked like she had a fully working female reproductive system, and she could wear any sort of clothing she wanted. </span></div></div>",

The blonde still needed a proper checkup, but the fact that she was permanently naked was definitely something to keep in mind. According to Anko, the intent behind the transformation played a large part in the scroll's effects, but there were other things to consider, such as whether Naruko's large chakra reserves or the Kyubi played a part in it. And there was also a question of just what else on Naruko's new body was permanent. Would she age? Would she go through menstrual cycles? Could she even get pregnant? Would any of her body hair grow in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell whatever the case was, Tsunade didn't want to end up like her. She wanted to be beautiful, but not <i>that</i> kind of beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I'm just over-thinking it,\" she said aloud. \"Naruko ended up that way at least in part because she intended to be naked.

The idea of making herself genuinely young and gorgeous was too good to pass up, and she was more than willing to take a gamble with an untested scroll to make it come it true. In fact, that thought alone made the choice even more exciting. Never before had she ever made a gamble with this kind of payoff before. <i>And the way I see it, I can't lose!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanity and compulsive gambling made for a very dangerous combination of vices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't think of it as vanity. Think of it as...testing the scroll's capabilities on yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that was a good way to look at it. There was lots of altruism involved with her choice. She promised Naruko that she would research the scroll's effects. Experiencing them firsthand was the best way to do that. She'd regain her youth and get a step closer to understanding the scroll and all of its intricacies. It was win-win for everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, calm down, girl</i>, she thought, feeling a bit giddy at how accurate that label was going to be for her soon. <i>You're still taking a risk, so hedge your bets first. Make sure everything goes just as you intend.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were lots of unknown factors to take into account, such as what the scroll would do if it was opened while a transformation was active. It was likely nothing would happen, but you could never be too careful. So Tsunade did the one thing she would otherwise never do in normal circumstances: she dispelled her personal transformation and reverted to her true form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not an easy thing to do. Tsunade always felt like something was weighing down on her as she watched her body rapidly age before her eyes. And this was no different. Her perfect ivory skin grew looser and more wrinkled, ugly purple veins protruded out of her skin, liver spots appeared, and calluses formed on her hands. Her face too began to feel different, as her skin clung tightly to her skull in some places and hung loosely in others. And from the corner of her vision, Tsunade could see that her hair had lost its yellow luster and turned a hard gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman sighed in a tone that itself had turned more gravelly, feeling somewhat despondent for the moment. It seemed like the Creation Rebirth had really done a number on her. She couldn't see her face, but she could tell that she most definitely looked older than her 50 years of age implied. If Naruko saw her right now, she'd be well within her rights to call the Hokage \"old lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not for long she won't</i>, she thought, immediately perking up as a smile cut across her face. <i>It's time to show that nudist who's an old lady now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought, the Fifth Hokage of the Leaf unfurled the great roll of parchment. A brilliant flash of light engulfed her, a choir of voices filled her ears, and then...silence. Just as was described. If what Anko and Naruko had told her was true, then that would mean it was now in effect. She took a moment to read her chakra and detected all sort of irregularities in it that matched the ones she found in Hinata and all the other girls earlier today. The next transformation she made would be forever. Taking a deep breath, Tsunade clasped her hands together into the familiar sign of the ram. \"Here goes nothing.\"</span></div></div>",

So she was somewhat disappointed when she felt nothing at all. No shocks, no tingles, no sudden emptying of her bowels. It was just like any normal transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, that was the only disappointing thing she felt. Looking down at her body, the Hokage was delighted to see that it looked like she was back to her youthful self. Healthy blemish-free skin, no wrinkles or age lines, and hair that was the color of butter. So far, so good. She attempted to undo the transformation again. And just as she expected, her youth held firm. Nothing she could do would change her back, or change her into anything at all. The scroll had carried out its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded appreciatively, but she wasn't ready to celebrate just yet. She had to make sure that everything was changed just as she wanted. She opened a panel on a wall that hid a full-length mirror. It was a decidedly mundane thing to keep hidden in her office, especially when compared to all the bottles of booze she typically had stashed here and there, but it was useful for all those times she fell asleep at her desk (usually because of the booze). Even a legendary sage had to put her face on in the morning.  Nevertheless, from what she could see, everything was in order. Her complexion? Flawless. Her hair? Not one out-of-place gray strand. Her lips? Pink, full, and pouty. Her eyes? Large and appropriately shadowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked,\" she said in her usually fiery voice, barely able to contain her excitement. \"It really worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, the Hokage began to strip off her clothes. She threw off her green haori, unwrapped the belt around her waist, and peeled off her gray tunic. She had to see for herself what her \"new\" body looked like. She was not disappointed when her breasts popped out, her large, luscious, gravity-defying breasts that most women half her age would kill to have. They bounced freely in the air, jiggled oh so slightly, and came to rest in perfect unison. Big, beautiful, and young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade shuddered as she ran her hands over them, enjoying their youthful firmness as they squished within her uncalloused palms. She slid them down to her stomach and traced the outlines of her toned abdominals, gained from a lifetime of rigorous exercise. There was not one trace of muscular degeneration or atrophy to be found anywhere on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, now that she thought about it, Tsunade felt stronger than she did just a moment ago. Stronger and...renewed. She couldn't explain it, but the sensation was there. It was like she had just spent an entire week bathing in the most formulated hot spring this side of the continent. She was tougher, vigorous, and more durable, as if every muscle in her body had hardened in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just as I hoped,\" she said, flexing an arm and admiring her bicep. \"The change has well and truly made me younger. I literally am only half my age now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her clothes soon followed. She kicked off her sandals, undid her trousers, and slid her panties all the way down her shapely legs. Down to her birthday suit, Tsunade could now admire every part of her body. Her legs were fit and toned, and her thighs were thick, formidable, and Amazonian. They came up to frame her V-shaped mound, which was smooth and hairless, showing off only the tiniest of slits where not one pink fold of flesh sagged out. Turning around, Tsunade took a moment to admire her butt in the mirror, running a hand down one large but most definitely not flabby globe, and gave it a tender squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this was just too much! Tsunade could have sworn that she just died and went to paradise. Turning around, the Hokage leaned closer to the mirror, propping an arm up on the wall to admire her young and gorgeous body. \"Hello there, beautiful,\" she whispered in a sultry tone as she stared into her reflection's eyes. Spirits, she could just kiss that lovely face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think, the Legendary Sucker had taken a huge gamble with a dangerous scroll, and came out on top! She was young again, drop dead gorgeous, and there was nothing in the world that could ever take it away. And the only thing it cost her was a low-level technique she had no practical use for anyway. For once, things were coming up for Tsunade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The next time I see the nudist, I'm going to give her a big wet kiss right on the lips. We'll see what she thinks of this 'old lady' now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hokage-sama,\" said Shizune as she burst through the door. \"A reporter is here to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stopped. She turned her head, looked at her assistant, and saw that the brunette was gaping at her with a wide mouth and even wider eyes. And then it dawned on the Hokage; she was standing here. In her office. Gazing lustfully at her reflection. Naked as the day she was born. And she forgot to lock the damn door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the flashbulb of a camera behind Shizune went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh hell...</i></span></div></div>",

Hinata had spent all that time in Naruko's apartment waiting for her clothes to dry while wearing some of her crush's old boy stuff, which included a white T-shirt, some cargo pants, and a pair of boxers that the naked blonde assured her were \"new and unused.\" Wearing them felt strange to say the least; they were a little baggy on the Hyuga's slender frame, and it was all she could do to keep the pants on. Naruko had to lend her a belt for that purpose. But Hinata had to admit, it was rather thrilling to wear things that at one point had grazed Naruto's skin. Like he, or she for that matter, was always close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she needed to wear Naruko's old clothes to feel close to her crush. The two were never out of sight of one another.

The bathroom floor needed to be mopped up, there was furniture that had to be slid back into place, assorted rags needed to be thrown out, and clothing had to be put back into the drawers. That last point seemed a little odd to the Hyuga though. If Naruko couldn't wear clothes, then it stood to reason that there was no reason for her to own any. But the blunette decided to stay quiet about that subject, for the time being at least. She was too enthralled just watching a naked girl do regular housework to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko still wasn't ready to spend any time outside in her undressed state, so the two settled on a modest dinner of cup ramen. That was fine by Hinata; as much as she would have liked her first date to be someplace more romantic, she wouldn't force or rush Naruko into anything she didn't want. However, she couldn't resist running her feet up and down the blonde's bare legs under the table, feeling the exposed skin press into her soles and between her toes. Poor Naruko didn't quite know what to do, even as she turned red and goose bumps sprouted up all over her. And judging by her hardened nipples, she was getting really excited too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can't hold secrets from me, Naruko-chan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata would have stayed all night if she could, but her presence was expected back at the compound, so she eventually had to leave. Nevertheless, she walked with a skip to her step and a smile on her face. This was definitely one of the happiest days in her life. While it was unfortunate that things for Naruko had changed so drastically, the Hyuga couldn't help but feel thankful that it happened, as it allowed her to finally make her feelings known to the blonde. Besides, she could think of much worse things than having a perpetually naked significant other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so sexy and thrilling, just picturing Naruko running around everywhere with not a stitch on her. Every inch of skin, every rippling muscle, every drop of glistening sweat was now hers to behold. It was a shame that she would never see what Naruko looked like in a dazzling kimono, or a in a set of daring lingerie, but she supposed nothing could possibly top the blonde's natural beauty anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what she'll do when she goes into battle though?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought dampened Hinata's newfound appreciation of the female form. Naruko's constant nakedness was hot, yes, but now that she had a moment to think more objectively about it, she realized her girlfriend had more to worry about than just embarrassment. Naruko wasn't being naked for her benefit; she was stuck that way, unable to wear anything fashionable, practical, or protective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fell swoop, all of Hinata's happiness vanished. Horrible visions began to fill her mind. Of Naruko shivering on a cold night as snow fell from the sky and frostbite crept its way up her exposed flesh. Of Naruko gasping in pain as a sword slashed across her unprotected stomach, where all her vital organs were. Of Naruko lying on the ground, bleeding to death because she couldn't bandage her wounds and stop the blood from pouring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my Naruko-chan!\" she cried aloud before slamming a palm over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata liked to think the Uzumaki was tough, but she wasn't invincible. No ninja was. And now that her body would not allow itself to be covered, she was more vulnerable than ever before. It was too much; the girl just had to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't panic. Just breathe</i>, she thought as she took a seat under a nearby tree. <i>Naruko-chan's still a ninja, Hokage-sama allowed her to keep her rank and registration. If she thought her condition would be a liability, she would have revoked it. The Hokage has to know how Naruko-chan can cope with her condition...right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded. Yes. Not all was lost. There had to be ways to help Naruko-chan. She'd ask the Hokage herself at her earliest convenience. <i>And I'll do whatever I can as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that's what she would do. She'd gather her herbs and poultices tonight, consult her books on field medicine, and see if she couldn't brew a few things up that would help a naked girl. It wouldn't be much; nothing she made at this point in time would save the blonde from the blast of an explosive note, or from an S-class missing-nin like Orochimaru, but it would be a start. And it would be a far more productive use of her time than just sitting around worrying.</span></div></div>",

Mostly because Sakura never shot it in her direction, though she was certain Naruto was quite familiar with it. It was just her luck to get stuck looking like her damn teammate. Her damn teammate who spent every hour of every day obsessing over her. While they had similar chakra levels, the girl clearly did nothing to make herself physically strong or durable. Sakura's body tired more easily, tolerated less pain, and had far less musculature. It was <b>weak</b>. She clearly spent more time trying to make herself look pretty rather than make herself an effective combatant. No wonder she was such a pathetic ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I transform into <i>her</i> of all things?\" she seethed, almost flinching at the sound of her voice. Even it sounded exactly like Sakura's. \"I should have just turned into that <i>other</i> idiot on my team. It would have done the job just fine. He at least stays in shape, and no girl would have harassed me then. And maybe looking like him would have made her leave me alone permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, just thinking about Naruto only soured the now pink-haired Uchiha's mood even more. It was all <i>his</i> fault this happened to her! Somehow, some way, that moron found a way to ruin her life like nobody ever could. This was definitely the worst day of her life, ever since her brother had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke groaned and rubbed at her oversized temple. All this negativity was making her head throb again. She had spent the last few hours napping with a pack of ice over it. But there was only so much relief that could provide, and she was getting royally sick of lying around. She needed to be up and doing something. Not something physically intensive, but at least something that required expending a little bit of energy.</span></div></div>",

A nice, long, hot one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy marched straight to her bathroom and turned the water on. As she waited for it to heat up, she went about the task of removing her clothing and exposing her female body to the open air for the first time ever. As she unzipped the qipao, she couldn't help but snort in disgust. Even Sakura's clothes were more about appearance over functionality. If they were posing as civilians, sure, they'd be useful, but for training or the combat-related trials Team 7 was often subjected to, they were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why the hell does she wear a bra?!\" Sasuke shouted when she was down to her underwear. \"There's hardly any chest to speak of here. Does she think I'll notice her if she pads her breasts out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke half-growled and half-sighed as she peeled off the garment. Or at least tried to. She messed around with the strap on her back, but couldn't quite unclasp it. Damn, how did girls take these things off? Or put them on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, to hell with it!\" Sasuke grabbed a kunai that she stored in her bathroom and simply cut the bra off, throwing the now useless rag into a nearby wastebasket. She had no need for the stupid thing anyway. If she was lucky, this was about as far as puberty would take the Haruno girl and she wouldn't ever need to figure out how to wear a bra anyway. Satisfied with that, she slipped off her panties and stepped into the shower, sighing appreciatively as the warm water hit her skin. <i>At least this still feels the same</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went about the task of rubbing her body down, washing off the grime of the day and trying not to think about how smooth her flesh now felt as it rolled across her fingertips. \"Hmph, figures Sakura would emphasize skin care over training,\" Sasuke muttered as she ran a hand over a slender arm that had hardly any muscle to go with it. \"It's a wonder she's able to give that blonde idiot any sort of bruise with these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she had mussed with her arms enough, Sasuke moved onto her chest. She sighed glumly as her previously toned male pectorals were nowhere to be felt, replaced instead by soft lumps of feeble flesh. Feeble girl flesh that, while small, felt so bouncy and silken in her grasp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am not enjoying this!\" she snarled. \"It's just a chest. Everyone has one, it's no different from my...what's happening to my nipples?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little nubs on her chest had hardened up suddenly, sticking up like two pink-colored pebbles. Now that...wasn't anything unusual by itself. Nipples hardened for everyone, it was normal. But Sasuke's old male nipples hadn't ever stood this erect before. It looked almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's nothing, it's just a girl thing! Another problem with Sakura's body.\" She had scrubbed her breasts\u2013her chest\u2013enough. She didn't need to touch her girl-nipples anymore. There was nothing special about them now, just as there was nothing special about them before. She had more pressing matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her stomach, which was thankfully firm (it was no six-pack, but it looked like Sakura at least did her sit-ups), and her crotch. Looking at it, Sasuke couldn't help but frown. Not angrily as she had been doing for the past few hours, but somewhat sadly. Little Sasuke was nowhere to be found, and the former boy couldn't help but feel like she lost something really important to her. It wasn't that Sasuke was particularly attached to his member and boys. Hell, sex was usually the last thing on his mind. But their absence meant that reviving the Uchiha clan was going to be a lot more difficult now. All Sasuke could see now was a poofy slit under a strip of pink pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, and to think all this time, I thought Sakura dyed it that way. Learn something new everyday.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders, Sasuke reached a hand downward to her new vagina. She had always made it a habit to clean herself thoroughly, and that meant giving even her genitals proper attention. She slid her middle finger along the groove of her vulva and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shock ran through her body, tingling, electrical, and wet. It came as sudden as a knife in the dark, hitting her with such unrelenting force that it made her slip and fall straight to the floor. But she felt no pain. The sensation she felt burning in her core overwhelmed whatever hurt the fall would have normally caused. If anything she felt...kind of, sort of, almost...pleasant? No that couldn't be it...could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke stared straight ahead, dazed, confused, and with water spraying directly onto her hair. \"What the hell just happened?\"</span></div></div>",

On a day like this, the normally boisterous blonde would have loved to simply run around and burn her bundles of energy. But for some reason, she was compelled to take it slow for once. To just let it all soak in. She didn't know why. Maybe it was the cloudless blue sky hovering over her. Perhaps it was the gentle breeze that caressed her skin. Maybe it was the soft billowing of the trees in the distance. Or maybe it was the fact that she was in such a natural place, untouched by man, in what could only be described as her natural state. And she felt at one with it all. Whatever it was, the tranquility called to her, and the blonde just didn't want to disturb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko-chan,\" a heavenly voice whispered. Naruko smiled as the face of a lavender-eyed angel came into sight. \"I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you too, Hinata-chan,\" she answered, reaching up to rub a hand across the dark-haired beauty's cheek. Hinata giggled and planted a kiss on it as it passed by her mouth before lowering her form close enough to give Naruko another one on the lips. And then on her neck. And then on her collarbone. Slowly, she left a trail of kisses down Naruko's body, which was naked, bare, sunkissed, and starting to work up a sweat. She kissed her way downward, until she reached the slightly parted lower lips of Naruko's most precious secret, which only ever opened for her. And then she kissed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata?\" Naruko sputtered, surprised at the Hyuga's sudden action. Were you supposed to kiss that area? \"W-what are d-doing? OHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata did not answer. She only continued to kiss, using her tongue to open Naruko's nether region just a little more and slither its way inside. Naruko gasped and went limp in an instant, throwing her back as she felt that wet boneless thing slide along her pulsing inner walls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAMI DAMN IT!\" she roared, seizing the alarm that was blaring in her ear and hurling it across the room. Naruko glared hatefully at the detestable machine as it hit the wall and broke into numerous pieces, silencing its odious wails forever. She wanted to savor it, to watch it choke, gasp for breath, and die for so rudely waking her from that wonderful dream. But it was over much too soon. If she had any hope of going back to sleep now, it was long gone. The dream was but a rapidly fading memory. And she now knew that she'd have to go buy another alarm clock later today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge truly did leave you feeling nothing but emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, the blonde slid out from under the covers of her bed, flinching as slightly chilly air hit her bare skin. She felt a distinct dampness on her hand and in between her legs, and knew exactly what that meant. Damn it, she never did...that in her sleep before. Why did sleeping naked in her own bed and feeling the sheets on her skin have to feel so good?</span></div></div>",

Ah, that was baby stuff. Stunted chakra? She still had her fists in that case. Lose an arm? She'd just put a band-aid on it. Dysentery? She didn't quite know what that was, but she was sure she would manage if she ever got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having to approach her team as she was now, female and bare-ass naked, was not something Naruko was sure she was ready for. She felt like she would die of embarrassment if her sensei and teammates saw her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being silly,\" she muttered to herself as she stood up on her feet. \"It's nothing they haven't seen before when you did the Sexy no Jutsu in front of the whole class. You didn't care then, so there's no reason to care now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the bathroom. \"And besides,\" she added as she turned on the water to her shower. \"I'm sure things will be the same as they always are.

Yeah.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly normal. Everything will be perfectly normal.\" Naruko had been repeating those words ad nauseam all morning. She said them in the shower, while she ate breakfast, and as she brushed her long hair. She hoped that if she said them enough, she might actually come to believe them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work. And honestly, how could it have? There was absolutely nothing normal about her situation; every mundane thing she did only served to remind her of her naked femininity. In the shower, she couldn't look down and avoid being turned on by the sight of her wet, slippery body. At the dining table, she could feel every stitch on the matting of her chair as it pressed into her bare butt. And brushing her hair required her to stand in front of the mirror for at least a good twenty minutes, her boobs jiggling before her eyes with every little movement she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, outside the safety of her apartment again, exposed to the elements and Konoha's prying eyes, wearing absolutely nothing but some hair ties to keep her pigtails up and a kunai pouch cum purse on her shoulder with as many essentials as she could carry. She knew someone was watching her, but she didn't bother trying to find the perpetrators. Naruko just wanted to get to the meeting place as fast as possible and get this day over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a sudden tickle in her nose. \"Ah, ah, AH-CHOO!\" she sneezed. \"AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO!\" The girl rubbed her itching nose. \"Damn it, as if I had enough problems. AH-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled down the road, sneezing again and again, barely able to see what was in front of her. So distracted was she, that Naruko failed to catch the paper on the news stand that featured a large photograph of her on the front page with only the thinnest of black bars to cover her up.</span></div></div>",

People were even more surprised to learn that she was never arrested or detained for what would otherwise be considered lewd or indecent behavior, and has in fact been given legal permission by the Hokage to be nude at all times in all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" said one citizen who refused to be named. \"I told her to leave my store, but she then just pulled out these documents signed by the Hokage. I swore that they were faked, but they had all the official seals and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen questioned about this, Tsunade explained that the girl, named Uzumaki Naruko, was suffering under the effects of a newly-discovered medical condition. The girl used to in fact be a male genin named Uzumaki Naruto, who was put under the effect of a jutsu that not only irreversibly changed his appearance and sex, but rendered her incapable of wearing any sort of clothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand the laws of Konoha and intend to enforce them in full,\" said the Hokage. \"However, due to the unique circumstances of Uzumaki's condition, I feel it is only fair to make her an exception to some of them. She has long proven to be a loyal shinobi of the Leaf and it is my belief that she should continue to do her duty with the same rights she had before. Just as we build ramps and elevators to accommodate the physically disabled, so too should we accommodate her own inability to wear clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade later went on to explain that Naruko's condition was not contagious and that all documents pertaining to the unnamed jutsu that changed her have been safely isolated and contained. \"There is no cure at this time. Perhaps we will find one in the future, but until that happens, Konoha will just have to accept Uzumaki for all that she is, nudity and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzumaki Naruko was not available for comment. This isn't the first time the genin has been involved with forbidden jutsu. She made quite a stir some time ago when she broke into the Hokage's library and learned the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more to the article, but Tsunade put the paper down when she heard Shizune approach her desk with Tonton in her arms as usual. \"Tsunade-sama, I've combed through the entire paper and checked all the tabloids as you requested, and I have not seen any mention of...yesterday's incident anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a word?\" said Tsunade in a conspiratorial whisper. \"No stray or illicit photographs? No doctored images?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. I had the camera and all the film in it destroyed, just as you requested, and it appears you have successfully bought the silence of the reporter who saw you. For now, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonton squealed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It's settled then,\" said Tsunade with no happiness whatsoever. She was fortunate that that journalist had been the only one to see her standing naked in the office. Because in order to keep him quiet and take the camera with the incriminating imagery off his hands, she had to pay a lot of ryou. If word got out of what she had done, and that photo made its rounds, the results would have been catastrophic, especially in light of the legalized nudism for Naruko that she herself had sanctioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it all worked out. The reporter's silence was bought, Tsunade's decency and reputation were preserved, and they were able to keep the subject of the interview entirely on Naruko. So the only person who would be scandalized today would be the nudist. Tsunade reached for the bottle of sake she had on her desk and prepared to take a victory swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not quite settled,\" said Shizune as she snatched it out of the Hokage's hand. \"I've calculated the money you lost. If you want your personal finances to stay in the black and avoid any more scandals, then we need to start making a few cuts to our budget. And by 'we,' I mean 'you.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finer, fine,\" grumbled Tsunade. \"What do you propose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That for the next six to eight weeks, you have to give up gambling. And you can't buy any sake or booze for that same amount of time as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stared at the brunette with a blank expression. \"Unreasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that, or we have to cut down on our food expenses,\" at this, Tsunade's eyes strayed over to the pig in Shizune's arms, \"and no, we are not eating Tonton. Or we have to live in this office. And while you may have no problems sleeping at your desk, I would at least like to have my own futon and bathroom. So you're going to have to curb your vices and ration your alcohol for a while. No drinking yourself silly or throwing your money away for six weeks. If you're lucky, which you usually aren't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't just expect me to stay sober for that long!\" Tsunade whined, pouting like a petulant child. \"You just caaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune rolled her eyes. \"Tsunade-sama, can you please act your age just once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her sour mood, Tsunade couldn't help but crack a smirk. It was the only silver lining she got out of this whole messs. \"I would like to remind you, Shizune, that I am currently of the age of a spry twenty-something-year-old woman. I would say that I am indeed acting my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune sighed. \"I still can't believe you actually used the scroll on yourself. What were you thinking? You saw what it did to Sasuke and Naruto. You know how dangerous it could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you get to be the age I am\u2013the age I was\u2013you'll understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had barely slept at all last night. She couldn't get Sasuke out of her mind. They hadn't parted on good terms yesterday, but the pinkette bore him...her...whatever...no ill will. Sasuke was the one she loved more than anything else in the whole world after all, and she understood the Uchiha's rage better than anyone ever could. She just hoped that her new twin would be able to hold it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she was tired, but about as ready for the day as she was going to get. Her hair was primped, her qipao was clean, her skin was flawless, and her weapons were in order. It was time to get moving and hope Kakashi wouldn't be late again. Though if he was, she supposed she could always steal a quick nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading out now. Bye!\" she said as she made her way to the front door of her home. However, she froze in her tracks when she saw a most horrifying sight in the kitchen: her father, slumped over on the table unconscious, with a puddle of blood pooling around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic overtook her mind immediately. \"Daddy!\" she cried, rushing over to him. \"Oh no! Daddy, what's wrong?\" This couldn't be happening. Was he sick? Couldn't be, he seemed fine yesterday. Was there a break-in? Had he been attacked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please be okay, please be okay, please be okay.</i> Sakura checked his pulse. His heartbeat was there, and it seemed healthy. And now that she was close, the pinkette could see that the older man was breathing regularly. She sighed in relief. It looked like things weren't as bad as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what caused this? Why is he bleeding?\" Looking down at his head, she saw that it was resting on a newspaper, and from what she could see, there was a very familiar-looking face of a young woman on the front page. She gently pulled it out, careful not to wake her father, and looked at it. Her jaw dropped. A smear of blood streaked across the paper, but it did little to cover what it displayed: a naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise gave way to anger as she recognized the girl as the same slut who tackled Sasuke yesterday. And anger gave way to mouth-frothing rage as she read the article, realized just who exactly it was, and nearly slapped herself for not realizing it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Someone</b> is going to die today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, they actually put that in the paper? Hee hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna' see! I wanna' see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka blinked in confusion. As his students were getting settled into the classroom, a small crowd had gathered around one boy who had a newspaper propped up on his desk. While the chuunin would have been delighted to see people so young actually keep up with current events, the realist in him couldn't help but be suspicious. No child or teen would be caught dead reading the news in this day and age, and looking at the rather lecherous grins the boys were all sporting, it was clear there was more to this sight than meets the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, boys,\" he said, ascending the steps with an authoritarian gait, \"what's going on up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of panic came over the youths. \"Um, nothing, Iruka-sensei. We're just...reading the comics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then maybe you won't mind if I borrow the rest,\" said the instructor, snatching the paper out of their hands. \"I need to read up on the news myself.\" Which wasn't a lie; he got up a little late this morning and hadn't had time to even glance at the newspaper. It was still in the mailbox at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students all started to back away sheepishly. Iruka hid a smug grin; he knew something was up here. And he was about to find out what it was. However, the moment his eyes hit the front page, a geyser of blood sprayed out of his nose and splattered all over the paper. He expected to find any number of perverse things, like a porno magazine or a hentai manga smuggled in the newspaper. That was pretty typical boy stuff that even he hadn't been immune to. But he did not expect to see the subject of the students' interest right there on the front page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-NARUTO?!\"</span></div></div>",

But that's what happened, because it appeared that somebody had cut out just about the entire front page, leaving a massive hole where the cover story was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, father?\" Hanabi asked when she sensed his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanabi,\" he said, pointing at the large window in his newspaper, \"have you been vandalizing my reading material again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl simply shook her head. \"No. It was not me this time.\" Hiashi peered at her with narrowed eyes, not so sure if he believed her. It didn't <i>look</i> like she was lying, but she could have been working on her poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked again. \"Do you have any idea who could have done it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply shook her head. \"Yes, I am sure, father. And no, I have no idea who did it. Perhaps it was Nee-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata? Hiashi would have laughed out loud at this if he could physically do such a thing (damn that botched facelift). That girl was just too obedient to play any sort of stunt like this. He had to admit, he hadn't seen her all morning, but then again, that wasn't unusual. The only times she didn't make herself scarce in the compound was when her actual presence was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" he said, folding the paper up and deciding to turn his attention to his meal instead. It was just a newspaper, it cost only a few of ryou, and was often written by a misinformed journalist with a clear bias who was looking to sell more copies with an attention-getting headline. It was not a dependable way to learn about the going-ons of the village. If anything really important was happening, he'd be one of the first to know. He was the head of one of the most prestigious clans after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at least the funnies and sports sections were still there. So there was no real reason to get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata left the Hyuga compound with an uncharacteristic bounce to her step and a fanciful tune whistling out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" said her little shoulder devil. \"I didn't actually think you'd go through with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know\" said Hinata with a slight blush and an embarrassed smile, \"when I saw it just sitting there, I knew I just had to have it. And you made a pretty sound argument about why I should take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you could have just bought your own copy, like Goody-Two-Sandals suggested. It wouldn't have been any problem at all. But instead, you just took a kunai, and cut the whole article out! Don't think your father's going to be pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing I ever do would please him anyway, so,\" Hinata paused to take a quick look around and make sure no one was within earshot. Nobody was. \"Fuck him,\" she finished in a very quiet whisper. It wasn't like her to direct such course language at her father (or ever for that matter), but she was in too good of a mood to be her usual demure self. Life was too short to be submissive and respectful to your elders 24-7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's hope for you yet, young grasshopper,\" said Devil Hinata. \"Now how about we...take a nice long look while we still have time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay.\" Hinata spotted a section of trees just off the road. That seemed like a safe place to hide and do her ogling. The Hyuga scurried a little deep into the trees until she was confident she was well out of sight. Taking a seat, she pulled the sheet she had cut out from her father's newspaper and unfurled it like it was a sacred scroll. There she was, her dear Naruko, out in the streets of Konoha, surrounded by gawkers, looking like she was desperately trying to avoid making eye contact with anyone, and oblivious to the fact that she had just been photographed. And most of all, she was completely naked. A thin black bar stretched across her breasts and another extended downward over her crotch to hide her nipples and vagina from the public's sensitive eyes, but they otherwise did nothing to hide the blonde's gorgeous figure from view. You could still see her breasts, her feminine curves, her toned stomach, and the V-shape of her mound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata thought it was completely unnecessary; Naruko couldn't wear clothing, and the article said as much. People were going to be seeing all her private parts whether they wanted to or not, so they better get used to it. But still, she couldn't help but enjoy just having the article in her possession. The paper was cheap, the picture was slightly grainy, and it was censored. But it was the first of what the Hyuga hoped would be an extensive collection of pictures and memorabilia of her sexy girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about\" said Devil Hinata as she buried her right hand into her skimpy kimono. \"C-c'mon, Hinata. You should try doing this. The risk of getting of caught makes it even hotter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, n-no thanks,\" said the blunette with an embarrassed blush as she rolled the article up and put it back in her backpack. She was feeling aroused and rebellious, but not <i>that</i> rebellious. \"I, uh, need to go meet my team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon! Live a little, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that later when I go see Naruko-chan today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the pieces are falling into place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke glared at the newspaper on her table as if she was pouring over maps and battle strategies. It seemed that Naruto had fallen victim to the same curse the Uchiha did. And Naruto had been that crazy bitch who tackled him in the street yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill didn't explain what exactly happened. The Hokage had been deliberately vague. So the naked blonde idiot-turned-bimbo was now Sasuke's last lead to figuring out how this transformation happened to her. That settled things. Sasuke would confront what her teammate had become, shake her down for answers, and then...well, she'd cross that bridge when she reached it. But one way or another, Naruto, or Naruko as she called herself now, was going to pay for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke continued to glare intensely at the photograph of the naked girl. At her stupid pretty face, at her stupid long legs, at her stupid gentle curves, at her stupid nice rack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke shook her head. Damn it, she was wasting time, staring at that picture for too long. It was messing with her head. She needed to get out now, go see Naruko face-to-face, and get her answers once and for all.</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for her to realize the impossibility of that task, for the world just loved to remind the boy-turned-girl of her constant nudity. The morning\u2019s cool air touched her everywhere, especially on the parts of her that never felt them before. It was on her back, her collarbone, her thighs, her chest, her nipples, the cleft of her buttocks, and even within her lower lips every time they parted. The soles of her bare feet pressed into the stonework of the bridge, and she found herself periodically kicking to get rid of whatever dust and pebbles had clung to them. Even the simple act of leaning brought her nakedness to the font of her mind, as the skin on her bare back seemed to mold itself onto the smooth polished wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up straight with a growl of frustration. \u201cWhere the hell is everyone?\u201d Naruko had been dreading the minute she would have to show her teammates her new self, but now that she was here waiting for them, the suspense was killing her. She began pacing back and forth. Minutes ticked by and the only thing she could think about was how she was going to explain what she was doing standing here looking like a centerfold. How she was going to dodge Sakura\u2019s first punch when it came and how much it would hurt now that she had nothing on to absorb the blow. And how she was a girl, and she had no clothes on, and how her body was so sensitive now, and it felt so soft and round and squishy and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko stopped herself. Great, she was doing it again. One hand was groping her breast, while the other was cupping her butt and tracing her feminine curves. Damn it, this was becoming a bad habit. Some people bit their fingernails, some scratched their heads, some twirled their hair\u2026and Naruko felt herself up. And when she felt herself up, she got aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does being a girl have to feel so good?\u201d she muttered. \u201cAnd why do I have to be so sexy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a cold shower. Fast. She looked up. The day certainly was muggy and a blanket of clouds covered the sky. A chance of rain was likely. Unfortunately, she had no idea when or if that would actually happen, so she turned her gaze downward to the water. It looked a whole lot more promising, and very tempting actually. Truth be told, back when she was a boy, Naruko had always though that taking a dip would be a good way to kill time while waiting for Kakashi. It\u2019s just that it was always problematic. Working and training in wet clothes was a real drag, and stripping down to undies in public always just felt wrong (and would likely result in a beating from Sakura). But since Naruko didn\u2019t have any clothes to take off or soak anymore\u2026</span></div></div>",

Putting her makeshift purse down, the naked blonde vaulted up onto the railing and dove headfirst into the canal. The water enveloped her with minimal splash and the shock of its coolness hit her so hard, she couldn\u2019t help but gasp when her head broke over the surface. But it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant kind of shock. It actually felt kind of nice on her skin. It was just\u2026so weird. So strangely unfamiliar. Naruko had swam and bathed in plenty of rivers and lakes before in the past, back when she was a boy, but feeling the cool water over her now bare feminine body was something else entirely. It was much like how the equally cool air hit all her exposed sensitive areas, like her breasts, her nipples, her navel, her thighs, her butt, her hips, and even inside her vagina (<i>I\u2019ll never get used to the fact that I have one of those now.</i>)\u2026but the sensation was stronger. More firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove under the surface again and propelled herself forward with a powerful kick of her legs. A shiver ran down her whole form as the water glided across her skin like a giant silken hand. She kicked her legs some more, spreading them out and letting the water's light current flow directly into her opening. A bubble escaped her mouth as she let out a gasp underwater. This felt so much better as a girl. And naked. Every small motion she made brought new bouts of pleasure. She swam about in circles, marveling at how the water felt on all her womanly parts. Her long hair trailed behind her gracefully as if it were made of air, her breasts almost seemed to flatten into her chest as she moved forward before floating weightlessly back up as her momentum slowed down, and soft liquid seeped into her crevices and curves without ever feeling invasive. It was like her every inch was being lovingly caressed, kissed, and licked all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko broke the surface again, spraying droplets of water upward as she drew in a deep breath of air. Even that action sent a wave of pleasure over her, as the contrast of the cool air on her wet skin was so strong and alien. Her plan backfired. She had gone into the water to shake her arousal off, but instead, it was intensified. Standing up so that the water came up to her waist, Naruko gave her right breast a firm squeeze with her left hand, moaning in ecstasy at the feeling it produced. She couldn't help herself anymore. Her whole body was dripping wet from without and within, and it was screaming for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But is that really such a bad thing? Is it so bad to love your own body?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill massaging her wonderful breast, Naruko dragged her free hand down her toned stomach and straight to where her pussy awaited under the water. She bit her lips as she stroked her clitoris, stifling a happy moan that threatened to escape as her loins flared with pure electricity, before sinking her whole finger directly into her womanhood. She suppressed another gasp as she curled it inward, feeling it brush all sides of her narrow inner folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does it have to feel so good? Why does it have to be so good...to be...a woman? And naked?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko didn't have an answer. She couldn't think of one. She couldn't even think, period. All she could do was stroke, rub, caress, feel, and love herself from the inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasuke had been walking down the street with such angry determination that the horrified gasp caught her by surprise. Looking up, her green eyes met the brown ones of a girl around her age. Likely another one of the Uchiha's crazy fans. But rather than be met with the usual bashful smile or friendly wave Sasuke was familiar with, she saw something almost completely unknown to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked mortified, as though she had just her favorite pet get run over by a carriage. Mortification soon turned to rage as the girl glared daggers at the newly-transformed pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-you...you SLUT!\" she howled. Sasuke blinked in confusion. What the hell was her problem? Sasuke was just minding her own business, picturing all the wonderful ways she was going to wring a certain blonde's neck, when suddenly this almost stranger was hurling insults at her. Was there something on Sasuke's face? Was there something wrong with her clothes? She had on her gray shorts and collared blue shirt that she always wore, and they did feel a little loose on her slim female body, but that still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLAT!</b> Some soft and squishy hit the Sakura look-alike in the head and seemed to partially explode. Sasuke was too taken aback to respond. Not that she would have had much to say anyway, for the girl who threw the item promptly turned around and ran away, sobbing uncontrollably. So first a girl insults Sasuke, throws something at her, and then runs off? That never happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kind of liquid trickled its way down Sasuke's face and she instinctively licked at it. \"Mmm, tomato juice,\" she mused. \"Very ripe too.\" She peeled off the object that flattened itself on her face. It was a tomato. For whatever reason, that mystery girl saw fit to throw a tomato at Sasuke. She decided that she was supposed to feel insulted by the action, but she had to admit, it was a welcome change from the usual reaction girls gave the Uchiha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, a free tomato was a free tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what that was all about?\" she asked as she wiped the stray bits of fruit off her face and ate them. Girls never threw things at Sasuke before. What would compel them to do that now? Guess it was as Naruto always said: girls were weird. He may have been an idiot, but occasionally, something insightful would come out of that thick head of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke suddenly scowled. Just thinking about the blond idiot brought her anger back to the forefront. She wasn't here to ponder about the female gender or tomatoes. She was here for <u>revenge</u>. And answers. And she was going to get them both from the newly-transformed bimbo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the bridge. Didn't look like anyone was there yet. That was fine, she could wait. However, a soft feminine moan caught her attention, and looking down, Sasuke saw the shape of a very familiar and very naked girl in the canal. She was standing waist-deep in the water with her back turned, gyrating her hips into it with serpentine motions. Soft ripples emanated from her form in gentle circles, and if the Uchiha peered carefully, she could catch quick glimpses of the topmost portion of the girl's bare butt peaking out of the water. She breathed lowly, deeply and huskily, almost as if she was panting in exhaustion, but she honestly didn't look like she was the least bit winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a normal day, Sasuke would not have hesitated to jump into action and teach his annoying teammate a lesson. But for some reason, all the newly-transformed girl could do now was stare at the naked woman in the water and wonder. She didn't know why\u2013hell, she didn't even know what in the spirits' names she was seeing\u2013but something about Naruko's movements and her voice was...hypnotizing.</span></div></div>",

Naruto!\" she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko didn't think. When she heard the voice call out her old name, she merely let out a startled squeak and dove into the water with a clumsy splash. Damn it, she <i>knew</i> she shouldn't have done...that! But it felt just so amazing to be out and about in the altogether like this, and now that she knew how to properly pleasure herself, she...well, she couldn't really resist. And when she got started, she didn't want to stop. And despite her sudden embarrassment at being caught, she still didn't. Her vagina seemed to be just as surprised as she was, and it released her juices right there into the canal. Naruko could feel it even under the water and with great shame, knew just what it meant. She had an orgasm outside, in broad daylight, with a captive audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, the day had only just begun, and it was already the most humiliating one in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's okay, Naruko. It happened underwater. Nobody has to know what you were doing. Nobody has to know that you came. Just let the water wash it all away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her assurances, Naruko couldn't stop the blush from creeping across her face. Crouching so that she was up to her chin in the canal, she turned around to face the intruder. When she saw a pair of green eyes glaring at her under a mop of pink hair, her heart fell. This was not the person Naruko wanted to see right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sakura-chan,\" she said, resisting her natural urge to start running. \"Um...f-fancy seeing you here today. Uh...nice weather we're having, huh?\" Hopefully a little casual conversation would calm the bubblegum terror down a little bit. Lowering her gaze a little, she saw that the Haruno was not wearing her usual qipao, but what appeared to but a familiar blue shirt and pair of gray shorts. From some of the material she had read before, she quickly realized just what that entailed. \"Um, and I see that you're wearing some of Sasuke's things. Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Naruto seen a sight like this just the day before yesterday, he probably would have done something really stupid right now. Like run away crying because Sakura broke his heart again. Or go find Sakura, get on his hands and knees, and beg her to give him a chance to prove his love to her once and for all because he was so much better than the Uchiha bastard. Or...maybe he would just beat Sasuke up just to prove he was more worthy of her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it happened today. Naruto was Naruko and she had Hinata now, who over a matter of hours completely stole her heart with her kindness, patience, understanding, and the fact that she <i>really</i> knew how to treat a lady. So the blonde couldn't really care less who Sakura hooked up with anymore. She was over her, and if Sakura was going to start dating Sasuke, then Naruko would simply wish her all the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Naruko's words, the anger on Sakura's face suddenly vanished as an expression of befuddlement came over her. \"Congratulations? What are you...oh forget it!\" And the scowl returned. \"I'm not Sakura, dumbass. I'm Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruko was confused. \"Sasuke?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. \"What are you doing looking like...oh. Ohhhhh. You, uh, were got too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was 'got,'\" the Uchiha seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko sunk even deeper into the water until her mouth barely breached its surface. She could feel the killing intent from the girl on the bridge. Sasuke couldn't have looked scarier now if he\u2013she\u2013tried. Though the fact that the Uchiha now looked like the always frightening Sakura probably had something to do with it. \"I'm...really sorry,\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO ME?!\" roared Sasuke with that same voice Sakura used whenever she got mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident!\" Naruko cried, standing up straight and exposing her boobs to the air. \"I was just trying to get that scroll to the Hokage's after I got changed, when all of a sudden you bumped into me. It unwrapped itself and you and everyone else got caught in its jutsu! I didn't want for this to happen to anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how I got...infected,\" growled Sasuke. \"You were messing around with power you had no understanding or respect for! I always knew you were an idiot, but this...this is a new low for you! What the hell were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't, alright!\" said Naruko, tears forming in her eyes. \"I know I screwed up, I get it, you don't need to remind me! But I didn't get out of this unscathed either! And put yourself in my shoes, which I can't wear anymore just so you know. Imagine you're just out training in the field when suddenly a big hole opens up under you and you see a scroll there. Wouldn't you be a little curious about what it did too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange look fell over Sasuke. The death glare on her face faded away and her whole body seemed to go completely rigid. \"Which training field are you talking about?\" she asked in an oddly blank tone. It didn't sound angry, but Naruko couldn't shake the feeling of dread that was building up in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you know, the one we usually go to when Kakashi-sensei trains us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that was also because of you,\" said Sasuke in that same eerily tranquil tone. Naruko waited for her to follow up with another round of insults, but none came. Instead, she went completely rigid. She didn't shout, she didn't twitch, she didn't even blink. If Naruko hadn't been talking to her, she would have sworn that the pinkette was a statue. The only sign of life she could see was the angry shade of red that began to rapidly spread across every surface of Sasuke's fair skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Sasuke?\" Naruko asked, stepping forward a little hesitantly, the water sloshing against her bare waist.</span></div></div>",

She spun around and made a beeline for the edge of the canal. Not trusting her ability to clamber up the steep incline fast enough, she swiftly summoned a couple of shadow clones. They were naked like her, but right now, the blonde could not afford to take a moment to admire their beauty. She needed to get out of here. Fast. They hoisted her up onto the shore and the very second her foot hit dry land, she broke into a run, hoping to put as much distance between her and the angry pink-haired terror that was Sasuke as she possibly could.</span></div></div>",

There was now a paved path leading into Konoha, and could see children on a playground. What was a training field was now a park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided to see what else had changed. He was startled when the full scope of the changes became clear to him. The defensive walls were gone and the mountain had no faces. The buildings were tall and imposing. The streets were paved and the main roads had a strange kind of machine on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran home unsure if it was still there. Thankfully he recognized his home. He opened the door, but his apartment was much larger with multiple rooms. The neighboring apartment no longer existed. He walked into the kitchen and noticed a note on the refrigerator that said, \"Naruko, I'll be out early today so don't be surprised if I'm gone when you wake up, and don't be late to school. Love, your awesome mom.\" \"Naruko? Mom? School? What?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was completely confused. He wondered if anything still the same. He walked into his room. It was clearly a girls room. The closet had a halfway open door and it contained several blouses, skirts and even a few dresses. The walls had several posters of boys.  The bed sheet was blue like his eyes, there was a pillow with a red spiral, and a Kyuubi plushy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed a school uniform that generally consisted of a white blouse with a dark blue sailor-style collar that had short-sleeves, and a matching dark blue pleated skirt. A red tie and a knee-high stockings were laid out beside the uniform. Naruto had a feeling of familiarity as if it belonged to him. He felt a compulsion to wear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His face changed, becoming notably feminine and his whiskers disappeared. His hair grew and became straight. His arms and legs became slender and smooth, and his shoulders narrowed. His chest grew large breasts, his stomach became flat. The final change occurred when Naruto felt a growing warmth that radiated out from inside, his hips widened as a uterus formed, and the warmth became pleasure. Naruto moaned and his voice became higher. The pleasure faded allowing Naruto to gather himself, or rather herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror showed him what he feared. He saw a girl. She looked similar to his Sexy jutsu, although she was more real. She was a civilian schoolgirl. Naruto looked for anything that could help. She found a school bag with a student I.D.

His arm brushed his chest this causing him to look down.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto noticed several things. He had long, straight blonde hair that reached his chest. The swell of sizeable breasts. In disbelief he moved his hands to confirm their existence. Ignoring Tsunade, he moved to the mirror to examine the rest of his body. Naruto stumbled off-balance when he stood up. He felt the way his hips swayed, and the weight of his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror revealed a well-toned, but distinctly female body. Her face had familiar blue eyes and whiskered cheeks. She had long waist-length hair. Her arms with narrow shoulders were slim and well-muscled. Strong legs that were long and slender. Larger than average breasts. A flat and lean abdomen. Hips flaring outward making room for a uterus. Her pubic hair forming a triangle emphasizing her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl. How?,\" asked a confused Naruto. Tsunade said, \"I was hoping you had an idea.\" \"The last I saw was a flash. I don't remember anything else.\" Tsunade reluctantly told her, \"I'm sorry, but with nothing to go on it looks like your going to stuck this way.\" A stunned Naruto found her way back to the bed. \"What's going to happen now, Baa-chan?\" \"I'll help you adjust, and if your fit for duty there is nothing stopping you from fulfilling your dreams.\" She smiled and said, \"Thanks Baa-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could continue their conversation a masculine scream interrupted them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She told them, \"I'm sorry, but like I told Naruto, without a lead I'm afraid there is nothing I can do.\"  Naruto revealed her feelings, \"Honestly by the time you find something I think we'll be comfortable with our bodies. I think it's still changing us.\" The now male Hinata echoed Naruto, \"I agree with Naruto, this is starting to feel normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade decided to examine them both physically and psychologically before releasing them. </span></div></div>",

With every step, fat began to build up as his body shifted to a more mature form. His legs began to change as with every step, growing longer as the clack of his new heels seemed to match the stretching and formation of new muscle. Leaning heavily on the railway, Naruto was sweating profusely as he finally looked down to see what the transformation had done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat. The. Hell!?\u201d he nearly yelled out as the shock overtook his caution. He was barely pushing 5 feet the last time he checked, but was now a modest 5\u20198\u201d for crying out loud! Looking down, his view was partially obscured by two large mounds hanging from his chest. The heels that grew (he didn\u2019t even want to know he was walking this well) added to that already massive increase in height. Planting his hands around his hips, he felt the pillowy shape of a derri\u00e8re most women would kill for complimenting a pair of long, silky smooth legs that taunted him with it\u2019s femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I have to get those keys!\u2019 he thought as he panicked and began to hyperventilate. Calming down, he quickly made his way down the stairs, well aware of how awkward it was to walk. After what felt like an eternity, Naruto spotted the keys a few feet away. \u201cThank goodness the keys aren\u2019t that far,\u201d he muttered as he made his to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then bent over to retrieve the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar pain began to shoot across his body as braced himself against the ground. As if an invisible being was observing the changes, Naruto\u2019s hands slimmed down and lengthened. As his arms went through a similar change, Naruto noticed his skin growing pale and shinier as a healthier hue overtook his tanned features. His back arched out as his spine curves, the rest of his bone structure morphing and taking a new shape. The remaining traces of baby fat around his stomach thinner and curved, complimented by an hourglass figure. The bits of fat that remained pushed into his already sizable chest, straining the bra to its limit as the mounds bulged out even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed as Naruto waited to see if any more changes occurred. Feeling nothing for the moment, Naruto scooped up the keys and raced back to the stairs. Mindful of the heels and the natural sway of his hips, Naruto finally unlocked the door and made his way inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Making his way in, Naruto made sure no one saw him enter his apartment. Locking the door behind him, Naruto slid down the wall as sat down against the wall. \u201cMan, could this day get any worse? I try to train and get stronger, but instead I\u2019m turning into some big breasted she-male! It feels like every time I take two steps forward, I get thrown back even further. This sucks!\u201d he whined as he wrapped his arms around his legs to sulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at the wall for an hour, Naruto figures that the transformation had stopped for now. Hearing a grumble in his stomach, he decided to go heat up some ramen. Taking the ramen to boil, Naruto couldn\u2019t help but take notice of the way his body felt as he moved. \u201cMan, how do women deal with this?\u201d he wondered aloud. Moving to his room to find a mirror, he noted his hips seemed to sway with every step taken. The subtle bouncing of different parts of his body didn\u2019t escape him, the small accompanying clacks of the heels not really affecting his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the mirror, he took a long glance at what stared back. His head was still the same, aside from his skin looking soft and pale. That was where similarities end though, as his torso was svelte and built like a woman in her twenties. Large, generous breasts strained against the top of his jacket being barely held back by an ill-fitting bra and fishnet. A tight core formed his stomach, laying flat as it rounded into an hourglass shape. Full childbearing hips and a large ass similarly strained his pants, while his now larger calves peeked out and made it look like he wore a pair of orange capris instead of a jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a hand full of the ripe flesh, he moaned as the sensations of grabbing such sensitive flesh left him erect. \u201cOh god, this is-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiiinnnngggg. The timer went off, scaring Naruto as the ramen finished. Nearly jumping in shock, he struggled to maintain his balance in the heels. \u201cOh god! I nearly broke my neck! Gotta go get my ramen,\u201d he said as he placed a hand over his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look, he turned to make his way to the kitchen. Deciding to try something different, he began to walk like some of the sensei\u2019s he saw. At first, it was a bit awkward moving to the sway of his hips, but it eventually got used to the rhythm of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the ramen from the stove top, he settled down as he took a bite from the cup. And promptly spit it out. \u201cGood god! This shit is disgusting!\u201d Trying to have another bite, the salty broth of the ramen nearly caused him to lose his lunch. Pushing the cup away, he didn\u2019t notice his mouth beginning to shift as his lips plumped up and push into a pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, he moved to search the fridge for something different. And inside was mainly different vegetables and meats from Sakura\u2019s last attempt to get him to eat healthy. Finally deciding to settle on a prepackaged salad, he sat down in his spot to eat the meal. \u201cHey! This isn\u2019t too bad! Sakura has some good taste,\u201d he muttered as his eyes began to shift. With the taste surprising his taste buds, he didn\u2019t notice them becoming a shade of bright yellow before slanting into a vulpine shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the meal, he got up and cleaned off the table before moving to his room. Swaying his hips in sensuous manner, Naruto\u2019s hair began to flatten and grow. Reaching the small of his back and framing his face, his appearance was now that of a buxom blonde woman wearing an ill-fitting outfit. Walking past the mirror without a glance, Naruto felt woozy as he barely made it to the bed. Laying down, he was barely aware of a burning sensation in his crotch as he passed out. Unaware of the seal spreading a mixture of red and yellow chakra across his body.</span></div></div>",

What the hell do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chuckle met his challenge. \u201c<b>Oh, what\u2019s wrong my dear boy</b>?

A pair of smaller but still ominous red eyes glowed is the dark. A red tail made of red chakra wrapped around his ankle, dragging in the now captive jinchuuriki into the cage. \u201c<b>...AT ALL</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the Kyuubi male or female?</span></div></div>",

Blowing a stray lock of hair out of his face Naruto looked at the now visible shape in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the normal towering form of a beast, the Kyuubi now took on a form that seemed familiar. An adult male sat on a simple throne, calming observing the transformed beauty. Spiky red hair fell to his shoulders, highlighted by an impossibly built body of muscle. The face was built similar to pictures of the Yondaime, with deep whisker marks marking the cheeks like a feral tattoo. The same red eyes met the yellows, entrancing all attention on him. \u201c<b>Well, you have certainly turned out well, haven\u2019t you?</b>\u201d came a calm voice. Manifesting an elaborate black pipe, he took a hit of the object before blowing out a stream of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to me? And how the hell did you break the seal?\u201d growled out Naruto, before inhaling some of the smoke. Instead of coughing on it, the scent was... intoxicating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another puff off the pipe, the human Kyuubi blew a longer stream before answering. \u201c<b>Easy. That little cursed object that pushed itself onto you was drawn in by your excess chakra. Had you encountered anyone from the accursed village, you would  turn into some vapid version of their ideal woman. Forever drawn into some life of marital bliss or whatever. But you didn\u2019t, and the curse did the only thing it could. It drew on my desire for freedom, and began to release me.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t escape,\u201d commented a slightly dazed Naruto. The smoke was beginning to get to him, making him crave the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Astute observation. The seal had a failsafe put in place, summoning the Yondaime and my previous container to restrain and rebuild the seal should it break. But luck was in my favor, since the curse entrapped them in my side. From there, it was child\u2019s play to overtake the fools and utilize their stored knowledge to manipulate the seal. I simply dictated the curse from there, turning you into the form that reflects your physical form now,</b>\u201d he finished. Observing Naruto\u2019s fascination with the pipe, he simply handed it off. \u201c<b>Take in smoke, savor the flavor, and blow out if you must.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the pipe, Naruto stared for a second before deciding to take a hit. Inhaling, a sweet scent enter the lungs of jinchuuriki for few seconds. Blowing out, Naruto\u2019s mind felt cloudy as the final effects began to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at the last stage of his plan working, the Kyuubi continued on. \u201c<b>Simply put, I stripped the Yondaime and my container of their physical forms. Taking the form and knowledge of your vaulted Hokage, I altered my physical form accordingly. As for my previous container, I altered her memories to affect you and overwrite you personality to something more fitting. So, how do you feel... Youko?</b>\u201d As he finished, he observed his handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sewer had dispersed as he told his story, becoming a large throne room with an adjacent bench covered in large ornate pillows. And laying on this bench was the newly converted Youko. Two large fox ears now sat on her head drooping and twitching at the sound of movement. A large bushy blonde tail stuck out her tailbone, swinging lazily as she lounged. An elaborate black kimono with flame designs hugged her impressive figure. Cut off near her breasts, the fabric cradled the bottoms while creating a deep canyon of cleavage for all to see. Taking a long drag, Youko blew out a trail of smoke before a voice oozing sexual energy answered back. \u201cExcellent, my lord.

Don\u2019t ask for something you\u2019re not prepared to give away so easily. No, want I need from you is simple: building up a foundation for an eventual takeover and our freedom. These foolish shinobi have enslaved my kin, and have the gall to use chakra to wage war! It is NOT what my father wanted, and there WILL be a reckoning. You will assist in freeing the other bijuu, while routing the Akatsuki through whatever means available,\u201d he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYouko was definitely intrigued by his declaration. \u201cAnd how do you propose we do this? While you do have a human form here, I don\u2019t believe it works quite like that in the human world. And how would I route this Akatsuki? I\u2019m certainly not weak, but I\u2019m not exactly built to tear through multiple monsters in human flesh,\u201d she commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you won\u2019t be fighting. I will personally deal with those vermin before it becomes a problem. As for maintaining a human form, the foolish Yondaime sealed half my power within himself before death. There exists techniques to bring the dead back, so I\u2019ll overwhelm his spirit to recreate myself with a human body.

That fool Gato from Wave gave me an idea, and the Yondaime\u2019s knowledge is useful for espionage. You\u2019ll present yourself as a capable investor, and eventually take over a business as a front. Preferably, it will be involved with shinobi, so you have a valid reason to interact and spy on them. The more information you acquire and relay to me, I will be able to undercut and sabotage the villages. Eventually, I will free my kin and ensure they cannot be sealed by creating physical tethers to prevent fuinjutsu from being effective,\u201d he growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of the humans after? You know they won\u2019t bow so easily,\u201d she said while idly purring out smoke rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gave her a measured look. \u201cThey\u2018ll either bow, or risk perishing to the wrath of the bijuu. After that, I will not care what they do. Aside from the putrid Uchiha clan, they will be of no concern. Hell, you can rule over them if you wish!\u201d cackled the amused demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do I get in all this? It\u2019s sounds very convenient for you, but I don\u2019t receive anything tangible from this arrange,\u201d Youko whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Kurama decided to play along with the vixen. \u201cVery well.

I thought I was the key piece in your plan?!\u201d she yelled out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Oh it\u2019s quite simple, dear Youko. For twelve years, your body served as my seal and prison. So know, it\u2019s only fair to use your body to repay the debt. You\u2019ll serve as incentive for anyone wishing to sign the contract. And the best part, oh the best part. You\u2019ll bear a kitsune every time someone wishes to sign or utilize the contract!</b>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Youko by the waist, he sealed her into a fiery kiss. Red chakra swirled around the kitsune, making her feel numb as the world around her shrank into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama reformer in a swirl of red chakra, taking his surroundings. \u201c<b>To be free once more. Truly, a glorious day.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking where Youko\u2019s body last was, a large ornate scroll sat in it\u2019s place. Opening the scroll, a picture of Youko standing seductively smoking her pipe occupied a large part of the top corner. Underneath, rows of blank columns occupied the rest of the space, awaiting the signatures of future summoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Have fun Youko!</b>\u201d Kurama cackled as he sent the contract off to a potential summoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho ends up with the scroll?</span></div></div>",

Grabbing a kunai, he calls out to the direction of the disturbance. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he called out in a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting no response, Sasuke tossed the kunai into a nearby wooded area near the sound. Feeling no chakra spikes and hearing no movement, he went to see what made the noise. Pushing past a bush, he saw a large black scroll occupying a piece of land. Treading carefully, he picked up the scroll and moved it to the training ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is a scroll doing in a random training ground?\u201d he muttered. Deciding to take a risk, he unfurled the scroll slowly... to reveal a blank summoning contract. \u2018An explicit one at that,\u2019 he thought, seeing the picture of a busty kitsune woman smoking a pipe. \u201cMight as well use it. The worst that happens is I decide the summons are worthless,\u201d he said with a scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the explanation about summoning contracts he received from Kakashi, he bit his thumb and signed the scroll.

Naruto felt an intense heat spread throughout his body. He cried out in pain as he felt his body change. His body reshaped itself into a new form. On the inside his bones and organs changed position. His hips widened, and his shoulders narrowed. His external flesh also changed as two mounds grew on his chest, and between his legs he could feel his genitals recede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped for air when the changes finished. She crawled toward the nearest body. Her reflection revealed several more changes. Her eyes were yellow with snake-like eyes. She also had a pair of fangs. She ran her tongue across them, and realized her tongue had also became more snake-like. Naruto knew only one person who had similar features as her face. She looked like Orochimaru, but she knew he lacked the fangs, and forked tongue. Naruto hissed in anger at the thought of having any similarity to him. Her anger caused her fangs to extend and leak venom. Her anger manifested differently. It was a cold anger different from her usual screams and shouts. She realized she found her previous self beneath contempt. She was such a child. Hokage, What a joke. Desiring to lead those cretins was pure stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her forehead protector to throw it away, however she noticed a difference instead of a leaf it was a note. The irony amused her.   </span></div></div>",
