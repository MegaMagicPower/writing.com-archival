It's while in pursuit of this goal that you stumble upon a store you've never seen before crammed between a shoe store and and electronics store. the store looks older, far older than anything else in the mall, like something out of the seventeen hundreds of something, but of course there's no way that can be the case, as the mall itself was only built about ten years ago. Looking through the shop window, you see a large variety of unusual object of every description, most of them pretty old looking, though some seem to be fairly new. The sign mounted above the front of the store, made of old and weather beaten wood with hand painted lettering, labels it as Feldan's Magic emporium. You figure it's probably some sort of antique store judging by all the junk inside. Being curious, you make your way inside and begin looking around for anything that catches your attention, eventually making your way over towards____________________?  </span></div></div>",

It seemed like you had been looking at it with your face and hands pressed against the glass when a voice came from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the Queen's Sin has chosen you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break your graze from the choker to turn to see a very tall and lanky man standing there.  His face was that of a man who's eyes and face seemed to show more age than his body did.  He wore a crimson robe with a mesmerizing pattern on it and carried a long black cane with an absurdly large green gem at the handle.  \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that you have been chosen by the Queen's Sin.  I must say I'm surprised.  It hasn't chosen a potential wielder for centuries.\"  You gave the man a look and he quickly added, \"Or so I've been told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaunt man chuckled, \"This store is much more than it seems, I do not so much sell items, as much as I wait for them to find new owners.  It is my lot in life and I am happy to fulfill it.  And you young man, are one of the chosen few.  You have been selected to own one of my trinkets.\"  The man walked slowly past you and opened up the display case and without even tell him what you wanted, he took out the choker and gave it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's face suddenly became more strained as though he was holding something back, \"It does not cost anything monetarily.  However...it will cost you.  Potentially greatly if you are found unworthy.  But if you complete you tasks you shall become more than you could ever dream.  More than the world has seen in over a millennium.\"  The man sat down on a chair and spoke as though recalling something, \"The Queen's Sin once belonged to a great and powerful queen from so long ago time has forgotten her.  So was so powerful she managed to control the uncontrollable power of Sin itself.\"  The man held up his fingers and began counting down.  \"Lust.  Envy.  Gluttony.  Wrath.  Pride.  Greed.  Sloth.  She wielded them all.  First she mastered them for herself and then used her power to control.  It eventually overcame her and the power was sealed into the Queen's Sin.  It's been in this store ever sense awaiting a new owner.  A new master.\"  The old man finally seemed to snap out of his memory and looked you in the eyes.  You could see so much in his eyes and had so many questions you didn't know where to start.  The old man continued, \"I see potential for greatness in you.  Whether that be great good or evil I can not yet tell.  But I believe you will change the world.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and walked you out the door of the store.  \"Now go.  As soon as you put on the Queen's Sin your new life will begin.  Your journey will be hard, but do try to have fun.  You're still so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found your tongue, \"But, I'm sorry I don't think I get it.  I just found a neat piece of jewelry and you're telling me all this about sin and power and...this is just nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will learn in time.  Just wear the Queen's Sin.  Touch the stone and picture the sin you wish to try to master.  The Queen's Sin shall do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the store and find yourself wandering aimlessly with the choker in your hand.  Everything that had been said was just so crazy but, it felt like it resonated with you through the jewel.  So you finally did what you wanted to do since you first saw it and put on the choker.  You felt a chill go down your spine as you then reached for the rainbow colored stone and touched it as you thought of the sin's power you wanted to try out.</span></div></div>",

Feeling awkward as the owner leans in to secure the choker, you feel his scrabblng finger, and the chill of the metal band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently satisfied the collar is secure, he steps back to admire it. But it just looks out of place around your neck. It's too refined, too elegant, too feminine to fit with your body or your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeh... No... Not really for me.\" you answer, your mouth getting dry, and voice cracking as you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't think I'll take this.\" your voice is now a high whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop owner shakes his head, which you take to mean he agrees. But he doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen's Sin, has accepted you, and your choice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs through your body, from the crown of your head to the tip of your toes. A dull sense of distance and disconnection following the wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand there, you find you can't move. Despite this, your clothes ripple and shift as if alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face blankly incapable of showing the horrified dread you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youth is enthusiasm and powerful.\" he shrugs, \"But it's also inexperience. That's the<i><b> Queen's Sin</b></i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emphasises it strangely, as if he's given you an explanation. But you can't even ask for more of an explanation. Only your eyes are under your control. Between one blinked look at the mirror and another, you see a woman replace you. Her clothes nothing more than a dress, split daring down the side. It's the same passionate, lusty red as the jewel at it's deepest shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/1049c81e6a51eca516b0fd2e24c37774/tumblr_opitk4Pxnr1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/1049c81e6a51...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her chest shift, in time with your breathing. You think momentarily of that gashed side of her dress. The teasing view of her firm full breasts. Even as you feel them shifting with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrate.\" the owner urges, a rare flash of passion colouring his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/f07f6b849c6b9a207c1b297643556d5c/tumblr_opitk4Pxnr1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/f07f6b849c6b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to reach out, cradle your suddenly shifted bust. The weight already pulling relentlessly at your shoulders. Your gaze darts back to her eyes, to your eyes, and the impotence there. In the mirror, the owner is shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youth, inexperience... Concentrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn errant thought, she's unbalanced. But before you can dismiss it, you feel another change building. You glower at the reflection, using your anger to drive you not to blink. Inevitably, you fail, and in the blink of an eye you feel your body shift once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/2dd288708d1db7b5f17bd2be8b51c735/tumblr_opitk4Pxnr1w2lwkto3_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/2dd288708d1d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been blessed with an arse to counterbalance your generous bust.

It's not because it's weird looking, or fancy, or anything like that, no, what catches your attention is how ordinary and out of place it seems in amongst the rest of the items. The item in question appears to be nothing more than an old notepad, apparently used, as it's a bit worn around the edges. Beyond that, there really doesn't seem to b anything special about it, certainly nothing that would justify the $29.95 price tag attached to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been guided to?\" A voice suddenly cuts in, causing you to jump slightly in surprise. You turn around to see a tall spindly figure looking down upon you. He was at least six foot six, his gaunt white skin and thin features making him seem nearly skeletal. The man wore his beard in a well maintained grey knot that was a foot in length, was dressed in glorious crimson robes with old patterns, and walked on a cane with a HUGE emerald on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi, I guess you must run this place?\" you ask hesitantly. The old man simply nods his head in acknowledgement. \"Yea, well, I was wondering, what's the deal with this notepad? I mean, there's nothing special about it as far as I can tell, and it's obviously been used, so why is it so expensive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let it's appearance fool you boy. That old note pad is one of the most powerful and reliable items in that case, possessing the power to grant the wishes of whoever possesses it.\" the old man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, wishes, right. Okay, well, I'll be leaving now.\" you said, intending to get the heck out of their before this snake oil salesman could get his hooks into you. However, what the old man says next catches your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so little faith in what cannot be seen. I fear for the younger generations. Very well, if you will not accept my word, perhaps a small demonstration is in order.\" the old man said, pulling out a large key and unlocking the cabinet, then pulling out the notepad and writing something in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nothing seems to have happened, you say snidely, \"Well, I'm waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then wait no longer.\" the old man says, handing you a small hand mirror. \"Look into the mirror boy, and tell me what you see.\" the wizard wannabe instructed. Deciding to humor him, you do just that. For the first second or so, you're confused, seeing only your normal self, but then you discover that something HAS changed, dramatically, and somehow without your ever noticing. \"What the heck? What did you do to my hair?! It's, it's green!\" you exclaimed, unable to believe what you're seeing for a moment, but it's true, your hair, formerly dark brown, almost black in color, was now a brilliant lime green, and apparently totally natural judging by the roots, which were every bit as green as the rest of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" the old man answers simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all it took was writing a few words in that old notepad? I mean, were they like magic words or...?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" the old man answered. \"The magic lies in the pages of the book, not within the words themselves, though they do serve as a guide for the power contained within, so be sure to choose your words carefully. Also, though the notepads powers are great, able to make a man rich beyond his wildest dreams, reshape minds and bodies of all those around you, and even bring forth magical abilities in those who have none, they are not without limits. It lacks the power to raise the dead, travel through time, or alter the very fabric of the world itself. You also may find that certain people, places or things may be resistant of immune to it's powers, either in whole or in part, usually due to the subjects own magical nature, though you will occasionally find certain individuals that despite possessing no magic whatsoever, the note pads magic simply will not work on.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and you're just going to hand something like that over to a kid you've never met before?! I mean, it's not that I object or anything, I'd love to have that kind of power, but I mean, how do you know I won't turn evil and try to take over the world, and even if I don't, what happens if I screw up?\" You questioned, eager to take possession of the notepad and the power it contained, but more than a little nervous about it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not happen. Though you will almost certainly abuse the items power to some degree, I can sense you have a good heart. And so long as you are careful not to lose it or become unable to use it for one reason or another, any wish made with the note pad can be undone by another wish carefully crafted for that very purpose. Now, if you've no more questions and still wish to purchase this item, I would suggest we conclude our business quickly, I do have other customers to attend to after all.\" the old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want to buy it!\" you exclaimed, grabbing a wad of cash from your wallet and slapping it down on the counter, not bothering to count it, as with the notepad, if it's capable of doing even half of what the old man suggested it could, you could become a millionaire if you wanted to with nothing more than a few strokes of a pen, before grabbing your purchase and rushing out of the store, eager to test out you're new wishing powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Arriving home and slipping inside, you're almost immediately greeted by one of your siblings, your sexy older sister Megan. An attractive red head with big bright green eyes, flawless pale skin, beautiful face, hourglass figure and full DD breasts, combined with her teasing nature and caring personality, growing up around this vision of female perfection had been rather difficult, not because the two of you didn't get along, but rather, because as sexy as she was, sister or not, you couldn't help lusting after her, something you'd had to go to great lengths to conceal from her and the rest of your family, though even with the effort you'd put into it, you weren't sure just how successful you'd been, as some of her teasing had been surprisingly close to the mark at times. Of course, Meagan was hardly your only problem in that regard, as your other siblings and step sibling, all five of them, were girls as well, all sexy, and all within a few years of you in age. It hardly seemed fair  that you were constantly surrounded by so much feminine beauty, and completely unable to do a single thing about it, due to the unfortunate fact that, every one of them was related to you! That, combined with being the only boy in a house full of girls, had combined to make your childhood, rather hard at times, in every possible sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess, you're back early. Did something happen at the mall?\" Meagan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you might say that. I bought something that i thought was pretty cool, and I was sort of eager to try it out, so if you'll excuse me...\" you said, attempting to edge your way past your sister and up the stairs to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can make it past her however, Megan asked curiously, \"Oh, what did you get? Another video game? Or maybe something else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're torn. On the one hand, you planned on keeping the note pad a secret, as if nobody knew about it and what it could do, you wouldn't have to worry about anyone attempting to steal it from you.

Though she's prevented by your wish from noticing she's naked, Megan does notice the way your string at her, and possibly the bulge forming in your pants as well, and asks nervously \"Um, bro, what's the deal? Why are you staring at me like that?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason.\" you reply offhandedly, tearing your eyes away form her naked breasts, attempting to focus on her face instead, but it's difficult, your gaze continually slipping downwards of it's own violation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay then.

On the one hand, you're eager for her to figure it out, so you can see her reaction if nothing else, but on the other hand you're also enjoying the sight of your sisters naked body, displayed in a way that you've never seen before now, or at least not nearly so well or so long, just a few quick glimpses of her in getting undressed or in the shower from time to time. You're also thinking it might be funny to see just how long you can keep her unaware of her nudity, and what peoples reaction will be should you mange to convince her to go outside. </span></div></div>",

Noting that there's no price tag, start to search around for anyone you can ask about it when the clearing of a throat coming from right behind you causes you to jump and spin around, coming face to face with an especially tall and lanky elderly gentleman wearing crimson robes with a mesmerizing pattern woven into the cloth, and leans heavily on a long black cane topped with an absurdly large green gem that you're certain can't possibly be real, as if it was, it would almost certainly be worth millions of dollars on today's market. The man's head is bald, covered with a number of elaborate and mystical looking tattoos. He also possesses a large crooked nose, and a long white beard. His most notable facial feature however was his eyes. Dark and mysterious, they hinted at hidden knowledge mortal minds were never meant to know, his gaze carrying a weight that only extreme age can bestow, making you believe that, as old as the man appears, his true age is likely far far older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by your reaction, the old man chuckles. \"Hasn't anyone ever taught you it's rude to stare boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" you stammer, with some difficulty tearing your gaze away from the old man's highly unusual appearance, somehow instinctively knowing that getting on this guys bad side would be a very bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving off your apology, the old man says \"Bah! No harm done. Now, did you need something, or did you just come in here to stare at an old man like he was some sort of spectacle?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been reminded of what you'd wanted in the first place, you turn back towards the display case, gesturing towards the elaborate wand you saw earlier. \"Yea, this old wand, how much is it? I couldn't find a price on it.\" you explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the direction you're pointing, the old man's voice takes on an almost reverent quality as he explains the history of the item that you've set your eyes on. <br>\r\n\"Ah, the wand of Circe! Quite the interesting history that wand has. Crafted and first wielded in ancient Greece by the goddess Circe, the wand possesses the power to transform it's victims into practically any form the wielder desires. Taken as a trophy by the hero Odysseus and passed down through his line for many generation before finally being lost. Since then the wand has served a number of masters, some good some evil, often changing the course of history, before eventually coming into my possession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little skeptical of the old mans story, ancient Greek goddesses and magical artifacts being difficult for anyone to swallow, you nonetheless replied \"Uh, that's great and all, but how much is it worth? I really think it would look great as part of my collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your disbelief, the old man frowns slightly. \"Ah, we have a skeptic in the room I see. Well young man, skeptic or no, I'm prepared to offer you this priceless artifact for.. say, a mere $43.37.\" the old man says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. While it was quite a bit cheaper than you'd expected, especially for a supposedly \"priceless\" artifact, the price the old man had just quoted you was still quite a bit, at least for a teenager such as yourself without a steady source of income, possibly more than you actually had on you at the moment. Still, you defiantly wanted the wand if you could afford it, even if it wasn't magic, and if by some chance the old man was actually telling the truth about that, something you found highly unlikely, well, you'd have to be a fool to turn him down. \"Uh, it sounds good, but I'm not quite sure I have that much money. Is there anyway you could maybe lower the price a little?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling mysteriously the old man replied \"Sorry, but all prices are final. However, I'm certain that if you just look you'll find that you have exactly the amount you need to purchase this item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you do as he asked, opening up your wallet and digging around in your pockets for any loose change you might have missed, coming up with the required forty three dollars and thirty seven cents exactly. While holding out the money, looking up at the old man, you ask \"How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching the money from you before you can change your mind the old man laughs. \"How did I know how much money you had in your pockets? It's simple really, I'm a wizard. Feldan's my name by the way, just in case you missed the sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to object, stating that wizards aren't real, and there's no way that this... Feldan could possibly be one, but, failing to come up with any other excuse as to how he could have possibly known the exact amount of money you were carrying, down to the exact penny, you decided to let the matter drop. shrugging you instead replied \"Okay, so your a wizard. can i have my purchase now?\" you requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a nonbeliever eh Jesse? Well, you'll soon learn better.\" The so called wizard said, stepping behind the counter and opening up the case before carefully handing you the wand, only to draw his hands back at the last moment. Gazing deeply into your eyes, a look of the utmost seriousness on his face, he tells you \"One last warning before you leave Jesse Rayburn. The wand of Circe is very powerful, but that power makes it difficult to control, especially for someone both undisciplined and untrained such as yourself. It was crafted by a goddess after all, and some small spark of her consciousness still resides within it. In order to control it properly you must not allow anything to distract you, concentrating fully on the task at hand so as to perfectly visualize both the intended target, as well as the desired form of the recipient in as much detail as possible. Otherwise, the wand may pervert your intent, transforming your target into a form far different that what you originally intended, often to the determent of either the recipient or yourself, so be very careful when using it. Also, keep in mind that a great many individuals would love to gain possession of such an item, many of them quite unscrupulous, so it would be in your best interests to be careful who you reveal the wand and it's power to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how the old man could have known your name, as you certainly hadn't told him, you decide nonetheless that it would be best to take his words to heart. Nodding slowly, you reply \"I think I understand. I'll be sure to exercise proper caution when using the wands power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" the old wizard says, handing you the wand before slapping you on the back, then placing one hand on your shoulder and escorting you to the door. \"Now, remember, if there are any problems with your purchase, you have one week to return it. After that time has passed however, all purchases are final, and if any problems do come up you're on your own.\" with that, the old man opens the front door of the shop, before practically shoving you out of the store and back out into the mall. Realizing the old man had never given you a receipt for the wand, you turn back around to ask for one, only to freeze, eyes bulging and moth open in shock, as you find that the old mans store has vanished, Only a blank wall remaining to mark it;s location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you're somewhat shaken by this, wondering how an entire shop can simply vanish into thin air like that, the wand in your hand looks and feels real enough, so you soon shake it off, deciding that you had better things to do right now, like testing out the abilities of the supposedly magical artifact you'd just acquired, starting off by___________________?</span></div></div>",

Even if this was just a curio shop you couldn't imagine anyone buying such a cheap novelty, even if they were buying it in an ironic sense.  \"I see you're looking at the lucky lepre-con pocket watch.  A fine item indeed for an introduction into magic.\"  A voice said behind you.<br>\r\nWithout turning you rolled your eyes and respond \"So that's what this shop is, huh?  Some kind of wizard themed novelty shop?  I was really just having a look around and I think I've seen enough.  Good day si-\" as you turn around you are forced to look up a fair ways to a six and a half foot man of skeletal build and pale complexion looking down upon you while holding the very watch you had just been looking at.  You swivel your head and indeed the watch was now missing from the display case, the old man having somehow snatched it without you even noticing.  \"Huh, that's an impressive sleight of hand trick you have there.  Anyways, off I go.\"  You dismissively state, trying to step past the man to exit this bizarre gimmick tavern.  You never were a huge fan of magic and didn't have an interest in playing games.<br>\r\n\"Hold on boy, the watch has chosen you.  It is your destiny to have it.\"  He explained, tossing you the watch.<br>\r\nSnagging it out of the air you set the watch back in its display case while sarcastically responding \"For only $19.95!\"  You look up though and to your shock the old man has the watch in his hand again.  Checking again the watch is missing from the display case.  How the hell did he do that?<br>\r\n\"Your first item is free, at least monetarily.\"  He said, placing the watch into your hand.<br>\r\nDeciding that just agreeing to what the old man said and hocking the stupid toy at your nearest convenience would get you out of the store quicker you say \"Okay, thanks then.  Bye!\"<br>\r\nYou are nearly at the door when the old man calls out \"Don't you want an explanation as to how it works?  It could be rather dangerous otherwise!\"<br>\r\nYou wave him off.  \"I'll test it in the field!\"  You call back in a dismissive manner.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I suppose you don't need to know that you aim it with the big hand and change the subjects luck with the little hand, six being average and twelve being highest.\"  He said, giving you a crash course in the device as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You flatly reply.  You look down at the watch and currently the little hand was at six, pointing back at you and the big hand was at seven.  What a stupid-<br>\r\nYour eyes were not really comprehending what they were seeing, the absurdity of the situation sinking in slowly like a knife.  You reached down with your right hand, watch in the left and lifted the small green note.  You stared at it for a while, Benjamin Franklin looking back at you with his smug old face.  \"Coincidence\" You say as you slide the bill into your pocket.  Doubts arose despite your best attempts to suppress them, eyes dragging back to the watch.  \"Still, might not hurt to test it a bit, just to confirm that it is just a stupid trinket.\"  You reason.</span></div></div>",

Anyway you had managed to make an enemy or two over the years despite generally being a mostly good guy.  One in particular stuck out for you, and that one was Suzan Devlins, your most recent ex.  The two of you had had a rather messy break up after it was discovered that she stole from you on multiple occasions to fund her purchasing habits (she was a very big spender and a kleptomaniac) and that she constantly invade your privacy by breaking into your social media accounts, reading your texts, and even eaves dropping on your phone calls.<br>\r\nThat's not to say that you were an angel.  You had not always been loyal, and while it's true that you only slept with one girl outside of your relationship you had done it about five times.  The first time just sort of happened; Suzan was out of town, you were horny and bored, and Diane just sort of fell into your lap in both a metaphorical and literal sense.  After that though it was a but less excusable and you were willing to admit it.  Also... you kind of sort of slapped her a little, though in fairness it was during the breakup itself and you lost control of yourself when she made a malicious and disingenuous remark about your manhood, a touchy thing for every man.  Anyway neither of you were on speaking terms at the moment for obvious reasons.<br>\r\nDeciding that if you were going to be petty towards anyone it would be her you made your way into the mall's food court.  She usually hung out there and you had no reason to suspect that she had changed up her habits.  Sure enough you eventually caught sight of her chatting with her friends over a communal plate of fries that she likely didn't contribute anything to pay for it.  She looked just like she did six months ago, namely rather attractive.  She had a nicely proportioned thin frame with a cute oval head plopped on it and long brown hair tied into a neat braid that she always slung over her left shoulder.  You may not be into her but you could not deny her beauty.  Opening up the watch you aim the big hand at Suzan.  \"Now then, let's give her a little misfortune.\"  You say to yourself, adjusting the little hand.  What do you set it to?</span></div></div>",

A good blow to knock her down a peg or two would do, and with that you turn the little hand back to five.  Now you waited, sitting down and ordering a small popcorn as you watched her from the opposite side of the court.  You watched for several minutes, beginning to grow anxious as nothing seemed to happen.  Time kept ticking as the girls kept chatting, blissfully unaware of your presence and at the presence of your supposedly fate altering device.  As you watched you began to have your doubts.  Maybe this was just a stupid toy, maybe it was  just coincidence that you found those one hundred bucks earlier, maybe... hang on.<br>\r\nYou squinted as hard as you could, leaning in to make sure that you were seeing properly.  Slowly dangling down from the plastic umbrella above Suzan's head was a spider, near microscopic from this distance but absolutely huge up close, it's leg span at least the width of your palm.  You watch as the spider made its slow descent, drawing closer and closer to the back of Suzan's neck until finally it touched down.<br>\r\nSuzan's eyes immediately shot open and dilated, her whole body freezing as she felt the arachnid skitter down her back, slipping under her shirt.  Suzan jumped to her feet and began screaming in abject horror, hands reaching behind her as she attempted to squish the unwanted interloper in a mad panic.  As she squirmed though she backed up and lost her footing, toppling over her own chair as she fell backwards.<br>\r\nYour own eyes bulged and popcorn caught in your throat as Suzan's bad luck continued.  As she fell her shirt got caught on the back of her chair, the force of her fall ripping it open and leaving her splayed out on her back topless, her unsupported ta-tas  now out in the open.  She didn't move at all for a short while, staring at the glass ceiling as she came to terms with what had just transpired.  Her hands went up and felt for her shirt, finding only the sensitive flesh of her chest meeting her soft fingers instead where it should have been.  Once it all sunk in she covered her chest with her arms and made a mad dash through the mall, crushed bug dripping down her smooth back as she wailed, several passerbys filming the bizarre half naked spectacle on their phones.  She was probably heading for the parking lot, trying to get to her car to grab some spare clothes or just to get away from the mall.</span></div></div>",

Plus it might feel nice to do a good deed.  You thought for a short while and made a deal with yourself.  For every time you gave someone bad luck you'd have to give someone good luck, just to keep yourself at least in the moral grey.  Now the only question was who to use it on.<br>\r\nYour mother was in kind of a rough spot.  She lost her job recently and hadn't been sleeping too well, stress likely eating away at her at all hours.  Your girlfriend was doing just fine but it might be nice to do something both of you could enjoy, and you're sure that she'd be more than happy to see this crazy store and get something for herself once you showed her that this actually worked.

Behind a thin pane of easily breakable glass was a loaded handgun, a rather old one by the looks of it but still a gun nonetheless.  It was a revolver of some description, highly polished nickel plating around a barrel just over seven inches leading into a six chambered cylinder mounted onto what looked like an ivory handle.  The bizarre nature of seeing something this dangerous protected so haphazardly was really-<br>\r\n\"Major Galloway's ghost gun.  Why am I not surprised that a teenager would be attracted to the gun?\"  You nearly leap straight out of your skin as a voice begins speaking behind you.  You turn to see a man who looked to be older than the sun dressed like he was an extra from Harry Potter, Towering over you at six and a half feet and with a spindly wire thin frame he seemed right at home in such a strange place.<br>\r\n\"What... huh?\"  You respond.<br>\r\n\"The item in the case.  It's the gun of the American Major Galloway, one of the most recent items in my shop.  I see you've taken an interest in it.\"  He replied, opening up the case and picking up the weapon.<br>\r\n\"I'm more interested in the lack of firearm safety.  You just left that thing out in the open for anyone to take.  Someone could seriously get hurt!\"  You respond.<br>\r\nThe old man laughs, casually spinning the weapon around on his finger by the trigger guard.  \"Hurt?  By this?  You make me laugh.  This little toy couldn't harm a fly!  Well, not on its own at least.\"  He cryptically responded.<br>\r\n\"How do you figure?\"  You inquire, taking a cautious step back from the seemingly senile old man twirling a pistol laughing like a loon.<br>\r\n\"Major Galloway had this gun blessed by native shaman on his journeys west, in exchange for sparring there land from the ensuing American land snatching.  The tribe got a reservation right where they were already situated and Galloway got a weapon that could turn his foes into ghosts.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's called a gun.  Guns turn people into ghosts.\"  You flatly stated.<br>\r\n\"Yes but you see this weapon... well, why not give you a demonstration?\"  With that he cocked the hammer back and blasted you right in the chest.<br>\r\nYou looked down, horror turning to confusion as you saw no blood, no bullet hole, but instead your body lying on the ground in a heap, another more opaque and translucent you (the one looking) standing over it.  The you on the ground looked like you had just gone brain dead, its eyes glazed over and its mouth agape.  \"You... you killed me!\"  You shouted, unable to believe what had just transpired.<br>\r\n\"No, you're very much alive.  Just not in your body at the moment.  Would you like to go back?\"  He asked.  Before you could respond he pulled the trigger again without cocking the hammer and with a bright flash of light you were on the floor, now back inside yourself.  Before you could say anything the old man explains.  \"This gun knocks the spirit right out of people, literally!  Spirits cannot move or touch anything except other spirits and magical items, so the major would shoot people and take there defenseless bodies back to his camp before pulling the trigger, which undoes everything the revolver has done, to interrogate them.\"<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\"  You say, getting to your feet.  \"So basically you can make anyone you want totally helpless?\"<br>\r\n\"Not only that!\"  The old man replies.  He turns the gun sideways and holds it out to you.  You notice that unlike a normal gun the hammer can be pulled back into several positions, each denoted by a notch on the side of the weapon.  \"Pull back to the first level and you can knock someones soul out and they can't do anything except talk and be seen if they so choose, though they can be completely invisible.  Pull back to the second level and they are are removed from there bodies as before, but now there bodies can move!  They are mindless drones that obey any command given to them by the whoever is wielding the pistol.  The last one, the third notch, is a bit tricky.  When you fire it at first nothing will appear to happen.  However once fired at a second person the two shall switch souls, and will remain so until they are swapped back with the gun or through other mystical means.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n\"That's actually really amazing!  So how much is it?\"  You ask, hoping to get the item for a deal.<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I'd say it's $185.  But for you... I'll tell you what, I'll let you have the gun for free, however I'm only going to give you one package of bullets, plus the five currently loaded into it.  After that I'm charging you double for every bullet.  five dollars a pop.\"  He bargained.<br>\r\n\"How much is in a package?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n\"Thirty shots.\"  He responds.  Wow, he must be really confident in his product if he thinks he can make his money back.  You quickly agree and the man hands you the gun and one box of ammunition.  As you are walking out of the store, gun tucked away in your backpack the old man calls out.  \"Wait, there is something of dire importance I must tell you!\"  He urgently shouts as you are exiting the store.  You turn back and with a smile now on his face he condescendingly informs you.  \"Don't get caught with your pants down!  Remember, you only have six shots in there, keep track of that!\"  You roll your eyes.</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure if all he said was true, but you know that if it was so strange that he refuses to sell it to you, you know that it has to be the game you play for family game night. \"Okay...\" you say dejectedly, hoping to trick the old man into believing you don't care anymore. You place the game back on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Now, if you have anymore questions about an of the objects in this store, or wish to buy something else, simply call out and I will come assist you.\" In a puff of smoke, the old man vanishes from view. You pretend to look at a couple of the other board games on the shelf, before quickly grabbing Oziphuge and making a run for the exit. As you get closer to the door, you hear a voice in your head say, \"I'm sorry that I could not dissuade you from your purchase, but be warned, there will be major repercussions for your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back at your house, just in time for your family's game night to begin. \"Well,\" says your Dad, \"You all ready to play Monopoly?\" Your two sisters and younger brother groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you interject, \"Look what I found at the mall.\" You pull out the game from behind your back. \"I thought we would have a better time playing this instead.

Being a typically horny teenage boy now you <b> have</b> to check it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step through the curtains, the small bells attached ringing, drawing the attention of the beautiful girl behind the clear glass counter. She's about your age or maybe a few years older with shoulder length hair black as night accented streaked with red and pink, large deep blue eyes, lightly tanned with a cute face, ruby red lips and lots of studs in her ears. She wears a choker, a black sleeveless mesh top that doesn't even attempt to conceal her perky C-cup breasts, making it abundantly clear she's not wearing a bra, a black and pink checkered microskirt, fishnet stockings, and stilleto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, welcome to Eva's Enchanted Erotica, my own special little corner of the emporium. I'm Eva. If you need anything, anything at all, let me know and I'll take care of you.\" The girl says, her seductive tone and sexual enuendo causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, sure, will do.\" You agreed, your mouth having suddenly gone dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo, see anything you like?\" The girl, Eva, continues, taking a deep breath and thrusting her nearly naked chest towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to avoid staring, you stammer incoherently, feeling an erection growing in your pants and desperately hoping she doesn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she giggles. \"Heh, just kidding! I just love messing with young guys like you. You're all so easy! Seriously though, what can I do you for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You ask, still confused about the situation, as well as a little disappointed that Eva doesn't really seem to be into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva sighs. \"What do you need?\" She asks slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, I don't really know. I've never been here before...\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's obvious.\" Eva interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, so, do you think maybe you could show me around?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrugs. \"Sure, that's what I'm here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! So you mentioned erotica. Does that mean you sell pornos and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. We're more about sex toys and aphrodisiacs here.\" Eva explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, no thanks then. I don't exactly have a lot of use for a dildo.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, cutie, not so fast! There's a lot more to sex toys than just dildos, especially the ones we sell. Like I said, this is Eva's <b> enchanted</b> erotica. We don't just sell sex toys, we sell <b> magic</b> sex toys! As well as aphrodisiacs that can make just about anyone horny as hell for you in no time at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. What kind of \"magic\" toys are we talking about?\" You asked skeptically, making air quotes with your fingers at the word magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All kinds! Dildos, pocket pussys, sex dolls, bondage gear, you name it we got it, not to mention all sorts of pills, lubes, oils and fragrances designed to enhance the sexual experience. But I can see you're still sceptical, so I'll give you a free sample of one of our products just to prove to you that their everything we claim them to be.\" Eva said, pulling a small vial of pink liquid off of a shelf under the counter and handing it to you. \"Here, drink this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe?\" You asked, a little leery of taking anything given to you by a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly safe. And just to prove I'm serious, once you've drank the vial if you can honestly say that you still don't believe our products are really magic I'll, well, I'll have sex with you right here in the store!\" Eva offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious?!\" You gasped. Receiving a nod you continue \"Well, with a deal like that how can I say no?!\" Quickly downing the contents of the vial. The liquid is thick and syrupy, a little sweet, with just a touch of cinnamon. \"Mmm, that's pretty good, but Hardy what I'd call magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait. It takes a minute or so to kick in.\" Eva states confidently, staring intently at you as though waiting for something spectacular to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what is it supposed to... Oh, my stomach feels weird! My skin's all tingly. I... Ahh! Oh! What's happening to me?!\" You cry, as you're assailed by an intense, indescribable feeling throughout your entire body, your voice becoming progressively higher with every word as your body begins to change, becoming shorter,  your skin softening, body and facial hair fading away as your eyelashes and the hair on your head grow longer, muscles shrinking and your shoulders and waist narrowing, chest hips and ass bulging outwards as your genitals are sucked up into your body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWh-what happened? Why is my voice so high? What are these things on my chest?\" You mumble in confusion, your mind slightly scrambled by your change, reaching down to touch the mounds in question, only to draw your hand back almost immediately. \"Oh! Their sensitive! But wait, why can I feel them? And why can't I...\" Then, it dawns on you. \"Oh my God, I'm a girl! You turned me into a fucking girl! How? Why? You drugged me right? You must have drugged me, this can't be real!\" You argued almost desperately as the entirety of the world view you'd grown up with was brought into question. After all, if something as crazy as magic can be real what else might you have been wrong about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's totally real. Feel free to examine yourself more thoroughly if you don't believe me yet, I certainly won't mind.\" Eva said giving your new body a leer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo panicky and confused to be embarrassed you do just that, sticking your hand down your pants and feeling around for your dick. It's gone! In its place you find a moist slit surrounded by fleshy folds. You really are a girl! \"T-this can be reversed right?\" You asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now that's the real question isn't it?\" Eva replied. \"The answer is ______________.\"</span></div></div>",

Which was true, yet somehow you couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed that you won't get a chance to explore your new female body. Not to mention <i>very</i> disappointed not to be having sex with Eva, as there's no way you couldn't honestly claim not to believe in her products now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm assuming you're convinced now?\" Eva inquired. Seeing you nod she continues \"Alright then, so, what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know. I don't know much about what you have available.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, I guess I'd better give you that tour I mentioned, give you a better idea of what we have to offer here. Well, come along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Eva through the alcove, which turns out to be much larger than you originally thought. You learn about colognes and perfumes capable of making anyone desire you. Concoctions capable of changing a person's gender, either in part or in whole, which you've already had a taste of. Creams to enlarge a man's cock or a woman's breasts or even cause them to grow extras, as well as a number of stranger and more perverted transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you sex toys of all kinds, reactivate self lubricating flesh lights, squirting dildos, incredibly lifelike strap-ons that the woman wearing them can actually feel, animated blowjob heads actually capable of carrying on a conversation, and even full sized living sex dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she tells you about the skin suits, which allow the wearer to take the form of the person who the suit is designed to look like. In addition to human suits there are a number of suits designed to resemble fantastic creatures, such as elves, fairies, demons, aliens and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least is the bondage gear, which comes in not just the usual forms, but also strange enchanted varieties, such as metal locking rings that, when slide over the limbs or head causes them to vanish into a pocket dimension, collars that allow the wearer to remove their own head, and other collars that enslave the wearer, causing them to obey every order given to them.

Instead of turning the victim to solid stone and killing them, anyone who presses their skin against the center of the rune and waits a few seconds will have their body transformed into living marble, as strong and as hard as your typical rock yet completely capable of natural movement.\"  The old man explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... makes no sense.\"  You said, unable to further articulate your confused disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's usually the case with magic, I'm afraid.\"  Feldan said, shrugging and raising his bony, upturned hands to shoulder level.  \"But I can assure you that that's how it works, and if you don't believe me, you're free to try it out for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the old man, looking for some hint of a smirk or a a giggle or anything to indicate that this was all some sort of overly elaborate practical joke and you were about to get punk'd.  He was stone faced, no pun intended, and for some reason a lump of doubt formed in your stomach as your attention turned to the painting.  Surely it had to be some sort of trick.  Surely!  Magic wasn't real, and if it were it wouldn't be available to buy in your local mall.  Surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand slowly, gingerly, tentatively reached for the painting, your entire body tensing as the tips of your fingers brushed against the parchment.  It was warmer than you'd expected, and the paint had more texture to it than you'd been expecting.  As you held your fingers against the gorgon's scowling visage, you felt something tingling inside you.  A few seconds passed, and you realized that the tingling sensation was not one of unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"  You screamed, recoiling from the painting and pulling your suddenly much heavier hand to your chest.  To your horror, you saw that your fingers had lost all color and were now an extremely polished and alarmingly reflective white.  Your palm drained of color next, your hand and then your whole arm getting heavier by the second and nearly pitching you sideways as your body's center of balance was thrown around wildly as the rune's magic spread through you.  Your knees buckled and dropped out beneath you as your chest's mass doubled, then tripled, then quadrupled.  Soon, you felt the magic crawling up your neck, your mouth opening in horror as the magic surged up the back of your throat and engulfed your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that you'd blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your arms and push yourself back onto your knees, your weight suddenly feeling significantly more manageable.  Standing, you could hardly feel the difference.  Looking, you could very obviously see the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  You said, turning your stony hand in front of your stony eyes.  \"I'm a rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  Your body has been transformed into a living stone golem possessed by your soul, exactly as I said.\"  Feldan said, his tone tinged with a hint of smugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were understandably amazed by the fact that your entire body was now a flexible block of marble dressed in a cotton t-shirt and jeans, and as such you didn't have time to register his rudeness.  You poked and prodded your new form, feeling everything exactly as your skin would yet sensing a definite shift in the consistency of your flesh.  While your body could bend just fine, pushing it with your finger proved that your skin had almost no give to it any more, your muscles rigidly remaining in place no matter how hard you pushed them, and you pushed hard enough that you started to worry about the structural integrity of your finger.  You didn't want to break something off that couldn't be put back on.  Actually, \"Hey, Mr Feldan, how do I reverse this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse this?  You've only just been changed!\"  He said, confused for the first time since you'd gotten here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... you know, for later.  How do I change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't.\"  Feldan said, rolling up the painting and tucking it into a cardboard tube while being very careful not to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  You asked, the floor shaking beneath your weight as you jumped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for 24 hours, anyway.  After that, the effects will wear off on their own.\"  He continued, handing you the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really could have led with that, you know.\"  You said, snatching the tube away from the smirking old man.  \"And why did you put this thing in a protective tube?  I thought you said it was indestructible to mortal attacks.\"  You continued.  \"And why are you giving it to me?  I haven't paid or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've led with that, yes.\"  He answered without answering.  \"And the tube is there more to conceal the painting than it is to protect it.  You wouldn't want to be drawing unnecessary attention to yourself.\"  He said with a complete deadpan, causing you to give a deep stone belly laugh.  \"As for payment, the first item chooses the customer, not the other way around, and as such the first item is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  You said shoving the tube into your suddenly ludicrously light backpack before slinging it back over your stone shoulders.  \"Well, see you later!\"  You said, this time meaning it.  You'd definitely had to come back here at some point, you didn't care if every other piece of merchandise cost a million dollars, it was MAGIC.  For today, however, you decided to have some fun with your free sample.  You decide to...</span></div></div>",

Pushing it aside, you find yourself standing in a long, dark room of the shop. The walls are lined to the ceiling with shelves and the shelves are stocked with hundreds of fluid-filled glass jars. <i>Preserved Oddities of the Old World,</i> says a sign. The jars are dusty and the liquid inside them is a murky green that obscures the contents, but peering closely at one you see within it a vaguely humanoid form, except it is barely more than two foot high and has two ragged wings emerging from its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the jars are far larger, though they all contain creatures (or parts of creatures) that you're sure no longer exist, and in many cases <i>never</i> existed. In one there floats a horse's head with a single horn jutting from its head. Another contains a pair of severed angelic wings. One of the biggest jars in the room contains the coiled form of a winged reptile. There are dozens of jars that merely contain eggs, though the details of the creatures they might contain are written in faded, spidery writing and in Latin no less.</span></div></div>",

A puppy with shaggy brown fur floats limply in the mucky liquid, its three heads lolling.

With a yelp of alarm, you leap back, slamming into the row of shelves behind you with a hard thud. The rickety old shelves wobble. The glass jars clatter and rattle, teeter on the bridge. You hold your breath, heart in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smash!</i> One of the jars tumbles and hits the floor, shattering open and spilling a soup of broken glass and thick green goop. A bird that looks like a dodo scrambles from the remains of the container. It flaps its tiny, gunk encrusted wings feebly, squawks, and bolts between your legs straight for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore jars follow, and you shield your head as they rain down around you and break open on the floor. Creatures you've never seen before are climbing from the shattered vessels. A lizard with the head of a chicken, a chicken with the head of a woman, a massive rat bristling with bony spines. You catch sight of a tall, naked, inhumanly beautiful figure dripping with goop before it barrels hard into you, its wet footfalls racing for the door. \"Did I just get floored by an elf,\" you wheeze. A laughing human skull burning with azure fire zooms through the air above you, before vanishing through a wall. You quail as a stallion with the upper body of a woman leaps over your body. A spider the size of a dog scuttles over your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the shattering of glass peters out. You hear the sound of running feet coming closer. A tall, thin figure in a dark robe tears back the curtain, surveying the broken, empty vessels in horror. There is a name tag pinned to his robe '<i>Hi, my name is Feldan</i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There had better be a very good explanation for this!\" you both exclaim at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly you pick yourself to your feet. Glass crunches beneath your feet. The shopkeeper has crouched down, raking through the shards. He shakes his head in disbelief. \"Foolish boy! Do you have any idea what you've done?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go with <i>no</i>,\" you reply angrily. \"What were those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priceless relics from a bygone age, each one the last of their kind. The world will never see their like again. And you released them...\" He points a shaking finger at you. \"You'll pay for this.\"</span></div></div>",

Brown hair and eyes, caucasian, five and a half feet tall, carrying a but extra in the thighs and belly but for good reason as you needed the added mass for sports, B cups, and with a round dimpled face that got compliments like \"cute\" and \"pretty\" as opposed to sexy and hot.  Your mind and personality were a bit \"different\" however.  You didn't like calling yourself a weirdo but you had some rather odd thoughts and fantasies at times.  You were straight, having dated only guys (well, guy.  You've been steady with your first boyfriend Travis for just under  a year now) and having never been romantically attracted to any women, but you always felt more sexually attracted to the female body and its softer more curvaceous form.  Personality wise you were a bit bossier and commanding than most and really liked to take charge of any given situation, which is part of the reason (along with other more pervy reasons) why you became captain of the girl's wrestling team at your high school.<br>\r\nYou're not sure why you entered this strange little store.  Well, you knew why; you and Travis were about to celebrate your 1 year anniversary tomorrow and you wanted to get him a gift.  What you mean is that you're not sure why you entered THIS store.  Neither of you were all that into fantasy stuff and by the looks of it this place just sold tacky magic themed novelties, but for some reason you felt compelled to enter, as though you were fated to do so.  Rather than wander aimlessly through the dingy little establishment you decided to confront the man behind the counter, a tall decrepit old fellow who dressed as though he was about to go off larping.  \"Uh, excuse me?  I know this is going to sound like a weird question but I-\"<br>\r\n\"Wait wait, don't tell me!  Let me think...\"  The old man interjected, closing his eyes momentarily before hesitantly responding \"You're here to get a gift for your boyfriend.  It's for an anniversary.\"<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raised \"Uh, yeah.  How did you guess that?\"<br>\r\n\"Magic!\"  The old man said in a tone perfectly straddling the line between sarcasm and genuine answer.<br>\r\n\"Riiight.  Anyway do you have anything that he might like?  He's not really into all of this magic stuff but seeing as how this is a brand new shop I thought I might as well check here.\"  You explain.  In all honesty you had already gotten him a gift, a statuette of some dorky Japanese cartoon character that he was obsessed with the base signed by the creator of the show, but unfortunately the package got delayed on its voyage overseas and wouldn't be arriving for another week so you needed something quick to tide him over before his actual gift arrived.<br>\r\n\"I've got something better, something that both of you will enjoy!\"  He announces reaching under the counter as though he already knew what he was going to give you.  \"And the best part is that everyone's first purchase is free!\"  He added before withdrawing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside of a rather plain looking fleece lined box resided six rings, simple wooden things polished to a reflective shine and laid out in neat rows of three.  \"Travis isn't really into rings, he tends to fidget with them.  Plus I'm not big into hand accessories either so I'm going to have to say swing and a miss buddy.\"  You reply in a somewhat disappointed fashion.<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I'm sure the two of you and perhaps a couple of your friends will enjoy these rings.  You see these rings are magic, they are the rings.  They are the exhibitionist's rings!\"  He explained.  Noticing that you had taken the liberty of taking your phone out and dialing 9-1-1 with your index finger hovering above the call button as a precaution the old man decided to elaborate.  \"You see while wearing the rings anything you do will look completely mundane and natural and will arouse no suspicion or even a batted eye.  The only people who will notice the oddness of your behavior, and thus will be in on the joke, will be other people wearing the rings.  You can get away with anything short of murder, which will be noticed despite the magic, all in broad daylight.\"<br>\r\nYou just stare at him, contemplating what he just said.  \"You know, maybe I was wrong to dial 911.  I probably should've dialed a mental ward, because you're clearly off of your meds!\"<br>\r\n\"Would you care for a small demonstration then?\"  He asked, stroking his long beard in thought.  You shrug, more so just to see what the hell he would try as opposed to any genuine doubt that he actually had magic rings.  \"I've got just the thing!  Now, when I tell you to put on the ring, put it on.  When I ask you to take it off, take it off.  Got it?\"  He asked.  You nod, crossing your arms as you awaited his magic trick.  The man selected the top right ring from the box and in a very grandiose fashion slipped the ring onto his finger left ring finger.  He then casually picked up a fancy silver lighter from the table and lit his own beard on fire.  \"Look, I'm black beard!\"  He joked, the end of his facial hair charring with heat.<br>\r\n\"You know I'm pretty sure that would've been impressive for a caveman or something but I can grasp the concept of fire.  What's the point of this?\"  You inquire sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Put the ring on and you'll find out!\"  He instructed.  You sigh and pick up the bottom right ring for symmetry's sake and put it on your HOLY SHIT THIS INSANE OLD COOT JUST LIT HIS OWN FUCKING BEARD ON FIRE!<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"  You shout, backing away from the crazy senior citizen \"What the hell?!  What are you doing?\"  You demand.<br>\r\n\"Take the ring off and you'll see!\"  He commanded.  You did as you were asked and just like before this dumb geezer was trying to convince you that because he knew how to use a lighter he was suddenly magic...  wait... something didn't feel quite right, wasn't this a lot bigger news a second ago?<br>\r\n\"Wait... this ring...\"  You say, putting the pieces together.  You slip the ring back on and jump back as you catch sight of the fire.  \"Oh my god this thing really is magic!\"  You cheer.<br>\r\n\"Indeed!\"  He laughs, picking up a dampened cloth and snuffing out the ember of his beard, having been reduced from a waist length thing to ending just past the base of his neck.  \"Now then you run along and have fun, I have some lotions I need to apply!\"  He remarked, removing his own ring and setting it back in the box.<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks!  I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun with these!\"  You say, placing the box into your back pack and running out the door.  As you run you stop outside, noticing that your ring was still on.</span></div></div>",

You'd shouted some curses at sweet little old ladies and blasted music on the bus without headphones just to make sure the rings worked and sure enough no one even batted an eye or asked you to be more civil.  They just kept on going as though you were acting completely normally and rationally.  Still, you hadn't done anything crazy with the rings just yet.  As you stood in the shower though, staring at the little wooden wonder, that changed.  You smiled, a sudden urge to act out of the ordinary surfacing.<br>\r\nYou'd always liked being in the nude.  Half because it just felt nice and half because, while not a huge narcissist or anything, you like the female form more than the male one and you weren't an exception to that.  Normally you were only able to go au naturale when you were home alone or with Travis, but now that you had the ring?  Naked time!  Not even bothering to dry yourself off you exited the bathroom and walked down stairs, your mother sitting on the couch reading a magazine while your sister Leslie texted a friend.  Your father, being the main breadwinner, was still at work and probably wouldn't get home until well beyond midnight.  \"Hey Jesse, what's up?\"  Leslie asked nonchalantly, still typing away on her phone like nothing was amiss.  You walk up to her and grab the phone out of her hand, not even causing Leslie to flinch.  \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\"  You say, quitting out of her text conversation and loading up some hardcore porn on her phone.  \"Hey Leslie, you wouldn't mind if I borrowed some of your clothes would you?\"<br>\r\nShe laughed.  \"Not at all!  Though, I doubt any will fit you!\"<br>\r\nYou proceed to strip Leslie down to her bare ass, tossing her clothes out the window casually.  You weren't normally this much of a pervert (... normally...) but having this magic ring on was just so... liberating!  \"Hey mom, would you care to join us?\"  You ask her, curious to see its effect.<br>\r\n\"When in Rome I suppose!\"  She says before beginning to take her top off.<br>\r\n\"JESUS MOM, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!\"  Leslie shouts in disgust, catching both you and your mother Rita  off guard.  It takes you a moment to piece together what happened, but you do figure it out.  The rings stop people from doing anything YOU do from being seen as weird, or anything that involves you doing something to another person like Leslie.  However since you didn't actually strip Rita and instead simply asked her to do something which she then did on her own will it was seen as out of the ordinary.  You'd have to remember that to avoid issues, you had to directly interact with things or have things result from your interference to be considered normal, if you indirectly act or if someone does actions not as an immediate result of you interfering it was not seen as normal.<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get that for you!\"  You say, stripping Rita yourself.  She was quite good looking for a woman her age you had to admit, and judging by the sounds that came from her and Karl's bedroom you knew he agreed.  \"Better sis?\"  You ask.<br>\r\nLeslie nods.  \"Yeah, thanks Jesse!\"<br>\r\n\"Now then, would you tell me where your dildos are?\"  You ask the two of them, your perverted little circus act now back on the rails.  They both tell you without hesitation and, after collecting both of theirs and your own and turning the videos you'd loaded up on Leslie's phone on at full blast you...</span></div></div>",

Luckily the time was nearly upon you and you had a great plan!  You waited near the door, your parents still at work and your sister Leslie was at a friend's house working on a school project and would be there for the night.  You had wrapped your present in some simple silver wrapping paper with pictures of balloons on them (it was all you had in the house) and were in the middle of watching some dumb show about celebrity siblings or something when you heard a familiar knock trio on the door that signaled the arrival of Travis.  You sauntered up to the door making sure that the ring was securely fastened to your right hand before opening the door.<br>\r\n\"Sup baby?  How's my little tub of love?\"  He asked, leaning down and kissing you on the forehead teasingly as though you were a child.  He was over eight inches taller than you and three years your senior as a college freshman to your high school junior and enjoyed pointing it out.<br>\r\n\"Good, how's my favorite twig doing?\"  You joked in regards to Travis's lanky composition.  You punched his arm lightly enough to not bruise but hard enough to hurt like hell and laughed as he gripped the spot and laughed along, the two of you enjoying your back and forth teasing.<br>\r\n\"Anyway you ready to head out?\"  He asked, pointing with his right hand while he cradled his gift to you under his left.<br>\r\n\"All set, let's ride!\"  You say, taking his hand as the two of you strode out towards his clunker.  You had to stifle laughter rather hard as Travis, not wearing a ring, didn't even notice your unorthodox style of dress.  A simple orange T-shirt hung off of your chest cut low to end just above your navel, a small brown purse hung off of your left shoulder, and flip flops clapped on the ground as it was still rather hot out and the weather was unlikely to change.  The odd part was that you had nothing covering your lower half, your legs groin and ass on 100% full display to the world and he didn't even flinch, taking you along as though it was perfectly acceptable.<br>\r\nTravis started up his car and began driving off, turning on the radio as the knucklehead couldn't drive and talk at the same time.  Or rather he couldn't do anything else while driving as he couldn't multitask worth a damn.  He was sort of a big klutzy dork and was totally the girl in your relationship, his easygoing and laid back demeanor basically allowing you to walk all over him if you had the inclination, but in truth he had his charms that kept you wooed and you didn't (usually) abuse your powers.  He was always genuine and spoke the truth, he had a lot of hidden talents, was great with his hands from years of fiddling with his electronics and his guitar, and... well, he knew what you liked when you were in the mood.<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here!\"  He said, scratching his short black hair for a solid fifteen seconds before stepping out.

Well I certainly didn't see it coming.  Thanks!\"  He says.<br>\r\n\"You should try one on.\"  You offer, giggling as you awaited Travis's reaction.  He took the top middle ring and without much fanfare slipped it on.<br>\r\n\"JESUS WHAT IN FUCK'S NAME ARE YOU DOING OUT IN PUBLIC WITH NO PANTS ON?!\"  He hissed, leaning over to look in your eyes as though you'd gone insane.<br>\r\n\"Relax, take a look around.  Notice how no one even cares?\"  You point out, motioning at the room of disinterested restaurant patrons.<br>\r\nTravis took a visual sweep of the room before replying.  \"Huh, no ones freaking out at a bottomless girl in public.  What's up with that?\"<br>\r\n\"It's the rings, they're magic!\"  You explain, pointing at the matching jewelry on your hands.  \"Basically anything we do will look mundane or typical to everyone!\"<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, anything?\"  He confirmed.<br>\r\n\"Well, everything except murder.  But I don't think you would be into that anyway.\"  You jokingly reply.<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised, I'm quite the killer at heart.\"  He joked.  \"Anyway though this is an awesome gift, and I know just what I want to do with it first!\"  He announced.<br>\r\n\"Is it something pervy?\"  You ask hopefully.<br>\r\n\"You know it bitch!\"  He responded with a snap of his fingers.

Placing his hands on your thighs and pulling them apart, exposing your pussy, Travis dives right in, licking and sucking away at your most sensitive parts, quickly working you into an orgasmic frenzy as his talented tongue plays over your clit before diving deep into your dripping womanhood. Knowing that no one will care what the two of you are doing, you don't even try to suppress your moans, instead giving into your lust, the sounds of your arousal causing your boyfriend to redouble his efforts, and before long, you cum, your fingers tangling in Travis's hair as your legs clamp down on his head as though trying to prevent his escape. Travis for his part though has no intention of escaping, instead continuing to tease you, not stopping until, several orgasms latter, your body has been reduced to a quivering, heaving, sweat soaked mass of flesh basking in the afterglow of your multiple orgasms. After taking a moment to catch your breath, as well as marvel that no one in the restaurant is paying the least bit of attention to the two of you in spite of what you just did, you exclaim \"T-that... was... <b>AWESOME!</b> Some of the best muff licking I've ever received.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'm just talented like that.\" Travis replied without the slightest trace of modesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but don't get a swelled head about it, not if you want me to return the favor.\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you mean?!\" Travis exclaimed happily, if somewhat incredulously, as giving him a blowjob wasn't really something you were into, but then, it was your anniversary, and he'd more than earned it with the way he'd just pleasured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your nod, Travis quickly replies \"Okay, my lips are sealed!\" while miming a zipper, causing you to laugh before sliding under the table yourself, unzipping your boyfriends pants, allowing his dick to spring out. You can't help but stare at it for a moment, fascinated, as while in general you preferred the ascetics of a woman's body to that of a man, there was just something about the male penis that sent a little thrill through you every time you saw one, and your boyfriends cock was no different. You give  Travis's member an experimental lick. Hmm, not too bad. At least he remembered to clean it today. Satisfied with the flavor, if not exactly enjoying it, you swirl your tongue over your boyfriends shaft, paying special attention to the sensitive area just below and behind the head of it, before sticking it into your mouth and sucking it like a little girl with a lollypop, moving it in and out between your lips, causing Travis to groan, his fingers tangled in your hair as he urges you onward. \"Oh shit babe! That's fucking incredible! he gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the compliment, you smile around his shaft, your eyes twinkling with mirth at just how easy it was to get a guy off. After all, you'd only just started! Forcing more of Travis's dick into your mouth, aided by the forceful grip he has on the back of your skull, you begin a sustained bobbing motion, your boyfriend cock pistoning in and out of your mouth as you continue to tease it with your tongue, working the entire thing for all that you're worth, and before long you feel your boyfriend tensing up, getting ready to cum, and you realize you have a decision to make. You can either swallow his load, something you're not entirely thrilled about as you don't really care for the taste, finding his sperm far too salty for your liking, although Travis seems to enjoy seeing you do it, or, you can force him to pull out, blowing his load all over you, the carpet, and anyone else who happens to be close enough. In fact, you could even aim it, ensuring that one or more of the other diners will get drenched, just to see their reaction, or rather, their lack of one.</span></div></div>",

My skirt! It's ruined!\" she complains. At first, you think she's about to take it out on the two of you, but despite her distress over the state of her clothing, she still fails to react to the fact that the two of you are responsible. Still, you feel that you should help her. In your own special way of course! Climbing out from under the table and standing up, you walk over. She's actually pretty hot your realize, mid twenties if you were to guess, probably some sort of corporate lawyer or business woman out to lunch judging by her clothing, with curly blonde hair down to her shoulders, long gorgeous legs encased in a tight pair of nude colored stockings, and a pair of generous breasts, D cups at the very least, the slight amount of cleave revealed by her outfit carefully calculated to entice without making her seem like a bimbo. Apologetically, you say \"Oh, I'm so sorry! I guess my boyfriend and I just got a little overly excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the woman replied \"It's alright. these things happen.\" As though having her clothing splattered by the cum of a complete stranger in the middle of a public restaurant were no more serious or noteworthy than someone spilling a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Still feel bad about it though. There must be something I can do.\" you said, giving the woman's stained outfit a thoughtful look, though inside you were laughing, already knowing exactly what you planned to do. Travis, meanwhile studies the situation with interest, curious as to what you had planned. \"Oh, I know! Here, let me clean it for you!\" you said, whipping your cum soaked shirt off and pretending to try and wipe the cum off of the woman's dress, though in truth you were only spreading it, intentionally making it worse as a set up for what you were planning next as Travis began chuckling in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the shirt and placing your hands flat against your cheeks, eyes and mouth open wide in horror as though you had just realized what you had done, you exclaimed. \"Oh, this simply won't do, I'm only making it worse!\" your boyfriends chuckles becoming a strangled gasp as you continue, \"Well, I suppose we'll just have to get rid of it. Wouldn't want you running about in a stained skirt would we? Of course, the top will have to go too. Wouldn't look too professional otherwise.\", before quickly doing just that, the business woman making no attempt to stop you as you strip her of her skirt, snagging her other clothing in the process, right down to her underwear, leaving her clad in nothing more her stockings, garter belt, and high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really needn't go to so much trouble. It was just an accident after all.\" the woman insisted once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, but I feel bad about it anyway.\" you said, before flagging down a waiter and handing him the bundle of clothing, complete with your shirt. \"Here. Takes these out back and dump them in the trash would you?\" you requested. As the waiter nods and goes to do as you've instructed, you turn back to your female victim. Holding your hand out as though to shake, you inform her \"I'm Jesse by the way. And you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matilda.\" the now nude woman replies, taking your hand and shaking it as you, and presumably Travis are busy looking her over. You were actually wrong about her breast size, her boobs are closer to a double D than a regular D, and the neat triangle of soft blonde pubic hair proves that her hair color is natural and not from a bottle as you'd first suspected. You decide in that moment that this particular catch is too attractive to be allowed to get away just yet.</span></div></div>",

What the heck am I suppose to do, knit him a sweater?\" you asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could indeed do that.\" the shopkeeper replied, and an exceptional garment it would be. \"However, such a thing is not the true purpose of this thread. You see, this thread is magic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rriigghhtt.\" you drawled, more than a little skeptical of the old mans claim. \"And just what exactly is this magic thread of yours suppose to do?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yet another nonbeliever, what is this world coming too?\" the old man sighted. \"Very well, I'll most likely have a difficult time convincing you of this with words alone, but this thread, when sewn into the fabric of any ordinary garment, will cause it to perfectly fit whoever attempts to wear it perfectly, regardless of said individuals normal physical characteristics, such as size, weight, and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it re-sizes clothes, big deal. Even if you're telling the truth, what the heck does that have to do with my boyfriend? He's not exactly Mr.fashion if you get my drift.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but that's just it.\" the old man explained. \"The clothing enhanced with this thread doesn't alter itself to fit the wearer. In stead, it alters the person wearing it to fit the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! That's impossible!\" you said, not believing a word of it, even though you'd like to, as the ability to reshape your body just by changing your clothes seemed like it would present all sorts of interesting possibilities for both you and your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you survive as long as I have young lady, you will eventually realize that nothing is truly impossible, it is simply that some things are far more difficult that others.\" the shopkeeper replied. \"However,\" he continued, \"I know that you'll not be convinced by words alone, so, I'm prepared to offer you a little demonstration of what this thread can do and allow you to see for yourself that every word I have spoken is absolute truth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And just how do you plan on doing that?\" you asked, still skeptical, but growing less so by the moment, said skepticism being replaced by intrigue instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, try this on.\" the old man said, handing you light weight jacket that was obviously at least two sizes too small for you, having been made for a girl far more slender than yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'll never be able to fit into that!\" you said, though you accepted the garment anyway, just on the off chance the old man might actually be telling the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally no, but if you check the lining, you'll see that a bit of magic thread has been added, which should make fitting into this particular item quite easy.\" the shopkeeper explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what have I got to lose? you did say the first item was free after all.\" you said with a shrug, taking the jacket and slipping it over your shoulders and attempting to zip it up. You had of course expected the zipper to be difficult, if not downright impossible for you to manage, but much to your surprise it slides up easily, no pinching, straining, or anything, just a slight tingle that you almost fail to notice, and probably would have if you hadn't been half expecting something to happen. At first you assumed that the coat had simply stretched somehow, but a closer examination revealed that that didn't seem to be the case, as your stomach seemed to have shrunk quite a bit from what you were used to. Quickly you remove the jacket, expecting the whole thing to be some sort of optical illusion, but no, even once the jacket had been removed, the changes still persisted, something you made absolutely sure of by raising your shirt up high enough to expose your stomach and feeling for yourself, revealing that, somehow over the course of the last minute or so, you had easily lost at least ten pounds in the arms, shoulders, and stomach, though your body below the waist appears unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, you were serious! This stuff really is magic!\" you exclaimed, looking over the the golden thread on the counter with new found respect. Then another thought occurs to you. \"Uh, this can be reversed right? I mean, I don't really mind being slimmer right now, but I kind of need the extra weight and muscle for wrestling, so....?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course.\" the old man replied. \"All you have to do is add a bit of thread to one of your old shirts or jackets and you should be back to your normal self in no time.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good, that's a relief! Anyway, thanks for the thread old man, I'll be sure to tell all my friends about this place!\" you said, picking up the thread and slipping it inside your pocket, waving goodbye to the store keeper and walking out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're back out in the mall proper, you think to yourself \"<i>hmm, if I'm going to experiment with this stuff properly, I'll probably need a new wardrobe.</i>\" Unfortunately, a quick check of your pockets reveals that such an endeavor isn't in the cards today, at least not here, as the price of women's clothing these days is astronomical, making buying everything you want out of the question. You'll probably have to stick with a few strategic items for now and get the rest later if you plan on getting everything new. Of course, there's always the local thrift store. The quality and selection certainly isn't as good, and you probably won't be able to find anything all that stylish, but on the plus side, the prices are a lot cheaper, allowing you to get a lot more outfits to experiment with for the same amount of money. There is also option available to you, as your friend Amelia's mother is a seamstress who works from home, and always has lots of different clothes around that she's working on for one client or another. That actually seems like the easiest way to get access to the variety of clothing you need, but if Amelia's mom were to find out that the two of you are messing around with her customers stuff, well, it could be bad for the both of you. Hmm, decisions decisions....</span></div></div>",

You're Caucasian, stand roughly six feet tall, with short cut dark brown hair, steel grey eyes, a somewhat athletic build, and a serious, slightly fierce looking face that's somewhat at odds with your personality, as your fairly easy going for the most part, though when you do get angry, people better watch out! You're also a big fan of magic and transformation in all it's many forms, though you don't actually believe in it. You're also a bit of a sexual deviant, though you manage to keep most of your fetishes well hidden. Having the day off for the day and already having completed the days classes, you're currently bumping around the local mall while you wait for your girlfriend to call you back confirming your date tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing this, you see a shop that you've never seen before, a quaint little shop that seems totally out of place here, looking more like a shop out of a Harry Potter movie than the sort of generic, and/or ultra modern facade most of the other stores in the mall portray, the sign above the door reading <i>Feldan's Magic Emporium. Grand opening sale today! First ten customers receive a free purchase!</i>. Deciding it looks interesting, certainly more so than the other stores in the mall at least, you step inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the store is every bit as odd as the outside, filled with bric a brac of every description, from statues and jewelry, to power tools and video games, and everything in between, most of it covered in a fine layer of dust as though it had been sitting the shelves for a long time, something you find more than a little strange as the store has just opened. All of the merchandise should be neat and clean. Another oddity, as though you needed another one, was that, despite the grand opening sign above the door, as well as the promotion, the store appeared to be empty, without even any of the stores employees in sight. Perhaps they hadn't actually opened yet and were doing some last minute work for tomorrow or something? It seemed unlikely, but what other explanation was there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the weirdness of the whole hing though, almost like the kinds of strange and mysterious shops run by witches and wizards in the types of online stories you like to read, you've always been the curious type, so rather than backing out, you press forward, carefully looking over the merchandise as you search for something that sparks your interest. Walking past ancient looking weapons and jars containing picked body parts, old furniture and technology that doesn't look like anything ever made on earth, journeying deeper and deeper, you quickly realize that there's no way this could possibly be any normal shop, not only due to the unbelievable merchandise, but also due to that fact that, given the malls floor plan, you should have run into the back wall of the store a long time ago, though given the way the shelves are arranged seemingly at random, forming a maze of sorts, you <i>could</i> be mistaken. Eventually though, among all the clutter, and weirdness, you find something that catches your eye.</span></div></div>",

Remembering how much you loved that old chemistry set, you feel the urge to buy this one, your parents having taken the old one away from you after an incident involving a series of stink bombs during junior high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the box containing the kit, you look around for somebody you could ask about the price, as the item's not labeled, though, being the only customer in the store so far as you can see, you're hoping to receive one of the free promotional purchases. Not seeing anyone in your immediate vicinity, you call out \"Hello? Is there anyone in here who can help me?\" A mere two seconds latter, the feeling of a hand clutching your shoulder causes you to jump, almost dropping the chemistry set and forcing you to fumble with it for a moment to avoid having it smash against the floor. Once you have your package secure you look back over your shoulder into the face of an old man with a bald head tattooed with strange symbols and a long white beard. His eyes look even older than the rest of him, having a sort of timeless quality that you can't quite place. He's also very tall, taller than you by at least a good six inches, dressed in crimson robes with a mesmerizing pattern, and carrying  a long black cane, topped with an absurdly large green gemstone which simply has to be fake, as a rock that size would be literally priceless if it should happen to be real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you the owner by any chance?\" you asked nervously, the old mans sudden appearance and strange clothing throwing you off more than a little, as both practically scream wizard, but of course that can't be, as there aren't any real wizards right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I am young man. Feldan is my name, just like it says on the sign. I see that you have found an Alchemy kit to your liking, and are likely wondering how much to purchase it?\" the old man stated more than inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but, don't you mean chemistry?\" you corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nay boy! I meant what I said and I said what I meant! What you hold in your hands a set of tools, elixirs and formulas dedicated to the practice of alchemy, a powerful discipline harnessing both science and sorcery to create marvelous potions and concoctions capable of all manner of wondrous feats, and should you desire to purchase it, you are most fortunate, as thanks to our special promotional deal and being one of our first ten customers, this wondrous item can be yours for a little bit of nothing!\" the shopkeeper said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile quite happy at being one of the customers to receive the stores special promotion, you can't help but stare at the man somewhat incredulously at the mention of magic, though, given what you've seen in this store already, you're not nearly so quick to dismiss his claims as you would normally be. Besides which, if it's really free, even if it turns out to be nothing but a box of useless junk you haven't really lost anything. Still, you can't help but ask. \"Wait, sorcery? You mean stage magic, like card tricks and pulling a rabbit out of your hat, or....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, young mister Rayburn, I refer not to such charlatans trick, but to the ancient and powerful discipline of true sorcery as practiced by the ancients, an art all but lost to the modern world.\" the old man answers, seeming somewhat irritated at the mention of such \"charlatans tricks\" as he calls them. Then it hits you. You'd never introduced yourself, and you'd certainly never met this man before. With his colorful appearance you'd certainly remember, so how could he possibly know your name?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you.....?\" you begin to inquire, only to be interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I know your name you ask?\" Haven't your figured it out by now my boy? It's quite simple really. I'm a wizard, a true one, and I know a great many things beyond the knowledge of lesser men, your name being but one of them. Now, if you still require further proof of my claims, then you merely need accept this gift and try it out for yourself. I'm sure you'll be most impressed with the results.\" the self proclaimed wizard said, gesturing casually towards chemistry, er, alchemy kit still cradled in your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not prepared to argue the old mans claims, nor did you really want to, hoping instead that he was indeed telling the truth and the kit really was magic. Nodding your agreement, you said. \"Alright, you've convinced me, I'll take the kit. Now, uh, could you show me the way out of here? I've kind of gotten a little lost wandering around in all these shelves.\" you said somewhat sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course.\" the old wizard said, chanting a few arcane words and making a couple of gestures, the world fading out of view around you for a moment before you suddenly find yourself standing once more in the mall proper just outside of where you had entered the shop, your purchase still clutched to your chest. You turn around, intending to both thank the shop keeper as well as asking him how the heck did he do that, but in place of the store front you're expecting, there's only a short space of blank wall between two other shops, the magic emporium and it's sign nowhere to be seen! The old guy was telling the truth! Suddenly far more excited than before, you hurry back to your apartment, eager to begin brewing wondrous potions to test on yourself and others. Arriving at your apartment a short while latter, you find that______________________?</span></div></div>",

Their also both naked as the day they were born, though jacks nudity is of no real interest to you. Kayla's on the other hand... You have to admit, Jack sure knows how to pick em. Of Polynesian decent, with deeply tanned skin, long dark hair and big brown eyes set within a face every bit as beautiful as the islands from which her ancestors hail, with a magnificent set of e cup breasts, narrow waist and full sexy ass, without the slightest trace of tan lines anywhere, your roommates girlfriend is a definite hottie. Frozen in place at the sight of aforementioned ass with it's magnificent rounded cheeks and the tight wet pussy, just barely visible beneath and between them, you, completely fail to note Jacks casual greeting, not responding to either of them until Kayla pauses sucking on her boyfriends rod for a moment, turning her head and happily greets you. \"Hi Jesse! could you please shut the door? I don't really mind an audience, but some of the neighbors might start to complain.\" she said, giving you a cheeky smile, her voice laced with warmth and affection even as she reprimands you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat nervous and embarrassed as well as highly turned on, you can only stammer \"Uh, yea, s-sorry!\" before stepping inside and closing the door behind you. \"E-excuse me!\" you said, edging around the couple and practically sprinting to your room, causing Kayla to laugh. Slamming the door behind you, you slide down against it, releasing a heavy sigh. Why did those two have to be such screwballs? Doing it in the living room of all places! Of course it wasn't the first time you'd caught them doing it. Not even the first time you'd caught them in the living room, but that didn't make it any easier to deal with, especially Kayla's teasing. A bit of an exhibitionist, Jack's girlfriend had never been shy about showing off her body, and it always had the same effect on you, leaving you highly embarrassed and exceptionally horny. Of course it wasn't as though you didn't have your own girlfriend and hadn't gotten into your own sexual shenanigans, but those two simply had no sense of shame whatsoever! Now you were left with a large, almost painful erection and no means of dealing with it! Well, there was always your hand of course, but you were reluctant to use that method. If only your date with Stacy wasn't so far away! But wait! You had another roommate, an attractive female one who, if she was home was probably suffering from the same sort of sexual frustration as you, though for a different reason. Hmm, maybe you and Janice could help each other? But no, she'd never go for it. Unless....? Turning your attention to the potion making kit the wizard gave you, you can't help but wonder if you could use it somehow to improve your situation? It seems like it would be worth a shot at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the kit, you begin searching for the instructions, as well as a list of the formulas the old man mentioned, wanting to see if there's any way to use the contents of the kit to brew a potion that might be useful to you in the amount of time you have available. You eventually find what it is you're looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Congratulations on the purchase of your own enchanted alchemy kit!\"</i> the top line of the instructions reads. <i>\"Your kit contains a number of self renewing magical substances specifically designed to allow for the production of the largest number of different types and potency of potions, salves and elixirs possible in a conveniently portable package.</i> This was followed by a list of all the different chemicals contained within the kit, some of which you recognized, and some of which were totally foreign to you. The most important ones according to the list seemed to be something referred to as preserving agent, the amount added  apparently being largely responsible for determining the duration of any potions you might make, as well as a bottle of powdered philosophers stone, an exceptional substance that even you've heard of, which, in addition to functioning as a universal catalyst, is supposedly capable of such amazing feats as transforming lead into gold, restoring youth and vitality or even giving it's possessor the gift of immortality! Whether it's actually capable of any of those legendary feats you honestly don't know, as the instructions, this part at least, doesn't say, but it'll be fun finding out. Grabbing the massive book of formula that came with the kit, you open it up to the index and begin scanning for anything that might be able to help you with your problem. You find several that look promising, and after looking them over, you___________________?</span></div></div>",

She had toned, thick legs, wide curvy hips, and a large firm pear shaped butt.  Eager to test out the powers of this watch, you hit the button and time slowed to a crawl.  The woman was caught mid step, her right foot hovering off the ground and yet she did not fall over.  You yourself were immune to this effect and were able to move freely around in this time frozen moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over giddily, you place your hands on the woman's waist and with surprising ease you pull her upper body up and hear a sound not unlike tape being peeled off of skin.  Looking down, you see that her top and bottom halves are separated with a smooth expanse of skin covering what would have otherwise been blood and guts.  Letting go, you see that her upper half remains suspended in the air.  You then placed your hands on your own waist and pushed up.  Again there was a peeling sound and with your upper half suspended int he air by your arms, you could see your stomach and hips no longer connected.  Figuring the rules applied to you too, you let go, only to have your upper half fall on the floor.  The wind was knocked out of you for a couple of moments, but you recovered.  You made a mental note to remember that and raised yourself up on your arms.  Looking up your saw your detached legs in front of you, still under your control.  You squatted and threw your arms over your topless hips and pulled your top half upwards.  Carefully balancing yourself atop your hips, you pushed the black woman's floating upper half to the side then leaped with your upper half onto her much larger lower half.  Your blank patch of skin connected with hers and you felt a not unpleasant tugging sensation as her lower half connected and fused to yours.  Her hips had been wider than yours, and as if to compensate the magic of the watch made your waist a little bit larger to match up with your new bottom.  The woman had been wearing short shorts that hugged your new but nicely, and there was a guilty pleasure to had in squeezing your large soft stolen tush.  You also noticed your vision was a few more inches off the ground,and you had a little difficulty adjusting to this new height, your thick legs shaky at first as you got used to your much longer lower half.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the floating upper half of the woman, you pulled her down onto your old set of legs.  Like before, her body slightly shifted to match her new legs and she was noticeably shorter than before.  You giggled at the odd swap and decided to test a little something extra with the woman, to see how far the watch could go.  Gripping the sides of her face, you pulled and her face came away like your were peeling off a strong sticker.  You reached inside your old panties and tugged on something wet and came away with your drenched pussy.  You pressed the wman's face down into your groin, leaving her eyes just barely visible above the top of your old pants.  Wondering if it would work, you tugged on either side of your old pussy and watched in awe as it stretched and grew.  After a couple of seconds it had become large enough to swallow someone's head, which was perfect.  You slapped it on the black woman's blank face, upside down, where it stuck fast and restarted time. The woman went back into motion, not skipping a beat or stumbling at all.  As you watched her go, her upper pussy drooling into her cleavage, she pulled out her phone and held it up to her eyes at her waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarveling at your amazing new toy and even more stunning new butt and legs, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

She was a hispanic woman on her computer in front of a coffee shop. She was wearing a mid length skirt and had her jacket hanging on her chair, leaving her wearing only a white tank top, which did little to hide her large breasts. They must have been the size of watermelons you thought, size F at least. You had to have them you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clicked the stop watch and froze time. After walking up behind the unsuspecting woman, you put both of your hands on either side of her neck and pulled. With another peeling sound, you took off her head and left it suspended in the air for later. You reposition your hands around the headless body, just below her breasts but above her stomach. You gave another pull and took off the chest and moved it off to the side right next to its former head. Now it's time to take you apart. You pull off your head and place it on the table where you can see yourself work. It was sort of surreal seeing your headless body from a third person perspective, but also arousing to see your new half white and half black body. But you needed to focus, those legs still needed a nice torso to complement them. You put your hands under your chest, just under where you grabbed the other lady's body, and pulled off your torso and walked it to the table. You used your disembodied chest to pull the hispanic chest toward your lower half and placed it on your pale midsection. As you did so, you gained full control over your new arms and feeling over your new assets. You take a quick squeeze of them before reaching over and reattaching your head. With your new mixed up body complete you take the hispanic woman's head and place it on your old torso and place than on the hispanic woman's midsection. After finding a good hiding spot, you unfroze time and watched the woman's reactions. She didn't seem to notice the smaller and paler chest and arms that she now had. Then you turn your attention to the new assets of yours, feeling them with your hands and admiring your new prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so enamored with your new body that you accidentally bump into another girl walking by. Just when you were about to apologize, you hear the girl yell \"Watch where you're going bitch!\" and then she proceeded to shove you out of her way. You got a better look at her. She couldn't be any older than 20, and she was probably a spoiled freshman considering her attitude. Her tube top, piercings, tattoos, and short shorts made you more confident in your assumptions about her. For being such a rude college girl, you decide to give her a little punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze time again. Good luck shoving me without arms you thought, as you take off both of the girls tattooed arms, not even leaving any stumps remaining. You take a better look at the severed limbs and notice at how nice they actually looked. They were well shaped and not too muscly without being too thin, and were covered in a nice pattern of tattoos. Not wanting to waste a good pair of arms, you took off your top and pressed them beneath your own pair of arms. Luckily, they attached and you gained full control over a new pair of arms. Satisfied, you unfroze time and watched the bitch walk away, oblivious to her lack of limbs. Would this cause problems for her later? Probably, but you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the mirror and took a look at your new body. A curvy dark-skinned lower half, a slim pale midsection, a tanned chest with large breast, and a four arms, two of which sporting elaborate tattoos. You then decide to...</span></div></div>",

Really, it just occurred to you that you might be holding a literal stopwatch, except for reality, in this case. Anyway, you had a Frozen Genny to deal with. Normally you'd just leave her alone, but now? Now you can get some revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a test you try and see how much you can mess with a person, and since Genny's here, she gets to be your test subject. For the first test, you grabbed her hands and placed them over her eyes, got on top of your car (after turning it off and putting it into park), and unfroze time. You watched as she ran in a straight line, and faceplanted right into a bush. After laughing your ass of at her, you froze time once more and rewound time once more. You sat there staring at her and you mind traveled, and you came back to one of your favorite stories. It was about a girl in a magic show and she wound up in pieces, with her parts strewn across the stage. You wondered to yourself, could I possibly...? Well, I mean, if things go wrong, you can always rewind. Getting down off the car, you wander into a nearby house and returned with a large butchers knife as well as a large duffle bag. Since you didn't want to outright kill her, you instead opted to chop off something smaller. Grabbing Genny, you're surprised to find how easy it is to move her, as if she was incredibly light. You maneuvered her over to the grass where you found a flat rock. You somewhat gently forced her down into a sitting position and grabbed her right leg and laid it across the rock. After rolling her shorts up, you set about severing her leg at the hip. After some work, you finally twisted it out of its socket, and soon had her leg laying on the rock. You were pleased to see that no blood came from Genny or her now severed leg. After hiding the knife in the bag, you unfroze time to see what happens.</span></div></div>",

You cannot return it normally, because you have, in essence, rejected its position in your body. The only way to reattach it is to bring it back into your form. Err, through your anus or vagina, that is!\" Your eyes widen as understanding dawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhuhm, but what about if-?\" He puts a hand up to stop you, already anticipating the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not. The magic of the blade makes damage impossible, and any orifice used to reabsorb the body part will stretch to fit with no lasting I'll effects. Now, go on, try it by swallowing you finger.\" You give pause, unsure about ingesting a piece of yourself. \"Worry not, no harm will come to you.

You felt uncomfortable about doing this in public, but you had to verify Feldan's claims before you took this knife with you, and you certainly weren't going to be putting your finger up your rear, at least not in public. As covertly as possible, you pull the front of your pants and panties and look down upon the mound of your cleanly shaven vagina. Pinky in your right hand, you quickly reach down and press against your entrance. It slips in quickly, finding yourself slightly lubricated from the thought of taking off pieces of yourself. You feel your finger wriggling around, glad you had cut your nails earlier, for a second, before there is a queer warmth. Your pussy feels empty once more, but the heat has transferred to the stump on your hand. Almost instantly, your pinky reforms, as if it had never left. You gasp, \"Oh my god, it's like it was never chopped off in the first place!\" you say as you turn back toward the shop keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite. Now, before you go I should note that there is a minor localized reality altering effect that goes along with the blade.

If someone were to make a cut upon you, you would not realize it had happened.

In the living room, you shut all of the curtains to stop possible spectating, and turn on some classic rock to drown out any noise you might make.  You strip down to the nude, tossing your clothes carelessly behind the couch.  You decided to go big with your first cut and as though you were cutting through butter, you sliced neatly at the base of your neck.  Balancing carefully, as it did not feel like your head had been cut off, you grasp the hair at the top of your head and tug.  There is a give, and some pain from puling on your hair, but you manage to safely lift your head off of your body.  You gasp as your view goes from atop your body to atop your living room cabinet and looking at your still living headless body.  You chuckled, still hardly able to believed this was working, but you had to accept what was before your eyes.  Your body hot you a thumbs up, then waved, making you giggle more.  Before you began to cut, you decided to take stock of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fairly tall for a woman, a little over six feet.  You were slim of body, although you had a little extra in your thighs and rump.  You had a pair of respectable C-cup breasts, each capped with a thick nipple.  Your face was fairly nordic looking, sharp features and piercing blue eyes, but your lips were plump and pouty.  You had long dark auburn hair that was side-cut on the left, leaving you with a cascade of hair down only your right shoulder.  Your pussy was small and cute, cleanly shaven to your liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife glinted in your hand.  You decided to started out small this time, and cut off your left nipple.  It was sliced off cleanly and as you pulled it away you saw a bare patch of skin covered the empty space of your breast.  You rolled it around in your hand, savoring the odd sensation of being touched from behind your nipple rather than the front.  To test that the restoration method was still working, you pushed the detached nipple into your snatch, and within seconds it was right back where it belonged.  Now for something a little riskier.  This time you cute off your entire right breast.  Your grip slipped and your tit fell to the floor.  You scowled in pain, but managed to keep your grip on the knife.  Picking it up, you noticed how soft and squishy it felt in your hand.  It was almost like water balloon but with less give.  You threw it up into the air and caught it a couple of times, laughing at the bizarre sight.  After a bit of this, you attempted to restore it.  Sitting down, spread eagle, you placed your breast before your obviously too small snatch.  You really weren't sure this was going to work as you pressed it against your tight entrance.  At first it didn't feel like it would go in, but as you press harder there was a give and then with surprising ease your pussy widened and swallowed your breast.  There wasn't even a bulge past the front of your lower lips as the breast was sucked in, and no pain either.  Moments later, as if melting out of your body, your tit reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief, glad that you wouldn't have to worry about larger parts being impossible to restore.  You paused for a moment, realizing that if it hadn't worked, you'd have been stuck having a detached head for the rest of your life.  You shivered, glad it worked and that your mistake wasn't one at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured of the safety of the knife, you tried something else.  Still sitting, you spread your legs as wide as they could go.  Placing the knife as flat as it could get against your groin, you carefully sliced underneath your pussy.  As you cleared the other side, it just sort of peeled off like a sticker.  Remembering Feldan's words about placing parts in other areas, you took your pussy and placed it where your neck would have been.  You shouldn't have been surprised, but your eyes still widened when the flesh of your vagina melded with the empty flesh between your shoulders. Curious, you stuck a finger in and sure enough it still function the same up there as it had in your crotch.  A trickling stream was begging to make its way down your clavicle as your lust became very evident upon your shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning your body around you pointed your ass at your head and bent over doggy style.  Using one hand to spread your bubbly cheeks, the other severed your tight pink little anus from its origin.  You took it and placed this right below your vagina, just above your clavicle.  Inserting a pinky finger assured you the swap had completed.  Now nearly gushing with arousal, you walked your body over to your head and picked it up and promptly shoved it against your misplaced snatch.  You licked and slurped like an animal, barely able to contain yourself as you attempted to sate your lust.  It only took you seconds to cum but it felt like hours to recover.  When you did, you scooped you orgasm drunk head off the floor and picked the knife back up.  Cutting from underneath the chin, you sliced upward on your face and became dizzy as your vision met the ground.  Everything was dark until your body picked up the sticker like object that was your detached face.  Carefully, you turned yourself around so the back of your face was to your body and planted it firmly against your ground.  There was a sucking feeling and soon it felt like your face had always been nestled between your thighs.  Looking up, you saw your belly button, then your breasts swaying above your field of vision.  You giggled, grabbing your head and the knife and made a beeline for your room, as well as the chest in there that contained all of your dildos and other sex toys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen hours later, you wake up and...</span></div></div>",

You had already forgotten your lowered vision,a nd when you rose out of bed with your eyes at crotch level, your body wasn't ready for the massive perspective shift.  You stand up slowly, careful to maintain balance.  Finally you stand up straight and swing your hips from left to right, throwing your vision around the room to get a look at last night's carnage. There were several different dildos, plugs, lube and other miscellaneous toys.  You rubbed your chin, instead pushing against open space as you remember you had taken your head off prior.  It seemed that a toy was missing so you moved your hand that would have rubbed your chin down to between your shoulders and find what you were looking for.  You grip the latex ring and pull out slowly the lengthy chain of large latex beads that had been stuck in the pussy that rested atop your shoulders. They fell to the floor with a wet slap as you walked shakily towards the shower.  Along the way you picked up your faceless head and tucked it under your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the shower you began to lather your mismatched body, enjoying the odd sensation of washing a pussy above your head.  Speaking of, you found it very easy to wash your hair this way as you were able to just set your head down on the tile and wash it from all angles.  Once it was clean, and almost without thinking, you decided to get your head back and pressed it against the pussy in your shoulders.  About a second after you began to try pressing it back into yourself, you thought 'Wait?  Will this work?  My pussy is in the place my head would be, and my face is where my pussy should be...?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had time to react, there was the now familiar sucking sensation of a body part being reabsorbed into your body.  You felt a shock of panic rip through you and tried desperately to pull your head out, but the sucking power was too strong and in went your head.  Time seemed to stop.  You couldn't breath, couldn't think.  But then some more time passed, longer than you thought it would take for a limb to regrow.  You were becoming quite reasonably worried that your head was just gone, swallowed by your own body, and you felt on the verge of crying when you felt the telltale warmth of a limb regrowing.  And yet, it felt wrong somehow...</span></div></div>",

You couldn't see too well from your crotch view point, but the mirror was able to give you the sight you needed.  Your pussy was pushing outward, growing, expanding upwards at an alarming rate.  As it did so, flesh pooled around it and grew along side it into a familiar shape.  Your pussy grew and grew as it turned up to face the mirror rather than the ceiling.  Hair cascaded down the back of newly formed skull and ears emerged from the sides of your massive labia.  A wisp of hair dangled over your forehead and tickled the golfball sized clitoris that now resided there.   Your sharp chin reformed with the bottom of your pussy taking up much of the real estate.  In seconds it was over, but you stood there staring for what felt like hours.  Your head was certainly back where it belonged, but your face remained firmly anchored to the spot where your vagina should have been.  Upon your once cute face was seated a face sized vagina, larger than any other human woman's, with large labia, massive clit, and small trickle of sexual fluid dribbling down your chin and into your cleavage.  Your draw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up to touch your 'face' if only to confirm it was real.  Your hands traced the moist skin, caressed your giant folds, and you nearly came from gently stroking the hyper enlarged clit.  Spreading your large lips, you were able to see that the vaginal cavity went straight down your throat.  An exploratory hand, for indeed your whole hand slid in quite easily, was able to make it into your throat and you could see the bulge in what you assumed were the vaginal walls of your neck.  'Fuck!\" you whispered.  You wondered if the knife could even fix something like this.  It could only cut and paste, not reduce in size.  This wasn't even supposed to happen with the parameters of the blade, but you surmised that because you had attempted to replace a part that was already being replaced, the magics of the blade must have tried to make it work.  And this is what they had come up with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beeping sounded from somewhere in your house.  You cursed again.  If it wasn't one thing it was another.  That alarm was for going to work, which you were going to be late to if you didn't get ready soon.  Magic mishap or no, you needed to pay the bills.  You took a deep breath, and exhaled.  You were going to be rational about this.  As rational as you could be, that is.  Taking the blade, you made a cut near your chin and sliced off the monster vagina.  It was heavy and took up most of the sink as you lay it down in there.  You then sliced your face back off and stuck it back where it should be.  Nothing looked weird now-  You looked in the mirror, down at the base of your neck, at the loose anus that was stuck above your clavicle.  You quickly peeled it off and stuck it back in between your cheeks, then turned to the real problem at hand.  You vagina was too big to hide.  People would notice, but what choice did you have.  Spreading your legs wide, you reattached your huge cunt and attempted to close your legs.  You could, if only just barely, but there was a slight gap due to all the new meat down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing your hair and brushing your teach, you attempted to put some panties on, only for them to be sucked into your giant wet snatch.  With a sigh, you removed them and threw on a skirt.  You just really hoped it wasn't windy today as you tucked the knife into your pocked and headed off to work...</span></div></div>",

While wondering through the local mall one day, you come across a shop you've never seen before, a very special shop. Why so special? Because, unbeknownst to you, this particular shop is run by powerful wizard, and sells real magic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the selection of items that the store caries is intended to be an extremely varied lot, and can include almost anything you can imagine, with a virtually unlimited number of different effects, so when including new magic items, you should <b>ALWAYS</b> make sure to leave room for new item choices so that other people an include their own ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, no dead ending a story line, there should always be at least one option left open so that others can continue the story from where you left off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, their are no rules, anything can be added, so go nuts, and have fun!</td>",
