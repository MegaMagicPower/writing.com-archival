            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a clear Sunday evening in the middle of November. The skies glowed an orange-red and the hum of traffic from a nearby city was being carried further than what is normally audible by a strong gust of southerly wind. The sound carried far enough so that it could barely heard in a small town a small distance away, James wondered why the noise of the city was so loud tonight, but dismissed it as his mind moved on to other things. James, like any normal 14 year old boy, was always on his phone. Whether it be texting or calling his mates, it is unlikely to see a day in which James wouldn't rack up extra costs for going over his call-time minutes. Today was the eve of James's 15th birthday and despite being told not to, he had already opened most of his cards and has received a fair amount of cash. He decided he needed to buy a replacement for his phone, which although admittedly wasn't old, wasn't the best out of his mates. James always had to be better than them. Colin, one of james's best mates had just gotten a new smartphone and he had been forever gloating to James about it. However, that gloating would stop soon, since Jame's had almost arrived at the largest electronics store in town. However before going in, something caught his eye from across the street, a sign offering the latest blackberry's and what a bargain only $120. He hurried over to the small shop and, not wanting to miss a bargain, rather carelessly ran across the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames's entered the small store and began browsing it's wares, He saw the phone advertised outside and walked over to the display model and began examining it. The display picture boasted the message, 'Preloaded with exclusive apps!' How could he resist? Jame's picked up the last model on the shelf and walked over to the counter, a rather timid man stood there, watching as I walked towards him. \"Excellent Choice\" he said, in a voice that both creeped me out and seemed trustworthy at the same time. It was an odd feeling, but never the less, he rang up the till and took my money. I unboxed the phone there and then and rather hastily threw out the instruction manual, now I was rather tech savvy, but this was no ordinary phone. James took his rather solitary walk home fiddling with the settings, not really paying much attention to where he was going. At one point he almost walked into some elderly lady who was less than pleased with the ignorance of today's youth. After a quick walk home, James's was still clueless as to how to access the exclusive apps but apart from that the phone was brilliant. Should James decided to call it a night, or keep trying to unlock the exclusive apps whose existance was now in question at the moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was beginning to to realize that his efforts were pointless and after all, he had school tomorrow. He was looking forward to it, the chance to boast to Colin but best of all he should be getting a new PS3 for his birthday from his parents.  Whilst they might not approve of him spending all his money, they'll be impressed with the bargain he got so James felt that he had nothing to worry about in that regard. James put his new phone on charge, unsure of the probably drained batteries life at the moment. He needed it to be fully ready for tomorrow. After all the phone looks sleek and sexy but what use would that be if it didn't work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, unlike a normal night, instantly drifted off to a dream. However this dream had an eerily conscious feel to it. This was the point which, of course, a silhouetted stranger appeared on the opposite side of the room James was standing in. He hadn't really paid much attention to his surroundings, the room was a clean gloss white which had no doors nor windows to speak off. The room was long as rectangular yet seemingly blank and uninhabited, that was of course for the stranger, who was now moving closer. As he came within 3 meters the silhouette effect was lifted and his, or as James now noticed her face became visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stuttered \"Erm... Hello\".<br>\r\n\"Welcome James, you are in a dream like state this was the only way for me to contact you\" Replied the mysterious figure.<br>\r\n\"Who... Who are you?\" Responded James in a manner that showed his nervousness clearly.<br>\r\n\"I am Ellen, and you have been chosen\" Replied Ellen \" Your new phone has the ability to transform people in ways you never thought possible. Age, Gender, Height, Race, Hair, Species and more!\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" Said James blanky<br>\r\n\"You heard me, now this power is yours to do with as you like, see it as a gift from the gods\" and with that She vanished in an exit befitting a magician.<br>\r\nJames then drifted out of the dream and slept until the morning.  </span></div></div>",

Then James looks down to see his legs &amp; torso are stretching out causing him to grow taller &amp; taller.

His quads &amp; calfs begin to expand &amp; harden up as if somebody is pumping air into them. Soon his leg muscles get so big they completely rip open the seams of the legs of the jean as they finish growing. Then the warmth fades from his legs.<br>\r\nThen his torso gets warm as his skinny yet muscular torso from the height growth gets ready to grow again. First his abs expand &amp; become an 8 pack of abs that look like they were cheiseled in granite. They are as hard as steel &amp; iron. Then the warmth moves up to his muscular pecs as they begin expanding both side ways &amp; outwards. They become like a massive shelf &amp; divide into two clearly defined individual muscles.<br>\r\nThen the warmth moves to his shoulders, back &amp; traps as they begin to grow. His back, traps &amp; shoulders widen &amp; expand to support his larger muscular pecs while keeping his narrow waist with the V taper.<br>\r\nThen the warmth moves to his arms as they explode in size. His arms become absolutely enormous &amp; are now like mighty pythons of power coming out of his torso. Then the transformation is over or so he thinks.<br>\r\nAs James now flexes &amp; admires his new powerful muscles, he thinks to himself, \"what am I going to wear to school?\" Suddenly he hears the ceiling &amp; walls creak &amp; groan as they expand not only upwards but also outwards. His room actually doubles in size. The ceiling must be like 12 feet high. The ceiling fan with the light hanging down disapears as there are now spot lights in the ceiling. His walls are now covered in posters with football players, basketball players &amp; pro bodybuilders.<br>\r\nThen he looks at his bed which has transformed into what must be like a custom made super king size bed. Its big enough for him to sleep in it length ways or width ways. Then his tv catches his eye. It used to be just a 30 inch but now must be at least 120 inch considering its now taller than he is. Plus theres top of the line dvd, blue ray &amp; game system hooked up to it. James walks over to his closet &amp; notices there are double doors &amp; are like 10 feet high. James opens the doors to find a massive walk in closet. He walks in to find his clothes &amp; shoes have expanded to fit him now.<br>\r\nJames grabs some clothes &amp; gets dressed to find they show off his muscular physique well. He grabs the black berry &amp; walks to his door to find its also 10 feet tall now. He walks downstairs to find his mother &amp; little 11 year old sister waiting to eat breakfast with him.<br>\r\nDo they freak out at his new size or do they act as if he has always been a muscular giant?</span></div></div>",

You need to hurry &amp; eat your breakfast. You only have 20 minutes till you have to go catch your bus.\" James replied, \"yes momma.\" James notices she only came up to his low to mid abs. She stands 5 feet 4 so normally she would be 4 inches taller than him. She released him &amp; went to grab his breakfast as he went to sit down at the table which was noticeably higher than normal. His little 11 year old sister Kelly who stood 4 feet 4 inches didn't even come up to his waist, stood up &amp; grabbed some toast then sat back down. James sat down as his mother set plate after plate of pancakes, sausage, scrambled eggs before him. She &amp; Kelly ate their breakfast then left him alone as they went to get ready for the day. As he ate his food, he pulled out his blackberry &amp; checked out the different features. James noticed there was a setting for who noticed the change. With this he could allow the whole world to notice the changes, just select people to notice the changes or even nobody to notice the changes. James thought he might allow Colin to know about the changes but he might not.<br>\r\nHe finished his massive breakfast &amp; grabbed his back pack then walked out the door to head to the bus stop 5 blocks away.

While putting the books down, Zoe noticed the Blackberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James, did you get a new phone?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh-huh,\" James replied nervously. He instinctively knew that something bad would happen if she looked at the phone too much. Zoe looked at James quizzically. \"Are you okay? You seem a lot less talkative than usual.\" \"I fine,\" James said quickly. \"Let's 'stu-dee.'\" He was having trouble pronouncing the word he had just re-learned. Zoe looked back at the Blackberry, and said \"Can I look at your new phone?\" James shook his head, and said \"No. I want 'stu-dee.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Zoe do?</span></div></div>",

Just give me!\" you say, reaching for the phone. Zoe pulls it back and says, \"I'm going to change you back.\" She sets the device to add 75 points to your IQ (she doesn't know how smart you were exactly, but she figures that you're slightly above average). She presses the button, but you slap the phone before it fires, hitting her instead. The result? Zoe now has an IQ of 175!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you imbecile!\" she says, rubbing her forehead. \"My spontaneous increase in intelligence is giving me a headache!\" You weren't paying attention. You were checking yourself to make sure that your intelligence hadn't changed. When you were satisfied, you said, \"Yay! I still dumb!\" Zoe sighed and said, \"Well, if you have such an affinity for being a numskull, I might as well keep you that way.\" You smiled at her and said \"That good idea!\" She thinks for a moment and says, \"Hmm, maybe it is a good idea. I can observe your behavior and learn more about this device and how it functions. Heck, I could even perform experiments!\" None of this made any sense to you, but you nodded anyway, because she wasn't talking about making you smart. \"You can go watch TV, James.\" You walk over to the couch and turn on the TV. The news is on, but it's very complicated, so you change the channel. You find a nature documentary, which you still can't understand, but you like the pictures, so you continue to watch it. Meanwhile, Zoe is taking notes in one of her binders. You ask her, \"When you going?\" She looks at you and says \"Silly, I live here, remember?\" Your memory isn't very good, so, as far as you know, she does live in your house. \"Okay,\" you reply. Zoe keeps taking notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking notes, Zoe examines the phone more closely. She sees of set of sliders in the 'Intelligence\" section. Each slider corresponds to an academic skill, and so she sets the slider for 'Math' at 100% and shoots you with with the phone. You don't feel different, but when she asks you what 2+2 is, you realize that you're able to do it. Zoe gives you several more addition and subtraction problems, which you do with ease. However, you struggle with multiplication and division. Zoe then gives you the IQ of an average kindergartner, and you're suddenly able to answer division and multiplication problems. Altogether, you have the math skills of a seventh grader, despite having the overall intelligence of someone six years younger. \"That was fun!\" you say with a smile, not even noticing your increase in IQ. \"Yes, it was!\" says Zoe. \"And intriguing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Colin gulped as his boxers changed into lacy women's underwear. Becoming crowded down below, Colin squeamilshly asked James to come inside. As he shut the door, his jeans started to shrink and ride up his legs, until they were very short and almost showed his rear. Finally, not known to James but felt by Colin, the now pink shirt tightened even more, and shortened to show off Colin's stomach. A thin layer of fabric split off of the shirt as well and formed an A cup bra touching Colin's skin. James was laughing hard inside, but he couldn't help but feel somewhat sorry for Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he got an idea. It would be the ultimate prank.

What now he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin's height remained constant. He felt like a piece of jelly being moulded into some statue. He walked over to a mirror and watched his transformation occur in front of him. Suddenly, Colin experienced a tantalising feel all over and his skin became smooth and soft. The pigment also became more tanned, like the pictures bikini models he always sees at the newspaper store. Then Colin began to realise what was happening to him. Colin's dark brown hair became a little lighter and felt almost whispy. His hair felt smooth and silky, as if he had just had a shower and washed his hair. He then noticed his hair began to elongate and become curly. His hair and skin now looked like that of an attractive 15 year old girl however there was still a lot of Colin that needed to change. He could feel his face becoming feminised. That transformation felt quick compared to the others. The transformation then began to move downwards. Two mounds of flesh began to build up into what could only be described as breasts. He realised that, thankfully, they only grew to around a size B. The virus or at least whatever it was quickly swept through the rest of Colin and left an attractive young girl in his place. Colin realised he looked like James's ideal girl.<br>\r\n\"James, what the hell have you done to me?\" asked a worried Colin.<br>\r\nJames realised this would now be the time to spring the best part of his joke.<br>\r\n\"What are you on about Clair?\" Replied James and walked over to give her a kiss.<br>\r\nColin could do nothing but kiss back.

You're phone possesses the power to change people in ways you thought unimaginable, well ok they're imaginable, but impossible. Anyway the Phone's hidden settings let you change anyones Age, Gender, Race, Hair, Body, Specific features and more. I will leave these up to you to discover. I would Highly recommend however you keep these reasonably secret as you may attract quite a bit of attention to yourself. The transformations have 2 modes, One where the transformee and the world think that the transformation is correct and has always been that way. Of course with this mode the exception is you. You will know who you are and the rest of the world will just see you differently. The other mode is a change in which everybody recognizes, this is capable of causing mass chaos, so be careful. Goodbye James\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had finished her words a new option appeared on the phone's screen ,Transformer.

His hair became jet black and grew down to his butt becoming straight. His hips widened immensely and her thighs thickened to match as his but grew out giving him a big jiggly round heart shaped bubble butt.

He'd always wanted a chance to start Secondary school again, knowing everything he knew now. So he set his phone's settings so he would be the same but his age would go back 2 years, well 1 year 364 days and a few hours, he would be 13. James was busy fiddling with all the settings on the blackberry changing it so he would be a little different than he was at 13, not just mentally but physically too, he wanted to be a little bit taller than before as he always got picked on for being short. After he had finished programming in all the settings he only had one choice left, although it was an easy one he made instantly. He would change reality around him so as to not around suspicion about his new phone, unfortunately this meant that he couldn't tease Colin about a better phone, but then again he could always switch back couldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was ready to go and he hit the transform button. The LED on top of the blackberry went from green to blue, James could feel himself shrinking, being redesigned, rebuilt. The feeling was exhilarating and rather pleasant, perhaps this was because he was regaining some youth. However James didn't see this as likely since he was only loosing 2 years, but what if it felt the opposite becoming older? He got a little worried but dismissed it as a problem for later. Suddenly reality began changing around James, he saw the room change around him, the walls from shades of mint green to the light blue he had 2 years ago. It was an odd sight and one that was utterly unexplainable. James's mind was suffering with seeing the changes happen in-front of him. It was then he fainted. Some unknown time later his mum walked in.<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, oh god are you ok?\" exclaimed his mum seeing the site of him on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. ...I'm.. ...Fine I just fainted that's all\" Replied James<br>\r\n\"Do you think we need to go to the hospital\" Asked his mum frantically. \"Perhaps just to be sure?\"<br>\r\n\"No It's fine mum, I'm fine.\" said James.<br>\r\n\"Well alright then\" said the relieved but obviously still worried parent. James's mum, Sandra, left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had his now 13 year old body to himself. He noticed he was taller than he was last time, James's room was completely different however so he could only compare himself to the height of the door. This was crude but effective. His room was missing most of the expensive technical gadgets he'd acquired over the last few years but he still had his new phone and computer. The only question remains, what should he do now?</span></div></div>",

To be honest with himself, he was missing some of the technical gadgets that he'd acquired over the last couple of years, his MP3 Player and Xbox were his most missed possessions. Then, when James had stopped thinking about everything, just for a minute, he realized he hadn't ate in 14 hours and he was suddenly very hungry. He went downstairs to get some breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way down the stairs he ran into his Sister. She was now only 2 years younger than him and he got the impression that they were better 'friends' than they were before, since she made no snide comments and just simply said 'Good Morning.' James  continued downstairs and made cereal, he spent around 30 minutes slowly eating it but despite his earlier feelings, he felt it hard to get rid of it all. He managed to eat enough though and went to go and pack his things when he realized all he would need is a pencil case since it's his first day of secondary school. James was a bit nervous about starting it all over again, but at least he would get much better grades in tests without trying. All in all he was looking forward to it, however he would have to make some friends fast as at the moment he didn't know anyone. He was wondering if he was still friends with Colin so he gave him a quick call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin, It's me\" Opened James<br>\r\n\"Hi, James I've got some work to do what do you want?\" Replied an arrogant Colin.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I was just letting you know I start today\" Said James, Hurt.<br>\r\n\"Ahh Ok I'll meet you at school, bye.\" The phone went dead.<br>\r\nPerhaps I was a drag now I was 2 years younger. I'll find out anyway I finished packing what little was needed and head out my door to school.</span></div></div>",

James hurries to the other side of the lunch room and hits the RESUME TIME button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lunchroom returns to normal, James hears a bunch of laughter coming from the table being occupied by some of the jocks and cheerleaders.  \"How the hell did this get on my face?\" asks an angry Bob Jones as he snaps Jimmy's glasses into two pieces.  Realizing that Bob has a bad temper and that he likes to pick on Jimmy anyways, James quickly freezes time again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thumbs through various options on his phone and finds one that returns Jimmy's glasses back to normal.

James was a smart student, some say on the verge of genius, but he could never be bothered to work in school so he only came out with middle grades. This made his parents rather unhappy with him not to mention his teachers too. James wearily walked downstairs and took a shower. His shower was quick and cold but it at least woke him up. His sister was being rather impatient as usual and he had to, unfortunately, rush breakfast and get out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least now he could start scheming on what he could do to Colin. His pace was normally slow, but today it was deliberately slower in order to give him more time to come up with a good prank. Perhaps he could turn himself into a girl and walk to school with Colin and then turn back? Or what about turning Colin into a girl? No they weren't that good ideas, although he would really like to see Colin's face in either one of the situations so he went ahead with it. </span></div></div>",

What better than to make himself cross the gender line? James starts to program in the phones settings, eagerly awaiting his transformation. He wondered what it would be like as a girl. James decided that he didn't want any unnecessary complications and made it so everyone, including Colin, thought that he had always been female. This didn't bother James, spending a day or two as a girl would be an exhilarating experience and one that he was sure that nobody in their right mind would pass up. Whilst going over the final settings James considered the implications of what he was about to do. Was it wrong? Was it Gay? Even if it was he didn't care, this was going to be the most remarkable thing he'd ever been through. James started the transformation sequence and the LED on top of the Blackberry began it's sequence of pulsing blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a blur, changing in front of him, The walls went from a distinctive male blue to a female pink. Of course this pink was actually a purple because it looks nicer on the walls but the point it made to James was clear.

He was now a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was in his school uniform and, before he initiated the transformation, was minutes away from going out the door. His now oversized and misfitting clothes began to resize themselves to his body. His shirt split into seperate items of clothing, he now knew he was wearing a bra. James's trousers became shorter and flared more until his trousers were now noticeably a skirt. It was a little shorter than he would have liked but well within school rules. James looked at his wardrobe infront of him and decided that he wasn't quite ready for the skirt. Quickly he made the effort to swap for some sleek fitting trousers. James now grabbed his bag, which admittedly now looked a lot different before and noticed how much lighter it was than normal. He had all his things packed already and was now getting ready to leave. He bumped into his mum as he left for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Joanne\" The voice repeated in James head all the way to school. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The words still echoed in James, perhaps Joanne's, mind. No it was clear he was still clearly male, based on the fact he turned himself on. He thought this was both creepy and cool at the same time. It was a short 5 minute walk to Colin's house and the day was bright and warm. James noted that he had more of a spring in his step than normal but couldn't pinpoint whether this was because he was a girl or just his amazement of the phones capabilities. James saw some boys he knew and occasionally played football with across the street. Whilst they never normally pay much attention he had the feeling they were watching him. A few short minutes later James arrived at Colin's house and preceded to knock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a minute\" came the rushed sound of Colin from upstairs. James waited around wondering when he was going to change back or at least let Colin in on who he was. James had found a feature that could restore the memory of just one person so it would be easy to get Colin back to normal whilst he stayed the same. Colin came downstairs with his bag ready and stepped outside.<br>\r\n\"Hi Joanne\" started Colin<br>\r\n\"Hey Colin\" replied a rather nervous James<br>\r\n\"I was thinking and, I think we should let everyone know.\" mused Colin<br>\r\n\"Know what?\" Asked a clueless James<br>\r\n\"You know, our relationship<br>\r\nIt became apparent to James that he was now Colins girlfriend, this was a little too much for James to handle and he decided to zap Colin back to normal immediately letting him know about James. He programmed the settings in on his phone and the LED flashed blue momentarily. Colin was then back to normal. James explained everything.<br>\r\n\"So you made yourself a girl?\" asked Colin, they were now well on the way to school\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you have to act like I always have been to everyone otherwise people will get suspicious and by the way, I think we're dating.\" Said James, a little creeped out. <br>\r\n\"You know you're a rather odd friend to have\" replied Colin in his usual tone. \"Your phone is awesome though, I'll admit you beat me before the whole transform anyone into anything program\"  <br>\r\n\"Hehe thanks\" James giggled That was odd, noticing his laugh had become a high pitch giggle. James continued the rest of the journey to school discussing the various possibilities that the phone had with Colin. They came up with some good ideas although James decided to remain as a girl for now. He was actually enjoying it. Not only was it interesting to see how both genders are different he thought he was enjoying being a girl a little more. Everyone was treating him better than before and he had a much better chance of getting into sporting teams. As this thought crossed his mind he'd just realised how athletic his body was. For lack of a better explanation, he was fit. He was enjoying this. He decided when he goes back to being male he'll change his fitness slightly. He did however notice there was an unhealthy amount of stares coming his way however. James and Colin had just entered the main school building and made their way to registration. They were in the same tutor group.<br>\r\nThe register caught him a little off guard<br>\r\n\"Joanne\"...<br>\r\n\"Joanne Berke\" <br>\r\n\"Ohh, Yes sir \" You replied realising you'd need to get used to your new name. You were still sat with the same group of friends you had before although you couldn't tell whether this was because it was a mixed group that you got on well with or just how the change worked. Registration ended and it was time for the first lesson of the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel his face becoming feminised. That transformation felt quick compared to the others. The transformation then began to move downwards. Two mounds of flesh began to build up into what could only be described as breasts. He realised that, thankfully, they only grew to around a size B.

Nothing personal, but rules are rules.\" and shows you out to the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have always got along good with Colin's parents, and you can see that even though Colin is now a girl, they must still think pretty highly of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are starting to regret your decision to make Colin think like a girl, because he is now taking much longer to get ready for school than he would if he was still a guy, and you have to wait out in the hall which is boring.  Then you remember your new Blackberry and pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are thinking about what to do, a thought hits you.  Colin's mom is pretty cool, what would it be like if she were the same age as him and Colin.  James sneaks over to Colin's bedroom, and is somewhat disgusted to see why Colin is taking so long.  He keeps trying his now longish hair in different styles, and even more shocking is that he seems to be enjoying it.  Noticing James's obvious dissatisfaction, Colin just laughs and snorts \"Hey, you are the one who thought it would be a good idea to make me think like a girl.  Now be a good boy and wait for me.\".  James lets out a fake laugh and replies \"Dude, do you mind if I make your mom our age for a little while?\".  Colin shrugs his shoulders and says \"Sure, why not?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin goes back out to the hallway and presses the correct buttons on his new phone.  Within a few seconds he hears a cry of shock coming from Colin's bedroom.  As he rushes over to see what is wrong he is greeted by Colin saying \"Dude, what did you do?\".  As James looks in Colin's room, he notices that while it is basically decorated the same, there are now two beds, two vanities, basically two of everything.  While James is still looking at his friend's room in shock, a very cute girl who looks alot like Colin comes bursting into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi James!  Hey what are you doing in our room?\"  She then gives you a playful slap in the arm.  Pushing you towards the door, she starts back up \"You need to get out of here.  Mom will kill us if she finds you in here!\".  James then realizes that this must be Colin's mom.  But if she is/was Colin's mom, who is Colin's new mom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a fairly attractive older woman walks up the stairway and says \"Girls, you better get ready quickly or you'll be late for school.\"  Seeing you she smiles and says \"Oh hi James, sorry that you have to wait for the girls.  You had better get used to it though, women always like to take a long time to get ready.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames feebly responds due to his shock.  He realizes that Colin's new mom was his sister Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames waits a little longer while Colin and his new sister Linda get ready.  He can hear them talk and giggle alot.  He is shocked at how much Colin seems to like being a girl, and how he likes having a twin sister.</span></div></div>",

HIS FRIEND DOES NOT CHANGE NAME RANDOMLY. <br>\r\nThe story is about the main character, James, who buys a new phone on the cheap. However the phone comes preloaded with some software that is not so standard, soon enough chaos breaks out and James has the power to transform himself and his friends. <br>\r\nThe device has the ability to change people in various ways, Partial or fully, so that the rest of the world (including the person transformed(excluding James) thinks it's always been like that) Or where everyone notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome basic rules:<br>\r\n1. No killing the main character<br>\r\n2. No personality changes<br>\r\n3. Try to keep good grammar<br>\r\n4. The device can only be operated by James.<br>\r\n5. No other devices with powers similar to the first one<br>\r\n6. No Sex etc Keep it 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I reserver the right to change chapters/delete chapters if I feel they are inappropriate or don't go where I think the story should be heading. I would like you to contribute but please more than one liners that can ruin a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Please Contribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen</td>",
