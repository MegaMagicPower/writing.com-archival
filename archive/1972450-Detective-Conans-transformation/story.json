It was just an accident\" Conan said, without knowing that the nanobots in the powder were collecting datas on him. After a minute Conan said \"Well I have to go now. Bye\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Conan\" Ran said, and then she closed her door and went to the window. Once she noticed that Conan was far away, Ran decided to reopened the compact powder,she hold her breath and said \"All right time for the truth\", then she pressed the button inside the compact and waited. After a few seconds th compact started talking and said with a mechanical voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Identity of the subject confirmed: Shinichi Kudo.\" and with that an image of Shinichi appeared on the mirror of the compact. Then the voice spoke again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you desire more datas on the subject?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ran was not listening.

That brat is really Shinichi?\" asked Sonoko<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is\" Ran said with a very sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Facinating.

Maybe he decided to do this so that he can have somebody taking care of him\" Doctor Wesber explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if that's the case why didn't he just ask me if he could come to my house? Wouldn't have been easier?\" Ran asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier, sure, but less profitable I presume\" Doctor Wesber explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Profitable? What do you mean?\" Ran asked confused but this time was Sonoko's turn to talk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. That little pervert, he became a child to take advantage of the situation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ran asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Ran iy's simple. How many time did you sleep with that brat? Or you did the bath together? Or did you let him touch you in some areas?\" Sonoko said by pointing at her breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? You are not saying that he is...\" Ran tried to say but then both Sonoko and Doctor Wesber finished for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... using this situation as an excuse to be a pervert without being noticed? Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, that's not possible, Shinichi is not...\" Ran tried to say but once again Doctor Wesber stoped her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... that kind of guy? Ran dear listen to experience. All men are perverted, all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, besides what other reasons could he have for not telling you?\" Sonoko finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan was now perplex.

Once Sonoko sat she took her phone and grinned \"Last night my camera took great picture of those two. If I make a good assemblage, I'm sure I'll be able to create a masterpiece\" Sonoko thought while watching on her phone a few immages of last night party. After that she looked over Sera, and saw that she too was checking her phone. Sera noticed Sonoko and gave her a signal that everything was fine. sonoko smiled back and then looked at Ran and Lan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a little hard, but Ran's personality is a little bit softer now thanks to our threatment last night, and Lan is a lot more casual. They are going to be great stars someday\" Sonoko thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the teacher entered and everybody in class got up</span></div></div>",

Once the nanobots are in the brain, then they started spread to the entire body, however a small part of them stays in the brain in order to adapt to the new changes. To top that, Ran and Lan have both experienced nanobots that have effected their brains as well. You see, if we put to many nanobots inside a person, those will no longer find a place to attach and so they will cover the old ones, causing the old ones to be damaged, and since the nanobots are attached to the neurons, if those are damaged then the brain will be damaged\" Doctor Wesber said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ran and Lan could become stupid?\" Sonoko asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, or they could become psycho, or even bimbos, or who knows, super genius.

Thanks to Doctor Wesber nanotech, she had now a chest circumference of 98cm <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to admit is not bad to have the girls bigger\" Doctor Wesber said while admire herself in another mirror. All the talk about boobs made her decide to gave herself an upgrade as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have everything ready?\" Sonoko then asked and the Doctor responded by giving a small bag to Sonoko<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside this bag there is the same cream we used on ourselves. You know how it works, spread it on the twins chest while wearing the gloves and the cream will do the rest. As for the 2 small boxes they contain the two chip to put on their forheads, they will automatically merge with Ran and Lan. Like you said, that way it will stop any more problem, but unfortunatly there is a small side effect\" Doctor Wesber said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sonoko asked worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chips will cause their I.Q. to drop a bit, not much, but a bit\" Doctor Wesber said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonoko then smilled relieved and said \"Not to worry Doc, I will take care of them as I promised\" and with that Sonoko took her bag, she saluted the Doctor and then left the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside she thought \"Time for some girl time\" Sonoko smilled</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was around 23.00 when Sonoko arrived under the Detective Mouri Agency. After the meeting with Doctor Wesber she had spent the rest of the day in doing a little bit of shopping for herself and for the twins, and now she was going to proceed with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well time to get start\" Sonoko said as she took the stairs that would have brought her into the house. Thanks to a spare key that she had received by her 2 friends, she entered the house without any problem. Once inside she took a flash light from her bag and she moved as quietly as possible. Thanks to the light she noticed the note that Kogoro had left for her daughters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhh, so Daddy is not at home tonight? That's perfect\" Sonoko thought happily and with that she went to Ran and Lan's bedroom, and then she quietly opened the door, after taking a spray bottle from her bag, and on that bottle there was written \"Knock out gas\". Sonoko entered the bedroom and found the two twins naked and sleeping like babies in their bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohh, they are so cute. And look they are already prepared for the treatment. Just need a bit of perfume\" Sonoko thought and with that she covered her mouth and nose with one hand, while she used the other to spray the Knock-out gas on the twins \"and everything is ready\" Sonoko said in a low tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, Sonoko tested the response of the twins to some stimulations. Once she was sure that the gas has done its work, she turned on the light and started whistling \"Let's get it started\" Sonoko said while giggling. In a few seconds Sonoko put on her special gloves and then she took the special cream for the breasts. After taking a good dose she started spreading on Lan's boobs. After finishing with them she did the same with Ran's. In just a few minutes Sonoko noticed the increase on the twins breasts, and smiled \"Now that's some serious stuff\" and with that she took a meter and started measuring the circumference of their chests \"Mmmhhh, 105 cm. Perfect.\"Sonoko smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhh, maybe I should increase a bit their butt as well, just to keep them in balance\" Sonoko thought and with she took another dose of the cream and started massaging the girls back. In another few minutes the changes started and so Sonoko once again took her meter and started the measuring \"88 cm. All right\" Sonoko approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she put the cream and the gloves away in the bag, and from it she took a little box. She then opened it and took the 2 chips that were inside \" Now for the cherry on the cake\" Sonoko said and with that she put the chips on Ran and Lan's foreheads.<br>\r\nShe noticed that the chips started to glow, sign of the fact that they were now active<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, in afew hours those chips will be completly integreted in the girls head\" Sonoko smiled and then yawned \"Oh well my work here is done. See you tomorrow my pretties\" Sonoko said and with that she gave both Ran and Lan a little kiss and by taking back all of her stuff she exited the room</span></div></div>",

This changes have the effect that you can't reveal your true identity to anyone and you also  can't do us any harm because of this.It works so when you try to hurt us or try reveal your true identity the nanobots will shock you to stop you to do whatever you are doing. Then they will punish you  in three different ways .The first one is that the nanobots make you so horny that it is a real torture.The second one is that the nanobots transform you even further into a girl.And last is oh I almost forgot to tell you that, because you are now in a female body it produced hormones and the nanobots will change your mind slowly into that of a girl.And the last way of punishment if you do something wrong is that the nanobots anticipate this process .But I doubt that you  could even hurt us because we gave you only the minimum strength and fitness of a female . By the way I think the best part of this revenge is that you what's happening but can't do anything against it  because it will only make it worse.hahahaha!!!\"finished Ran laughing out loud evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nonsense!

Was it all? Of course not, a certain girl was in that house too, a beautiful high school student, karate champion and excellent housekeeper: Ran Mouri. <br>\r\nWell actually at the moment she wasn't in her house, she was walking around the streets of Tokyo, for the first time ever without her best friend Sonoko Suzuki, still wandering about the case of last night, in which she and her family was involved, because once again they coincidentially happened to be in the same place and at the same time that the murder accoured. <br>\r\nBut enough chit chat, while walking Ran was still thinking about the method used by the culpit, that made it seem like some kind of magic was used, but once again that possibility was destroyed by the work of the duo Conan/Kogoro ( well, we all know it was actually a one kid job) and Ran was once again speechless, but this time, in a different way, kind of sad, maybe because of the last words Conan said to her after the case was solved <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murderer has been taken away by the police, Ran looked at him and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a shame, I really thought a magical trick was used\" but next to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ran, there is no such thing like magic in this world\" Conan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it wasn't a magic trick, I admitted, but come on Conan, don't be like that\" Ran said quietly by herself \"You are becoming like Shinichi.

Come on magic must exist\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic does exist\" a mysterious voice said, and after hearing that Ran looked around herself in search for someone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?

After a few seconds, Ran's arms moved away from Hana's body and that gave the little girl the chance she was waiting to got up from the bed and go to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHana returned into the bedroom and as quietly as possible she returned close to her big sister.

She slapped the both to test them , and soon regret doing that \u201cOuch, that hurts\u201d Serena said, massaging her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish the job, Serena turned the twins around once again, and made their necks stronger and stiffer, also she made sure that the dress they were wearing would now fit the twins new size. Once that was done Rachel and Amanda were now about 1,83 m tall, and at least 3/4 times more buffer and muscolar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad for my first work as a witch, if I may say so\u201d Serena complimented herself but then thought \u201cAlthough Rachel is not a fitting name for an amazon, I have to choose another one, which shows their might. Wait I got It! ROXANNE. Roxanne and Amanda, in shorts, Roxy and Amy, the amazon twins. GENIAL\u201d And with that Serena pointed her indexes to the twins foreheads to cast the memory spell.</span></div></div>",

YOU GOT EXACTLY 10 MINUTES TO DO THAT, OTHERWISE YOU BETTER BE PREPARED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES \u201d Jiro shouted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYES SIR\u201d Roxy and Amy responded without hesitation, and with that they prepared themselves at the entrance of the gym.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTheir mother arrived near them in a couple of seconds, with a timer in her hand. \u201cReady\u2026GO\u201d Eva shouted, by starting the chronometer, and with that the twins started the running. While Roxy and Amy were running, Eva approached her husband.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou sure show no mercy during the training\u201d Eva said while giggling.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMercy? Huh, our girls can take these exercises no problem. I should know, I trained them myself. And besides this is just a warm-up. The real train will start in about 20 minutes ah ah ah ah ah \u201c Jiro laughed while looking proudly at her two daughters train with great ardor, and then he hugged his wife with his left arm.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, she had a feeling she could find some spells that could get her back. She first performed the counter spell to remove the first change made. When she didn't see anything change on either Hana or Sarina, she thought, <i>'The last spell must have been one that didn't change their physical appearance.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking through the book, she was able to find the spells needed. An age regression spell, a humanization spell, and a vocal spell. She also found the sister spell. 'I bet Sarina used this spell on her. If she thinks she can take her away, she has another thing coming.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at Sarina. She was ticked at her. Rachel knew that she couldn't just take Hana back. She also had to deal with Sarina. She continued to look through the pages to see if she can find a perfect punishment for Sarina. <i>'You won't get away with taking my book, Sarina. Soon, you'll get what's coming to you.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then found some spells that caught her eye. first was another age spell. This one was to make the subject older. <i>'You like making people older? Maybe we'll see how you'll feel as an 80 year old woman.'</i> Sarina thought. The second spell she found was the personality spell. <i>'This is the one. You tried to turn me into you with this. Perhaps we'll see what would happen when it's the other way around.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, Rachel then figured that the age regression spell could also be a good punishment. <i>'Hana does actually look peaceful with you. Maybe I'll let you off on a lighter note and instead make you her twin sister.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then thought of who she should work on first.</span></div></div>",

had expected to face when escaping from the police,a stray dog chasing him was not one of the things he had imagined.He had nor even provoked it !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoo,you stupid mutt,\"He yelled as he scrambled onto a garbage can  and then clawed to get up over  the fence of the house he recognized as Ono-san's.At the alley's entrance ,a large  Doberman  darted  into the alley  and toward his 'safe' spot  on the garbage <br>\r\ncan,snarling and snapping at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms and legs burning,the teen scrabbled away ,falling of the fence into the yard beyond it.\"ha..ha..ohgods..\"He wheezed as he pulled himself up,wincing as his body protested.\"It isn't to far.\"He told himself as he trudged as stealthily as he could  to the front Gate.<br>\r\nHis house was two blocks away.He could make it that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opened silently  when he pushed on it.The detective poked his head out and looked  around, expecting  the dog,but seeing <br>\r\nand hearing nothing  except the dull rumble  of an automobile .It was the best opportunity,so he  dashed  out and  ran as fast  as je could for the street.Just as he reached  the street bright headlights blinded him.Shinichi  stumbled back abruptly found his footing gone<br>\r\nas his feet slid out from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out there, young lady!You shouldn't  run out  into a road like that.You will get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainfully,the teen sat up.The delivery truck that  had almost hit him  had stopped and the driver was peering  out the window at him,but Shinichi frowned at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,sorry\"He said curtly,\"I'm fine though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck driver stared at him,but Shinichi ignored him and walked around the truck,continuing as if everything was fine.The  truck started up again and pulled away .Only when he could not hear it anymore did the  teen begin to shake.That  had been One more brush with dead than he needed.He had only  barely survived once and that  one time  had landed him in the miserable state he was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinichi reached back  and pulled  his cell phone from his  back pocket.The battery  had died earlier  that afternoon and,from the  crack he heard a minute ago,it  was safe to say that the whole was dead  now.He cradled the brocken mess of plastic and microchips<br>\r\nin his hands as he wearly walked.The Kudo household  loomed over him  now,but it was  colf comfort to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way  that  he would  be pulled out of his depression now.He was a girl  by some cosmic twist of  fate.The reputation he had as Kudo,Shinichi was useless,His connection to his cases  had just  been crushed  beyond hope of repair and a new one would be impossible to obtain in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've used all of my bad luck for a year in just one day.\"He grumped mentally.All he wanted right now  was to be  in his male body with a bed to pass out on.A yawn forced  its way out  as he leaned against the front gate of his fence.Bone tired did not even come close to describing  his current state .Even a great detective like him  had his limits.His head hit the gate  with a thunk as he  slid down the rest against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver head  the thunder sounded dully in the  distance and rain began to drizzle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\"He muttered,reluctantly  standing back up,\"Guess I had a better get inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"Shinichi blinked and looked to the next house over where  a plume of smoke  was rising into the air  from the  blown out fence.<br>\r\n\"Oh,its  just Agasa.Heh crazy old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly  man  in a dirtied white lab coat crawled out of the  wrecked stone wall around his house,caughing  as smoke  began to  disperse into  the air .Shaking his head  ruefully,Shinichi jogged over to give him a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all right ,hakase?\"the teen  asked as held his hand out for the inventor to take,pulling him upright when Agasa gratefully took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,.ah?Have we met before?\" Agasa wondered  as he adjusted his askew glasses and peered  at Shinichi .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleuth  groaned and rubbed his  forehead.\"It's me ,Agasa !Shinichi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgasa  regarded  him curisously .\"Ah!Are you are relative of Shinichi 's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!I am  Shinichi!\"The teen yelled ,loosing  his temper.Why would nobody believe him?\"\"I witnissed a crime and was forced to take some drug  that was supposed to kill  me but instead it turned me into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of  drawn a silence ,brocken by the patter of rain and Shinichi's labored breath .Agasa shook his head  and frowned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, young lady,it's rude to play  jokes  on you elders.Did Shinichi  put you up to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to break what little  control the young detective  had over his emotions.All of  the confusion,anger, and even fear  burst out as he shouted at Agasa.\"N\u00d6,I DIDN'T PUT MYSELF UP TO THIS!\"Useing  the label of the inventor's white lap coat,Shinichi shook him.\"I can prove it to you,hakase,please,ya gotta help  me .\"His voice  broke alarmingly and then ,much to his horror,his eyses begann to water.\"Damit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently ,Agasa pried  Shinichi's hands off of his coat.\"Ah ,uh..He stuttered,confused on what to do.\"Come along,let's get you inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Her mother wants her her to be more feminine if it possible she wants her to be the greatest girly but the opposite is the case she is the greatest tomboy. She has never even wore a bra. And in her current state she never will. It\u2019s even has serious influence on her body which is that she never had a period. The doctors say it\u2019s a negative placebo effect because she wants so much to be like the boys. They warn her and did her did everything in their power to make her more girly because they are afraid this could lead to serious health problems. But she refuses because she thinks being feminine makes her weak she just let her hair grow because her mother begged her and boys can also have long hair. Her mother asked me for advice so I told her about you the most girlish but also the toughest girl I know. She believes you can get threw her by showing her that you can be feminine and though. So she sent her here so that I could ask you this. Please Ran make Mary a real girl!!!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Ran answer?</span></div></div>",

Ran suddenly had a smile on her face like she predicted what will happen. She saved Conan with a plate that blocked the shot and she showed what she\u2019s now capable of. She catches the shot in mid air and now her eyes have turned to a crimson tone. She took a knife and was about to kill Agasa but he managed to escape with a fog trick. But it had no use, she could see him trough the veil of fog and followed him. Before he left, he left a message for Conan and now he understood why Ran was like this. When she returned back without Agasa\u2018s head she pretended to know nothing. She asked him to stay silent about this and he agreed knowing that she planned to kill Agasa. It was Saturday so Conan had no school. While Ran said that she\u2019s going to buy some food, which is a lie, he told her that he\u2019s going to Ayumi, also a lie. Their ways parted and both had a goal:<br>\r\nRan: torturing and then killing Agasa<br>\r\nConan: saving Ran<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?<br>\r\n1. He and Agasa team up<br>\r\n2.She finds and kills Agasa but he left some Syringes hidden in Mori\u2018s office</span></div></div>",

It said: \u201eShinichi, now that you know happened let\u2019s meet under the ...bridge at 10am\u201c<br>\r\nUnder the bridge he found a wounded Agasa. Now a Dialogue:<br>\r\n\u201eProfessor, what\u2019s the matter\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eRan is not only faster, she\u2019s also much stronger. I could have died\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eWhat shall we do\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eIf we call the cops, she will make a carnage. But we have a trump card, you. She trusts you so you can come behind her back.\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eWill she get stronger?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eI think so. I\u2018ve made a mistake with that gas and now she will be bloodthirstier second by second until we stop her\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eAnd her eyes\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eThey only turn back to purple when she is with you. But if she\u2019s under attack while you are close to her they are \u201eonly\u201c red, not crimson. You should be the one who cures her. I left some syringes in Mori\u2018s office, use them\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eOk\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eWell, Well, Well, if it ain\u2018t the invisible cunt\u201c a scary voice said.<br>\r\nIt was Ran, she was above the bridge, so she didn\u2019t see Conan. Agasa reacted quickly and saved Conan by using an invisibility device. Ran jumped down and all she found was Agasa.<br>\r\n\u201eOnly one of us will make it out alive\u201c <br>\r\n\u201eYou don\u2019t want to hurt me\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eThat won\u2019t work. You will suffer before I grant you the sweet relief of death so be thankful\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eIf you want it like this, come at me\u201c<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t hesitate after hearing these words and in a matter of 10 seconds she almost killed him. But she found a better way to kill him.<br>\r\n\u201eYou know, I was in your house and I found these \u201eyou are young again\u201c pills and bet who\u2019s going to eat them. Exactly, you.\u201c<br>\r\nShe pressed them inside Agasa\u2018s mouth and he was young again but not a young you want. He was a fetus. Ran picked him up with the words: \u201eYou can\u2019t imagine what I will do to you\u201c and put my inside of her jeans. She headed back home. Conan, who saw this was still shocked but he had to be careful. She also went back home. Here a dialogue of them:<br>\r\n\u201eHey, how was your play date\u201c she giggled<br>\r\n\u201ePretty funny and what did you buy\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eChocolate to make a cake for you\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eOhh, thank you\u201c he hugged her and for a brief moment he forgot what she is now. After the dinner and his cake he found the syringes. He decided to wait for the next day.

When she saw the injection you could see the last part of her stone heart breaking. He eyes suddenly began to change. they now have the color of the deepest red.

If I die, use them\u201c. He quickly went back home, now it\u2019s Ran\u2018s turn to appear in this chapter. Agasa was in his house and waited for Ran. He armed himself with a knife, a taser and a syringe gun. He sat on a chair when Ran entered the room and now a dialogue:<br>\r\n\u201eYou really want to die, don\u2019t you?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eWhy do you think that?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eYou could have chosen every location but you decided to fight here, why?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eBecause I love this house and if I have to die, I prefer my own house as the location\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eOk, let\u2019s do this, I want to cook today\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished this sentence a barrage of syringes was fired by him. But even though they were faster than bullets, Ran easily dodged them. We was surprised but he had no time for surprises. He took out the taser and shot it. Surprisingly, it hit her. The electricity that hit her was strong enough to make an elephant sleep but she didn't get tired, the opposite is the case, every shock made her eyes glow in a scarlet way. After 20 seconds she took the taser off and thanked him for helping her getting more excited. His last option was his knife. Without any plan, he ran into Ran. It was easy for her to dodge every try of him to hurt her. When she felt bad for him she let him cut her once. But surprisingly, the knife broke. He immediately started to understand why Ran didn\u2019t let herself get hit by a syringe. It\u2019s because otherwise he would have known about her invulnerability and could have used a chance to flee instead of trying a melee fight. Now another dialogue:<br>\r\n\u201eYou played with me, from the first\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eTrue, can\u2019t you figured it out that late\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eA perfect plan is hard to see through\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eIndeed. Now, how would you like to go\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eAt the age of 88, with a food plate in the left gand, an ice in the right, a belly full of wine and a women\u2019s mouth around my cock\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eChange of plans\u201c<br>\r\nShe began to punch him bloody. When he lied on the ground coughing out his blood, she decided to help him to his knees. She ripped his heart out and ate it proud like it was a trophy. <br>\r\nYou can see, right now Ran is bulletproof, strong, has advanced senses, has a heart colder than ice with a soft spot for Conan and one power I will soon reveal. What will this sociopath do next?<br>\r\n1) she comes back, cooks for Conan and then tells him the truth<br>\r\n2) She comes back and is attacked by Conan</span></div></div>",

When he looked up, he could see her eyes. Crimson eyes, very scary. He couldn\u2019t think, I mean, he\u2019s a cripple. Suddenly fists began to rain on him like the actual rain that started when Ran crippled him. Every punch felt like being struck by a bullet, made out of the hardest material in the world. He soon began to bleed. The rain washed away most of the blood on her, but not everything. She soon found it boring to hear him weeping, like a child who doesn\u2019t want to feed his dog anymore. She\u2019s annoyed. She decided to do it as quick as possible. She snapped his neck with ease. She then sent him on fire(I know it rained but he still burned).

She wanted it to stay like this. To have a better chance of finding him, they made 3 groups. Genta and Ran were in the double team. They searched for Agasa in his bedroom. It was the perfect chance. Ran quickly took one of the tied hanging one the wall and chocked him. He died faster than she\u2019d expected. She hid him in the closet. After a while, Ayumi called for all. Ran said that Genta was using the toilet. They found Agasa\u2018s gas experiment. Ran now had to interfere. She quickly pulled out a knife and stepped Mizuhiko trough his neck. Ayumi was the only one left, here a dialogue of them:<br>\r\n\u201eRan!?Why!!?\u201c she said weeping over Mizuhiko.<br>\r\n\u201eI killed Agasa and you three were close to find out\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eWhy did you kill him, I thought you love everybody\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eNo\u201c she said colder than a stone in winter\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRan pulled the knife out of Mizuhikos knife and then ran towards Ayumi to finish the job.

First, it is becoming really hot in this room so he starts sweating and second, he starts to feel pain in his hands. Looking at them, he notices that there is slowly growing white hairs on the back of it and they are deforming. His fingers gets shorter, while his nails are growing longer.<br>\r\nSuddenly his feet start to ache like the shoes are a little bit to small and Mitsuhiko tries to get out of his shoes, but with his still shrinking fingers it takes a little more time than normal to get the shoelaces loose. After getting out of them, he tries to get out of his socks to, but they are already torn at the end by his growing toenails.<br>\r\nShocked by this he fails to notice that at the same time, a small bulge starts to build up at the back of his pants, stopping his slowly slipping pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting over the shock from his changing hands and feet, he took notice in the now longer sleeves from his shirt and realizes that he should take of his shirt and pants to get a look at the rest of his body.<br>\r\nGetting the pants down is easy as they were already slipping before, but before he can get his shirt off, a strong wave of pain hits him and he falls down. The pain is coming from his growing tail.<br>\r\nAll the time there is growing fur on him, white fur on his hands, feet, chest and tail while black on his arms, legs and back.<br>\r\nHis hands and feet now look like paws completely with paw pads and claws, reduced to three digits per paw.<br>\r\nHis ears are moving up to the top of his head while becoming triangular and on his cheeks grow whiskers. All over his head is growing black fur as his normal hair gets shorter and darker to match his fur. His mouth and nose merging into a short muzzle with pointed teeth while his eyes remain unchanged.<br>\r\nJust after the pain of his changing face and growing tail subdued a loud crack is coming from his back as it bend itself to held Mitsuhiko on all fours. Another crack comes from his legs as they deform so walking on all fours is more comfortable. Short after, his whole body is shrinking down, his four legs shrink to the same length.<br>\r\nAs it stops, Mitsuhiko takes a moment to look at his now feline body before slowly getting up on shaking legs.</span></div></div>",

Mitsuhiko must have escaped them without untying them.

If Mitsuhiko really shrunk out of these ropes he should also have shrunken out of his clothing. If his body changed in another way then only shrinking smaller, the socks could point out that whatever was changing him had changed him into something other than human, maybe a cat by looking at the socks shreds. If the process is nearly as heat generating than shrinking alone, that would also explain the heavy sweating of Mitsuhiko. <br>\r\nWow, if I hadn't been shrunk myself I would never believe I think that way, it sounds impossible.

Getting it to wake up wasn't hard, but the result was for Conan to have a scratch mark up his left arm, he wasn't expecting it to do so, still thinking it could be Mitsuhiko. With a small moan of pain Conan was holding his arm while the cat was hissing at him, angry for being woken up by a stranger. Meanwhile Mitsuhiko inside was screaming again, hoping that somehow Conan would recognize him, even if he didn't believe he could. He was shocked that the cat, that had been peaceful until now had attacked Conan.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, there are two possibilities. For one you are really a normal cat and angry that I woke you up. The second one would be you are Mitsuhiko, but something is subduing your normal self. What now?\u201d While Conan was thinking, the cat slowly laid down again, still hissing at him. Mitsuhiko couldn't believe that Conan already knows that he could be the cat, rising his hopes for being rescued again. But he couldn't do anything to show Conan that he was indeed Mitsuhiko.<br>\r\nAfter thinking for about five minutes Conan saw that the cat was back to sleep and he had one guess what was subduing Mitsuhiko if the cat really was his friend. He had taken a clearer look at the collar the cat was wearing, seeing that it was something completely electronic. It should be the source of the subduing. But how to remove it before he was scratched again?<br>\r\nThe policeman that had looked through the data with the help of the professor and Ai, who had come down after hearing nothing from the others for more than five minutes meanwhile found what Conan had already guessed. Looking shocked at the recorded data and a video of the slowly changing Mitsuhiko into the cat called Shiro.

The bindings and clothes could have meant he only had shrunken in size, but the socks were torn like some claws had broken through them. And if the theory is correct that would mean this cat over there is Mitsuhiko, but something is subduing him.\u201d<br>\r\nAi looked at the cat, still shocked that Conan had already guessed that. \u201cYeah, that's the cat from the video we saw on the computer.

He takes some time to fully remember what had happened. When all was back he was wide awake and started to look for a possible way to escape. Shortly after he registered that the only way out would be the door so he tried opening it. To his surprise the door was unlocked. So he started to look for a way out of the building.

A minute later she comes back with a syringe.<br>\r\n\"What do you want with a syringe?\" <br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? Whatever changed him was something he was given when he was kidnapped, so maybe I can find something in his blood that helps us knowing more. I don't think Mitsuhiko can go home looking like that. Maybe if I find something I can work on an antidote to his changes.\" <br>\r\nWith that she takes Mitsuhikos arm to put the syringe in and get the blood. The moment the needle goes through his skin, Mitsuhiko wakes up slowly.

His voice was a little deeper and raspier then normal.<br>\r\n\"You are finally awake. Did you have a nightmare or something like that?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't remember having a dream at all. But why is it so warm in here?\" With that, Mitsuhiko slowly sits up.<br>\r\n\"There is something I need to tell you Mitsuhiko. Whatever this kidnappers did to you, it wasn't just putting you to sleep and bring you to that building. They must have given you something, maybe a drug or something like that, only it seems that the effect was delayed. While you were asleep you started changing into some kind of cat-human hybrid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuhiko, like Ai before, started laughing before he looks down at his hands and gasps in shock seeing the white fur on them. \"You weren't lying.\"<br>\r\nAfter getting over the first shock, Mitsuhiko slowly stands up. Standing in a ray of moonlight, Mitsuhiko looks himself over. Noticing the claws looking out of his socks, he takes them off. His feet were similar to his hands covered in white fur. Piece by piece, Mitsuhiko takes his clothes off. Beneath his shirt he his whole upper body was covered in fur, black on his back, sides and arms while white on his chest and belly. His legs beneath his pants were similar to his arms covered in black fur and after taking them off completely a black tail with a white tip could be seen behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" was all he asked after mustering himself a couple of minutes, standing in his fur coat and only his underwear.</span></div></div>",

She was at her computer searching for something.<br>\r\n\"And, any luck?\" Conan asked. \"There is something that is not normal to a human bloodstream, but I don't know if it is the cause of your changes or something that was produced by your body after the changes. Maybe its a protein that a cat or your hybrid body needs to survive.\"<br>\r\n\"So nothing fix. Did you need something other from me then my blood?\" Mitsuhiko sounded calm, but he was far from it.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would help me to have a couple of hairs from you to look at your DNA. Best would be both, some hairs from now and some from before you started changing.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where do we find older hairs from before the changes?\" Mitsuhiko asked.<br>\r\n\"We will look at your clothes from today. If there aren't any hairs we have to look for a hairbrush or comb.\" Conan explained.<br>\r\nWith that Mitsuhiko cut a couple of his hairs for Haibara before he and Conan went upstairs to look at his clothes.

He had stumbled into a case with someone from the black organization involved. Similar to Shinichi's case with the roller-coaster, the man had been at the wrong place to end up as a suspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter successfully solving the case, Heiji had been stupid enough to follow the man alone. He wanted to help Conan with the organization and had not noticed that he himself had been followed by another person. Said person had knocked him out in an dark alley and forced an APTX-pill down his throat. After that he had left Heiji alone to die, only for Heiji to shrunk like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of lying in an dark alley he hadn't been found around the time he woke up. Luckily for Heiji they didn't take his phone and feeling a little weak himself, he decided to call Conan for help. He didn't took notice of his smaller hands or his longer sleeves, but because he wore a shirt with short sleeves they didn't block his hands.<br>\r\nFinally having dialed Conan's phone he put it up to his ear, still without noticing his smaller state.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Hattori, where are you? I thought you were on your way to the professor?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was... \u201c finally noting something was off Heiji looked more closely at his hands. All that Conan heard over the phone was a scream that sounded much to young for Hattori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Conan started looking for Heiji with the professor the way he should have come. Luckily they found him quickly in that alley that was near his original way to them. There wasn't any bystanders, meaning nobody had heard Heiji's screaming or they hadn't bothered for a screaming child. When they reached him, there was sitting a child around Conan's age with over-sized clothes and still in a shock. The professor had to carry him back to his house while Conan took the things left behind. He put the now over-sized pants in the backpack along with Heiji's phone before shouldering said backpack and taking his shoes. <br>\r\nIt took more than an hour for Heiji to come back to his senses. The professor had bandaged his head where he was been hit before while Conan had gotten something for him to wear of his things. Ai had taken a blood sample after they arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that day Heiji had lived with the professor and Haibara, using the name of Akira Hikawa. He had joined the Detective Boys shortly after joining their class, certainly not on his own will. Much like Conan and Ai, he had been forced into the group.<br>\r\nTo anyone who knows Heiji, he was out helping Shinichi with his case.</span></div></div>",

But even now that there were even numbers between real kids and shrunken ones, the kids still decided to go after a draw and Conan didn't want them to go alone, so in the end they would go all.<br>\r\nThey looked in every room of the building for something that could be interesting, but found nothing in the upper parts of it. What they didn't notice was that they watched by hidden cameras in the whole area.<br>\r\nFinally in one of the last basement rooms Mitsuhiko found something that could mean someone had been held captive here and called the rest to look for clues. Just after they were all in the room the door closed with a loud bang, startling them all. The door, an old iron door hadn't any handle, so after calming the kids down they tried to push the door open. It didn't move, they were trapped in the room. Conan didn't want to try kicking the door open with his ball because if it didn't push the door open it would bounce with much force so that it could hurt someone.<br>\r\nHaving no reception with their phones didn't help them any further, so they started looking for a way to open the door. They had told nobody where they would go, so for the next hours nobody would start looking for them. And even if they started looking, the only person who could find them here was the professor if he used the spare glasses from Conan.<br>\r\nWhile they explored the room they didn't notice the quiet hissing sound. Only when Ayumi passed out out of nowhere they took their surrounding in and heard the hissing. But that was far to late, one by one, the rest of them passed out. First after Ayumi was Ai before Conan and Akira passed out nearly simultaneous. Before Mitsuhiko could start to panic much he had collapsed too. Genta was the last one, probably because he had more body mass then the rest but even he finally hit the floor out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, someone opened the door. The person wore a gas mask to breath, the sleeping gas not entirely sucked out off the room yet. He gave each off the six children an injection with a syringe before leaving the room without closing the door fully. If the drug he had injected them work like it should, they wouldn't tell anyone. If not they can leave the room and aren't any wiser what happened in there. In front of the door laid an old stone pillar that they should think blocked the door for some time.</span></div></div>",

The old building, the room in the basement, the heavy door that had shut behind them and wouldn't open and finally them all falling unconscious. But now the door was open slightly.<br>\r\nConan got up looking if there was someone outside the door, only to find the pillar laying next to the door. \u201cHad the pillar toppled over, shutting the door? When that was the case, how did it move away?\u201d<br>\r\nBy the time Conan returned into the room the others were all awake.

Why is the door open again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know for sure, but just behind the door laid an old stone pillar. Maybe it toppled over and blocked the door after we entered. But why it isn't blocking the door anymore I don't know. And if the hissing we heard before was sleeping gas to knock us all out I'm not sure.

All of them had their ears slowly moving upwards while growing more triangular, sprouting a small fur coat on them that hid them in their hair mostly. <br>\r\nIt wasn't until Genta scratched himself that they noticed something was off. Genta had cried and the others look at him, noticing that he had a bloody scratch on his right cheek. Next to it as his hand, his nails slightly sharper and bloody too.<br>\r\n\u201cGenta, I think you should cut your finger nails when you get home\u201d said Mitsuhiko. Before Genta could respond anything Ayumi noticed that her own nails were to sharp too. \u201cI don't think that's Genta's fault, Mitsuhiko. I cut my nails yesterday and they are sharp too. And yours look not better.\u201d<br>\r\nThey all looked down at their hands, noticing all similar sharp nails. When Akira looked back up, he noticed something else. \u201cWhat happened to your ears, Conan?\u201d Looking confused at Akira Conan touched the side of his head, finding nothing where his ears should be. Moving his hands up further he found them in his hair, but not in the same form as before. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nThe others soon discovered that they had the same problem so they all panicked a bit. What was happening to them? Had someone done something to them while they were unconscious in that room?</span></div></div>",

And in combination with the ears the sharper nails could be explained as a change too, meaning that they could change further. Because they didn't want other people see them change, they decided to stay in the building in another room near the entrance if something else happened. Only this room had no door and open windows, meaning they could escape it easily. If they didn't change further they could leave the building later.<br>\r\nOn their way over to the room Akira's feet started to hurt. He couldn't ignore it for long, so he was the first to remove his shoes and socks. Akira looked shocked to see his feet growing rounder before his eyes while his toes shrunk back into his feet. His little toes vanished completely into his feet and the other toe-nails grew sharper, changing into cat-claws. <br>\r\nHearing Akira's following gasp the others turn to see what happened. They all had noticed a little pain from their feet, but had ignored it until they saw Akira's feet. The others quickly tried to took their own shoes and socks off, but while Ai and Ayumi had been fast enough Conan's, Mitsuhiko's and Genta's socks had already ripped open and turned into shreds in their shoes. Shortly after that their feet had deformed into naked paws, reduced to four toes each and with already completely formed claws at the end. Lastly there grew paw-pads on their feet, finishing the form of naked paws.<br>\r\nThey quickly took their shoes and went into their chosen room were Conan took out his phone to call the professor, explaining what seemed to happen to them and asking him to get here as fast as he can. Hopefully he wouldn't be to late and only find cats when he arrived.</span></div></div>",

Normally Genta was the biggest, Mitsuhiko the second and the rest was around the same height. But by now Genta and Mitsuhiko were the same height as the others and all were further shrinking. Genta only took notice of his shrinking when suddenly his shirt slipped down his body. He hadn't only shrunken in size, but also in weight, reducing his belly to the point were his shirt collar could just slip down. Under that he looked more like the others now, really slim compared to his old weight. That got the attention of the others and by looking at each other, they know that Genta wasn't the only one smaller than before.<br>\r\n\u201cIf the professor isn't here soon he will only find cats.\u201d Ai stated, looking down at her hands as they start to change. Their fingers started shortening while the nails grew further out. Their thumps vanished, leaving their hands just like their feet. And when the fingers finally stopped shortening and the paw-pads had grown the looked exactly like their feet did. <br>\r\nAt the same time Ayumi noticed that their faces were slowly pushing out, forming a small muzzle from their nose and mouth and including their teeth to sharpen as well. Then all of the sudden she could feel something poking out from her cheeks and by reaching up to feel it, she found there had grown small whiskers.</span></div></div>",

But most of their clothes would not fit them anymore anyway because of the shrinking. <br>\r\nShortly after Genta's shirt had slipped down the others were in similar situations than him, leaving their upper bodies bare. Their pants wouldn't slip down as long as they remained sitting, but were also much to big now that they had shrunken to half their original size and were still shrinking. So they had removed them and their underwear which was far to big too.<br>\r\nSitting there they all felt uncomfortable when suddenly a tail begun to sprout from above their rear. Like the rest of their changed body the tail was naked as fur hadn't started to grow.<br>\r\nNext one after another they yelled in pain when with a loud crack from their spine their backs switched from bipedal to quadrupedal. When Conan, who was the first who's back cracked, tried to get up he fell down an all fours and they all took notice that while they had been sitting the length of their arms and legs had adjusted to each other by shortening their legs.<br>\r\n\"Now we really look like cats except we didn't have a fur and are still a bit to big, but we are still shrinking slowly, meaning it won't take much longer until we reach our final size. Hopefully we can still talk after we finish changing\u201d was Conan's dry comment from his position.</span></div></div>",

Luckily the three others didn't ask them if they know why they were bigger then them. Maybe they hadn't noticed it yet.<br>\r\nFinally it was the time were all of them feeling an itching all around their body with indicated the start of growing fur. And the fur was the second thing beside their size to slightly distinguish them.<br>\r\nConan's fur was completely black, the only exception were his four paws and a small strip over his eyes, which were white instead. <br>\r\nAkira looked very similar to Conan, he was also a black furred cat, but beside his also white paws he had  white tips on his ears and his tail. <br>\r\nMitsuhiko had also a black and white fur-coat growing in. Beside his four paws his whole front from his chin down to his tail were white, while his back, legs and tail itself were black.<br>\r\nGenta's fur was orange instead of black. His tail was a lot bushier than that of the others and had a white tip. Other than that only his front paws and his chest had white fur.<br>\r\nAi had grown a grey and black striped fur-coat, looking like a little silver tiger. Her paws were all grey furred while her tail was completely black.<br>\r\nAyumi was the only one with a tricolored fur-coat. While her four paws, her chest and belly were white furred, her tail and the left side of her face were orange. The right side of her face was covered in black fur, which continued on her back with the exception of some orange spots.<br>\r\nWhen the growing fur finally stopped they all looked themselves over before looking at the others.

With no case to solve for them, the three boys had nothing to do.<br>\r\nAt the moment they were at Agasas house to play some games. While Conan and Genta were playing a few rounds alone after Genta had played a couple of rounds with Mitsuhiko while Conan had waited. <br>\r\nMitsuhiko had gone into the working area and found something that had attracted his interest. It was something that looked like it was build recently with a manual of what it should do near it. After reading that it should be a shrinking device, Mitsuhiko grins to himself.<br>\r\n\"With that I could get Conan and Genta away so that both Ayumi and Ai will finally see me.\" <br>\r\nLately Mitsuhiko was really jealous of Conan that both girls had only eyes for him and Genta was just annoying with his ever hungry being.<br>\r\nHe tried the device on a couple of things on the workbench by shrinking and growing them before he thinks of a plan and what he should do with the boys after shrinking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I can just hit them with the device to shrink them down, but that gives three things to think of. First, what to say where they are? Maybe I can say I wasn't with them today and then they had gone missing in a case. I would help searching them, but we will find nothing. Second, to what size should I shrink them? A couple centimeters? Big enough for me to see them but small enough to keep them hidden and from reaching things that could help them. Third, what to do with them? I don't know how loud the could be in a shrunken state, so keeping them could be dangerous if someone sees or hears them, but that is something i must see after shrinking them. If I keep them, what to to with them? Put them somewhere like a cage or box and have fun with them? Keeping them hidden from prying eyes? Find a way to keep them in one place? Maybe I can glue their feet to something. That would also stop them from running away. Maybe I should knock them out with Conans watch so I can set everything up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind set he started to look for the reserve watch of Conan and the darts to fill them in. After finding them, he starts to approach the two boys still playing. Just as Genta wins the round, Mitsuhiko hits him with the dart from the watch before reloading it. Genta hasn't even noticed the dart and the sting, so Conan had no warning before he was hit by the second dart. \"What...?\" was all he said before falling asleep. With both boys out, Mitsuhiko starts working on his plan. <br>\r\nFirst he gets the shoes of them both and puts them on their feet. Next he took the shrinking device and set it to fifty centimeters and hit both boys with it.<br>\r\nAfter they had shrunken down to that size, Mitsuhiko took of their shoes and Conans jacket off again. Then he takes glue from the workbench and starts to glue their clothing to their bodies. Their socks to the feet, their pants to the legs and their shirts to the upper body. Next he put glue in their shoes before putting them on their feet again. He even put glue on the inside of Conans jacket an puts it on him again. <br>\r\nAfter that he sets the device to three centimeters and aims at them before firing. After having reached this small size, Mitsuhiko glues the soles of their shoes to a small metal plate so that they could not move their feet to run.<br>\r\nNow they looked like small action figures that where movable. Then Mitsuhiko starts to play a round alone while the boys where still asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Mitsuhiko starts the game round, Conan woke up. The first thing he noticed was how stiff his body and his clothing were. The clothes were more restricting and uncomfortable then ever. If he had to describe his feeling for the clothes, he would say they feel like they were glued to his body. <br>\r\nBefore opening his eyes, he tries moving his body. He could wiggle his toes, feeling his socks around them. Wiggling his feet he could feel he was wearing his shoes again, but his shoes felt a lot more heavy then they should, so he couldn't move them around, making his feet and legs nearly unmovable. His hands were free to move around, but with his stiff arms that was also limited.<br>\r\nOpening his eyes he could see he was lying on a dark, hard surface, most likely on the ground. He saw something big in front of him but didn't recognize what it could be.<br>\r\nThen there was the sound of screeching tires, similar to that of the game he and Genta had played. <br>\r\nHe remembered playing with Genta before something had pricked him in the neck. After that there was nothing, he had fallen asleep. \"Just like I was hit with the darts of my watch.\" <br>\r\nBut that would rise questions. Who would hit him with a dart from his watch? Wasn't the only people in the house Genta, Mitsuhiko and him? And where are the two others?<br>\r\nLooking around he couldn't see them, and turning wasn't possible to his heavy feet. He tried looking why his shoes where so heavy by moving his head slightly forward, but only sees some large object near his soles, looking like it was leaning against his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't see was that Genta was also waking up, but the two of them were lying back to back with some distance, so Genta likewise couldn't see Conan. <br>\r\nGenta felt similar to Conan how restricting his clothes were. Also he noticed how heavy his feet were, slowly registering he had his shoes on. He couldn't see his feet because of his belly, but there was something large lying by his feet. In front of him he could see a large, empty area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them realized that they were not gaged and beside being stiff from the clothes, they were not shackled in any way. Genta could see that his Detective Boys badge was missing, while Conan tried to find his within his pockets with no luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mitsuhiko finished his game round and turned to look at the boys, not that they saw his face for him sitting ahead of their feet.</span></div></div>",

While Genta moves only his head to look around him, Conan tried to reach the pockets of his jacket like he is searching for something. \"Probably his DB-badge.\"<br>\r\nBut Conan couldn't find it because Mitsuhiko had taken both of their badges. He had also switched Conans watch with the reserve one he had used to send them to sleep, so Conan had no darts in his watch. He was sure that Conans belt was empty because of him using his ball yesterday and even if he had a ball he couldn't kick them because of the glued down shoes, making this weapon of his useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching them for a coup\u00f6e of minutes he decides to speak with them. \"Ah, you are awake.\"<br>\r\nConan &amp; Genta stopped moving before asking at the same time \"Mitsuhiko?\". And because they had heard each other they also asked each other \"Genta?\" \"Conan?\"<br>\r\nMitsuhiko hadn't heard their words, only seeing their lips moving while both thought that Mitsuhiko was way to loud for a normal situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they are so small I can't hear them speaking. Maybe I should grow them a bit back to see when I can hear them. If I keep the shrinking device I can shrink them down again if I need to. I will grow them back cm for cm to the point I hear them speaking again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Mitsuhiko took the device again from its spot next to him, setting it to 4cm before hitting them with it.<br>\r\nFor both the boys it was an weird feeling as the device hit them, not that they know what it was or where it come from. They only saw the ground moving a bit under them while they felt like they slide on it. \"What was that for a weird feeling?\" asked Genta after they stopped growing while Conan said nothing but looking thoughtful.<br>\r\nSeeing Genta speaking but not hearing him Mitsuhiko tried again with 5cm. No difference to before. With 6 cm he could hear them, but only if he bowed his head down to them, with was a little uncomfortable to him. Trying 7cm, he could move back his head, but not sit normal to hear them. Finally at 8cm he was able to hear them without moving nearer to them even if they where really quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so if I need to hide them with nobody hearing them I can shrink them to 5cm or I can shrink them to 6cm and hear them if they are nearer to my head. But keeping them in the front pocket of my shirt could expose them if they moved and if someone is near me he could hear them there too. Something I should think for a solution later.\"</span></div></div>",

Why are you so loud?\" answered Conan for them both.<br>\r\n\"So their ears are more sensitive now\" thought Mitsuhiko before answering a little quieter \"Sorry, I didn't thought about it before. How do you two feel?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel stiff all over, like I'm wearing an armor or something similar. I can't move my legs and there is something really heavy keeping them in place.\" Conan responded. Genta only agreed with Conan. \"Where are we and what happened?\"<br>\r\n\"We are still at the professors house.\"<br>\r\n\"But I didn't recognize anything around me. The ceiling is to high up to be in a normal house and whatever is in front of me looks like something gigantic.\" Conan was confused. Why did he not recognize it if he really was in the house of the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to your second question, I will just show you.\" With that, Mitsuhiko carefully picked up Genta with two fingers of his left hand and Conan with his right hand. Both of them were scared for being touched by something that big to them and also being lifted from the ground that easily while they themselves couldn't really move. But that was nothing compared to the shock when Mitsuhiko turned them around so they could see each other and the gigantic Mitsuhiko next to them, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting them down on there feet, forced to stand by the metal plates and their stiff legs, Mitsuhiko waited for their reactions after that shock. </span></div></div>",

Conan combined what happened to them \"Why have only Genta and me shrunken down so small, why is there some plate at our feet and why are you smiling like that, Mitsuhiko?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, the reason you have shrunken down is that I hit you with a shrinking device I have found. The plate is there to keep you in place, I don't want you to try running away.\"<br>\r\nGenta and Conan both looked shocked at their friends explanation. \"But why?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm jealous of you Conan. Both Ayumi and Ai have only eyes for you. With you not there, I hope they will finally notice me more. And for you Genta, you are always babbling about food, that's really annoying.\"<br>\r\n\"You know that I don't have any interest in Ayumi or Haibara, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, but that doesn't help if they still look at you all the times.\" That silenced Conan, while Genta was still shocked. Mitsuhiko thought he was that annoying to just put him aside like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly ten minutes of silence between them, Conan finally asked \"And what now? What do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n\"I will keep you that small and immobile, maybe even shrink you more so that nobody hears you. When I meet with Ayumi and Ai and they ask, I will say I didn't was with you today. I think they will want to search for you, but with no clues what happened with you, they will give up eventually.\"<br>\r\n\"Have you ever thought about what will happen to us? We will starve to death. And with not being able to walk, how do we go to the toilet?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will find a way to let you eat. I can still shrink food for you or give you some crumbs. For you, they would be way bigger then normal food would be. But I haven't thought about the toilet part. It will be hard not only because of you couldn't walk or have it in your size, but also because I glued your pants on your legs. You can't take them off that easily.\"<br>\r\n\"You ... have glued our clothes to us?\" inquired Genta.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have glued your clothes. You will not be able to slip out of your glued down shoes, or even your socks. You can't take off your pants or shirts, and Conans jacket is glued to him as well.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's why we are so stiff, the glue hardened in the clothes so they are nearly unmovable for us.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I will look if I find a solution for your toilet problem. I don't want someone to find you by smelling you.\" With that, Mitsuhiko stands up to walk over to the computer, taking the shrinking device with him, just to be save. He intended to look in the Internet for a solution. To Conan and Genta it felt like an earthquake as Mitsuhiko walks away. But even with the shaking they both kept standing by the to them heavy plates.</span></div></div>",

The only way for us to move would be to either get out of the shoes or to get in a handstand and walk on our hands. But the first is impossible because of the glue, we would tear our feet away trying. And the second would mean we have to lift the plates from the ground. And to us, they weigh way to much to achieve that. Even if we did get them lifted, walking on our hands with that weigh would be nearly impossible I think.\" But his mind was running to find a solution for them to escape Mitsuhiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Conan was thinking of an escape plan, Mitsuhiko had started the computer and was looking for a solution for their problem. So far he had found two ways to keep them from needing a toilet.<br>\r\nFor one solution Mitsuhiko would have to diaper both Conan and Genta. But that was nothing he wanted to do. It would mean he had to change them frequently and even if he could overpower them easily with his size they could keep struggling. He also didn't want to use the watch on them to often because he wouldn't get new darts without telling the professor why he needed them. Not to forget the costs of repeatedly buying new diapers. Even if he could just shrink the diapers in the shop and take them secretly he didn't want to steal from someone that way.<br>\r\nThe other solution was a drug to reduce their metabolism. That would not only help with the toilet problem but also reduce the amount of food they would need, even if at their size that was already little. He only didn't know how the normal dose would affect their shrunken bodies. <br>\r\nThat was something he would need to test. The problem was how would he get the drug? He couldn't order them online and if a child like him could get them in a pharmacy was also not guaranteed. And he couldn't ask someone other without explaining why he would need that drug.</span></div></div>",
