He tried to move but he soon realized he was strapped and restrained to a large operating table. In front of him was a large mirror. His mind was still hazy, and he couldn't recall how he ended up where he was. One moment he was with his squad fighting the blood pack, and now he was tied to a table like some twisted science experiment. Waking up in odd places wasn't all that new to him however, he had sneaking suspicion alcohol wasn't involved this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here!\" Shepard whispered to himself as he tried to free from his restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use Shepard, there is no point escaping,\" a deep mysterious voice called out from the shadows. As the footsteps drew closer Shepard could recognize the shape of a large Krogan and two Vorcha who were accompanying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard glares at the menacing Krogan, it didn't take a genius to figure out he was their leader. \"I take it you're in charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Krogan stepped forth and lights his cigar \"That obvious huh? The names Wrang, And you've must be the ass-hole who has been killing my men\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood pack was known for being cruel and merciless with their pray. Shepard knew he had to choose his words carefully if he wanted to stay alive<br>\r\n \"I did what I had to stay alive. I'm sure you would have done the same\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe krogan remained silent as he took a huff from his cigar \"You know I've heard stories about you. People say you're a hero. But all I see is a fraud hiding behind his own inflated ego\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was growing impatient. Clearly, the blood pack had something up their sleeve otherwise he wouldn't be breathing \"If you wanted to kill me you would have already done it. So what the hell do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked,\" Wrang said with glee as he walked behind the operating table \"Since you've been such a nuisance we figured we'd have fun with ya before we put you down\" The krogan pulled out a thick green hose and wiggled it in front of the commanders confused face. He didn't have a chance to react before the hose was already in his mouth. As much as he resisted he could not stop them from digging the tubing deeper down his throat. There was no escaping his fate now. Whatever they had planned Shepard had to endure it until his squad could rescue him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are only going to get worse from here on out\" Wrang joyfully said as he caressed the commander's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s some strange illness affecting all forms of life on the planet at the moment...well, male life. Women are somehow unaffected. We need immediate medical aid! Send only women, and hurry!\u201d Valerie bit her lip as she sent the transmission. Normally the message would take days to reach the citadel due to how far away Seiapod was from other civilized life thankfully her father was able to give her some advice on to jury rig it to make the message get there faster. Although it was hard to hear his instruction clearly, what with all the weight on his face now. She sighed and shook her head. Help will get here. It has too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Shepard gave the Normandy\u2019s interior another look over. It has been a few years since the destruction of the Reapers and while the constant parading, press conferences, and taking the time to bask in the public\u2019s praise was nice he needed some time to do what he wanted to do. And all he wanted was a boy\u2019s night. Of course he wasn\u2019t the only busy one after it all ended but he wanted nothing more than just a night or two out with his friends and shoot the shit and make some nice post war memories. So that\u2019s what this week was for, all his fellow compadres that followed him to hell and back were going to join him on a galactic trip with no destination in mind besides away. They\u2019ve already confirmed they were coming so at the moment Shepard, the ship\u2019s AI EDI and his trusted pilot Joker were the only ones on board. Soon to be arriving were; Garrus, Wrex, Kaiden, Grunt, Thane, Zaeed, Mordin, Jacob, Javik, and James. He could hardly believe all twelve of them were able to get the chance to walk away for one whole week but he wasn\u2019t going to let the opportunity pass by. In only a few shot hours the Normandy will be in space flight and the next few days will be full of nothing but hanging out with some of his greatest friends.<br>\r\n     The merriment, while appreciated, didn\u2019t last long. Within six hours of the Normandy taking off a distress signal was picked up by their communications array.<br>\r\n     \u201c...council....SOS...colony....Seiapod!...Illness...the planet...men...unaffected....immediate...aid...hurry!\u201d<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the worst static filled message we could\u2019ve gotten at the start of our trip.\u201d Joker\u2019s voice filled the recreational area the others had settled in, an obvious attempt to keep things light.<br>\r\n    \u201cInnocent civilians need our help. Any objections?\u201d Shepard asked. What met him were several faces of amusement.<br>\r\n     \u201cHonestly I wouldn\u2019t count it as a vacation if there wasn\u2019t at least <i>one</i> shoot out.\u201d Garrus replied.<br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ve needed this. I\u2019ve been doing nothing but diplomacy for years! Do you know what that does to a Krogan?\u201d Wrex replied, a smile, or at least as close to one as a Krogan could get, plastered on his face.<br>\r\n     \u201cEven with the Reapers gone there\u2019s still going to be trouble. We\u2019re still heroes after all.\u201d Kaiden said standing firm.<br>\r\n     Grunt was hollering nonsense but was obviously excited.<br>\r\n     \u201cOf course not.\u201d Thane answered. \u201cHopefully I\u2019m not too rusty.\u201d<br>\r\n     \u201cWell damn, I\u2019m already four deep. Guess I\u2019ll have to slow down it we\u2019re playing heroes.\u201d Zaeed said, opening a fifth beer despite his statement.<br>\r\n     \u201cAssistance needed. Gender targeted illness? Intriguing. Need to study for myself.\u201d Mordin stated.<br>\r\n     \u201cCount me in.\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of there and at a resort before we know it.\u201d<br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ll lend my assistance I suppose.\u201d Javik dryly replied.<br>\r\n     \u201cThe real question isn\u2019t looking for objections, it\u2019s wondering why you thought any of us would raise any.\u201d James joked gesturing toward Shepard with his own bottle of beer.<br>\r\n     \u201cYou heard \u2018em Joker, let\u2019s go. How far out is Seiapod? The message said they needed help urgently.\u201d A friendly voice came to life.<br>\r\n     \u201cWe should be able to get there in two hours and 13 minutes barring any flight accidents.\u201d The ship\u2019s AI, EDI, helpfully clarified.<br>\r\n     \u201cWhat she said. Well I would\u2019ve only said two hours but you get the gist.\u201d Joker chimed in himself. With that the skeleton crew was off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All twelve men stood at the front of the ship and watched as the planet came into view. Larger than earth but with more land than water Seiapod was a giant luscious paradise that humans could easily settle on as it\u2019s atmosphere wasn\u2019t terribly different. \u201cUhh hey guys? I\u2019m getting a message stating that this planet is quarantined and that no one is allowed on or off the planet.\u201d Joker said looking over his shoulder. He was met with eleven faces that clearly weren\u2019t bothered by this development. \u201cOooookay but when zombies chase you back to the ship and you\u2019re all banging on the door to get me to let you in I\u2019m totally saying I told you so.\u201d Joker chided. He then expertly guided the Normandy to the modest landing dock the planet had. The ground crew, which was everyone minus Joker, prepared to disembark. They all wore full body suits and respirators just in case.<br>\r\n    \u201cWhat\u2019s a zombie?\u201d Grunt asked.<br>\r\n     \u201cLiving dead. Infect each other through biting. Can only be stopped with a shot through the head.\u201d Zaeed replied.<br>\r\n     \u201cAwesome. Hope that\u2019s what\u2019s out there, I could use some target practice.\u201d<br>\r\n     \u201cNo guns. This is a simple recon mission first and foremost before we return to the Normandy and establish a base to help the men with the planet\u2019s issues.\u201d Shepard announced. A few grumbles were heard but the request was followed. A blue light washed over them as they were decontaminated, a few moments later the door opened to the outside, a nice breeze letting itself in. Before the group stood several women in simple clothes.<br>\r\n    \u201cCommander Shepard?!\u201d A familiar voice cried from the head of the welcoming party.<br>\r\n     \u201cYes, we\u2019re here because of the dis-\u201c Shepard started to respond but was cut off.<br>\r\n     \u201cNo you can\u2019t be here! My message said it only infects men!\u201d She cried out.<br>\r\n     An awkward and tense moment passed before Shepard continued the conversation. \u201cWho are you, and what do you mean? Your message was corrupted but it plainly said men were not affected by this illness.\u201d Shepard said what the group was thinking.<br>\r\n     \u201cMy name is Valerie, I\u2019m the daughter of the leader of this colony. And quite frankly; no. It did not.\u201d Valerie said coldly.<br>\r\n     Shepard played back the message they received back to her, and the faces of all the women went ghastly white. \u201cNo...no! This is awful so many more men are going to be infected! We have to stop this! I\u2019ll send ano-\u201c this time it was Valerie\u2019s turn to be cut off.<br>\r\n     \u201cThe planet was quarantined. No other crews are coming in...or out.\u201d Javik informed. \u201cSo it\u2019s either our gracious help, or nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n     After a moment of silence Valerie sighed. \u201cFine. But those masks and suits stay <i>on</i> alright?\u201d Her demand was met by their nods.<br>\r\n     Valerie led the group into the quaint colony, several women were seen running in and out of the sparse buildings but true to the welcoming party\u2019s words there wasn\u2019t a man to be found.<br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019m getting an awful feeling.\u201d Jacob said. Kaiden, James and Wrex murmured their agreement.<br>\r\n     \u201cI was promised zombies.\u201d Grunt huffed. Garrus let out a single laugh as they were led to a small building near the center of the colony.<br>\r\n    \u201cOk I\u2019m going to warn you...what you\u2019re about to see isn\u2019t for the faint of heart.\u201d Valerie cautioned. After a deep breathe she opened the door and led the men inside. Within the home was a sight none of them would soon forget. A man with a gut the size of a queen sized mattress lay on his back, rolls of flesh oozed their way onto the floor, his appendages bloated to immense proportions, even his facial features seemed lost in his incredible bulk. Gasps, retches and surprise came from all the members of the group. It seemed all of the questions they had were clear even beneath all of their protective clothing because Valerie started explaining. \u201cA few weeks ago a few of the men in the colony started to exhibit strange behaviors and curious symptoms. Our best researchers started trying to figure out what was wrong but by then the swelling had started. By the time the first victims had lost mobility all the other men were infected, we\u2019re pretty sure the disease is airborne. We still aren\u2019t sure why only the men were infected, our research has slowed since we lost the men of the research team. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll even be of any help, but if there\u2019s anything you can do I beg you to try. The...thing you see before you, I can scarcely call it a man anymore, is my father. And he\u2019s one of the smallest men left in the colony.\u201d Tears welled up in Valerie\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ll get started.\u201d Mordin said after a small silence. His omnitool sprang to life as he rapidly typed on it and performed scan after scan. Several of the men walked out, needed a moment to themselves. Shepard, Garrus and Kaiden talked with Valerie some more.<br>\r\n     Grunt stood fixated on the human in front of him. His pale skin was covered in bright red stripes, and his breathing was incredibly loud. The Krogan took a few steps toward the man before reaching out and pressing into his gut with his hand. It felt warm and soft with quite a lot of give to it. As he reached his other hand, a different hand quickly slapped the krogan\u2019s hand off the victim\u2019s body. <br>\r\n     \u201cCease! Could get infected. Airborne is only a hypothesis, could be wrong. Be more careful.\u201d Mordin quickly rambled off, despite talking to Grunt his eyes never left his Omnitool. Grunt muttered out a meek apology as he left the building.<br>\r\n     Shorty thereafter Shepard\u2019s party left as well leaving Mordin alone with the man turned blob of fat.</span></div></div>",

He mainly just wanted to see more of the victims. Valerie wasn\u2019t lying when she said her father was one of the smallest, Grunt met a couple victims who were so large makeshift shelters had to be set up outside because they grew too large for the confines of their houses. The whole thing was confusing to Grunt, he felt feverish or at least the base of his neck was incredibly warm. It felt like the area where his helmet and suit met was running up against his skin and the irritation it was causing was well...irritating. He walked several feet behind a house near the out skirts and looked around.<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s no one here.</i> He thought to himself <i>I know they said it\u2019s dangerous but my neck itches so much. If it\u2019s airborne I should be fine as long as I hold my breath while my helmet is detached right?</i> He hastily reasoned to himself. Before sense could return to him he took one more precautionary look around before inhaling deeply and then releasing the lock on his helmet, slightly lifting it up so he could slip his hand under his helmet and scratch his itch. He quickly redid the seal and then exhaled. His itch was gone, and he felt less feverish after that deep breath. Smiling to himself he figured it was time to get back to the Normandy.<br>\r\n     After a short jog, Grunt found himself in the decontamination section of the ship. After a couple minutes the outside of his suit was completely disinfected, and the doors to the inside of the Normandy opened. He was surprised when he saw everyone else in the recreational area.<br>\r\n     \u201c....and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found.\u201d Mordin finished off a quickly spoken speech. Grunt blinked at the eyes that were now on him for interrupting. \u201cSome of those guys are huge.\u201d He said to the unentertained audience.<br>\r\n     \u201cAnyways, to refresh ourselves, and catch up the late comer, the disease thrives off testosterone which is why males are infected, a cure hasn\u2019t even been started yet let alone created, and rapid creation of fat cells mostly happens when the victim is asleep. Did I get that?\u201d Jacob asked.<br>\r\n     \u201cPrecisely.\u201d Mordin replied. \u201cLab will be set up tomorrow. Too late now. I\u2019ll wake up early.\u201d He prattled off as he headed towards the sleeping pods. Most of the others followed suit. Soon all that were left were Shepard, Wrex, Zaeed, Thane, Joker and Grunt.<br>\r\n     \u201cSo it\u2019s just making guys fat?\u201d Joker said plainly.<br>\r\n     \u201cYeah. Weird right?\u201d Shepard responded. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any plant or animal life that would even seem to cause that too.\u201d<br>\r\n     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just leave again? I have no desire to smother a bed with my ass.\u201d Zaeed grunted.<br>\r\n     \u201cQuarantined remember? We technically shouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to be in galactic prison either, or worse in galactic prison with a bed smothering ass. We could already be infected.\u201d Thane mused.<br>\r\n     \u201cImpossible.\u201d Wrex bellowed. \u201cWe had suits on, and respirators. Those things are state of the art, no way we\u2019re infected.\u201d<br>\r\n     The conversation continued before the rest of the crew went to sleep.

They all had awoken around the same time and while usually this time would be spent discussing who would make coffee or get first go at the showers all eyes were on Grunt this morning.<br>\r\n     Specifically his middle.<br>\r\n     The Krogan stared wide eyed and slack jawed at the mass of flesh hanging off of him. He cautiously touched it and felt it slightly jiggle afterwards. \u201cW-what.\u201d Was all he could mutter.<br>\r\n     Afterwards was a whirlwind of discussions and a hastily set up lab. Blood samples were taken from all 12 crew members and after several hours of test it was determined that each of them was intact infected with the virus, however so far it has only effected Grunt.<br>\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ll get started on the cure. Not just for us.\u201d Mordin said, quickly getting to work. Shepard and Garrus left to go ask Valerie if there was anything they should watch out for. The others quietly sat, trying to wrap their heads around their fate. Grunt excused himself and entered the restroom where he stripped off his pajamas and stared at his reflection. It looked bigger outside of the cloth shirt he was wearing. The basketball sized mound jutting off of him was still foreign to him, but having stripped to his briefs he realized that wasn\u2019t the only change. His thighs were thicker, noticeably so. His hips have rounded out slightly, and his face looked slightly fuller or perhaps it was a trick of the light. He shook his head, put his clothes on again, even though a small sliver of stomach was always able to be seen, and walked back out to the others. Several minutes later Shepard and Garrus returned.<br>\r\n     \u201cValerie told us about some side effects we should come to expect....\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just take a deep breath, and... PULL!\"<br>\r\n      Garrus yanked hard on his pants, finally stretching them up past his large thighs. The waistband creaked in protest as it was forcibly expanded to fit his engorged stomach. Quickly but carefully, he grabbed the human garment he had picked up yesterday, something called suspenders, and attached them front and back. <br>\r\n      The first time he did this, he fumbled with it horribly, and the straps and pants snapped apart, causing one of the buckles to whip up and whack him in the eye. That was earlier this morning, and fourteen tries and three split pairs of pants later, he was considerable more practiced. Of course all of this could have been avoided if he were on the citadel, or back on Palaven. Earth was notable lacking in plus-sized Turian outlets.<br>\r\n      Huh. Funny, that was the first time Garrus had ever thought of himself as plus-sized. It was easy to forget, being here on earth, among humans. He had tried to ignore it for a while, but the fact was, he had put on a substantial amount of weight. Compared to the rest of the galaxy humans were fatty race. Getting fat was a normal part of their aging process, they were born covered in it, and they could get significantly larger than average without too much difficulty. Living on earth, Garrus had gained 30 lbs; by human standards,  he had perhaps gotten a little chubby. Turians however were a much different kind of race. Their plate-like skin, their lightweight anatomy, and their military culture meant that fat was a rare thing on Palaven. By Turian standards, Garrus was morbidly obese. <br>\r\n      He had certainly seen, or at least heard of, Turians bigger than himself, so he like to think that there was a store somewhere in the galaxy that sold clothes big enough for him. He supposed he could have had Shepard check on the citadel for him before she came back.... But that would involve telling her that he had blimped up while she was away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Five months, it had only been five months. Just a quick tour of the galaxy again, a visit to everyone she hadn't seen in years. Tali on Rannoch; Wrex, Grunt, and Bakara on Tuchanka; they had, like she and Garrus, moved forward with their lives, and Shepard wanted to see it all, to remind herself that it was all worth it. Garrus had wanted to come too,  but he had seen all of them recently himself, during a Turian fleet victory tour, and his new work on Earth, a desk job with planetary security, prevented him from joining Shepard this year.<br>\r\n     Meanwhile, with no war to fight, the love of his life gone, and little to do but sit around, watch vids, and eat, that's exactly what Garrus had done. He didn't even need the new job, the entire crew of the Normandy was set up for life retirement after the war, but he found himself going stir-crazy without something to do.<br>\r\n     Unfortunately, he had to balance that with his new, slower life with Shepard, so a desk job was the best option.<br>\r\n     Of course, that hadn't done his burgeoning gut any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The suspenders were his final option. His midsection was large enough now that they would be invisible under his shirt anyway. Spirits, they were tight though; the taut elastic was cutting into his shoulder, back, and belly. They had to, to be tight enough to hold the trousers at the right height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Damn it, his body wasn't made for this. He pulled on an over-sized formal shirt, his only stroke of luck in this whole debacle. Turian formal wear was larger and roomier by design, even with that, it was a bit tight. Hopefully she wouldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Time to get going to...</span></div></div>",

A lot of fancy black-tie places claimed to have \"authentic\" Palaven fare. Garrus had tried them all, and he had not been impressed. Funnily enough, the only restaurant on all of Earth that got even close to right was McDonald's. Turian meals weren't sit down affairs. Everyone had somewhere to be, usually for some military purpose, so Turian food was nutrient dense and quick and easy to eat. The one way in which McDonald's differed was in quantity. The portions in a Small Palaven Medley were three to four times more than what the average Turian would eat in a meal.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Pulling up to the window, Garrus ordered a Large Medley with extra panem, and a soda. Soda was not something you could find on Palaven, but once the molecules were set right, it was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the skycar made its way to the spaceport, Garrus inhaled the meal. He noticed as he did so that both his pants and his suspenders getting more and more painful.

Knowing that every bite was more weight, that every second was that much closer to another pound of her favorite Turian, it gave her chills as she lay on the bed, waiting for their nightly ritual.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the familiar pounding footsteps began marching towards the bedroom, and she prepared her self for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door pushed open, and a very naked Garrus squeezed half-way into the room, the sides of his massive belly, thighs, butt, and moobs squished against the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard laughed. \"Oh my God, you're so gigantic!\"<br>\r\nGarrus would have blushed if he could, and held his all-to-tiny hands over the gigantic mound of flesh in front of him. \"Hey now, I worked hard on this, only because you asked me to.\"<br>\r\nHe was still pretty insecure about his weight, even as he kept intentionally gaining more and more. It only got worse the heavier he got, but in honesty, that was part of the allure for both of them.<br>\r\n\"What does the scale say, anyway?\" He asked, the scale in under his feet being part of the ritual. The readout was on the wall next to him, as he hadn't seen his feet in five months.<br>\r\n\"Just a hair over 682 pounds.\"<br>\r\nGarrus sighed. \"You were right.\"<br>\r\n\"More than twice as much as Wrex, big guy. No way he's making fun of you again.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Next time he sees me he might die laughing.\"<br>\r\nThey looked it up a while ago, and found he had become the biggest and heaviest Turian to ever exist, with second place weighing in at 221 pounds. It was amazing how fast a Turian could get fat, when they really tried.<br>\r\n\"Well, come on. Get in here.\"<br>\r\nGarrus shoved forward with all his might, the door creaking and groaning as his blubber pressed against it, but he found, no matter how hard he tried, the his bulk would not budge.<br>\r\n\"Uh...we might have a problem here...\"<br>\r\nShepard laughed even louder, before she got up, shoved some more food in Garrus's embarrassed, but hungry maw, and yanked on him until he popped through the frame.<br>\r\n\"We might have to think about moving, before you're too big to leave the house.\"<br>\r\n\"I think that point might be only a few weeks away...\"<br>\r\n\"Lets make the most of this bed then.\" She said, shoving Garrus backwards onto the mattress.
