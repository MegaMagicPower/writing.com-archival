Between her dad, a high officer in the military, and her mom, an aggressive CEO for the fast food industry, she had always got whatever she had wanted. Trinkets rained on her almost every day and the more she grew up the more expensive she became but, still, her parents gave her everything and more, trying to compensate their absence with whatever that money could buy.<br>\r\nIt was a perfect life for her, even though she didn\u2019t know it at that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she reached sixteen that she made the biggest mistake of her life. During school she fell in love with Joe Korsky, one of the most seeked out guys in her school. The two of them fell almost immediately in love, apparently, even though Joe seemed to receive most of what Larissa had from her parents. Still, she loved him and she believed at his every word. So when her father prohibited her to see Joe again, Larissa did the only thing she could think of.<br>\r\nShe escaped with him into another state, leaving her house, her trinkets and her doting parents behind, following that mad love that had corrupted her.<br>\r\nIt was a few month later she began to understand what a mistake she had done.<br>\r\nAt first, Joe seemed the all loving guy he was at school but, as soon as money began to be an issue, he started to become harsh on her, until he began using her as his own money maker. She still believed to be in love and so did whatever he wanted, she seemed to drink all of his lies, all of his fake tears when he asked her to go meet this or that guy, to give them a private dance, or to keep them company for the night.<br>\r\nShe obeyed always\u2026until she caught him with another girl. <br>\r\nThen all the lies she had said to herself to stay with him crumbled to pieces, leaving her destroyed and alone as Joe eloped away with his new conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa spent the following two years alone, initially hating herself, but then she began to hate all the others around her. As she lived scraping by, memories of her wealthy lifestyle began to haunt her, until she decided to end it there. She couldn\u2019t live like that anymore.<br>\r\nShe had lost everything, all that remained of her family was a little speck of metal around her neck. It was a silvery sliver of metal that her Dad had brought back to her, when she was a child, from one of the many places he had visited while in mission. He had told her it was a fragment of a particularly vicious bomb and that she had to keep it with herself to remember to strike always hard to those who were against her.<br>\r\nAs she stood on the walkway in the small town where she had lived for the last month, some unnamable community in Wyoming, she looked down the bridge and prepared herself to jump for the last time.<br>\r\nBut suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sky seemed to be getting red, much more red than what was used to happen at dawn. As she tried to squint her eyes she screamed, as a huge ball of fire flew right over her head, forcing her to fall backward on the bridge. Scared, Larissa saw the meteorite falling into the vally not far off from where she was. She felt the heat of the explosion when that huge boulder from space hit the flank of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts of jumping down from the bridge were gone. All she could think now was that meteor. She wasn\u2019t stupid, she knew that something falling from space would have, at the very least, caused a minor quake. Instead, she had felt only the heat of the explosion but the ground was stable. Curious about this fact she quickly scanned the area and then left the road to try and track the crash site of what she supposed was a meteor. <br>\r\nShe had to leave all of her meager possession on the side of the road, for the flank of the mountain was too difficult to traverse with something on her back as she didn\u2019t want to fall without knowing what had she seen fall from the sky.  As she moved on the flank of the mountain she knew she was getting near, for she could see the trail of burned down trees around her, and this seemed to renew her energies. Soon enough she was standing at the mouth of what seemed a cave but resembled more a tunnel. As she began walking inside she noticed that the walls surrounding her were very smooth, too smooth to be natural formations. It was then that she realized where she was.<br>\r\nShe was now walking inside the crash site. <br>\r\nThose smooth walls had to be the rock of the mountain melted away from the meteor impacting the ground. She whistled loudly, her sound echoing all around her as she tried to imagine at what temperature that thing had collided against the mountain. In the almost darkness, for the only light was coming from the outside, she almost missed it. She stopped, suddenly, realizing that she was at the end of the tunnel and only in that moment she thought of looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, right below her, there was this huge metallic contraption. <br>\r\n\u2018A Satellite, perhaps?\u2019 she thought as she kneeled to look more closely.<br>\r\nAs she did so, while investigating what seemed to be a face sculpted in the side of that thing, her necklace brushed against the metallic surface and she was suddenly shocked as small lightning\u2019s began to rise from every inch of that thing. She heard a whirring sound and then the thing opened its eyes and looked at her, engulfing her in\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a panic she tried to run away from that cave, thinking that the tunnel was collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The truth was far more worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she scampered toward the exit, a huge metallic, clawed, hand grabbed her by the torso, yanking her back, until she was back in front of those headlights, which, as she looked at them in terror, now were more resembling to a pair of menacing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>From where have you taken the Allspark? Answer me, pathetically low life form</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa could do nothing more than scream as what she thought was a Satellite spoke to her. As she screamed , the seemingly mechanical creature covered the side of its head as it collapsed backwards, releasing the girl from its grip, inadvertently. As the being crashed on the end of the tunnel, Larissa turned around to look at it, now that light seemed to stream from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that it was some kind of huge robot or something, but without any particular signs on its surface. Still crouching away from it, she tried to talk to it, at the very least to not consider herself crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Who are you!? What are you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You miserable low life form. Wait that I manage to restart my legs and you will\u2026what is that? What is that on your neck?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa looked confused, as she grabbed the sliver of strange metal her father had given her so many years before. The same that had given\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment she realized what had turned on that thing. It had to be her necklace, not that she knew how but, it didn\u2019t matter. She had in her hand the key to restore that thing to full power, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as this was the case... She turned to look maliciously to the giant robot who was unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis? You want this? Really? Why don\u2019t you come here and take it youself, if you\u2019re so advanced?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait\u2026I know, why. You\u2019ve got no fuel left, isn\u2019t it? Then guess who\u2019s gonna answer a few question first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an occasion she couldn\u2019t miss. To be the first one to interrogate that robot-thingie and to understand what it wanted from Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Decepticon wasn\u2019t faring very good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten out from the Portal of their ancestral home, awaiting to be acclaimed like the hero he had been during the wars against his traitorous brethren, the Autobots.  Instead he had fell from space on that backwater planet and now was being blackmailed by a low life, carbon based, life form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day couldn\u2019t get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I will kill you as soon as I can, carbon based life form</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that won\u2019t do. Don\u2019t forget I have here the only thing you need to move again\u2026and could easily walk out of here, leaving you in here, trapped maybe for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Decepticon didn\u2019t like the tone that the low life form was using but, it had to admit, he admired the gall and the maliciousness coming from the small creature. It reminded of himself when He had been a new appointed machine, in their ancestral home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You have guts, creature. I like that. Very well then. One question each?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, no how. What are you? And what do you want? Remember, if I don\u2019t like the answer you stay in here for all the eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and before you start with the story of the peaceful aliens, if you are peaceful, then I\u2019m a rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo words yourself carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
