I hope to have his permission to put it in this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Misty, Ash, Brock, and Pikachu were in Professor Oak's lab. Professor Oak had called the four of them to his lab to show them his latest invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So... what is it?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The machine was comprised of two booths connected by a pinkish tube on top and a monitor in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It's a telepod. Would one of you like to demonstrate it?\" Oak asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Brock, Ash, and Pikachu all looked at Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I guess I'll go...\" Misty said. She stepped into the left telepod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Oak pressed a few buttons on the a keypad and both booths started to seal up from the top down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Suddenly, Jigglypuff rolled in through the window and into the second telepod!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Jiggly?\" Jigglypuff said, as the telepod's door closed, sealing it inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The pink tube flashed brightly. When the flash cleared, the monitor read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"DNA COMBINING COMPLETE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The door of the second telepod opened, revealing Misty. Jigglypuff was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Are you okay, Misty?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Of course I am!\" Misty replied, stepping out of the telepod booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, I guess the experiment was a success...\" Oak said. \"You can go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So Misty, Ash, Brock, and Pikachu walked outside.

Jessie, James and Meowth leaped out from behind a tree. \"We saw you twerps trying out old man Oak's new invention.\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n    \"We want to know what it is.\" James replied.<br>\r\n    \"So tell us what you'se were doin'\" Meowth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"We're not telling you bozos anything!\" Ash shouted. Pikachu sparked at his cheeks. Meanwhile, Misty had an uneasy feeling in her stomache...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Why are you so interested?\" Brock said.<br>\r\n    \"One of Oak's inventions might will definitely please our boss.\" James said. \"He'll be so glad, he'll let us retire in Cinnebar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Just think, Lazing by the beach, drinking fruit punch...\"Jesse daydreamed. The uneasy feeling in Misty's stomach turned into a bloated one. Her skin started to turn pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"We don't get nuttin' till we get his invention. So what is it!\" Meowth shouted. He leaped toward Ash. Berore he could, everyone turned their attention to Misty. \"Hey...What's...goin on?\" Meowth said as turned his head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- WSoul's addition<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Misty quickly swelled up until she was completely round.

Her body was pretty much all she could see, but she somewhat managed to make out what was below her. She saw all of Pallet through the clouds. From her height, all the people looked like little Diglettes.<br>\r\n    Her tiny hands rubbed what little of her body they could reach. She still felt like her own skin, albeit stretchy and slightly rubbery. She couldn't see it, but her eyes were encircled by a blue ring like Jigglypuffs. She thought about what she was going to do now that she was a balloon-puff-something. Then, the lights of a familiar town caught her eye...</span></div></div>",

She wanted to visit her sisters, but up until now she was at the mercy of the wind. Misty thought for a minute, then began waving her arms and legs in a swimming motion. Sure enough, her hot air balloon body began it's slow decent toward the gym. The roof was open, but there was no show, so the only ones there were Misty's three sisters; Lily, Daisy and Violet. They were just drying off from a afternoon swim.<br>\r\n    \"Hmm...won't they be surprised when their 'little sister' comes for a visit and rolls over them.\" Misty thought. \"Although, I could just wait until they begin their show tomorrow and really surprise them....puff!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Misty!?\" Violet leapt back. \"You've gotten.. like.. taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yeah, I've changed. Which is more than what I can say for YOU three!\" Misty shook an inflated fist at them. \"You're just as lazy as ever! How dare you call yourselves Gym Leaders!\" She looked down at Lily, who was wriggling her way out from under Misty. \"...You guys need to get in shape.\" Misty grinned evily. \"Here, try a round one!\" She scooped up Lily, and held her in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Misty!! Like, what are you- MMPH!\" Misty forefully blew into Lily's body, as her own started to shrink. Lily's eyes widened as her own body began to expand into a large sphere. Her skin acquired a shine like rubber, though it wasn't pink like a Jiggilypuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally, Misty was back to normal, with her own skin color, though the shine remained. Lily, on the other hand, was now as large as Misty was before. Misty kept her older sister's lips closed by pinching them together with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You know, that look suits you.\" Misty said. \"But I don't think you're ready for so much air. Let's see.\" She let go of Lily's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With an embarrasing 'Braaap'ing noise, Lily's round body flew around the top of the pool, before landing face up on the water, a flattened version of her former self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Guess not.\" Misty shrugged. \"Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

Here she was about to earned her final badge, but Clair, one of the strongest trainers in all of Johto, was going to denied her that chance. Unfortunately for Clair, Alicia wasn\u2019t ready to back down. \u201cYou should really rethink your decision.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair was at her wit\u2019s end. \u201cGet this through your thick head. You are not worthy of this Rising Badge,\u201d She shoved the badge in Alicia\u2019s face before grasping it back in her hand. \u201cAnd just who do you think you are trying to order me around? What makes you think I\u2019ll change my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this,\u201d Alicia smirked as she held a white Pok\u00e9 Ball with the letters \u201cIN\u201d on it. She tossed the ball into the air and from it emerged blue smoke. The smoke enveloped the gym leader who was coughing from the sudden lack of air. As quick as it started, the smoke dissipated seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair inspected her body for any changes. Realizing that nothing happens, she turned her attention back to the smirking trainer. \u201cYou got some nerve. First, you insult me in my own gym and then you tried to gas me out. Forget about getting the badge! Leave this gym and never come bac\u2014mrrrffff!!!\u201d In midst of her tirade, an unexpected rush of air caused her cheeks to puff up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia giggled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the last part. Could you repeat that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing down the air, Clair was about to scold Alicia when her mouth wide open and began sucking in the air. She inhaled with the same ferocity as a vacuum cleaner, consuming the air into her gullet. Her torso expanding rapidly to accommodate the incoming air. Her body morphed into a roundish shape as it absorbed her arms and legs. Eventually, Clair\u2019s suction dwindle to a halt, leaving the inflated gym leader out of breath. \u201cUggh\u2026 I feel winded\u2026 and bloated,\u201d she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia broke into a fit of laughter, unable to contain her amusement. \u201cThat is an understatement. Take a good look of yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair looked down and was horrified with she saw. Her once her trim figure has now changed into a sphere. Only her hands, feet, and head remain unaffected from her inflation. \u201cWhat happened to me?! I\u2019m a\u2026 giant blue ball! How did this happen?!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you ask me, it seems your body swelled up from your pride and arrogance,\u201d Alicia commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence! This is your fault!\u201d shouted Clair, pointing an accusing finger at Alicia. \u201cWhat kind of Pok\u00e9 Ball is that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia answered, \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. This is the Inflate Ball. It\u2019s designed to prevent people from stealing Pok\u00e9mon or Pok\u00e9 Balls. When enough smoke fumes is inhaled, the person begins inflating almost immediately. Of course, the Inflate Ball have other purposes like teaching a certain blue-haired sphere woman a lesson.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutraged by the remark, Clair waddled towards Alicia. \u201cListen here, you\u2019re going to get me back to normal or so help me I\u2019ll\u2014WWHHHOOOOAAAA!!!\u201d Clair took an awkward step forward and immediately crashed to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, such a graceful fall from the gym leader,\u201d Alicia mocked. \u201cOh hey, you dropped the Rising Badge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive that back!\u201d commanded Clair. \u201cYou haven\u2019t earned the right to hold that badge!

He figured if he hurries, he should be able to speak to the trainer that defeated and inflated Clair. \u201cThere it is,\u201d He spotted the building and headed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Would you like to\u2026 Oh, Lance, welcome back. Do you need anything?\u201d Nurse Joy welcomed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes. Has anyone recently come here after challenging the gym?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. However, I do recall seeing someone holding something that resembled a dragon\u2019s face. Alicia was her name I believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know where she is now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she said she wanted to be alone for a while. It might take some time before she \u2026 Oh, wait. Here she comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia asked, \u201cAre my Pok\u00e9mon healed yet, Nurse Joy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll check on them now, Alicia,\u201d Nurse Joy answered. \u201cIn the meantime, Lance would like to speak with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia blinked, \u201cL-Lance? As in Lance, the Pok\u00e9mon Champion? And he wants to talk\u2026 t-to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lance answered. Alicia turned around and jumped when she saw the champion himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Alicia.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s an honor to meet you as well. Sorry if I seem flustered. It just\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking to the champion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right. Do you mind if we chat for a minute?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I-I mean I don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d Alicia corrected herself as the two walked toward a nearby bench. \u201cSo did you want to talk about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour battle with Clair, specifically the aftermath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Alicia muttered dejectedly. \u201cThen you see her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to not notice a giant human sphere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. I just don\u2019t get how someone like her can act so childish. Not handing over the badge is one thing, but to insult and mock me is ridiculous. She infuriated me so much I thought I would teach her a lesson. Thinking about it now, I went too far.\u201d She sighed, slumping her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance placed a hand on Alicia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up. At least you\u2019re willing to admit your mistakes. Besides, if anyone else was in your position, I\u2019m pretty sure they all would\u2019ve done the same thing to Clair. Tell you what, after Nurse Joy returns your Pok\u00e9mon, we go back to the gym and then you can try making amends with Clair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia smiled, \u201cSure, maybe she\u2019ll turn over a new leaf.\u201d</span></div></div>",

What if Clair doesn\u2019t accept my apology?\u201d Alicia asked Lance as they approached the Blackthorn City Gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot. I know she can be a smug and intimidating individual, but she takes great pride in what she does\u2026 sometimes to a fault. If apologizing can helped her see in a new light, then I said go for it.\u201d Lance reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you said so. Okay, here we go,\u201d Alicia opened the door and the two walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, they were greeted by the bloated bluenette. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to you got back, Lance!\u201d yelled Clair. \u201cYou sure took your sweet time getting back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the warm welcome back, Clair. But I didn\u2019t come here alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou brought someone along? Idiot! It\u2019s bad enough you see me like this, and now\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off when she noticed Alicia. Her hands balled into fists and her face contorted into a scowl at the mere sight of the trainer. \u201cThis\u2026 This is who you bring? She\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m in this situation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of what happen between you two, but\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you of all people would take this seriously. Why on earth would you bring this arrogant little nuisance back to my gym?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuisance?!\u201d Alicia blurted. \u201cLook here, you bloated beach ball. I\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair interrupted, \u201cWatch your mouth! Just because I cannot move does not mean I will tolerate your disrespect. After everything that happens, after all the humiliation I suffered at your hands, you think you can come back and gloat in my face? Not like\u2014Mrrph!\u201d Clair\u2019s rant was abruptly broken when her cheeks suddenly swelled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Clair?\u201d Lance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe inflation is wearing off. We better get out of here.\u201d Alicia grabbed Lance\u2019s hand and pulled him to the door. Once they were outside, they stood by a window and observed the ball-shaped bluenette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the gym, Clair was battling against with the air inside her. Her eyes were shut tight as her cheeks turned reddish. She flapped her hands and kicked her feet furiously as the pressure reached its climax. It was a battle she was doomed to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable withstand the pressure any longer, Clair opened her mouth and unleash a torrent of air. The violent windstorm propelled her spherical body backward to the other side of the gym. Her bloated butt made contact with the wall before bouncing off and barreling down another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alicia and Lance watched Clair ricochets around the gym with reckless abandon. \u201cUmm\u2026 shouldn\u2019t we help her?\u201d Lance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia retorted, \u201cBelieve me, I tried that the first time using the Inflate Ball on someone. It didn\u2019t end well for me. Right now, we wait for Clair to finish deflating. It\u2019s our best and safest option.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two resume watching Clair whizzed around the gym. Over time, her once massive body return to its normal shape. Once the last remains of air escaped her mouth, Clair slid across the floor before coming to a stop at the side wall. \u201cUgh, I will never live down this day,\u201d she grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClair!\u201d Lance yelled, running toward his cousin with Alicia following behind. \u201cClair, are you all right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Lance. Although, I would be better if she was not here.\u201d Clair stared at Alicia who glared daggers back at the gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Lance stated, drawing attention from the two females. \u201cLook, it\u2019s oblivious you two don\u2019t like each other. Both of you feel the other has wronged you. I\u2019m not asking you to make up and be friends, but at least try to come to a mutual understanding. The last thing that we all need is for the situation to elevate out of control.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair and Alicia stood in silence, staring at one another as they processed Lance\u2019s statement. Alicia let out a sigh before speaking. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it. That\u2019s why I came here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance smiled at Alicia and then turned to the bluenette. \u201cClair?\u201d The gym leader crosses her arms and looked away. \u201cClair\u2026\u201d  Lance grabbed ahold of Clair\u2019s ear and pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw ow ow ow ow! All right, I\u2019ll apologize. Just let go already. Ow!\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d He complied as he released Clair\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting outside to hear the news. Oh, and Clair, make sure you actually apologize.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair growled at the remark as Lance walked out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I guess I\u2019ll start first,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cClair, I\u2019m sorry for everything I did. You take your role as gym leader very seriously. I was irate with your lack of cooperation and took it out on you. It was wrong to inflate you, and for that, I\u2019m deeply and truly sorry.\u201d </span></div></div>",

After what you did, you have to do a lot better than a simple apology.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia sighed, \u201cOkay, what do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet on your knees and beg for forgiveness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me. I want you to get on your knees and beg for my forgiveness. Come on, get to it.\u201d Clair ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia grumbled as she reluctantly dropped to her knees and started pleading. \u201cOh Clair, can you ever forget me for my actions? I was wrong to treat you so cruelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluenette couldn\u2019t help but savor the moment. \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure. You\u2019re saying the right things, but I don\u2019t think you really mean it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Alicia agreed through gritted teeth. \u201cI was foolish to believe that pitiful attempt would convince you. You are the world\u2019s best dragon master. Someone of your stature deserves far better praise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you finally understand. But instead of giving me compliments, how about you prove your worth by kissing my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?!,\u201d Alicia shouted as she looked at her tormentor. The smug grin on Clair\u2019s face indicated she was serious; she even placed her left foot on Alicia\u2019s lap. \u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m done playing along. Can you apologize already so we can move on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, Fine. As much as I enjoy punishing you, I do have other manners to attend. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 what was your name again? Doesn\u2019t matter, I hope you\u2019ll accept my apology and we can put this situation behind us or something. Now that\u2019s over, you may leave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia wasn\u2019t ready to leave just yet. After giving her sincere apology and then begging like a pleasant, this was her reward? A halfhearted\u2026 No, a piss-poor attempt at an apology from a gym leader with a gigantic ego? Oh no, forget about showing Clair humility. Alicia had something else to show the ungrateful woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you not hear me? I said you may leave now.\u201d Clair reiterated before Alicia grasped her bodysuit and pulled until the two were face-to-face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, my name is Alicia. Secondly, I heard you, but I\u2019m not leaving just yet,\u201d Alicia stated coldly. \u201cYou see, I learn something about you. It doesn\u2019t matter if Lance, myself, or anyone else tries to help you. You won\u2019t change. You\u2019ll still be the same arrogant, unappreciative person you are now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you to said what\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d she tightens her grip and pulled Clair in closer, silencing the bluenette. \u201cBerating and demeaning me is one thing, but giving that poor excuse of an apology, that\u2019s where I draw the line. You need to be taught humility and humbleness, and I know exactly how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair stated coldly, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe me? Okay, it\u2019s your bloated funeral,\u201d Alicia replied as she activated the Inflate Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey been in there for a while now,\u201d Lance mumbled. He stood outside the Blackthorn Gym, waiting for Clair and Alicia to end their dispute. While hoping the two would come to a peaceful agreement, he couldn\u2019t shake off this uneasy feeling of something happening between them. He was considering checking on them when he heard the door open and saw Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Lance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at first, Clair thought she was too dignified to give me a proper apology, so I took it upon myself to teach her a few things about humility.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018teach\u2019?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll have a better understand if you saw Clair yourself. I\u2019m heading at back to the Pok\u00e9mon Center. It was nice meeting you, Lance,\u201d Alicia waved goodbye and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this can\u2019t be good.\u201d Lance sighed as he opened the gym\u2019s door. He saw a sphere-shaped Clair bouncing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLance, help me! That little brat did it again!\u201d Clair shouted before colliding with the oncoming wall face first. \u201cOw! Even after I apologize, she still had the nerve to inflate me. She thought I needed a lesson in humility. How is throwing me around like a ball supposed to teach me humility? Ow! How long are you going to stand there? Hurry up and hel\u2014Ow!\u2014 help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in everything he heard, Lance decided to leave Clair with her problems. Clearly, she learned nothing throughout the entire ordeal. With a sigh, he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLance! Get\u2014Ow!\u2014back here!\u201d She waited for some kind of response from her cousin, but alas, Lance did not return. \u201cGreat, me, a prestigious Gym Leader, turned into a helpless balloon not once, but twice in the same day. Now here I am bouncing around like some humanoid pinball. Why me\u2014Ow! When will this nightmare end?!!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

From losing her Gym battle against Alicia to inflating into a balloon, she suffered a great deal from yesterday alone. She hoped today would bring her less stress. That wasn\u2019t the case when her grandfather visited the Gym to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClair, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fully aware of the growing concern surrounding this Gym,\u201d He reasoned calmly. \u201cEspecially after what transpired the past day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, grandfather, I\u2019m well aware,\u201d replied the frustrated bluenette. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that yesterday\u2019s events were\u2026 out of control, but I assure you, that was an irregularity from the norm. There\u2019s no need to suspend me over something like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClair, we both know that\u2019s a false accusation.

Listen, Clair, I know how committed you are to your duty as Gym Leader. However, if you continue this trend, you\u2019ll tarnish the reputation of not only yourself but the Gym\u2019s reputation as well. Keep that in mind during your time off. For the time being, I\u2019ll be acting as the Gym\u2019s temporary leader.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Grandfather, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClair,\u201d he spoke in a firm but stern manner, causing his granddaughter to flinch. \u201cthis is not negotiable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym filled with silence and uneasiness as the two family members stared down one another. Clair glared at her grandfather, clearly irate with his, in her mind, unjustified decision. He remained firm and decisive, fully committed to his decision. Over time, the bluenette\u2019s patience dwindled until she reached her boiling point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Do as you please!\u201d she snapped. She stormed out the Gym and slammed the door shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandfather sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s probably best for her to sort things out herself.

Dragonair, use ice be\u2014 Ow!!\u201d The bluenette wailed when a speeding Pok\u00e9 Ball nailed her face. Her hands immediately covered her face, muffling her groans. Dragonair, the Rocket Grunts, and their Pok\u00e9mon watched the Pok\u00e9 Ball opened up and enveloped the distressed Clair with a blue gas before it dispersed seconds later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pain subsided, Clair removed her hands from her face, and, with seething rage, pointed an accusing finger. \u201cWho did it?! Which one of you imbeciles did it?! Answer me!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rocket Grunts shook their heads as they were taken aback by Clair\u2019s indignant outburst. Even their Pok\u00e9mon cowered behind them for fear of facing the fuming woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiars!\u201d Clair marched towards the Rocket Grunts. \u201cI should have known you goons would use an underhand tactic. You two realized you couldn\u2019t beat me, so you hurl a Pok\u00e9 Ball at me as an attempt to escape. Well, forget about returning to your gang; I\u2019m personally taking you to jail myse\u2014What so funny?\u201d she noticed the thieves were snickering before they pointed at her lower body. Annoyed, she turned her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\u201d<b r></b>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\nEveryone within Blackthorn City jumped from the bluenette\u2019s blood-curling scream. Those within proximity covered their ears from the shrilled screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy butt! My butt is growing!\u201d Clair watched her rear swelled before her very eyes. Placing her hands behind herself, she gasped as her rear pushed against her hands. Her growing cheeks were quickly approaching bubble butt status, stretching her bodysuit to accommodate its expansive growth. \u201cThis\u2026 this can\u2019t be happening. How is this happening?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, wide load,\u201d taunted the female runt. \u201cWhy not ask the Pok\u00e9 Ball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPok\u00e9 Ball? Wait\u2026\u201d Clair turned around and picked up the Pok\u00e9 Ball, unintentionally displaying her inflating butt at the snickering Rocket Grunts. One look at the white coating and the lettering confirm her suspicion: she\u2019s holding an Inflate Ball. \u201cThis\u2026 this better not belong to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive us back our Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014that\u2026 brat,\u201d Clair gritted her teeth at the familiar voice of Alicia, who just caught up with the Gym Leader and Rocket Grunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive up now, thieves! Between Clair and myself, there\u2019s no chance of\u2026 Um, Clair, your butt\u2019s growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! And it\u2019s your fault! Thanks to your accursed Inflate Ball, I have a behind the size of a Wailmer,\u201d Clair wiggled her inflating rear at Alicia, grimacing at the noticeable bobble her cheeks produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, that was meant for the robbers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, because your aim suggests a different story. I think this is payback for yesterday.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! Look, we shouldn\u2019t be arguing now. We have these robbers to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, like those imbeciles would even think of leaving under my wat\u2014Ack!\u201d Clair shrieked as she felt someone slapped her enlarged butt, sending it into a bouncing fit. She craned her neck around and saw the female Rocket Grunt smiling back at her. \u201cW-what? When did you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard. Your bubble butt makes for a great cover up,\u201d The cheeky Grunt responded with a harder slap, prompting another yelp from the bluenette and more butt wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair\u2019s face burned with embarrassment. Never in her life would she find herself in this situation. She, a prideful, sometimes overconfident Gym Leader, having her now beach ball sized butt cheeks spanked like some bad-mannered child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this is funny? Let\u2019s see how you fare with a massive rear end!\u201d Before Clair could use the Inflate Ball, the male Grunt snatched it out of her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but we\u2019re on a schedule. We\u2019ll take this off your hands, though,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya later, suckers,\u201d The female Grunt bid them farewell, but not before giving Clair\u2019s butt one last slap and then hightailed it with her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away!\u201d shouted an irate and red-faced Clair. \u201cNo one makes a mockery of me and walks away! Come on, Dragonair, we\u2019re going after them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Alicia stepped in front of Clair. \u201cYou won\u2019t catch them in your condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you suggesting I let them go? You saw what they did; my butt was their personal drum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but maybe we should find Officer Jenny first. She could patrol the city and help us have a better chance finding them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A pair of globular orbs bulging prominently from her bodysuit; unfortunately, its growth continues, already passing her hips in width. With a cautious finger, she poked her left cheek and watched it wobble effortlessly. There\u2019s no way Clair can even hope of chasing those goons. She couldn\u2019t run, much least walk, without her inflated butt bouncing and swaying behind her. She would be the laughingstock of the entire city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragonair, return,\u201d she sighed, \u201cFine, we\u2019ll go with your plan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Alicia asked, surprised by the bluenette\u2019s willingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can\u2019t chase them with this\u2026 this blubbery behind, much to the credit of your incompetence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I was sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, finding Officer Jenny is our best bet right now, and I assume your Pok\u00e9mon were stolen, along with your Inflate Ball?\u201d Clair watched the young trainer nod her head. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll help you out but you better keep your stupidity to a minimum. I suffer enough embarrassment to last a lifetime. Now let\u2019s find Officer Jenny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia almost lashed out at the arrogant Gym Leader, but watching Clair clumsily waddled while her butt bounced around was enough consolation. \u201cSure thing, partner,\u201d she said, smacking Clair\u2019s bubble butt. Casting a smirk, she casually walked ahead of the mortified and outraged bluenette who waddled slowly behind her, shouting profanities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull harder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t! Clair, I think you\u2019re too big to fit through the door.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible! Keep pulling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the officers inside the Police Department were perplexed by the commotion at the entrance: Alicia struggling to pull Clair in the building, specifically Clair\u2019s swollen rear. With her cheeks the size of a pair of exercise balls, she has grown too wide for the double doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?!\u201d Alicia shouted. \u201cI keep pulling but you\u2019re not budging. Just admit it, Clair, your butt is too big to make it inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can fit! We need more help,\u201d Clair looked up and spotted the officers, \u201cHey! Do you plan on standing there and watching, or are you going to lend a hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any officer could response, out came an annoyed Officer Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with all that the noise?\u201d she questioned, drawing the attention of everyone else. \u201cWhy is everyone standing around? We have a robbery happening as we\u2026 Clair? What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about me! The robbers, did you find them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, after Nurse Joy contacted me, I sent out a patrol squad but I hadn\u2019t heard from them since. You wouldn\u2019t happen to see them, Clair?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll explain everything once I get inside,\u201d Clair grabbed hold of the walls and tried to pull herself and her oversized butt indoor. \u201cC-come on! I can make inside. I\u2019m not that big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by what she\u2019s witnessing, Officer Jenny gestured toward Alicia. \u201cDid the robbers have something to do with Clair\u2019s\u2026 enlarged figure?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, kinda. It\u2019s a long story. How about we talk outside before Clair wedges herself?\u201d Alicia whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Officer Jenny said before clearing her throat. \u201cOkay, everyone, return to your posts. I\u2019ll be outside talking with these two. The moment anyone hears about the robbers, notify me immediately,\u201d she addressed her officers as they saluted and went back to their stations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter removing Clair from the entrance and saving her from further humiliation, both she and Alicia explained their story to Officer Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam Rocket? I thought they disbanded when their leader was defeated. Great, this is direr than I thought,\u201d Officer Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Clair asked. \u201cIf those goons are anything to laugh at, then the rest of them shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Clair. Team Rocket steals Pok\u00e9mon for a living. They could care less about their well-being. We have to find them before they sell off the Pok\u00e9mon or worse\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse\u2026\u201d Alicia muttered fearfully. She couldn\u2019t bear thinking about Team Rocket bringing any harm or injury to the stolen Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cNO!\u201d she shouted, \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen. Those Pok\u00e9mon need our help; not just mine, but all the trainers worried for their Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the distressed young trainer voiced her concerns, Officer Jenny comforted Alicia. \u201cI give you my word: I won\u2019t stop until every trainer is reunited with their beloved Pok\u00e9mon. We will get them back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we will, you have me,\u201d Clair snobbishly stated. \u201cI may have let those goons escape, but I\u2019m not someone that repeat mistakes. I\u2019ll personally make them regret ever coming to my city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClair, unless you\u2019re planning on sitting on the thieves, they\u2019ll be too busy laughing at your giant butt to take you seriously,\u201d Alicia joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Clair growled and scowled at Alicia. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m like this is due to your careless intrusion, you brat!\u201d she spat as she stomps her foot, triggering a series of bounces from her rotund rear. \u201cI had those fools cowering before me and then you show up, causing me nothing but irritation. You do understand how infuriating is being with someone that has no sense of decency?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m staring right at her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus began the slinging of verbal attacks between the two trainers. They heavily expressed their disdain towards one another via insults, sarcastic remarks, and slandering. The more time they spent shouting, the more vicious and heated their comments became. Before their trash-talking had any chance to turn physical, Officer Jenny in stepped in and reprimanded the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough from both of you!\u201d she scolded. \u201cI don\u2019t know what history you two have but I need you to put that aside. Focus on finding and rescuing the stolen Pok\u00e9mon, understand?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair and Alicia glared at one another for a few more seconds before they turned away and folded their arms. \u201cFine,\u201d they begrudgingly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Jenny didn\u2019t take kindly to the half-hearted response. Approaching the trainers, she grasped their ears and yanked mightily. \u201cI said, <b>understand</b>?\u201d she asked again with more assertiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwowowow! Okay, okay, we get it! Ow!\u201d shouted Clair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, the situation is more\u2014Ow!\u2014 important than us. P-please let go. Ow!\u201d Alicia pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you two promised to stop fighting?\u201d Officer Jenny asked with another pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Yes, we promise! Just let go!\u201d They both answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Officer Jenny released her grip as Clair and Alicia nursed their sore ears. \u201cGlad we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Jenny!\u201d Out came a fellow officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve received word from the patrol unit. They spotted the criminals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d </span></div></div>",

The young red haired girl, know as the gym\u2019s leader Flannery, had had to deal with several matches today, mainly from beginners thinking they\u2019d get a cheap badge because she was new at this.  \u201cGeez, I need a break.\u201d she groaned kicking a pebble.  \u201cHey Ref, close the place down for a little while.\u201d she shouted throwing the keys over to the man standing at the side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with so many people thinking a young girl like me can\u2019t be a strong gym leader?\u201d she complained looking up at the sky as she walked.

Oh, I have to see this.\u201d she thought following the directions the board gave, failing to notice there was something \u201cunique\u201d about this one.  After a few minutes she caught a good view of the said hot springs, making her jaw drop. \u201cWow, these are huge!\u201d she shouted dashing inside.

The former sauna laid in tatters on the ground, and in the center lies a spherical towel-clad Flannery. \u201cOh dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I can explain!\u201d Flannery blurted hastily. \u201cUm\u2026 Well\u2026 You see\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were inflated by the sauna but broke it due to your size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I mean yes\u2026 Wait, how did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not the first person to try out the sweller saunas; these are still relatively new, so there are some kinks to work out,\u201d the employee explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlannery blinked, \u201cSweller saunas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe name isn\u2019t that great, but it does get the point across,\u201d the employee bashfully admitted. \u201cThink of it as a stress reliever; your body expands with pent-up stress before it seeps out into the air, leaving you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. And judging from your size looks like you had a tense day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah\u2026 you can say something like that,\u201d Flannery muttered. \u201cSo what happens now? I mean the sauna is destroyed so\u2026 hold on, do you hear that?\u201d Her ears caught wind of a hissing noise emitted throughout the room. \u201cI hear something hissing and why do I feel so\u2026 relaxed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019re deflating; the steam inside you is trickling out,\u201d stated the employee as she watched the ball-shaped redhead slowly returned to her normal shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026 great,\u201d Flannery blissfully replied, partially aware of her situation. She was too preoccupied with enjoying the sensations to fully comprehend her predicament. It was like all her problems and stress from today practically disappear, allowing her a peace of mind and immerse herself in the moment. \u201cYou are right. This really is soothing,\u201d she chirped. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this sooner? This is just what I needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you agree, unfortunately, your time is up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Flannery looked down and saw her body was back to its normal size. While disappointed her relaxation ended as soon as it started, she realized she would rather be her regular shape than be an oversized balloon. \u201cWell, it was nice while it lasted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be over. We offer other services besides the saunas. You\u2019re welcome to try them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Like I said earlier, they still need tweaking and just like you, previous customers have been in that situation. There\u2019s no need to feel down,\u201d the employee comforted. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re a Gym Leader; with such a rigorous job, you deserved some rest and relaxation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly convinced, Flannery pondered for a moment. Between looking after her gym, accepting challenges from trainers, and caring for her Pok\u00e9mon, she hardly had any time to relax. That and a part of her was hoping for another chance to be inflated. As embarrassing as it sounds, she did enjoy expanding into a balloon. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have anything else plan for today. Eh, why not? I\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee clapped her hands together. \u201cExcellent!\u201d she cheered. \u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed.

Just one question; Do either of them cause me to\u2026 well, you know?\u201d Red in the cheeks, Flannery puffed her cheeks and stretched her arms as wide as possible to hint at her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is someone taking a liking for inflation?

The jigglypuff seems fine, except she has pastel green hair that has a light pink tone to it. Her hair is in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. And, oddly enough, speaks. \"How could this have happened to me...I was never a bad girl...\" she says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing about this Jigglypuff is that she wansn't always one. Before she somehow became a Jigglypuff, she was just your typical Pokemon trainer. Her name was Yamiko, and she happened to have a thing for, not suprisingly, Jigglypuffs. She only had six Pokemon, and they were all Jigglypuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was before she was transformed into Jigglypuff. To make matters worse, she was extremely weak from the transformation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a male Jigglypuff hops over to her. \"Jig, jig, jigglypuff.(Hi there, Cutie.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko blinks. \"Uhm, hello. Why can I understand what you say?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jigglypuff raises an eyebrow, then chuckles. \"Jiggly jigglypuff? Jig jigglypuff, jigglypuff jig jigglypuff. (What did you just say? I can't understand Human, so I don't know what you said.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko sweatdrops. [Oh, that's right.] she thinks. \"Jig...jig jiggly Jigglypuff, jig jiggly jiggly. (I...am not a Jigglypuff, I used to be human.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male smiles. \"Jigglypuff. Jig jiggly jigglypuff. Jig jig jiggly jigglypuff. (Fooled ya. I understand human just fine. But I don't believe you are human.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(from now on, assume the Jigglypuff is speaking jigglypuff, while Yamiko is speaking english.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko rubs the back of her head. \"I guess it is hard to believe. Besides, I'm a Jigglypuff now, so it doesn't matter.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male grins. \"Exactly.\" He waddles over to Yamiko and lips locks her. \"Mating ritual.\" he says in a muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mating...what do you- wait, you don't mea-\" she says, muffled. She's interrupted when the male starts blowing her up with his breath. Since she's a Jigglypuff, Yamiko can't really do much besides grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes of breathing, Yamiko has been inflated to about ten feet. Suddenly, they hear footsteps. The male stops breathing into her. \"Sorry, hon. I think you're incredibly cute and all, but I'm not about so give up my freedom over a girl.\" he says. The Jigglypuff runs for the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[They say chivalry is dead, and guys like that prove it...] she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the person who they heard walked up to her. \"Wow. Either that's a big Jigglypuff, or a Snorlax in disguise. Either way, she's mine.\" he says, as he pulls out a Heavy Ball. \"This should do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the trainer takes a good look at her. \"Wow, that's strange.

He only knew of Pokemon that were extrememly rare, or extremely common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom told me that I should have saved this ball for a special Pokemon, and you're as special as they come.\" he says, innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yamiko can say anything, a Pokeball hits her body. However, it wasn't just a normal Pokeball. It was a ball specially designed to capture extremely massive Pokemon. Naturally, Yamiko was no match for it, as she gets pulled into the ball in a red ray of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next think she knows, Yamiko is once again in front of the boy, but this time, she's in the boy's room. \"Hiya.\" says the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko can't really get a good look at the place, since she can only face forward. \"Huh? Where am...oh wait, I remember now. You trapped me in a Pokeball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gasps. \"Whoa! You can talk?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko moves her body up and down a little. \"Yea. And I also used to be a human.\" she says, somewhat peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, human? I hate to burst your bubble...uhm...not pun intended, but you're a Jigglypuff.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko sighs. \"Let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. What a story. Finding yourself as a Jigglypuff, then getting blown up by the very thing you got turned into. Poor girl.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko smiles. \"Good, I'm glad you believe me...but why did you capture me in the first place?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have this thing for Jigglypuffs, since they are both cute and inflatible.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko giggles. \"Really? Me too!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nods. \"Yea...but now that I know that you used to be human, I feel kinda bad about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko blinks for a moment. \"Hey, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Cory, and your name is?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Yamiko. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory stands at about 4 feet tall, and wears clothes that are fairly plain. His hair is brown, and he has a normal build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, they are walking down a road. Yamiko is normal sized, for a Jigglypuff, anyway. Cory agreed to let Yamiko remain out of her Pokeball if she promised not to run off the first time they got outside. Forturnately for Yamiko, she didn't want to get away from Cory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Cory, you're a pretty nice guy.\" Yamiko says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Hey, how old are you, anyway?\" Cory asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko sighs. \"I'm 12. I've been a Pokemon trainer for 2 years...and a pokemon for 2 days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, anyway?\" Cory asks.</span></div></div>",

It feels like I'm a ball of air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory nods. \"So, how did it feel to be inflated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko thinks back to when the Jigglypuff blew her up.

Odd, but nice.\" Yamiko says. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory chuckles. \"Well, you remember when I said I like Jigglypuffs because they're both cute and inflateable?\" he says as he digs through is pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko chuckles. \"Oh, I get it.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory pulls out a normal air tank. \"How big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko thinks back to when she was around 15 feet wide.

Yamiko grins as she quickly grows large. Within a minute, she has grown to ten feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around 17 feet, Yamiko's little stubs of feet and hands sink into her, making her look like a completely round ball. After 2 minutes, the tank is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory looks at Yamiko. \"Wow. You're a ball, Yamiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko smiles. \"Yeah. Ohh...it feels great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory smiles. \"Well, I'm glad your happy. So, what now?\"</span></div></div>",

You want me to be like you are right now?\" Cory asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. \"You are happy when I'm happy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory smiles. \"That's right. I get you. I like the idea myself. It's just out of the blue, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory pulls out another tank and sticks the hose into his belly button. \"Ok, here's to you, Yamiko.\" he says, as he turns the dial on the tank. He looks down as his body quickly begins to round out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive mintues pass, and at this point, Cory looks like a gaint ball with hands, feet, and hands. But within seconds, thoes parts of his body sink into his flesh, making him look like nothing more than a giant, clothed, flesh colored ball. At this point, he's 10 feet wide, but he continues to grow until he is as big as Yamiko. That's when the tank is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes seem to stretch really well on his body. The only place where his flesh shows is where his limbs, hands, feet, and head used to be. Cory manages to tilt his body until his face meets up with Yamiko's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko giggles. \"So, how do you like it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, but nice.\" Cory says. \"However, we can do this longer some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko sighs. \"Ok. But why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory smiles. \"I live with my 14 year old sister. And I want to introduce you to her.\" Cory explains, as he deflates himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko is deflating herself as well. \"But won't you get you into trouble when she sees me?\" she asks, as she fully deflates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory chuckles. \"Hardly. My sister probably likes inflation more than I do.\" he explains, as he stops inflating at five feet round. \"Oh. I'm stuck. Wanna help me get rid of the rest of this air, Yamiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[He's probably not stuck. He probably wants to fill me with the remaining air. But since he's so sweet and all, that's fine by me. Besides, I like being inflated.] Yamiko thinks. She nods, walks up to Cory, and hops on him. Yamiko puts her lips on Cory's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory breathes into Yamiko, causing her to fill up while Cory empties. Soon, Cory is normal sized, and Yamiko is a 4 foot round ball with feet and hands. \"Ahh...that never gets old.\" she says. \"Anyway, is there anything you want to do before you introduce me to your sister?\"</span></div></div>",

What about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a female, and neither of us have a name. Not that we need names. After all, it's not too common to find Pokemon who are always inflated, except for you guys, of course.\" the Vulpix explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee speaks up. \"I'm a female too, suprisingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko grins. \"You two said you are always inflated...why?\" Yamiko asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee smiles. \"We wouldn't have it any other way. We love this, right, Vulpi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix nods. \"Yea. It's big fun, literally.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko smiles. \"Ok, my last question for now. Do you two want to inflate in any special way?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to be a hot air balloon.\" Vulpix says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee smiles. \"Yea, that's what I want too...well, actually, that would require me to evolve into a Flareon. What I really want to do is get really big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. Vuplix clears her throat. \"Oh, and since you're gonna be telling this stuff to Cory, tell him that we wanna try that round thing you two did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How did you know?\" Yamiko asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After about 30 minutes of being in the Pokeball, it switches to a one way window mode. We can see out, but you can't see in.\" the Eevee explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. \"Ohh. I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns to Cory. \"Ok, I've talked to them. Vulpix want's to be a hot air balloon, and Eevee wants to be huge.

The gym leader, Whitney, was looking for someone who specialized in normal type Pokemon. Since she had nothing but 6 Jigglypuffs, she thought she was sure to make the cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she was about to enter the gym, when a man walked up to her. \"Hello, are you here about the job offer?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. \"Why yes sir, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins. \"I thought so, little girl. Let me tell you a story.\" his kind tone suddenly turns mean. \"I am a member of Team Rocket, however, because of their cutbacks due to the dissappearance of our leader, there were cut backs. And I got cut back. So I'm a little disgruntled.\" he explains. \"Match! Here! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko smiles. \"Ok...\" she throws out a Pokeball.<br>\r\nOne of her Jigglypuffs pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Ok then, this should be easy.\" The man says. He tosses his Pokeball out, and a Miltank pops out. \"How about a little wager. This one Pokemon can beat all your Pokemon. Win, and I'll drop out of the race, so to speak. Lose, and you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Yamiko says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He made his Miltank use Rollout on all of my Jigglypuffs. The first one I called out only stood up to two hits. The others were beaten before they could even attack. My price was to not apply for the job. That was what I aggred to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!? You call yourself a Pokemon trainer...well, I said if I won, you would have to forget about the job, and I'm gonna make sure you keep that promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna...\" she gulps. \"...kill me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins. \"No. That would be rash...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pulled out a strange gem, then pointed it at me. After that, he never said another word to me. The gem shot a beam at me, and before I knew it, I was a Jigglypuff. And then he had the nerve to run of with my Pokemon.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory sits just sits there. \"Wow...but arn't people looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. \"Local girl kidnapped by possible member of defunct criminal organization.\" she says, imitating a newpaper headline. \"I'm the 'local girl' in that sentence. And they are looking for a human, not a Jigglypuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me guess, you are trying to return home, right?\" Cory says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko nods. \"I'm been walking from Goldenrod City since. I lived in Violet City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory smiles. \"You're in luck. I live in Azalea Town.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamiko grins. \"Cool. That's not to far. So, are we going there, or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You don't want your parents to worry about you, do you?\" Cory says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two turned back and headed to their destination.</span></div></div>",

As you may probably know, there has been a rash of attacks on the Gym Leaders of both the Kanto and the Johto reigons.\" the male says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it appears that in every gym in the Kanto Reigon and half here in Johto has had the gym leaders and assistants turned into Pokemon.\" The female says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male has a piece of paper handed to him. \"This just in, we have live coverage from a large amount of gyms in both reigons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral live accounts from the Gym leaders of various gyms. However, after a few of these live reports, the transmission turns to static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chair appears when the static clears. A minute passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...your morons! Turn the chair!\" he yells, as two people walk up to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry boss.\" says the male, who's head is just above the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" a female says, who's head is also hidden off camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female turns the chair, to reveal a Persian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...go away now!\" the Persian yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey do. \"Ahem! Anyway, you might not recongise me, but I was the once great leader of the Virdian City gym, and leader of Team Rocket, Geovanni. As you may have known, I was found out, and I disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure snarls. \"Anyway, I don't know how I became like this, but now I am exacting my revenge. As you may know, a mysterious man has been walking from gym to gym, turning the occupants into Pokemon.

For safety reasons, Duplica never ordered Ditto to transform for either an Onix or a Golem impression. To do the impressions, Duplica started used specially made costumes which she would inflate with helium so that she could move about freely. The three tanks Duplica had, two were to be used as backups while one was being refilled, were stored in a closet near the costumes and the other gray clothing she used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the closet, Duplica opened up the door and pulled out a bright red tank and a hose. Connecting one end of the hose to the tank and putting the other end in her mouth, Duplica almost turned the valve when she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'According to the mail this morning, the company I bought the tanks from said one of them had a bad valve.' Duplica thought. 'The problem was that a few valves they made recently vented gas at full blast.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the valve, Duplica didn't think it was a bad one. She had the tanks for two weeks now, and a letter from the company suggested a recently found malfunction. She probably got a letter because the company defined recent by anything that happened in a month. Duplica, cautious nevertheless, turned the valve on.</span></div></div>",

'Woah, what happened to her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Joey accidently bumped into Duplica's helium tank, but caught it before it could fall. After tracing the hose from the tank to Duplica's chest, an idea crept into the Joey's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk formed. 'I know I shouldn't, but I will anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up to the valve, Joey turned it counterclockwise. Nothing happened, so he tried clockwise, and was rewarded with a hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that one either.\" Duplica muttered. \"There doesn't seem to be anyone good today.

She was halfway to the tank when the boy opened the valve up to full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica halted when the flow of gas increased. It was an experience almost unlike anything she felt before.

On the cartoon, a girl stuffed a hose into her mouth a certain way, and it caused her head to inflate like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I know it was just a cartoon, but then again, I didn't know I could inflate like I did earlier.] she thinks. [What the heck? It sounds fun to me.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica walks back to her house and gets a helium tank, and puts the hose into her mouth. After fooling around with it for a few moments, she manages to get it in the possition she wants it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Here goes nothing.] she thinks, as she turns the dial. Since her head is smaller than the rest of her body, it only takes a few moments for it to get completely round. At this point, Duplica's head is about the size of a beach ball, and as round as one as well. She pulls out the hose, and walks up to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Whoa. This is freaky...and yet, it's extremely cool at the same time.] she thinks, then giggles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at the hose.

Officer Jenny was on the case, of course. So, she rode her motorcycle to the balloon factory and entered it.<br>\r\nThe robber had left a note at the police station, saying that he would steal the new air pump at the balloon factory. Why would someone steal an air pump? Jenny didn't knew or cared. It was her job to arrest any robbers.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jenny was grabbed from behind.<br>\r\n\"Well, If it isn't Officer Jenny\" said a gruff voice.<br>\r\nJenny struggled to free herself, but it was no use. She couldn't even throw her pokeball to release her Growithe.<br>\r\n\"Let's go see that new air pump\" said the robber, who forced Jenny to walk to the largest air pump she had ever saw. The man forced a tube into Jenny's mouth and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Crayon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny started to here a hissing sound. She looked down and realized that she was starting to get larger. Before long it quickened and she started to bigger and bigger until she was about the size of a small compact car. Then she was startled to see that she was floating because of the amount of air entering her body. Higher and higher she floated until she hit the ceiling. Bigger and bigger she got until she started to turn a bit round. More air flowing into her every second making her bigger and rounder until her belt snapped from the strain. This caused the inflation to quicken until finally she was as big as a small house. After a while the robber came back and stated that it was going a bit too slow. He commensed in turning up the tank.</span></div></div>",
