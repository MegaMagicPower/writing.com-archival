A large wooden shelf exends from the side of the shack, onto which Glenn throws the sack of fish. The door is opened long enough for Glenn to drag out a large tub and a couple of knives.  He shows you how to de-scale and clean a fish out. Then, he pats each down with some 'curing spice' from the tub and throws it on a rack. By the time you've prepared seven fish, Glenn has finished off the remaining fourty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you a fisherman, or does everyone you know clean a fish like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of the few. The rest of us fishers are scattered around the shore. My strip starts fifty yards to the right and goes out to the left as far as I want it to. The Oxys are all over the place, but they help us fishers out by fighting off some of the larger critters out there.\" Glenn hoists the rack into the smoker and rests a finished rack on the shelf you were just using. He helps himself to some and offers it to you as well. Naturally, its perfectly smoked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your gaze to the lapping ocean and you realize just how foreign it all looks. \"Where are we?\" you think to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alcrux. Its an all-bunny town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not in Kansas anymore,\" you quietly muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kansas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of Kansas?\" A simple shake of the head and a look of bewilderment are all the answers you need. \"It's right in the middle of America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the ocean didn't look <i>that</i> foreign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's back where I'm from, which is apparently a long ways away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there must be some way to get back there. I assume you want to get back home sooner or later, right?\" </span></div></div>",

That bunny's a few fish short of an ocean, but he has a lot of experience with that crazy kind of stuff. Probably why he's so nuts now. Let me just pack up this fish and we can head into town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn diligently packs up the rack of fish into a pair of wicker baskets, which he slings over his shoulders. \"Come on, now\" he becons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path uphill from the beach is steep. This beach is much wider than the thin strip you traveled up to reach Glenn's house in the first place. You keep loosing your footholds and sliding back in the sand.

People from all over would come to stay the weekend, and there was always a bunch of tickling going on. Gauss and I used to save up and go there every couple of months for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother. I was up there trying to bail him out of there, but they captured me instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. What happened to the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know. Most of the people think that Bing went rotten, but I don't buy it. He was a nice enough guy; even tickled eachother once or twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that he left in the middle of a power struggle when someone tried to make a real business out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Glenn\" says a brown hare from under his straw hat. His shady stand faces away from the beach and apparently sells nothing but foodstuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pan\" groans Glenn as he heaves the baskets onto the counter. \"How's life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old, same old. Who's the blue guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friend of mine,\" responds Glenn casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, chief.\" Pan rummages under the counter to find a small pouch, presumably full of coin, which he throws to Glenn. \"Take it easy, aiight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" says Glenn, who pockets the pouch and keeps moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the town comes into view. It's mostly a two-story town made entirely of wood with broad alleyways. Everyone in sight is a bunny, and there is no shortage of them. Big fat ones who shake with laughter, little grey ones who trip over eachother playing games in the street, and spindly brown ones peddling their wares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go talk to Plazo?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You find it easiest to walk in his wake. You almost walk into him when he slows down to talk with someone. He speeds back up and suddenly turns into an alleyway. The slowdown has stuck you behind several bunnnies and you are afraid you'll lose him. So, you turn sideways and try to wiggle your way through the crowd. Nearly falling into the alleyway, you are relieved to see that Glenn has waited for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hop on\" he sighs and lowers a shoulder. Instead of sitting on his shoulder, you sling a leg over so that you are straddling his neck with his ears going over your legs. When he stands up, you can feel his ears pushing down on your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strong are those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ears. I mean, are they strong enough to use as another pair of arms or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're almost as strong as my real arms. I just never use them because they're so much harder to control. Just imagine moving your arms if they had no bones.\" Not being too fond of the idea, you drop the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after taking several more shortcuts through the swarming crowd, you reach a calm bubble surrounding a dilapidated shack. It is questionable if the sign ever was legible, although it certainly is not currently. An angry crow perches on the sign, screaming at you in the only voice it can. The weight of the shack had slouched against another, sturdier building, and you are cautious to enter the building in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you don't affend him. He's a scary looking guy, that's for sure, but he is the chief's brother. In fact, the chief is usually the only one who takes him seriously. When in doubt, just agree with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you choke out, although the lump in your throat brings it down to a whisper.</span></div></div>",

You follow him into the ancient shack. The light quickly dwindles; only the whispy, pale block of light behind you remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glen? The shit you do'n here?\" A growl of a voice smacks you upside the head before you can see a thing. \"An who else is with you thur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn moves out of the way to reveal what appears to be a saloon. A musty bar stands in front of you, as well as countless destroyed chairs. Flames float in the air without any rhyme or reason. Above the bar hangs an enormous and ornate dreamcatcher, devoid of any apparent dust or cobwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friend of mine. We came here because he\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to be a human, right? There's too much junk in his mind for him to be anything else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed by the offhand comment, you totally ignore the included insult. \"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight you were! Hop up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the bar and hoist yourself onto one of the few remaining stools. Behind the counter stands a ghastly figure. What used to be a snow-white rabbit has decayed into a grey, shedding figure. His eyes are glazed over: he's probably blind. All sorts of talismans hang from the ancient creature. His short, grizzly ears still bother to stick straight up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Plazzo, kid. You want som'm drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nice to meet you, sir.\" Eyeing the dusty bottles behind him, you decide to forgo the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit it is! You would'n be here if you didn'n have a problem, so I know its not 'nice to meet me'. And your havin a damn drink, kiddo. Pick yer poison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, you try to get on Plazzo's good side. \"Surprise me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you don' know whats-a goin on right about know. All fuzzy in the head, ya know? You got a pair right now, Glenn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst, old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An I will!\" The grizzled rabbit whips out a pair of highball glasses from under the counter and a pair of amber bottles from behind him. He uncorks each with his thumb and sloshes them over the top of both glasses. \"This shi'll make ya see stars. Bottoms up, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your glass by the edges and sip precariously. It hits you like a punch in the face. In the middle of your drinking, Plazo begins to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, watcha itchin to do first, gettin outta that digi-body or gettin the hell out of Alcrux?\"</span></div></div>",
