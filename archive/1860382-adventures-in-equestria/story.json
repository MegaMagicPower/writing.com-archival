One thing different from other teenagers is that you secretly liked My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. You don't really know what got you hooked on that girls show but you couldn't care less. It was entertaining for you to watch and it was well worth wasting your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while you were busy looking through your spam folder in your email, you come across a suspicious looking email that stood out to all your other ones. The subject line just read 'My Little Pony Lost Episode'. Being the curious teenager that you were, you double-clicked on the email only to be stopped by a warning asking you if you want to download a file. You nervously click the \u2018yes\u2019 button and wait for the download finish. The format was in mp4 format so you\u2019re guessing that it\u2019s legit. After some time, the video automatically opens in full screen and begins to play. You anxiously watch your computer monitor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few seconds of the video were blank before suddenly a picture of a smiling Twilight Sparkle appeared seemingly looking straight at the camera. It didn\u2019t creep you out yet as Twilight wasn\u2019t wearing a creepy smile but a perfectly natural smile that you\u2019ve seen her do in several episodes. Twilight just stood there for several seconds until her mouth moved to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden disturbance of silence slightly surprises you but you soon get over it. You\u2019re not sure if she\u2019s talking to you or something so you decide to speak back to the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am!\u201d came a reply, \u201cI\u2019m just here to test a teleportation spell and I decided to use it on you. You would want to try it?\u201d Twilight said with a forced smile hoping you would want to volunteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d you reply not really sure if it would actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Twilight replies, \u201cNow all you have to do is stay still for a few seconds an-.\u201d You don\u2019t get hear the remaining part of sentence as you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain consiousness and find yourself in a deep forest. You have a slight idea where you are but you don't know where Ponyville is. All you want to do now is get back to Twilight and say that the spell worked. Only problem is that you're lost.</span></div></div>",

I mean, liking a princess is pretty cool, don't get me wrong, but I like her for who she is, not for what she is.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's really thoughtful of you. I'm sure Celestia would love to hear you say that.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and blushed at that comment.

I trust ya. Fire in the holl!\" Applejack said before fire Pinkie out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was shooting straight at them and she flips to do a strong pony kick at them.

You know that they wanted to help you, but something inside of you is telling you that you need to do this fight on your own. You throw your attacks at the changling queen while dodging hers. The fight goes on before Chrysalis rams you down into a hole underground with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(your name here)!\" Twilight said as she and the others followed you below ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up after the fall as you are covered in cuts and blood as battle scars while Chrysalis gets up too. You're breathing in and out heavily as you go to make another attack. Chrysalis dodged your punch and uses her magic to knock you back down onto the ground. You barely got back up on your feet to show that you won't go down like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, Human. Your resilience is quite astounding, but I'm afraid that this is the end for you.\" Chrysalis said before hitting you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, Celestia, and the others got down below and was shocked and horrified that you're getting hurt so badly. Celestia was scared the most that your about to be destroyed be the evil queen. You keep on showing your never-ending desire to survive, but it looks like things are still going bad as you feel your life being drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how you keep on fighting me like this. Perhaps, it's the strong love you have inside you. Question is, for who? I believe that it is Princess Celestia. Am I right?\" Chrysalis wondered evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was shocked to hear that from her. Is it true that you have deep feelings for the princess of the sun? You looked at the mares as Chrysalis gave you another beating. The mares can't take it anymore as they charged in to help you, but Chrysalis created a barrier to prevent that from happening. They just stand there and watched you get annihilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that is quite understandable. I mean, who can't take their eyes off of a princess like her, anyway?\" Chrysalis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that supposed to mean?\" You asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that you only want to be with her because she's only a princess and it would mean that you'll have a highest honor for yourself. It is a fact that you cannot deny.\" Chrysalis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mane 6 and Celestia begins to burn with the same question. Do you really only like her because of her status? Well, all except for Twilight. You chuckled at her opinion and you're about have get second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because she's only a princess? Then you must be the world's dumbest queen ever.\" You said with a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Chrysalis said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia, Twilight, and the others were surprised at what you just said to her. You slowly sit back up to look at Chrysalis in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that's the only reason, then you're wrong. That's not the reason at all. I mean, sure, her being one is cool and awesome, but the true reason I like her is not because of her status. It's because of \"who\" she really is. To me, she's the most caring, kind-hearted, and loyal alicorn I had ever met. She watches over the ponies and unicorns day in and day out with a smile and she always take care of her subjects. She has the makings of a true princess, friend and, most of all, a member of a family. That family is right next to her right now.\" You turned to see Twilight and her friends with a touched Celestia. \"She admires those mares as if they're her little sisters and won't let anything happen to them. The same goes for me. She's been a real friend to me ever since I arrived here. That's what I admire her the most. The good heart she has inside of her and I will not let her down no matter what.\" You said with love and defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was so touched by your words that she ended up crying up tears and Twilight smiled lightly at your motivation to not let Celestia get hurt. You willed your way back on your feet and Chrysalis was standing in awe at your act of resiliency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, hear this. As long as I have blood flowing through my body, I will not give up on them. You here me, Chrysalis? I will never quit!\" You said with bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when something strange happened. Back at Ponyville, the container that holds the Elements of Harmony begins to light up and their powers shoots out towards where you are. It reached you and you feel their power surging in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay?\" Rainbow Dash gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in tarnation?\" Apple jack gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight? Isn't that?\" Rarity wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. The Elements of Harmony! But, how is this possible?\" Twilight wondered in disbelief of what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Celestia wondered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gain power from the elements, your wounds begin to heal and your right arm gets a sun logo like Celestia's, only it shines with gold. You then begin to burn with flames and you start to grow wings of fire on your back and then gain a white robe with gold linings around it. You opened your eyes to reveal a shining yellow on your pupils and you appeared to be flying while Chrysalis was watching your transformation feeling something she'd never thought she would feel, pure fear. You spread your new wings very wide and the mares were in awe and shock at your new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of trickery is this?!\" Chrysalis asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trickery. It's the real deal. Time for you to meet your fate.\" You declared as you grew a flaming sword in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis goes in for a huge attack and you blocked it with ease. She was petrified at you power as you swung your sword to send flaming waves at her. It hits her and was sent back hard. The mane 6 and Celestia was gapping in awe at the new gained power you acquired as you fly down in front of Chrysalis with you arm and hand sticking out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feed off of love to gain powerful yourself. Well, guess what? Love hurts and so is this.\" You said as you created a giant fire blast at her and Chrysalis was sent flying out of her castle while screaming. You stand triumphant before you passed out and you returned back to normal when the flames disappeared. The mares go over to you and Celestia uses her magic to get you on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going now, girls. He needs some rest.\" Twilight suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mares nodded and they start walking back to the castle with your unconscious body. Celestia was inspired by the power you gained to defeat Chrysalis. However, she was also feeling touched in her heart hen you revealed your love for her. One thing's for sure, there's a lot to discuss when you wake up.</span></div></div>",

Then Twighlight was able to finally do her experiments but was not able to find any leads as to why all that stuff happened. After about 50 tries she finally gave up but when she gave up I told her to not worry that I believe that whatever happened before will maybe happen again. But on a much brighter note Celestia and I were having the BEST TIME OF OUR LIVES!!!! \"Oh Celestia I'm so glad that I met you. You are THE greatest Pony I ever met in my life.\" \"I so agree (Insert name here) the time from when I met you to here (besides for being Pony-napped) were the best days of my life.

Will you marry me?\" Celestia was about as red as a ripe Strawberry but then she jumped up and gave me a (Bear) hug. \"YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!! Of course I will (Insert name here).\" Then after that we told Twighlight and her friends. They were all so suprised but we told them that the wedding will be in Canterlot.</span></div></div>",

This is all my fault. If only I would just returned his feelings for me.

You better hope you know what you're doing.\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike. I know the real you is in there somewhere. If you can here me in there, I want to say that I'm sorry for breaking your poor heart. I just thought that it would be impossible for us being together for you're a dragon and I'm a unicorn, but I now realized that I was wrong and selfish about that. You were always there for me when I needed you the most and you always helped me with the things that I have trouble with. I was very grateful that you did everything for me, but I was also ignoring your feelings for me and I should've thought about it sooner. I now see that I need you in my life more than ever. So, please. Come back to me, Spike. I LOVE YOU SPIKE!\" Rarity said with tears coming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all touched to hear Rarity's speech to Spike. However, Spike goes in for another attack on her and you all got more scared now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is it.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity hold her eyes shut to wait for the pain. When she opened her eyes, she sees that Spike is calming down and he's shrinking down back to his normal size in an unconscious state.

Five more seconds and we all would've been goners.\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Twilight go up to Rarity and was smiling at her bravery for Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job, Rarity.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. You're a hero and Spike will be happy to see you once he wakes up.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the mane 6 take Spike back home and he wakes up to see Rarity smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity? Is that you?\" Spike asked holding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spikey-Wikey! I'm so glad to see you back to normal.\" Rarity said happily while hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I went on a rampage! Oh no! Did I hurt you?!\" Spike asked in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm fine and so is everypony else.\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Rarity. I let my emotions get the best of me. I'm a terrible friend.\" Spike said with disappointment in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't your fault, Spike. I'm the one that pushed you to become that monster in the first place. But I promise that it won't happen again.\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad to see you all okay.\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Oh! And spike?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rarity?\" Spike answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity then kissed Spike on the lips and he was shocked while blushing to see that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Hearts and Hooves Day.\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was happy to feel his first kiss from Rarity snd they both go to see you and the rest of the mane 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you back to normal, Spike.\" Twilight said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to be back.\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you and Rarity have some \"things\" to do.\" You said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike and Rarity blushed at each other before going to have their first date together. You were happy for them and you see that love does conquer all, even for those who are different creatures from each other.

And just when Luna was giving up Twilight had a plan that WILL make them scream. \"Twilight I am not sure that this will work.\" \"Don't worry princess I'm SURE this will work.\" \"Trust her. Her plans NEVER fail.\" So as Zecora brought some foals and filly's they dropped some candies and then a creepy wind blew around them. And Luna (dressed like Nightmare Moon) told them that their offering has been so generous that she would eat the CANDY instead of the children. AS Luna was asking Twilight why this would've worked Pipsqueak came by. \"Um Princess Luna? I was just wondering could you do the same thing next year.\" \"Child dost thou liketh to be scared?\" Pipsqueak agreed and Luna said she would do it every year.

You blinked and turned your head to see that you was falling out of the sky passing by clouds quickly. \"What? Where am I? Why am I falling out the sky?\" You shouted as you was screaming from fear. Looking around you was able to take yourself in and saw that you was a young Pegasus filly and tried to figure out how to get those little wings of yours to start flapping. No matter how hard you was trying you was getting no where and screamed out in fear of death for help, not really thinking on there be anyone to save you for you are in the sky and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on little buddy!\" You just made out over your screaming as you passed a cloud with a rainbow water fall on it. Which if you wasn't falling to your death after being turned into a Pegasus filly you would of questioned how that was possible. Looking above you you was able to make out a blue Pegasus with rainbow colored main and tail flying quickly towards you. Due to watching the show and being secretly a massive fan of Rainbow Dash you knew it was her. You just didn't know how. As she got closer you was crying and trying to flap your wings still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow save me please!\" You called out to her and hearing you she picked up speed as she closed the gap and caught you and pulled up with only three feet of clearance between the two of you and the ground. She held you close as you snuggled into her holding on to her the best you could with four hoofed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay little buddy I got you. You are safe now.\" She said as she was flying back up to her home at the cloud with the rainbow water fall. \"So what you doing all the way out here if you can't fly yet. And what is your name?\" She asked as you slowly let go and some how stood on the cloud as if it was solid ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You answered the first question and thought on the second one and just relied that you couldn't remember your own name. \"I... I can't remember.\" You said lowering your head. \"I'm all alone and don't know why I am here or how I got here.\" You sniffles as you sat there and she watched you with your white hair and three shades of blue  main and tail.</span></div></div>",

You nodded your head and hugged her the best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember where I am from... and a bit about my past... but it would sound weird.\" You looked away as you pulled away from her and started to walk towards the edge of the cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that. Your my filly so that is all that matters.\" She stated which caught you off guard for the rainbow dash you remember from the show would never adopt anyone as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am from another world actually. And your world is like a show that kids and some adults watch for entertainment.\" You tried to explain and she just walked up next to you.

You can stay with me seeing how you stuck here.\" She winked at you and you only blushed and lowered your head to stare at the world below. The small town of Ponyvile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" You took a pause as everything was just setting in your mind and you still couldn't remember to much outside of what you told her. \"Mommy.\" You felt her wing twitch then pull you closer to her as she was blushing from hearing that. It oddly made her happy to hear. She never thought of herself as a parent. \"Sorry that I am not your  real filly though.\" You stated bot really thinking on your words of being born from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not easy but I think I can help with that.\" You both hear behind you and turn to see princess Twilight. She slowly and proudly walks twirls the two of you. \"I mean that is if Dash wants to really do its for it is a lot of work on her.\" She continued watching you move closer to rainbow almost under her. \"And after your birth you would return to your current young age.\" Her eyes trailed from you up to her dear friend who was just staring at her before looking down at you her cheeks all flustered. </span></div></div>",

Her under belly slowly started to fill out as you was growing inside her. Finally Twilight sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done. You two are mother and filly. You will bare her for three months before she is due my friend.\" She told dash watching her  gently lay down and rub the ends of her wings along the bulge in her belly.  \"Never thought I see you as a caring mother.\" She chuckled and walked over and laid down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say. There was just something about her. I couldn't just say no and turn her away.\" Dash said as she just rested there taking in the added weight and looked back at her belly. She went about explaining to her what you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. There are many different world out there. Maybe one could of been able to see our world through a magical portal and they mistaken it for just a show.\" She sighed then turned her head to watch her friend showing such happiness and bliss over being a parent. \"So she had you at mommy huh?\" Twilight giggled making Dash blush and look away.

I mean if I don't then who would? She technically came to me out of the sky.\" She laughed as she stretched her wings before slowly raising to stand. \"The others are going to be  confused. AJ more then any. Best get ready for a Pinkie Pie party little filly.\" She shook her head and used a fore hoof to rub her belly. \"Well Twilight.

Mommy will understand.\" Dash said knowing you couldn't really hear her in hopes that she could encourage you to not suffer any more.

I put her there.\" Dash knew she made mistakes in the past that hurt ponies feels but this was different.

You just laid there for a little while before wiggling out from between the two of them and slowly climbed down off the cloud and walked across the floor towards the door. You reached up placing one goof on the wall your other one reaching for the handle of the door as you was flapping your wings. \"Come on. Reach.\" You whimpered quietly before you was able to open the door and then went back down on all four. I looked back at the two of them before walking out of the room and looked around at how the inside of Princess Twilight Sparkle's  Castle. \"Wow. It looked big on the show but it huge if you actually here.\" You quietly mutter to yourself as you was walking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there little fella. You must be Rain Drop. Dashie's  little filly. Twi told us all about ya'ha sugar cube. I can see why Dash took a motherly charm to you. \" Apple Jack said making you spin around to see her and fall over. You made your way back to standing and then lowered your head looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, don't be scared little one. We won't hurt you.\" A soft light voice came from behind you.  You could tell it was Fluttershy, but you was starting to feel crowded and was looking for a way to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, you are simple adorable.\" Rarity stated blocking off your only means of escape. You backed up against the wall and was staring at the floor before laying down. \"Is everything alright dear?\" She asked and the three of them moved in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" You Wasn't sure why of all things to scream out in a light timid voice that was quiet like Fluttershy's.  But before you knew other wise you was scooped up into Dash's fore legs as she floated in the air and in front of each pony was a little filly. Apple Bloom stood in front of AJ, Scootaloo in front of Fluttershy, and Sweety Belle in front of Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back up. Your crowding her.\" All three of tem said at the same time. The girls looked at each other then apologized and took their leave besides Scootaloo and Fluttershy. She floated closer and smiled at you. You looked at her and smiled back.</span></div></div>",

I looked at Scootaloo's  cutie mark then looked back at my own blank flank oddly upset that there was no cutie mark there. Scootaloo and Dash noticed and Dash was a little confused seeing how you said you was From another world and all.  \"Don't worry champ you. I am sure you will get your mark in time.\" Dash told you and you looked up at her then to Scootaloo next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why it bothers me. I mean I know I am not originally a pony. And that as a human I would of never had one. Just as more time passes I feel like this is more where I should be then back there. Sorry for having such thoughts as to leaving you mom.\" You lower your head oddly feeling ashamed for thinking of your real home and world. Dash shook her head and slowed down to walk at tour side and drooped a wing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fine. Even if in the end you do leave back to your own world, you will always be my little Rain Drop.\" She told you smiling down at you making you blush for in a way she is telling the truth for thanks to Twilight's spell you was Rainbow Dash's little filly now. \"Plus you helped me have the final push to adopt Scootaloo so I should thank you.\" She then laughed lightly for you dropping out of the sky into her life changed her dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Scootaloo watched Dash enter the library first before following her in together and looking around at how large and vast it was. \"Wow!\" Both you and her said at the same time before giggling together. \"Scootaloo could you teach me to fly?\" You asked as you looked away and kicked at the ground with one of your fore hoofs. Though she only just learnt how to fly herself she smiled and hugged you telling you she be happy to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me your big sister.\" She giggled and smiled happy to have a family now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cording to my examinations and best estimate actually Scootaloo he is the same age as you.\" Twilight corrected her as she flew down to you from a higher shelf. \"So let us go over all this again to make sure I have it all recorded in my notes.\" You went about explaining it again but this time you seemed to have a harder time remembering your home world and self. Having gone there several times now herself Twilight could see the frustration and how upsetting it was for you that you where having a harder and harder time keeping your memories. It was clear you still had them but try where becoming distant and foggy. Seeing your reaction Rainbow pulled you into a hug and held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing. Twilight. Is there not a spell or potion to help her?\" Fluttershy asked as she moved close and hugged you as well. Twilight shook her head and sighed. Once you calmed down you just laid down behind Rainbow and listen to their talking.</span></div></div>",

Poor Rainbow who would of bolted normally to get away from a lecture was just stood there trying to keep her eyes open. Flutter shy on the other hand seemed to not be as effected as the rest. It was unserten how much longer you and Scootaloo listened but not long later the two of you was fast asleep snuggled into each other. Rainbow looked back and couldn\u2019t help but smile and blush. \u201cWell you two are lucky that you could do that. But despite wanting to join you I got to stay awake to help you my little droplet.\u201d She stated before turning back to twilight with tired struggling eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo in theory this could be why he who is now a little filly...\u201d Twilight paused looking at Rainbow Dash and is surprised she is still fighting to stay awake but was still able to shot a state telling her to correct her words. \u201c... I mean he who is now your little filly, and why the longer she is here in our world the more she will forget her own. One day she will forget it forever and only know this one and you Dadh as her birth mother.\u201d She finished making Rainbow\u2019s heart sink for she was torn on helping you get home and wanting to keep you. \u201cYou know he belongs in his old life and not here. I know you have a powerful bond to her and even went as far as giving birth to her to make her your child. But...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know... I know I have to let her go and let her return home.\u201d Rainbow broke out into tears and turned her back on her friends and stood looking down at you before lowering herself next to the two of you and dropping her wing over both of you. \u201cBut you said it yourself that we don\u2019t know what detention he is from. You went to one that was similar to his but clearly from his description not the same one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and I can\u2019t just send him randomly to any. No pony has that power to rip open dementional portals to every demention.\u201d Twilight walked over and placed her hoof on dash\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIn the end I believe she will never leave you and will be happy with the life you have and will give her.\u201d Twilight stood tall and walked over to a book she had gathered. \u201cI will try to perserve his memories by copying them and sealing them in an amulet. The danger is That he might not remember any of them but they will all be stored and can be returned if the amulet is broken.\u201d Twilight sighed before casting the spell and formed and amulet in the shape of a rainbow raindrop. When she was done you woke up and looked up at Dash and smiled. \u201cRaindrop what do you remember of your past?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... I remember Mommy Dash and my sister Scootaloo that mommy adopted. Mommy was young when she had me and I never seen my daddy. I go to school with sis and our friends. Why you ask auntie Twi? What wrong auntie Fluttershy? Mommy?\u201d You looked from one to the next each of them had a worried look on their face besides Dash who only smiled and kissed you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing my little Raindrop, nothing at all.\u201d Dash said still in tears as she stood up and nudged Scootaloo awake. \u201cCome on kids. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d Dash said leading the two of you out. You looked back at Twilight and couldn\u2019t help but think something was wrong with the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDash if you get...\u201d Twilight started then lowered her head. \u201cTo attached then you won\u2019t be able to let her go.\u201d She quirky spone the rest and Fluttershy only watched as the three of you left.</span></div></div>",

I am sorry for what I said.\u201d You said as you kept your head low before looking up at Dash then lowering it again. \u201cI really don\u2019t remember anything outside of Mommy and waking up next to my sister and everything after that. I can slightly remember a protective warmth like no other. I think I was being carried around inside that warmth and I felt loved and I didn\u2019t want to leave that place, but now I am here and I have you two.\u201d You said looking back up at Rainbow Dash and saw her face red and smiling for she knew that warmth was inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay come on champs up we go.\u201d She coughed before opening her wings and taking off as did Scootaloo. You watched for a moment before copying them but you didn\u2019t get to far off the ground before there was a thud. This sound made the other two stop and. Look back to see your face planted in the ground before your body folded over and hit the ground. This sight made Dash bolt to you and pick you up. \u201cRaindrop I am sorry I forgot I have to still teach you how to fly. I am sorry my little droplet.\u201d She cooed you as your eyes where all watery before you started to cry like a baby filly. She carried you all the way up to the cloud you now call home and landed. \u201cIt okay it only a scratch and bruise.\u201d She tried to comfort you as your words where still ringing in her mind making her deep red as she thought in how she felt holding you inside her being your mother to be. She with out thinking sat down and slowly curled your body up and held you comfortably against her belly fur. This made you calm down for your ear was against her fur and you could hear the familiar sound of her heart beat and this soothes you. You reached a hoof out to Scootaloo who took it and snuggled in with you and Dash gently lowered her body over both of us just being able to cover us with her entire body and drooping her wings to help. All three of us blushing from this moment but Rainbow Dash most for she was remembering being pregnant with you and thinking of doing it again with both of you together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get inside and prune those wings okay my little filly.\u201d The silence was finally broken by Dash\u2019s voice as she stood up making the two of us shiver lightly at the cooler breeze that hit us compared to the warmth of our mother\u2019s body. We followed her inside and sat as she started to tend to the feathers on both of our wings slowly. It felt nice and relaxing feeling her breath on your wings as she adjusted and put each feather back in their propper place and removing any broken ones.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it wasn\u2019t the empty ness of not having them inside you that you felt? Maybe it was emptiness in your heart that you didn\u2019t have any pony to share them with as a family?\u201d She said shyly and timidly as she felt her friends heart start to race with her\u2019s on each word she spoke.

Is it a miss fire of the spell or it being cast twice so soon that it is making her feel like a parent herselve for placing the fouls inside her friend. \u201cDash, I don\u2019t understand why but thank you.

We came wondering if you knew where Scootaloo was for she wasn\u2019t in school and the fillies where looking for her.

Scootaloo and you where snuggled in the for legs of both your mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up almost like the instinct of a foul was still there you started nursing from your mother. \u201cHmm, oh morning little droplet.\u201d Cooed Rainbow Dash as she just let you not really caring that you was older and shouldn\u2019t need to nurse anymore. Instead she helped you make it easier for you. As she was she noticed that on your flank there was a mark. It seemed some how you had gotten your. Cutie mark which was a single droplet falling into two ripples. Twinwoke to see this and giggled at the sight. She cuddled the sleeping Scootaloo as she watched you nurse until Dash stopped you and started to Prun your wings and fix your mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy?\u201d You softly spoke breaking the silence finally. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever leave me.\u201d You yawned as you enjoyed the feeling of her tending to you. Those words light Dash\u2019s face up but caused Teilights face to grow a bit grim. What had she done, you was not of this world and was going to eventually be sent back. But now she felt horrified on the thought of you leaving and wanted you to stay but felt it was wrong to keep you as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig sis, I mean mum?\u201d Apple Bloom shyly spoke before she felt a foreleg hold her tight and guide her to continue nursing. This made her blush but she didn\u2019t fight it, she willingly did and shed a tear of happiness for what Apple Jack did for her. She. Now had a mommy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt alright sugar, take your fill. Mommy be okay.\u201d AJ said blushing as she watched Apple Bloom happily nurse from her. \u201cI made all that just for you sweet heart.\u201d AJ cooed as she was so happy to be able to give her this. \u201cMy little Apple Bloom.\u201d She said the gasped feeling her filly nurse more almost because she was so happy from hearing those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweety Bell, come to mommy and have your share.\u201d Rarity cooed as she watched her fully wake up and step away from the dragon that was curled around her. She watched her shyly walk up to her and nodded before the young filly started to nurse as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwi took you as Scootaloo then took her turn and Rainbow just loved it until she was done and started pruning her as well. We all heard AJ giggling as Apple Bloom wasn\u2019t showing any sign of wanting to stop. \u201cTwilight, thank you, I have friends and a family now. I couldn\u2019t be more happy.\u201d You told her which made her blush and hold you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the four of you ran off to play before passing out for a nap. While you all did that the older ponies where talking about what they just did and how they felt about it. In the end not one of them regretted it. In fact Fluttershy was asking if it work with different animals for she wanted to mother Angel her rabbit friend as well as any sick animal that would need her help. That she want to mother them all and heal them all inside her mothering body. Twilight and Starlight told her that it might not be wise and dangerious one to do that so much and two that not being the same animal might cause her issues just as much. Pinky being who she is asked if could hold a new birthday now for the four of us that was asleep.</span></div></div>",

The offer was so cool and you would've been an idiot not to take them up on that offer but you want to get to know the Ponies/creatures of Ponyville. \"I thank you SO much for the offer but I'm afraid I have to decline.\" Everypony was surprised that you actually denied an offer to be a prince. Princess Luna was the first to break the silence. \"But how come? You would be living in the Castle and...\" I put up a hoof to interrupt her. \"The reason why I'm declining is because I want to get used to my new form AND make friends with the ponies/ creatures in Ponyville.\" The princess's then nodded their heads and flew out of the castle. \"Wow.\" Fluttershy said \"I can't believe you gave up the opportunity to be a prince.\" \"Fluttershy's right. But I'm glad your staying in Ponyville. Hey how would you like to be enrolled in the \"School of Friendship?\" \"It would be an honor. At least I'll learn more about friendship AND get to meet some new friends.\" \"Wow well Fluttershy and I can't WAIT for you to join our classes.\" As I was about to speak again the door opened revealing the REST of the Mane 6.

You need too calm down! Can you see anyway you could get out of there with help from here?\" You shout as loud as you can to make sure Zecora would hear you over the fire and her screams for help. You really wish you would know how to use magic now that your an alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Celestia you came! There is a window on the opposite of the door, but its blocked from the outeside by something! Please hurry! I is getting hard to breath in here!\" Told Zecora you as you heard crashing on the in side of the hut and her coughs shortly after. She didn't seem to have seen you, but you didn't cared about that and ran around the house and saw what blocked the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of the roof that must have broken down when that bomb went off. It was surprisingly only in flamed in very few places. You tried to force it off the side of the hut but it didn't move a single inch. \"It must be stuck somewhere.\" you though and looked the thing over and soon saw the problem. One of the roof supports was stuck in the gound and the window. Thinking fast you move to one side of the support and placed you hind hoofs between the ground and lower part of it. You dug your front hoofs in the gound before you and kicked it as hard as you could. Again and again you tried and finally it gave away. You gave it another strong kick and sent it flying. You quickly moved out off the way of the falling roof parts and saw that there was now a hole in this side which was probably even Celestia could fit trough with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked inside to see that Zecora was already lying on the ground unconscious. You wanted to rush in and get her out, but something was holding you back. All of th sudden you doubted, what you are doing here. \"Wait. Why should I risk my live for her. I don't even know her!\" You started to think of all the reasons not to save Zecora, but you shook your head to get these thoughts out of your head. \"How can i even think that way. I got her into this shit!\" you said to yourself and rushed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to see when you entered the hut cause of all the smoke and the flames. Still, it only took you a moment to find her and the reason why she was unconscious. She was carrying a bag with potions she probably wanted to save and then one of the shelvess fell from the walls and hit her. You moved up to her and somehow were able to pick her up and lift her over back holding Zecora in place with your wings. You ran outside and that no second to soon. Right as you exited through the hole in the wall, the hut collapsed and every thing still inside was lost in the flames which were raging even greater then when the bomb went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as far away as you could before you're were feeling exhausted and set Zecora down. But suddenly your head felt like it was getting bashed in with a hammer. You broke down and held your head in your hoofs waiting for the pain to go away. \"NOTHING BUT A FAILURE!\" Was some deep voice, seeming to be enraged by something, screaming in your head. Instantly after that your head was feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to Zecora who seemed to recover and she was sleeping. You were wondering what you should do now.</span></div></div>",

Who are you?\" You ask looking to Celestia she stood up and turned to you with a look of confusion \"You're not dead?\" Celestia asked suddenly the energy in you seems stronger \"Oh no! I'm not trusting you! I trust you and then BAM my insurance premiums go way up like that KABOOM!!! And who know's what'll happen to the space time continuum!\" You yell as you flail your hooves and with a shake of your head you suddenly feel like you weren't yourself for a moment Celestia sighed \"I really didn't think I'd see you again or rather YOU not well... you.\" Celestia said trotting away from the desk \"Well no point in going on any longer without telling Luna.\" Celestia said as she trotted over to a wall and banged on it \"Hey Luna he's back!\" Celestia called out you look confused \"Okay I don't know what the salamander is happening but I want to know now! It's my money and I want it now!\" You said feeling that strange energy surge again Luna then trotted in with a warhammer \"I'll kill you!\" Luna yelled as she swung it down you manage to dodge it \"Whoa! I may have blown up a house today but I can say from experience that violence isn't the answer!\" You yell as you trot backwards towards Celestia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a cold knife at your neck \"I'm afraid in this case it is.\" Celestia said cold as the blade at your neck you wrap your foreleg around her's and get the knife out of her hoof you then slide under Celestia as your shaking \"Celestia you gotta help me! You're trying to kill me!\" You yell in a panic as your voice is quaking \"Wait how does he remember your name?\" Luna asked in confusion \"That's a good question. I didn't expect a memory to stay intact. If he remember's... that. This could be trouble.\" Celestia then trotted away from you and turned around now looking down at you \"Okay how much do you know?\" Celestia asked</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since you had no idea how to get out of this damned forest you thought it would be the best to just wait for Zecora to wake up and then hope she knows where to go. Also you should probably tell her that fire was your fault... of maybe that could wait for later. Yeah that would be the best for now. You looked over to her as you heard a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was slowly getting up and was tying to see where she was as her eyes took you into focus and she seemed surprised to see that you are an alicorn. She was a good ten feet away from you and there was an akward silence as she was looking all over you. You stared at her in a weird way unable to bring out a word as Zecora got closer to you. But suddenly she stopped about half way to you and she looked at your flank. You wonder why she was looking so intense and finally you knew what she was looking for. A Cutie Mark. You realized as you had woken up that you didn't had any, but still looked at your flank because you felt unsure off how long she was looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. You looked back at Zecora and looked her know directly in her eyes. She seemed to be shocked and scared by your look as you would guess. You got out of your siting position in which you waited for her to wake up. You are worried about the look in your eyes and wanted to calm her down as she seemed really dissolved about what happen and your apperance. \"Are you okay?\" was all you could get out and you felt really stupid for even asking this question. And for the worse Zecora was now even more nervous about you and started to back off. \"Hey, what's wrong? You don't look to good.\" You said as you took a step in her direction. Not the smartest move in this situation and that move kicked you in the face. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora emidiantly turned around as you got closer and kick you with her hooves. It hurt like hell and you screamed in pain as she send you flying in the tree behind you. \"Back off you mad gone beast!\" Zecora screamed at you as you got back up and trying to get a clear vision again from that kick. The next thing you see clearly is one off the potions out off that bag she wears. As that thing hit the ground in front of you It exploded and flames and pieces of the broken glass were comeing in your direction. You jump out of the way of the flames, but the shards still hit you in the flank and left a long bleeding wound,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked up as this scene was over. You saw a how Zecora ran in a direction with the ground covered in moss. After that you blacked out cause of your blood loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up after what you guessed have been a few ours since you see a small pond of your blood. You noticed that you head must have been bleeding for a short while since you can feel the dried blood on your snout. It is hard for you to get up since your some of the shards are still in your flank. You start to remove them one by one. \"What the hell was wrong with that pony?! I saved her life and she tries to kill me. It was me who endangered it in the first place, but she could know that.\" You start to think why in the name of hell she would want your death so badly. You take out the last of the shards in your flank. It is like a mirror and big enough for you to see every detail of your new face. You see that there is a small bleeding scar above your right red glowing eye. And something seems to be wrong with your left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is comepletly grey with your iris being slightly touch of a white-blue and your pupli is streched and thin like the one of a cat. \"I look like a total freak with this second changed eye! That zebra is going to pay for turning it like this with her potions!\" you say out loud really pissed know as you notice something. Now your left eye has a touch of a red-purple. \"Wait a sec... This sin't her fault, is it?\" you ask yourself calming down and see your eye change its color to grey. This is extremly crepy to you, but know you got to follow Zecora and find out what was going on and why she creeped out that hard at your look. And if you manage to do that you will tell her that you set her hut on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a made up mind you head the direction that was covered in moss. Unknown to you at the moment your left eye turned back the way it was when you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it to the edge off the forest and can go now to either Sweet Apple Acers or to Ponyville.</span></div></div>",
