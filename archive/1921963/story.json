The big soft expanse he called his body had been growing steady all his  20 years of life and the tiger had now reached a point where he tried to avoid moving, because moving nearly 600 pounds of fat is quite tiresome. He poked his soft, saggy chest a bit and took in the mountain of fat that rose behind it before he turned his attention to the TV. A chubby lion then walked in carrying a bottle of soda and some snacks which he placed within easy reach of the obese tiger. The lion was Peter, his boyfriend. They had met just over four years ago and had been an item nearly from their first meet. He hadn't been nearly as fat then, although big enough to struggle in stairs and preferring activities that could be done in a chair inside.<br>\r\nMost of his waking hours now were spent in the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rubbed his boyfriends huge belly gently. It had gotten so big. When they first met Peter had no idea how much boyfriend he would get. At first he thought it was awesome, but when John crossed 400 without signs of slowing down he was getting worried things were out of hand. 400 was big enough, now need to go further he told John. But he didn't listen, either from laziness, or from a wish to get bigger. He heard his loves labored breaths and he noticed how he rarely moved nowadays. Come to think of it, it must be at least three months since last he left the apartment. Peter was worried and was trying to think of how he could get John to take better care of his health.<br>\r\nHis train of thoughts were interrupted by John snatching his arm and pulling him for a kiss.<br>\r\n'What are you thinking about honey?'<br>\r\n'You' Peter answered, doing his best to not let his concern show<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you choose a blank chapter just start writing, I'll change the choice here to match your chapter)</span></div></div>",

As the tiger devoured his snack Peter looked down at his own belly, now covering his groin completely and starting to sag down on the side of his thighs. Ever since he crossed 250 lbs he had been a bit worried and embarrassed, although having a boyfriend nearly twice his size helped his self image. But still, his current 260 lbs was more than he was comfortable with.<br>\r\nHis train of thoughts was ended when John good heavily up from the sofa. He took a moment to catch his breath, then he unbuttoned his shirt, letting his belly flow out.<br>\r\n\"This shirt is getting to tight, I can hardly breath in it\" he said.<br>\r\nPeter just nodded as he looked at the massive amount of tiger in front of him and he once again felt what he only thought of as \"that feeling\", a sort of weird attraction to the that belly, to seeing it grow, seeing it make his boyfriend struggle to walk, rip his clothes and breathe heavy. He resented that feeling, knowing that all that weight was dangerous, but still, whenever he saw it like this, all stuffed from breakfast and the recent snack, hanging out of a shirt that definitely was a bit tight while John was breathing hard just from getting up and standing he felt strongly attracted to it. 600 lbs of tiger, all his.<br>\r\nJohn stretched, sending ripples through his whole, soft body and Peter could take it no more. He got up and wrapped his arms as far around Johns soft middle as he could and kissed him on the nose.<br>\r\n\"Then take it off, you look better without it anyway\"</span></div></div>",

His little lion was so bad at hiding just how much he loved seeing him grow, although he sometimes brought up health and such a little showing off was all it took to get him to forget all of that. John took a step back and Peter followed. Another step, Peter followed and soon they were getting close to the bedroom. Peter saw where they were headed, got a smirk on his face and suddenly ran ahead. John gave him a minute, and then went after. On the way there he tore of his shirt.<br>\r\nHe hurried the last meters and was a bit out of breath as he opened the door. But he knew that deep down Peter loved seeing him stopping to catch his breath. He could tell that Peter was enjoying the view a lot from where he lay, stretched out naked in a comically sexy pose on the bed, the sort that is incredibly sexy when muscular people do it, but that just looks weird when fat people do it, belly sagging to the side and such.<br>\r\nPeter waddled the last few steps slowly, letting Peter take in the sight of 600 lbs of tiger in motion, before dropping heavily on the side of the coach. Peter was on him nearly instantly, caressing his fat folds, nosing his backfat, just enjoying all his body. John loved being worshiped like this. After a couple minutes Peter went down to the floor and began taking off his pants, slowly pulling them down his soft legs.<br>\r\nOnce naked John stands up and gets onto the bed on all fours, it's the only way he'a able to get to the center of the bed. Or actually beds, since a regular double bed didn't give them enough room. It was tiresome to walk move across the madras and when he reached the middle of their two king size bed (filling nearly the entire room) he was quite winded and just collapsed for a while. As he laid there Peter climbed on top of him and began cuddling with his back.</span></div></div>",

He knew that if John doesn't want to do anything else then eating food and watch TV that's fine, but he himself wanted more of life. He would want to go places and see things all over the world, and he wanted to share it with his big cuddly tiger. He knew that John's tiger body was build to hold more weight then a lion's would and that he could still move and walk around (With some effort that is), but one day he will reach that point when he won't be able to even get out of bed, and he wants to gain some nice memories of their time together before that happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there is nothing wrong dear?\" John asked, waking the lion up from his dreams. He had been staring for probably a full minute at John without saying anything. What should he do? Should he come clean and tell him what he thinks? \"You know you can tell me anything you want, without it making me upset.\" John added, resting one of his thick paws on the lion's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John...\" Peter started with a slight pause. \"You know I have always love you and done everything you like just to see you happy?\" \"Yes?\" John answered, unsure of what was going to happen. \"It's just that it feels like we never do anything together anymore.\" Peter said, with some force. \"But, we <b>do</b> things together. We eat snacks, watch TV, and...\" John started before getting interrupted by Peter. \"You don't understand. We don't do things that other couple do. We never go out on a restaurant, to the movies, heck, we haven't even been outside looking at nature for several months!\" \"I don't get what the problem is.\" John said, wanting to understand his boyfriend. \"It's just that you are always stuck inside this house, when there's a <u>whole</u> world outside.\" Peter said, and did a gesture with his hands to symbolise a big globe. \"Do you want to go on a vacation together?\" John asked him. \"Yes! That is exactly what I want.\" Peter said, and got up from the sofa. \"Just imagine all the places and people, the unique natures and animals, the exotic foods and flavours.\" \"Foods and flavours?\" John said with a small drool coming from his mouth. \"See, I knew there would be something that would suit you too.\" Peter said, and patted his tiger's big gut. \"Okay. I'm convicted. I will take and go on a vacation with you, but only if you promise it will have great food there.\" John said happily. \"I will make that my first order of business.\" Peter said, and they both shake hands on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was now feeling like he was on cloud nine. He would finally be able to see some of the worlds wonders, and he would be able to share it with his favourite fur of them all. Looking through a bunch of websites on great places to go he knew he to find something that would both have great tourists attractions for him, and some great food for John. And after doing a bunch of research's he finally decides that the place they will go to would be...</span></div></div>",

After he bought the tickets and printed the recipe he rushed to John to tell him the good news. As he reached the bedroom he saw John eating a snack. He was not wearing a shirt and his giant belly was on display, Peter could only blush, secretly hoping it would get bigger during the vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the news babe?.\" John said as she shoved a cracker in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got tickets for Rome!\" Peter said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats great!\" John said half excitedly focusing on eating. Though he ushers Peter to join him. Peter sheepishly joined him in the bed his blushing growing darker with every step near John. John smiled knowing that Peter tried to hide his desire to see John bigger. As Peter finally climbs into bed with John. He cuddles up to his fat side playing with his massive belly. As John smiled at him he noticed Peter's chest, giving it a small surprise squeeze. Peter gave a small cry and shy away. Peter hated when John did that but John couldn't help himself the only thing that John loved than getting bigger and his boyfriend is his boyfriend's chest and how he would love to see it get bigger. He already though if hoping to get Peter to join him on the gaining train so he could see his boyfriend's chest get bigger, Peter loved seeing him get bigger so why shouldn't he enjoy Peter also getting bigger.</span></div></div>",
