You are sitting in the living room watching ESPN's Sportscenter when your mom calls you to tell you that dinner is almost ready.  Meanwhile your sister, Cindy, comes downstairs and immediately changes the channel to some Ballet concert.  You shout, \"Change it back!\" but she just sticks out her tongue, making you even madder.  Suddenly you hear something upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk upstairs toward your room.  You slowly open your door and are immediately blinded by a white light.  When everything clears, you find the hard floor of your room expanding.  Oh No! you've shrunk.  You must be about 1 inch tall!  Before you can do anything, you hear the sounds of tap tap on the stairs.  Its your sister coming back upstairs wearing her brown medium heel sandals!  She's has no idea what has happened to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel like you always take one step forward and two steps back in this crazy day! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding your only choice is to try and head back to the house, the door suddenly opens and a giant blonde-haired woman in her thirties walks out. She is wearing a blue tank top, jean capris and white flip flops with a cigarette in her hand. You realize you are on the mat still which she will be stepping on and with you only being ant-size, there is no way you can outrun a foot the size of a cruiseliner! You curl into a ball and hope for the best as her foot lands beside you, the soft mat muffling the chaotic impact but not the loud sound of her heel slapping into the flip flop. Peaking up, you can't help but notice that the sole of her flip flop alone is over twenty feet tall. Looking up higher, you can't even see her face from under the mountainous breasts that jut over her chest. The giantess walks off the mat, closing the door behind her as she goes to her lawn chair on the porch and lights up her cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can get her attention, then she can help me, help Jen find her key, so Jen can help me find help in getting back to normal size!\" You think aloud.</span></div></div>",

This of course is what you want to say but the desire to be close to these mammoth sized mammaries are just too enticing to pass up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab on the material of her black blouse and climb up from under the wobbling globe above. A few minutes pass with her standing still and making your climb relatively easy, you are soon climbing up her v-neck and make contact with the warm, creamy flesh of her left boob. Your arms and legs sink into her a few feet like crawling on Jell-O. Her bra can barely contain the massive bosom as her cleavage is very prominent up her v-neck. You are very careful to move slowly so that you are not felt, even though you want to get her attention, she will probably instant think you are a bug crawling upon this sensitive area or she will get very weirded out and make explaining the situation that much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milf suddenly turns her body slightly to grab something on the kitchen counter and this creates disdain for you as you are flung to the side, losing your grip on her breast. You flail through the air as you are falling to the ground, about to be splattered on the kitchen floor but instead you meet an abrupt halt as you land in between two soft walls. Looking around, you find yourself wedged in her valley-like cleavage. With the breasts being so soft, you are able to shimmy yourself up to where they are barely holding you, although they are soft, you know if she were to press her breasts together, you would easily be crushed by the immense weight of the two mountains. Despite this danger, you use this position to relax, feeling super comfortable. The warmth emanating from her skin is very nourishing as your body being so tiny, gets cold very easily and the smell of her soap and perfume is very pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should probably start climbing soon. Right?</span></div></div>",

Not only does your mom know about the shrinking incidents, but that she had been working with the FBI.  Putting aside the fact her company developed shrinking tech and that the FBI had been using an ant hill for their operations in your own back yard this is all too weird.  \"Okay gentlemen, that will do for tonight,\" your mom's voice booms, \"Contact me on the usual line if anything else comes up.\"  The FBI agents nod their heads and once again head into the ant hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't trust the FBI agents, but since your mom knows what is going on you decide to stick with her.

Once your mother is back into the house she stands by the counter for a minute, waiting for her tea to be made.  You take this moment to climb higher up her dress.

You are lifted into the air as she walks on towards her car.  You take a peak of your surroundings and see the birdbath location getting closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your mother nears the birdbath you hoist yourself off the side of her pump and roll onto the pavement, suprisingly unscaved.  You look on as your mom exits the frontyard, the skirt of her polka dot dress swaying left and right.  You keep watching her walk on until she is gone from your view.  You had had an almost near death experience at the feet of your mother, but you feel energized, gaining your second wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the thundering footsteps subside you walk towards the birdbath and bask in the mere scale of it.  What was once a 3 to 4 foot fountain is now a skyscraper.  Just another reminder of your diminutive stature.  You scan the area looking for the earring.  You see something sparkling in the distance. Taking a closer look you recognize it as the earring you are looking for.  You approach it when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The both of you wait for the other to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think what you can do, the bird is three times your size with talons that could  squeeze the life out of you.  The bird gets tired of waiting and lets out a roar, which would be a chirping sound to any normal sized human.  It walks towards you and tries to grab you with its beak.  You roll out of the way and try to create distance between you guys.  The two of you circle around each other when you bump into your mom's earring.  You look back and the bird takes this chance to gain altitude and fly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you grab the earring and spin it around like a shotput.  You keep spinning to gain momentum and wack the bird as it dives down at you.  You get a clean shot at its face and you watch as the bird flys away from the frontyard.

She proceeds to strut over to you.  The quicker pace of her walking creates simeltaneous tremors that cause you to almost lose your balance.  Your mom stops right in front of you.

You cower as her hand gets closer when you notice her grab the earring next to you.  You watch as with just two fingers she picks up her earring, while you needed to use all your strength just to even grab it.  She snaps it back on and straightens her hair.  You watch as her hair seems to float in the air before falling back into place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see your mom lower her hand to the ground motioning for you to get on.  You climb onto her palm and hug her hand as you are thrust into the air as she raises her hand to her face.  Once you feel her hand stop moving you stand up and look st your mom's enormous smiling face.  Your mom stands back up and walks back into the house.  You look back at the yard and think back to what you went through.  Your mom sets you on the dining table and walks to the kitchen and brings out dinner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compare the plates and see that while your mom is going to eat a full steak you are left with a few crumbs on a plate, which is a full course meal at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore dinner starts your mom asks you how the frontyard was.  You tell her about the bird and decide to leave out you riding on her shoe.  Your mom is in shock about the whole ordeal.  She picks you up and kisses you with her squishy lips.  You dont fight it at first when your mom inhales and almost sucks you up.  Your upper body gets stuck between her lips as you wiggle to get free.  Your mom spits you out just in time, and begins to laugh as you are once again covered in her lip gloss.  You clean your face off and eat your dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cant help watch as your mom cuts and eats pieces of steak bigger than you with ease.  \"That could have been me a second ago.\"  You think to yourself as you slowly eat your crumbs while you continue to watch your mom eat.
