            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two thirteen-year-old boys sat anxious at their desks, waiting impatiently for that most glorious sound of the final bell of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was light-skinned with fiery red hair and deep blue eyes He wore blue jeans, a red shirt shirt with white short sleeves and a grey vest, as well as brown shoes. This was Freddy, a smart and kind boy who put his friends before him, but hated bullies. He also loved food, which had lead to a fine, barely noticeable layer of pudge on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was a slender African-American with purple eyes named Andy. He wore a deep blue sleeveless shirt, black sweatpants, and open-toed sandals. Andy was a caring person, but lazy. He wanted to gain weight, but his metabolism forbade it. Both boys watched as the clock's final seconds ticked down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1... BRRING! <br>\r\n\"Finally! Woohoo!\" yelled Freddy in excitement, whipping a grey cowboy hat out of his bag and plopping it on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Andy cheered. \"Race ya!\" He proceeded to rush outside toward the buses, followed by Freddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha gonna do during summer break?\" The redhead asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat and try to get as fat as my dad, what else?\" Andy replied smoothly. \"You've seen how huge he is!\" Andy's father was a heavyweight wrestler, and an animal caretaker. The man had a large belly, mostly muscle but covered with a thick fat layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Fred said dreamily. \"He's bigger than mine!\" Fred's dad a retired cowboy, living in comfort. He chose to retire because of how he noticed he was getting too fat for the horses. Unlike Andy's dad, Fred's father's belly was 100% gelatinous blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... dude look at that.\" Fred pointed as the bus came to a stop and released the pair. Near the bus stop was a moving van. Clambering out was a fairly pudgy Asian youth with brown hair, brown eyes, a light blue shirt with a green over shirt, brown jeans and blue shoes.</span></div></div>",

His body was a massive sphere, and his clothes were barely hanging on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Tomaki, let's get the boxes out.\" He said. \"I gotta get to work soon!\"<br>\r\n\"Dad, you said you were gonna help me become a sumo like you!\" Tomaki protested.<br>\r\n\"Sorry son, but I need to get to the new stadium!\" With that, the man waddled to the back of the truck as Tomaki looked across the street at the bus pulling away.. In its wake stood Freddy and Andy.</span></div></div>",
