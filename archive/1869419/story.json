I'm driving non stop from several hours and I need a break so I decided to stop in the closer autogrill. <br>\r\nParking the car and I see that there is not a lot of people but by a bus a bunch kids of about 11 and 12 years are coming down, appear to be part of a football team. <br>\r\nI enter inside and order a coffee and a croissant. The kids meanwhile start to generate confusion. The kids begin to order, who fruit juices, who croissants, and I move to make room and inadvertently crush one foot to one of them. <br>\r\nI apologize to him trying to speak in Spanish, but he stares at me with a look of evil and grins to me.<br>\r\nI finish and go to the bathroom. While I am inside to piss, someone knocks and I say that it is busy but he keeps knocking making me so angry I open the door and I see the same boy who I had crushed his foot. <br>\r\nWith an extremely strong push pushes me inside and closes the door. <br>\r\nHe looks at me and says something. <br>\r\nBut how is the boy and how old is he?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
