She never imagined that the school could be so big. <i>It looks much smaller in the brochure</i>, she thought. by the time she made it back to Gryffindor tower, her feet were killing her. She kicked off her shoes and dropped down into one of the chairs in front of the fire. She scanned the area for something to prop her feet on, but didn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Harry ambled through the door, dropped his books, and walked over to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you, Hermione?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd be a lot better if I could prop my feet up.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't they have any stools around here?\" he asked looking around the room.<br>\r\n\"No. I've already looked.

She tilted her head back to see the red headed figure of Ron, she grinned up at him, and shrugged - like she was going to tell him.

However, she couldn\u2019t help but be sad; Hermione has been at Hogwarts for one full month and she has yet to make a real friend. As she was thinking on this, she heard someone come in the Common Room. She turned and saw it was Harry Potter, who she met on the train to Hogwarts but hadn\u2019t really talked to since then since he was always with Ron Weasley, who didn\u2019t like her at all. Hermione then deiced to get back to her book. She didn\u2019t notice that Harry was walking towards her.<br>\r\n\u201cHermione, can I ask you something?\u201d asked Harry.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, Harry? I\u2019m in the middle of reading my favorite book\u201d, replied Hermione.<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you could help me with my homework. I-\u201c, started Harry.<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all I\u2019m needed for?!\u201d Hermione began to yell. \u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t want to get to know me, to be my friend, but as soon as they need help with homework, they come to me as if we were friends! Well, I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019ll help you, but in return, you\u2019re going to do something for me, got it?!\u201d<br>\r\nHarry was scared by this point. \u201cY-yes Ma\u2019am\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am? I\u2019ve never been called that before. Okay, from now on, you don\u2019t call me by my first name; it\u2019s way too informal for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am\u201d, Harry replied immediately. He didn\u2019t understand why he was following her orders so easily. It felt so natural.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s get started on that homework\u201d, said a thinking Hermione. She felt a power rush when Harry called her ma\u2019am and agreed to be more formal with how he calls her. With some gentle pushing, Hermione was thinking she could have Harry be her willing slave in no time at all. Who needs friends when you can have the Boy-Who-Lived as your obedient slave?<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, Harry\u2019s homework was done.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Miss Granger! You\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d replied Harry.<br>\r\n\u201cYou called me Miss Granger this time\u201d said a surprised and happy Hermione.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you told me not to call you by your first name\u201d, said Harry although it made him think. Why exactly was he following her orders so easily? Why did it please him so much to follow such a simple order from her?<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u201d, said a very excited Hermione. \u201cNow as for our agreement, you must do something for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Miss Granger?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He immediately tock off her shoes and socks and began his massage, starting with Hermione\u2019s left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione meanwhile was laughing in her mind. She was enjoying the power she had over the Wizarding World\u2019s hero and she barely did anything. Harry, meanwhile, was thinking why he was so submissive but put it out of his mind as this probably wouldn\u2019t again until he needed more help with homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was very impressed with Harry\u2019s massage; never had her left foot felt so relaxed. She was wondering how Harry would feel giving her a massage every day from now on. Soon enough, Harry got down with the left foot and began with the right one. Eventually, he was done with Hermione\u2019s right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re really good at this.

Would he want to give her a foot massage every day? Sure it was a nice moment with the 2, but he wasn\u2019t sure where this would lead if he agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He owed her two more kicks and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione saw her chace, at one moment druing his writhing when his balls were unprotected, she kicked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still needed one more kick though, and she felt Harry needed to be standing to receive it.<br>\r\n\"Stand up for the tenth one\" she told him and Harry rose to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not stand for long. She drew her foot back and swung it at his groin with even more force than any of the kicks she had given so far.<br>\r\nHarry passed out from the intense pain coursing through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke....</span></div></div>",

Of course she would allow him, this was her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her feet up into the air, allowing Harry room to reach under her seat. The wand seemed to be resting against the back wall.

They continued onward, buying books, and Hermione began her care for him with much gusto, helping herself to his money as they purchased supplies. At first, Harry gave her a weird look, but she simply smiled and batted her eyes at him, making him stop his look. He was unsure of what would happen if he said something, but decided to anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione, this is my money. I thought you still had some of your own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Harry. It IS my money. Since you're mine, everything you had is mine, too. You didn't pay attention to math, did you? Ever hear of the transitive property?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it works with numbers, but I'm not sure-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you shouldn't think, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and happily continued spending his money, then started walking away, urging Harry to follow her. However, Harry was beginning to feel ill, and ran for the bathroom nearest him, barely making it before he felt his clothes slowly hang from him. He threw up in the sink as Hermione made it into the bathroom behind him. She smiled and nodded as he felt the world spin. He focused on a point in the sink, trying not to pass out, and noted that the vomit wasn't vomit. It was dark brown, thick, and sticky, like the blob monsters you see in old horror movies. It smelled horrible, and it made him feel sicker. Hermione giggled behind him as he felt himself falling, then blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry woke up on a strange surface, kinda itchy, but soft, with a hard, cold surface below it. He felt less ill, but still took to a coughing fit, dry heaving as his belly burned. He couldn't open his eyes, feeling too weak to even try. All he heard was a loud rustling, and a roar of people outside the room he was in. He heard a rumble as curled up to protect his ears, then he heard a deafening sound, and his hearing returned to normal. He whimpered from the pain, and tried to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned and tried to talk, barely managing the words, \"I'm... Not... Sure...\" Hermione giggled, then there was shuffling,and the padding of something soft on hard floor. He rubbed his eyes and then slowly forced them open, the dull blur of his vision slowly clearing as he woke. His first sight was of a giant Hermione standing over him, smiling. She lifted a foot, which was now bare, and dropped it on him, pressing him into the floor with her soft sole. Harry grunted and squirmed, making Hermione giggle with a little groan at the end. The question was, was Hermione mad at Harry, or was she forgiving?</span></div></div>",

By no means did he have a foot fetish, but the overwhelming female flesh was making blood rush to various regions. He grunted and squirmed, making Hermione smile and giggle, twisting her foot on top of him. Surprisingly, even at Harry's size, he was confortable in contact with her skin. She bit a lip over him, and clenched her toes, gripping his head. Her cheeks reddened as she lifted him up, then stepped roughly onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you're so cute at this size. I'm glad you agreed to this. You'll be my foot pet forever now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned at that, and looked up to her. She rolled him about, nearly crushing his chest and ribs every time her foot pushed on his side. The smell was horrible, and the sweat was slick. He didn't dare to tell her he was uncomfortable, at risk of being a victim of an angry giantess. She looked down at him and lifted her foot. \"Now, I think it's my personal duty to try you out at a better place than this, so we're going to go for a walk. In my shoe, pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scurried to her shoe and crawled inside, where Hermione's foot covered him and carressed him with long toes. Harry was worried that he was in danger, but Hermione didn't seem to care. As she walked about, the heat and smell grew worse, the pressure becoming overwhelming with each step. He was sure that he would die if she kept going.</span></div></div>",

He had regained almost complete control of himself in an instant.<br>\r\nAll these thoughts went through his head in a millisecond.... In the next, he realized what had brought him back. \u00a0He replayed it in his head. \u00a0Did Fudge actually say that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know why he was sent to Azkeban. \u00a0He's the one who betrayed Lily and James Potter to You-Know-Who\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. \u00a0Yes Harry was sure that's what Fudge said. \u00a0His heart screamed. \u00a0The pain felt new. \u00a0Fury, Agony, despair. \u00a0These feelings, together coupled with fear were more powerful than those of the lust the charm had induced in his mind. \u00a0Pure hatred enveloped him. \u00a0He could barely see, like a film had covered his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione heard it. \u00a0She didn't know what Harry's reaction was going to be, but knew it couldn't be good. \u00a0</span></div></div>",

The pleasure of his tongue licking up and down her bare sole was so good she couldn't help but squeal in delight.  Not that Harry noticed; with both of her feet now totally bare, the spells effects had only grown stronger.  All he cared about was smelling and licking her feet.  Not wanting to deprive him of his joy, Hermione moved both of her bare feet right in front of his face.  She wiggled her toes, as if to say \"Well, what are you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dived right into her feet, licking her soles up and down, up and down.  He sucked on each toe, his tongue darting in-between.  Meanwhile, the pressure built up within Hermione, growing stronger with each lick on her feet.  Until at last, she climaxed, the shock of which caused her feet flail around.  Her right foot wound up \"accidentally\" brushing up against Harry's manhood, which to her delight also felt wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment she remembered that Ron was sitting right next to her.  \"Bloody hell, what have the two of you been doing?!\" his voice equal parts horror and fury.  Realizing that this was a possible disaster in the works, Hermione grabbed her wand, shouted \"Obliviate.\"  The memory charm did its work, a second later all Ron could say was \"What were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough all of this, Harry was still licking her feet.  \"I need to stop this,\" she thought to herself, \"before we get caught.\"  Ron was one thing, but a room full of crowed people was quite another.  It would be better to do this somewhere safer.  Leaning under the table, Hermione whispered \"Harry, put my stockings and shoes back on my feet.  Were continue this later.\"  Disappointed, but unable to resist Hermione's commands, Harry put the witch's footwear back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Harry.\" she thought to herself.  \"Your have plenty of fun at my feet soon enough.

Soon, Parvati Patil would be her her slave and take place (literally) at Hermione's feet.  The plan was really quite simple; Harry would isolate Parvati from her friend Lavender and bring her to the classroom.  Once there, she would be forced to smell Hermione's enchanted feet and the newest member of her harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a safety precaution, she was wearing Harry's invisibility cloak and had cast several silencing charms around the room to prevent anyone from overhearing the enslavement.  Furthermore, she was wearing her thickest stockings and shoes, drastically increasing the strength of her foot odor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the worst part of this whole plan, keeping those horrible tings on her feet.  She desperately wanted to free her feet and wiggle her toes on the fresh air, but that risked the smell warning Parvati before they were ready, defeating the whole purpose of the invisibility cloak in the first place.  Hermione's only option was to endure the wait.  Fortunately, she didn't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the classroom opened and her two slaves entered the classroom.  Well, slave and soon-to-be slave she amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Harry,\" said Parvati, \"what did you want to talk to me about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled.  \"Follow me,\" he told her, leading her to the desk right where Hermione was sitting, indicating for her to sit down.  Just as they planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, what's going on?\" Parvati said, confused as she sat down.  \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will,\" said Hermione, whipping off the cloak in a dramatic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione!\" began Parvati, as Harry hit her from behind with a binding hex.  It did its job instantly; Parvati was now as bound to her seat as if they had tied her up with rope.  Of course, the spell hadn't robbed her of her wits.  Nor had it removed her capability of screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP!  PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE, LAVENDER, ANYONE HELP!\"  Not that the screaming did her any good mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use, Parvati,\" smirked Hermione as she kicked off her shoes.  \"This room has silencing charms all around it.  No sound gets in and none gets out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of desperation, Parvati looked pleadingly at Harry.  \"Don't bother.  Harry here is my obedient slave,\" Hermione told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and soon, you'll be one too.\"  she answered, placing her stocking covered feet on Parvati's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati was flabbergasted.  She couldn't understand what was going on.  Why was Hermione doing this and what did she mean Harry was a slave and soon so would she.  Most of all, why had Hermione placed her feet on her face.  Was it revenge for all the times she had commented on how stinky they were in the Gryffindor common room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough now that they were right up in her face, they didn't smell that stinky.  Well, actually they did, but it was a good smell.  Really good actually.  Really, really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParati leaned back (as much as she could) and began to smell Hermione Granger's feet.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Noticing her boy-toy's anger and that Parvati was slowly falling under her control, she decided to kill two birds with one stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parvati, bite the very tip off my left stocking,\" she said moving her foot so that her toes where lined with Parvati's face, quickly adding, \"just the fabric mind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay,</i> thought Parvati as she bit the end of the stocking.  The stocking now secure, Hermione pulled her foot out of it to reveal her bare foot in all its glory.  Now free, Parvati was exposed to the full intoxicating power of the foot odor.  It was the most delightful thing she had ever smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her toes, Hermione said, \"Good, now the other foot.\"  Parvati bit on the second stocking, letting the first fall out of her mouth and on to her lap as Hermione pulled her right foot free.  With both feet completely bare, Hermione's feet were at their maximum potency.  \"Excellent work Parvati.  Now, you are going to lick and worship my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?  Is she nuts?

Smiling at her handiwork, she picked up her wand and pointed at her discarded stocking lying across Parvati's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wingardium leviosa.\"  The stocking flew into the air and soared to Harry who eagerly caught them.  \"Harry, why don't you enjoy those while I finish up with her.\"  Hearing this, he dove to the floor, his nose buried in the stockings.  As for Parvati, she was now fully consumed with worshiping her soon to be mistress's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" said Hermione.  \"All those times you insulted me about my stinky feet and now you can't get enough of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm,\" responded Parvati, not really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Parvati,\" said Hermione, pulling her feet away, \"who is your mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati stared at the saliva drenched soles in front of her.  \"You are Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" said Hermione, returning her feet to Parvati, while Harry rolled on the floor with the stockings.</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to Lavender, it had been two weeks since Hermione had enslaved Parvati to her feet, who had since been spending all her free time dutifully attending her mistress' feet.  As she didn't know the details, poor Lavender felt abandoned and replaced.  \"Fine, go be with you're new friends,\" she screamed, tears running down her cheeks as she ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lavender,\" called Parvati.  She wanted to go to and comfort her, reassure that they were still friends.  But then Hermione's feet popped into her head and all thoughts of Lavender were washed away.  She was a slave and had a duty to her mistress.   Five minutes later she was at the empty classroom that Hermione had appropriated for her use.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are Parvati,\" said Hermione.  \"Come and worship my right foot.\"  Harry was currently sucking Hermione's left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mistress,\" said Parvati, yet found herself unable to move.

Personally, Parvati thought it was wonderful idea; the two could spend more time together, while mistress would get an extra slave.  Everybody would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, she would make an excellent slave.  Wonderful idea, Parvati,\" said Hermione.  \"Go fetch her at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress Hermione,\" said Parvati, dashing out to find Lavender and bring her to be enslaved.  She was so excited that her best friend would soon be able to enjoy Hermione's feet with her.  And maybe when they were done serving Hermione, they'd be allowed to worship each other's feet.  It was an arousing idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hermione decided that her feet needed some more attention.  \"Harry, worship both of my feet will you?\" she said bring both her feet to Harry's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mistress Hermione,\" replied Harry.</span></div></div>",

Slowly though, his convulsions began to ebb, slowing down, and eventually coming to a complete stop. <br>\r\nEverywhere except for one place, that continued to arch... <br>\r\nHermione was freaking out. First Harry had stopped moving all together then he had begun to have a seizure under the table! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what he was doing, why he was doing it, or how she might get him <br>\r\nto do it again in the future.

Something about it had made <br>\r\nher feel good.... sexy.... dominant. Acting on some unknown instinct, she pulled <br>\r\nher left foot away from Harry's mouth and brought it towards the bottom of his robes, which were already hiked up from her other foot being on his throbbing cock. She put her foot under his knee and twisted it so she had his knee hooked. <br>\r\nBringing it up, she also brought his robes the rest of the way down, exposing his package to the chilly winter air. <br>\r\nShe then brought her other foot towards his newly bare cock and hugged it in between the arches of both of her feet. <br>\r\nThis new, raw instinct had taken control of Hermionie to the point where she barely realized what she was doing anymore, just knowing that it felt right, and made her <br>\r\nfeel sexy and dominant, awakening a tingling sensation in her own private area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first stroke, she knew that she had done the right thing. Harry couldn't suppress a moan of pleasure as her soles engulfed his second head. <br>\r\nShe stroked a few more times like that, but knew, somehow, that it wasn't enough.... not for what she had in mind anyway. <br>\r\nShe repositioned her feet so her toes wrapped around Harry's fully alert soldier, and started again. <br>\r\nGoing up and down.. <br>\r\nup and down... up, and down again. <br>\r\nDriving Harry mad. <br>\r\nAs they clenched and unclenched, he began to feel himself going to the edge. <br>\r\nThose amazingly sexy soles bringing him closer and closer. <br>\r\nHe couldn't hold it any longer, nor did he want to. He thought only of pleasing his new mistress and he could only assume that she wanted him to let her feel all of him, including his hot, gooey cum. <br>\r\nSo he shot. A load that he would have thought impossible, a huge amount of jizz exploding from his cock. So much at once that it almost hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he continued to orgasm, in absolute ecstasy, still spilling more and more of his nectar onto her feet and himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry and Hermione were walking along the corridors of Hogwarts after the entering class with their Dean Minerva MacGannagal and Hermione was dreadfully upset. In fact, she had all the rights to be in that bad mood as the last couple of days were awfully annoying. It all started when her parents and she returned to London from a trip around Euorope. For some reason, even though it was the 31-st of August, the British capital was under the terrible heat wave. The temperature was above 35 degrees Celsius and, if that wasn't enough, they got stuck in a horrible traffic jam for hours. The worst problem was that she was to be on the Hagwarts' express at 10 a. m. but it was impossible for Grangers family to make that huge detour to their house and get to the railway station in time. So her parents decided to head directly for the station as Hermione already had everything necessary in her travel bag after the trip. She wasn't particularly happy about that but at least she didn't need to carry all her stuff which she'd get later anyway. When she got on the train she was extremely tired and her feet were boiling as she was wearing her old converse without socks and she hadn't taken those off since the airport in Paris. She was eager to take a nap but her friends were all the way chatting about their summer experiences and arguing about which qwiddich team would win this year. The cherry on the cake was the fact that after they finally arrived at Hogwarts for what ever reason it was decided to make all the children sit an entrance class after dinner instead of letting them go sleep. So it was nine o'clock already and Hermione was getting more and more angry with her life and the people around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: Hermione, I literately don't understand why you've picked those ancient runes and numerology? These subjects are considered to be the hardest of all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Well, moreover, they are considered to be the most usefull. At least they are much more interesting and valuable than your predictions! I wonder why Professor Dumbledore hasn't still cancelled this course. It's just rediculus! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: It might be, but you can't deny the fact that I'll have a lot more  free time for having fun while you'll be calculating those numbers and memorizing lines and angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: You know what, Harry, I'm sick and tired of being the only one who cares about your future! If you forgot, you are the one who Lord Voldemort is hunting for! and it should be you who work hard and study the most appropriate subjects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: But, Hermione, it has been all right till now and nothing bad had happened so far. I'm strong enough to stand against Tom \u2014 I killed him once and I'll manage to do that once more. Calm down and try not to overreact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Overreact?! Everything has been all right?! You are just a silly kid Harry Potter! I'll show you how little you can do against a somewhat serious enemy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes him into an old classroom which hasn't been used for centuries and closes the door with a spell. She takes her magic wand in her hand and points it right to Harry's shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: Hermione, what are you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Expelliarmus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry evades the spell and tries to fight back with the tarantalegra spell. Hermione easily rejects it and sends it back to Harry. He manages to escape from the beam but Hermione's binding spell gets him and he falls on the floor all tied up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: What a hack you are doing, Hermione?! Dispel that and let me go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Huh, not that fast, little Harry. Now you how weak you truly are? You've provably learnt your lesson by now but, you know, I'm completely wasted after these few days and I want to relax. Moreover, for each lesson you have to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a chair and puts it over his chest so that the front legs are standing under each of his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry: What are you going to do? \u2014 he asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sits on the chair with one leg on each side of Harry's head, ignoring his words. She starts then to undo the laces on one of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: You know, Harry, I haven't taken these shoes off for three days in a row and my feet are killing me now. Perhaps, you wouldn't mind me using your face to refresh them a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would. He would definitely mind it because when her converses came off with a wet \"Plop!\" noise, the faint smell of rancid vinegar and pure sweat assaulted Harry's nostrils with tenfold intensity. Her long arched slender feet were a pinkish color with somewhat orange balls, and they were glistening with sweat! Harry could feel the heat coming off her feet and he didn't like that at all trying to move his face from his friend's hideous soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Oh, now I see why my parents forbade me from taking my shoes off in the plain \u2014 the passengers could have been quite upset. Anyway they were lucky unlike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs one of her converses and immediately buries Harry's nose into the mouth of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Before my feet will enjoy your face, you must enjoy the scent of my footwear. Now, breathe deeply in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to end this nightmare as soon as possible Harry takes a big whiff and starts coughing. The smell is totally revolting and can barely take it without puking. Unfortunately for him, Hermione orders him to continue sucking in the putrid stench. And Harry inhales deeper and deeper, feeling the sour, vinegary scent assaults his nose. His only source of air was that damp hot and sweaty stink emitting from the insides of Hermione's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of sniffing the malodorous converse Hermione decides to increase the level of her absentminded friend's  suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: You've done a good job. Now you are ready to begin the next task. Take your tongue out and start licking the insole! I wear these shoes every summer since I was eleven and they haven't been washed since that time, so they can really use a little tongue-bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he can't escape his fate Harry touches the sole of Hermione's converse with the tip of his tongue in attempt to clean the dirty heel stained insole. Immediately an eruption of flavor hits his tongue and spreads itself through his mouth. Harry instantly closes his mouth and tries to escape from his stinky prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: No-no-no... You stick out your tongue and give them a proper lick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHating the bushy-haired girl with super smelly feet sitting above him Harry submits and sticks his tongue out for the first lick, already disgusted by the smell, only to have his senses assaulted once again by the awful taste of her shoe's insole. Harry nearly pukes because of this. He can feel how moist and smelly the insole is with some black gunk made of Hermione's dead skin and sweat mashed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry yells \"It's gross, Hermione! Do you ever wash your feet?\" She takes her shoes from his face giving him an opportunity to breath somewhat clean air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione: Indeed i do, but this time you got unlucky. Now it's time for you to experience the real fragrance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to prove herself, Hermione placed the ball of her right foot close on Harry's nose, capturing his every breath underneath her sweaty sole letting the stink deep out towards his face. Her feet were hot and glistening with sweat. He took his first sniff of her acrid feet, struggling to keep the vomit in his mouth as Hermione giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 Nasty aren't they? \u2014She asked excitedly, wiggling her dripping toes above Harry's eyes. She hen began to slide her sweaty bare feet up and down, scrunching against his nose, her toenails digging into your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to stand the smell anymore Harry cried for help but Hermione was being quite loyal to her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snorted another deep breath from between her tight, smothering soles, your nose unable to escape from under the senator's rancid feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 I told you, I want you sniffing. Now. \u2014 Hermione said and with that she placed her sweaty toes directly over Harry's nose. He breathed the sweet stink of her feet .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rickety, sweaty, salty , vinegary smell engulfed Harry's world and sent his lungs screaming for fresh air. Hermione's barefoot toes were disgusting, the absolute stinkiest and sweatiest part of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione giggles moving Harry's nose inbetween her big and second toe, letting him sniff the worse part of her rancid, reeking feet \u2014 Give 'em a good whiff, Harry! They aren't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering what strengh he had left he stuck his nose between Hermione's toes and sniffed several hard long sniffes. It was easier to breath between her toes but her scent is much thicker. A vinegary feminine sweat smell was numbing his mind as he  inhaled. Harry tried to turn from the source of deadly aroma but Hermione immediately prevented that action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniff \u2014 commanded the bushy-haired girl, \u2014 Harry took in a deep breath as she started wiggling her toes, wafting her horrendous stenchup his nose, \u2014 Keep sniffing, do not stop until I tell you to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did he have? Just to commence the order and give up to the brain-burning fragrance while Hermione was wriggling her toes, mashing his face into their sweaty surfaces. That lasted for half an hour which seemed a century to poor Harry and after he was completely drenched with her foot sweat Hermione made up her mind that she wants her feet totally clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing that refusal would just lead to more punishment, Harry reluctantly stuck his tongue out and swipe it across her foot. The moment his tongue touched hermione's sole Harry tasted the salty cheesy sweat that covered the entirety of her foot. That feeling was almost unbearable but he kept forcing himself to lick and swallow. Harry had been licking just the half of the first foot but he was already totally disgusted and turned a sickly shade of green! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could taste was the acrid-smelling bare feet of his now former friend. Harry continued licking Hermione's feet starting down at her heels and working his way up, to him this was the most humiliating thing in the world, being forced to lick the dirty underside of his classmate's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wiggled her toes causing Harry to lick the bottoms of her feet faster and faster so she would enjoy that relaxing feeling of his tongue moving along her sole. However it didn't seem to work in his favor very well as her foot sweat seemed to poor down his throat by the bucket and she still wasn't pleased with his performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her soles were somewhat clean Hermione decided that it's high time Harry moved to the most delicious part of her feet. She ordered him to lick in-between her toes and eat whatever was there. Harry felt rather ill at the thought of doing this but Hermione's eyes started down at him intensely and he forced himself to continue this torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's foot lowered just in front of him, toes spread wide. Harry could see some black bits between them. The bushy-haired girl wiggled her toes, causing a small piece of gunk to come free and fall just on Harry's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm, that's the stuff, \u2014 Hermione murmured, \u2014 Eat that. Eat all my toe jam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rallied his strength and pulled himself over to her toes, sticking out his tongue and began to lick his friend's sweat away. He moved his tongue around her toes, trying to ignore the foul salty taste. Her toes wiggled on his tongue relishing more of the disgusting flavor. Licking the bottom of her toes, in-between them, and swallowing her toe jam was the absolute lowest point in Harry' life and he had to do it twice as Hermione had two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already midnight when Harry finished with her toes. He could clearly feel the flavor of cheese and vinegar on his tongue, and his face smelled like foul sweat but Hermione's feet were now quite clean and she was rather satisfied with his work. So she finally removed her soles from his face and put on her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a nice work. Now I'll leave you here to think of you behavior and you'd better change your attitude to life till next mornig. Otherwise... We can repeat that session. You know, I really enjoyed it and my feet are getting really tired after the day of running all over the castle. Your ties will fall in ten minutes and you'll be free for today. Good night for now, footboy, \u2014 With that said Hermione went out of the classroom leaving Harry alone with his thoughts. </span></div></div>",

He felt angry with the students for turning their backs on him for the second time since they've been at Hogwarts. He felt betrayed at Ron for believing that he cheated his way into competing in the tournament. He felt scared about the tasks to come. He felt fearful that Voldemort was involved somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut through it all, ig gave Harry clarity that Hermione was the most important person in his life. She did not betray him and offered to help him get ready for the tournament. Harry was determined to do anything to make sure Hermione didn't leave him; he felt he would break if that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever,his new found devotion to Hermione meant that he took things so far that Hermione knew something was up. Harry carried her books for her when they shared the same classes, he tried to stop asking Hermione for regular homework help so as not to disturb her (but Hermione made sure to help anyway), and when they were in the library, he would get her books without magic, exhausting him physically and then being too tired to do any studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the second such study session to prepare Harry for the tournament, Hermione decided to get to the bottom of it. A few seconds later, Harry came back with the latest book that she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Hermione. I was able to find it, said Harry as he was panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Harry, but we need to talk. I appreciate all the help you are giving me recently, but you're not even training for the tournament. The first task will be here before we know it. You're acting more like my errand boy than my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it that obvious? I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, but this whole tournament has made me realize that you are the one that's keeping me from losing sanity. I don't know wht I'd do if you left me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione felt a pang of sympathy as she knew that Ron's abandonment hurt Harry the most. But she couldn't wrap her mind about what Harry was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harry didn't even blink when I called him my errand boy. I understand wanting to help me a bit, but it's like he's willing to lower himself to me just to make sure I don't leave him. Perhaps I should give him a task so degrading that it'll surely knock back,' thought Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Harry. But you really must get to training for the tournament. So what I am about to ask you to do, think of this as part of your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hermione was about to give him his task, Hermione had another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if he actually does what I am about to ask? Am I willing to go down this rabbit hole with him, wherever it leads for us?'</span></div></div>",

B-but how?\" asked Harry confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your mouth and tongue of course. I want you to clean off all the dirt, toe jam, and whatever else is between my toes or on my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then closed her eyes as she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There, that should be a task so degrading to do, especially in the open in the library, that Harry would not do it. Finally, he can- wait, what's that?!' thought Hermione as she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hermione's great shock, Harry had gotten on his knees beside her and had taken her left foot in his hands before he started licking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was shocked as her best friend was actually doing this task, in the outside public of the library mind you, without any hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is going on? Harry's not acting as if we're best friends or even equals. It's as if he's put me on a pedastal above him, like I'm - oh that feels good!' thought Hermione as she was interrupted by a feeling that she was about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione tightened her eyes trying not to lose control. She had no idea if Harry had touched a part of her foot that felt pleasurable to her or if the trail of thought she was having was what caused it. Hermione opened her eyes and looked as Harry was cleaning her foot with more determination and focus than she had seen from Harry in a long while, if ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Harry was finished with her left foot and began working on cleaning her right foot. Hermione was ablr to control her urges as she just watched Harry clean her feet as if nothing else mattered in the world.

He heard some footsteps coming into the room, but he didn't bother to look up and see who it was. With any luck, they would see he was busy and not try to start up a conversation or anything. The steps grew closer and a shadow fell across the pages. Looking up, he saw Hermione with on hand on her hip and the other holding out a tin can with SPEW on the side in bright blue letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to make a donation?\" She asked in a tone that implied that this was not actually a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already gave two sickles when I joined.\" Harry said as he looked down at his book. \"Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, funds are low and we need more money for flyers that I plan on putting around school and in Hogsmeade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry kept trying to read as he responded, \"Seriously Hermione,  this whole crusade of yours is kinda pointless; the house-elves love serving wizards. Now can I please get back to studying?\" Harry paused to consider the role reversal in this situation. It was usually him interrupting her when she studied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just don't understand! These are creatures compelled by magic to serve others! They need to be freed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't guess I do understand, but I do understand that I have a test tomorrow in potions and I've put off studying until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione threw the empty SPEW can on the ground. \"I'll make you understand!

He wanted to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth opened slowly, \"Hermione...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could utter another word, She flicked her wand. A stinging sensation overwhelmed his face and he fell to the floor at Hermione's feet. But that wasn't what hurt the most. What hurt was that he knew he must have displeased Hermione. He wanted to ask what he had done wrong, but was afraid that by speaking, he might displease her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me Hermione?\" she giggled. Harry nodded slowly. \"Well, that was your first mistake. Hermione is what my friends call me. You are not my friend. You are my slave, and as such, you will refer to me as 'Mistress'. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress!\" Harry blurted out as he nodded his head. Hermione smiled in response and Harry felt a tingle of pleasure throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione watched in amusement as her slave took such pleasure in his own submission. \"I think I ought to explain how this spell works. Your emotions are tied to my own. If I am happy, you'll be happy. If I am disappointed, you will be disappointed. In short, I own you and will continue to own you until I've decided you've learned your lesson.\" She paused a moment and twisted her hair as she thought. \"Your first lesson will be in humility. A slave owns no clothes. Clothes are for free people.\" With that she waved her wand once more and Harry was suddenly naked. He instinctively tried to cover himself. Hermione blushed slightly at the sight and gave an approving eye to her slave's physique. Due to the magic bond, this pleased Harry as well. So much so that he ceased trying to cover himself so that his mistress could get a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed quite loudly at this. \"Very nice my slave, but this simply won't do. Go retrieve one of your bed sheets. You will make yourself a covering out of it as best you can.\"  Harry scrambled to get up the stairs. Not so that he could hide his shameful state, but so that he could impress Hermione with his obedience. Hermione just smiled to her self and sat down in the chair where Harry had previously been studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about ten minutes, Harry was kneeling at Hermione's feet. He had cut a hole in the middle of his sheet and had tied it together at his waist with a strip of sheet he had cut from the bottom. He looked a little like an over sized house-elf. This pleased Hermione, which made Harry Happy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright slave, I think its time...</span></div></div>",

He didn't move too quickly because he didn't want to cause his mistress any discomfort, but he could hardly contain his excitement. He had long fantasized about this moment. Or had he? It was difficult for him to determine whether he had actually wanted to do this before, or if the spell was altering his memory. These thoughts only passed through his mind for an instant before they were replaced by another one: no matter if he had wanted this before, he wanted this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished untying the shoe, he placed it respectfully on the ground and then removed the next shoe. After that, he began slowly peeling away the socks. This tickled Hermione and the sensation travelled to Harry via the spell. The tickling sensation combined with the pleasure he was receiving from serving his mistress. It became overwhelming euphoria. He couldn't think straight. His vision began to grow fuzzy at the edges. All he could focus on were his mistress' now bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took a look at the shoes and socks that her pet had put aside. She considered ordering him to take them and inhale their scent or put them in his mouth to gag on, but then she reconsidered. If she did that, the spell might take that as a signal that she had given him clothes and thus release him from her service. This frustrated her a great deal and she would need to think of a way to get Harry to taste her socks without being released inadvertently. Perhaps she would just give the socks to Harry as a gift when she was finally ready to free him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frustration and annoyance that Hermione was feeling was instantly transferred to Harry who was taken out of his daze. He felt awful. He needed to make Hermione happy again so that he could feel that euphoria again. It was the greatest sensation he had ever felt in his entire life and he had to feel it again. \"Mistress...?\" He began before he was quickly silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, in her frustration had decided to stomp-kick her slave in the face. \"Decided\" might be the wrong word as it was purely instinctual. She looked at her slave sprawled on his back from the force of her kick. She felt better by getting that out of her system. In fact, she felt great. She felt so dominant... so invigorated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis translated into Harry feeling wonderful as well. His face certainly hurt, but the tingles of pleasure rushing through his body far outweighed the soreness of his face. He wasn't sure, but he felt as though his lip might be busted. He absentmindedly licked his lips to check for blood. To his surprise, he tasted no blood, but he did taste some of the residue left by Hermione's foot. It was salty and tasted awful, but he soon found himself licking his lips again. And again. Even after the residue was completely gone, he kept licking just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione watched this bizarre behavior for a minute and it amused her greatly and gave her an idea. She didn't just want her feet massaged, she wanted them worshipped. \"Slave.\" She said in a stern, no-nonsense voice. Harry sat up rigid as he awaited his command. \"Come over here and kiss my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry crawled to her on hands and knees and took her right foot in hand and began to kiss it multiple times. Slow and gently first and then more rapid and passionate. As Hermione exulted in her dominance, Harry's brain responded by telling the rest of him that he was in heaven. He soon took hold of the left foot as well and began kissing the both of them in turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at about this time that Ginny walked into the common room through the portrait hole. She just stared at the pair of them for a moment until Hermione noticed her and tilted her head back to say \"Oh, hello Ginny. DIdn't see you there.\" Ginny could tell from the tone of her voice and the look on her face that Hermione was quiet pleased with herself. She couldn't make out Harry's expression as his face was buried in Hermione's feet. She opened her mouth to say something. She didn't know what, and no one would ever know as nothing came out. She blushed until her whole face was red as her hair and then she scurried awkwardly up the stairs to the girls' beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she might have gotten a little jealous...\" Hermione mused, \"... wouldn't you agree, my pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked up from his mistress' feet to ask, \"Who?\" He had been so enraptured by his task that a wild pack of hippogriffs could have come through the common room and he'd have paid them no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny. You know, Ron's sister. The one that has a crush on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know Ginny... could I please kiss your feet some more mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione put her index finger to her chin as she thought about it. \"No, now I want you to suck my toes. Be sure to lick out and swallow any of the gunk you find between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry went at this new task with an appetite. He licked up all the sweat, dirt, and who knows what else and swallowed it gladly. Each toe he sucked and swirled with his tongue until they were covered in his saliva which he then tried to suck off to leave the toes as dry as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Hermione picked the SPEW can back up. It was great that Harry was learning his lesson to help understand the plight of house-elves everywhere, but SPEW was still low on much-needed funds. Since Harry was her slave, she could simply order him to make a donation of just about any amount she might want. This idea seemed to cross a line in her mind though. Slave or not, Harry was still her friend and she didn't want to steal from him. She just wanted him to learn his lesson. She looked down at him, so engrossed in his work when an idea came to mind. A charity auction. She would get a bunch of girls together and they'd bid for the privilege of having the boy who lived serve them for one twenty-four hour period. Any proceeds would go to the SPEW treasury so she could buy the flyers, Harry would learn more about how terrible it is to be a slave, and one lucky girl would have a slave for a day. It sounded like a win-win-win situation to her if she ever heard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained her plan to Harry who broke down in tears and hugged Hermione's leg. He was devastated. The entirety of his existence revolved around making Hermione happy and her being pleased with him. If she were so quick to toss him aside... he just hated to think about what it might mean. \"Please mistress! Don't make me leave you! I belong at your feet! No other girl is as perfect as you! If I've displeased you, I will do better I promise! Just don't make me leave you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked down at her sobbing slave and reconsidered for a moment.</span></div></div>",

QUESTION. YOUR. MISTRESS!\" Hermione finished her screams with a kick to the ribs. She then began to stomp on her slave as he lay in the fetal position. These were not well aimed stomps and most landed on Harry's legs and arms. She stopped when she saw that he was now bruised all up and down his limbs. She had no idea what had come over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was nauseous. The kick and the stomps hurt, but not as bad as the knowledge that he had enraged his mistress with his selfish request. As far as he was concerned, he deserved to be stomped on and trampled for having displeased the beautiful, intelligent, and perfect goddess that was Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked him over and saw how miserable she had made her slave, Hermione felt guilty. She had not meant to stomp on Harry like that. She kneeled down and started stroking his hair. \"There there, it won't be so bad. It will only be for one day, and I will be so happy with all the money you'll have raised for SPEW.\" She noticed that Harry had begun to smile. \"And I'll give you a reward if you serve your temporary mistress well... a foot job.\" Harry looked up at his mistress and his eyes widened. He had to please his mistress, and he had to get that foot job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at around 5, a gathering of girls had been assembled for the auction in an empty class room. Harry looked out among the girls. Most of the faces were familiar, although he didn't know all of their names. He saw among the crowd the Patil twins (who planned on sharing Harry if they won), Ginny, and Cho Chang. Before Hermione's spell, he would have been overjoyed to know that his crush would be interested in bidding on him, but now he only saw her as a means to please Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gave a loud cough which caught the attention of all the girls present. \"Hello, and welcome to the first ever SPEW charity auction.

In the end, Ginny won out at 1 galleon, 3 sickles, and 7 knuts. Hermione was quite surprised by this turn of events. The Weasleys were poor and she knew that Ginny must have scraped up ever coin she had to take part in this auction. She might have even had to borrow some for this. Harry had knelt down during the bidding and was know grasping Hermione's leg. He kept kissing the area right above her knee slowly and trying not to break into tears. He had to put on a brave face if he wanted to earn that foot job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny walked up to the front of the classroom where Hermione stood with Harry at her feet. Hermione held out the can into which Ginny emptied out her pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he was worth the money, Ginny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he will be.\" The grin on her face seemed both victorious and sadistic, although Harry wasn't looking at her. He was too busy trying to drink in as much of Hermione's perfection as he could before he was ripped away from her for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let loose, slave!\" Hermione commanded, kicking with her left foot as she doubted Harry would move quickly enough if she didn't use a good kick. The foot landed just below the ribs and gave a sharp pain causing the boy to roll over on his back. It was from this position that he saw Ginny. She was looking down at him with a strange look on her face. Harry wasn't sure if she was angry or excited, or what. He began to get up when Ginny put her foot on his chest and pushed him back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, many girls were still in the room and watching with awe. Ginny looked over her shoulder at them. \"Show's over. I won him and I don't feel like sharing.\" At this the girls began to slowly file out of the room. All of them paused a moment to look down at Harry before they left. Most of them looked jealous, a few of them looked horny, and Cho gave Harry a look that might have been pity or regret. The thought that his crush might have some sort of feelings for him made him feel a little better and he began to smile as he watched her walk away. He tried to get a peak up her skirt when the spell's magic kicked in. He suddenly realized that it didn't matter if Cho liked him or not. He didn't care about that, he only cared what Hermione though about him. He turned his head until it was flat on the floor and looked at Hermione's feet while the rest of the girls continued their exodus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so you have custody of him until this time tomorrow at which point he will be mine once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" She looked down at Harry, \"We are going to have to fit a lot of fun in those 24 hours. Isn't that right Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't respond immediately and Ginny raised her foot up and slammed the heel down right into his solar plexus. He sputtered and looked up to her. \"Yes, Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be Mistress now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked to Hermione who nodded her head. \"Yes, for the next 24 hours you will refer to her as mistress if she so desires.\" She then began to walk out the door and turned just before leaving \"Remember to be a good boy if you want your treat!\" and with that she disappeared down the hallway leaving the two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I serve you, Mistress Ginny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your hands and knees.\" Harry did so and Ginny sat down on his back and took hold of his hair as if they were reigns. \"GIDDYUP!\" she shouted and kicked him in the side with her heels. Harry began crawling out into hall where Ginny yanked his head to the left and gave him another kick. This continued for a good twenty minutes. Harry's stomach was bruising from all the kicks he was receiving. Once, a kick had gone so far back as to hit him in the testicles. He yelped in pain and fell on his face. Ginny responded by standing up and kicking Harry until he got back on all fours at which point she sat back down. It was becoming clear where they were headed to once they started going down the stairs. They were headed for the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ginny was a petit girl, but carrying her all this way on his hands and knees was exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to comply, but an order from Ginny didn't carry the same magical effect that an order from Hermione would. As such, he was having a lot harder time getting his beleaguered body to answer him. When he didn't she of course responded with more kicks. When it was obvious that this wasn't going to get him up, she retrieved two shackles from the wall and locked them around Harry's wrists. With a wave of her wand, they began to retract back into the wall dragging Harry with them until they pulled him into a vertical position. He was now half-standing, half hanging with his arms bound directly over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny walked up to the ragged slave and, much to his surprise, kissed him. It was just a peck on the lips at first, followed by a more passionate one. She thrust her tongue into his mouth and swished it around. Harry was too weak to fight back and was in fact, enjoying it. She then broke off the kiss and whispered in his ear \"Did you like that Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was hoarse, but he managed a reply. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might. Its just a shame you've been ignoring me all this time to lust after that Cho Chang slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harry could utter a syllable, he felt Ginny's knee ramming into his crotch. He tried to scream in pain, but there wasn't enough air in his lungs and all that came out was a wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny stepped back and began kicking at Harry's balls, but he had crossed his legs by this point and she Ginny couldn't make any direct hits. \"Spread em!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did not comply \"Ginny, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread them or I'll tell Hermione what a worthless slave you've been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Hermione being disappointed in him filled him with dread. She had told him to treat Ginny as if she were his mistress. Resigning himself to the pain, he opened his legs and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smirked and began an assault on Harry's balls. He deserved this, she reasoned to herself. After all, she had not made her infatuation with him any mystery. And yet he ignored her. He caused her untold heartache all because he was too busy chasing the skirt of that stupid, skanky, Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry cried out quite loudly at first, but soon his whole body was numb with pain and he didn't feel the need to scream any more. He wasn't sure how long it took before he passed out from the pain or how long he was out, but he was awoken when the chains in the wall extend once more, dropping him onto the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

She smirked a little and then dumped out a pile of socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took me about an hour to get all of these together. Hope you took that time to rest up real well, because I have work for you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry hoped he wouldn't have to wash all of these socks. He would soon wish that that was all he would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to ring the sweat out of them into this goblet!\" she she laughed as she produced a brass goblet and placed it on the ground in front of him. \"Also, on your knees and elbows. I'll be sitting on your back while you perform this task. So, it would be in both our best interests if you didn't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis limbs were a little more rested now, so Harry was able to get on his elbows and knees fairly easily. However, he nearly collapsed from Ginny's weight. He moved his hand using his elbow as a fulcrum and picked up a sock. It reeked of sweat and grim. Twisting it with all his strength, he managed to retrieve a single drop. He reached for the next, already dreading what would be done with the collected sock juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to take hours, but in the dungeons, there was no way to be sure. When he had finished, the goblet had a few inches worth of sweat, grime, gunk, and who knows what else in it. Sliding off the ragged boy's back, Ginny picked up the goblet and took a whiff. She feigned appreciation for it, \"My my, what a delightful scent. I'm sure its just going to taste wonderful.\" She got down on her knees and tilted it towards Harry, \"Wanna sip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it wouldn't do any good, but Harry shook his head weekly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny whipped out her wand \"Dehydrinase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Harry was overwhelmed with thirst. It felt as though his throat was cracking. He had to drink something. He lunged for the goblet but the shackles kept him back. \"Please mistress, let me drink, I'm dying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny cackled, \"I think I could hear a little more begging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tears in his eyes at this point \"Please mistress Ginny... I need to drink it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My generosity is just too great.\" she smiled, handing over the goblet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gulped it down immediately and immediately he regretted it. His thirst vanished instantly and he was left with a vulgar taste in his mouth He began to wretch but he managed to keep from vomiting. He was sure vomiting would only make things worse for him. He began to cough violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny watched these spasms with an amused look on her face. \"Put the socks back in the sack. Its bed-time and we'll need to get back before curfew.\" With a wave of her wand, the shackles left Harry and he began to pick up the socks. He then carried Ginny on his back while holding the sack in his mouth. In this miserable condition he finally made it back to the Gryffindor common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry dropped Ginny off at the foot of the stairs leading to the girls' beds and began to turn towards his own when Ginny stopped him. \"You'll be with me tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, boys aren't even able to go up those steps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because they aren't trustworthy. If they can be made into less of a threat to our innocence, they can go up the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I do that?\" Harry asked with genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With one of these!\" Ginny flourished a small, golden chastity device. \"With this on, you couldn't deflower a girl no matter how much you might want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't even try to resist as Ginny bent down to lock the cage on his cock. Once it was closed, she began to walk up the stairs and Harry followed her. When they got to her bed, she put her arms out. \"Disrobe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling fingers, Harry began to remove one article of clothing at a time. As more and more of her lithe frame revealed itself, Harry's member strained against it's bonds. It caused him a lot of pain, but he gritted his teeth and kept on. Soon, the young Weasley girl was just down to her bra and panties. He didn't know if he should go any farther or not. Ginny sensed the pause and reached around to unstrap her own bra. She turned to face him. Harry winced in pain as his dick ached against the cage. Her breasts weren't the largest, but they were perky and round. In the low light, the shadows cast over them were intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny moved fluidly over to her bed and lay down. She looked up at Harry as she reclined on her side and gave her last order for the night.</span></div></div>",

It was one thing to worship Hermione's feet. As his mistress, her pleasure resulted in his own. This would not be the case here. He started with a kiss on the top of each foot. Then he kissed each toe. He was kissing first because kissing required less tasting. After a while, he began to lick. It didn't taste as good as Hermione's due to the absence of a magical pleasure-share, but it wasn't as bad as he might have thought. He considered this and decided it must be because he'd been doing all of Ginny's walking for her. Finally he began to suck her toes. He dedicated a lot of time to each toe and licked in between them. After having licked, kissed, and sucked, he was running out of ideas. But the night was still far from over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, he could just start the whole process over again and just kiss, lick, and suck until dawn... but then he began to look upon her body lying there clothed only with shadows, and he began to ache again. Perhaps if he worshipped her feet properly, she'd allow him some release in the morning, he thought. However, she looked to be asleep. How would she know one way or the other?</span></div></div>",

He began to lick her feet to the point that small rivers of drool began to form and work their way down to her bed. Each toe was given a royal treatment as he sucked and licked as if his life depended on them. Then he began the cycle over. And over again. He continued until small pools of saliva moistened the bed sheets at her feet. Feeling his work there was done, he moved up her legs. By morning he was kissing and licking her calves and about to start on the knees when he heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to worship my feet, not my legs...\" Harry cringed at this, \"...but I guess I can accept this as proper tribute. Now move up a bit further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked to her in shock. Did she mean what He thought she meant? As if reading his mind, she nodded and motioned for him to get on the bed with her. Harry was a virgin. Up until last night, he had never even seen a naked girl before. Tentatively, he got onto the bed and moved his head into position between Ginny's legs. He felt her grab his hair and pull him in. Not knowing what else to do, he began to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moaning, Harry knew he must be doing something right. Harry had often fantasized about what his first time would be like. It had never occurred to him that when the day finally arrived, he'd be a slave in a chastity tube. His thoughts were interrupted as Ginny exploded with a scream and pulled Harry in deeper. He kept going until she let loose another and released him. Using his makeshift garment, he wiped the juices from his face. At  Ginny's command, he began to dry her off in similar fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny arose from her bed and put her arms up for Harry to begin to dress her. When he was done she turned to him and kissed him on the cheek. She seemed to be be happier with the afterglow, but Harry doubted it would last. \"Well slave, I have you for several more hours, but they are mostly filled with classes. Hermione really should have held that auction on a friday so I could have you to myself on saturday. Oh well...\"</span></div></div>",

At Ginny's command, he carried it downstairs and out the portrait hole and into the hallway. Harry and Ginny both ignored the questioning by the fat lady as to what it was they thought they were doing. Ginny picked up the chain, stood behind Harry and reached through his legs to attach the chain to a loop in is his chastity cage. Then she sat down in the wagon and shouted \"Mush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did his best to make it to all of Ginny's classes. He ran as fast as he could considering he had to pull a young girl along with him by his crotch. Whenever he began to slow down, Ginny would just kick him in the balls. This would slow him down for a few seconds, but he would then move much quicker. The pain was bad, but he was used to it at this point. No, the worst part was the humiliation. Up to this point, Harry's enslavement had been kept to a minimum. The most people who had seen him at once were the girls who Hermione had invited to the auction. Now it was the whole school. They all stopped to turn and stare as he pulled Ginny along while wearing nothing but a bed sheet. He crossed Ron at one point who opened his mouth to ask what was going on, but didn't know if he should direct his question to his best friend or his little sister. Come to think of it, he didn't even know what question to ask first. In the end, Ron just stared openmouthed while the pair scooted along. Harry was happy for that because he wasn't sure how he'd have responded had his friend said anything. And he really couldn't take the time in any case as he needed to get Ginny to her class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it to Ginny's first class on time. She slid out of the wagon and patted Harry on the head. \"You just wait here for me, ok?\" Harry nodded, knowing there wouldn't be enough time for him to run to his own class anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, he pulled her to her next class and then to lunch where she unhooked the wagon so Harry could fit under the table in the great hall. Ginny put together a plate of food for Harry and put it down on the floor for him. Before he could eat any of it, Ginny put her foor right in the middle of it. She then lifted it up and wiggled it. Harry knew without being told that he'd need to eat the food off the bottom of the shoe before he'd be allowed to eat it off the plate. He began licking long up and down the shoe and then began to focus on the tip of his tongue to get the food out of all the crevices. Then he began on eating the food off of the plate. Mostly it was stuff like mashed potatoes which were easier to fit into all the nooks of a shoe. He had no silverware, so he had to use his hands and tongue to scrape up every last piece of food. He was too hungry to leave anything on the plate. When he was done, Ginny gently pulled his head onto her lap and began to stroke and pet him while she talked to her friends. As lunch came to an end, Harry crawled out from under the table and stood at attention while Ginny reattached the wagon and they were off to class again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle, Harry had managed to get Ginny to every class on time. Sometimes they had cut it close, but they made it. Now it was drawing near to the hour when Ginny would have to give Harry back and she just had him wander through the hallways pulling her along. She was parading him for all to see, but Harry didn't mind. Harry was ecstatic. He knew that soon he would be reunited with his true mistress and all would be right in the world once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the moment arrived. Ginny removed the wagon and the chastity tube as Hermione walked up to them. Harry could sense that Hermione was happy to see him. The joy began to well up in him once more as the magic of the enslavement spell began it's work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was alright, I guess. I'd probably bid on him again if I had the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your personal opinion, was he good enough for a foot job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny laughed, \"Not a chance. In fact, I'd be willing to lend you this chastity tube if you'd like just to keep him from having any undeserved pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked from Ginny to her slave and thought.</span></div></div>",

He thought he comprehended just what a foot job meant, but he was too busy drinking in Hermione's beauty to really think about anything other than the now. Being in range of Hermione caused their master/slave connection to grow strong once more. Already it was causing Harry to  forget how hard Ginny had made him, or that he had serviced her, or that he had energetically worshipped her feet all night. It was becoming a blur. A blur in which the only thing that mattered was getting back to Mistress Hermione. \"Mistress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione placed both hands on her hips and cocked her head, \"Yes slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... let me serve you.\" Harry said. It was half whisper, half moan. All desperate. He was once again entirely dependent on Hermione and his only thought was pleasing her. Hermione just watched as he kneeled down before her and began to kiss her on her thigh. She reached down to pet him gently. It was strange for her to see her friend like this. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't normal. It looked to her like Harry had finally learned what it was to be a slave. Perhaps he'd finally be able to understand why it was that the house-elves had to be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want from you slave, is for us to find ourselves a quiet place where we won't be disturbed. Harry nodded as he began to lick her knee. This tickled Hermione and Harry was able to share in that pleasure. \"That means your going to half to stand up now.\" Harry did as he was told and the two of them found an empty class room. At Hermione's word, Harry closed all the blinds. He turned to see that Hermione had already removed her shoes and socks. She was starting on her robe. Harry watched in wonder until all that was left was her skirt. She sat on the desk and motioned for Harry to come closer. Harry did so. He was doing his best not to blink. He didn't want to miss even a moment of this. Her breasts were perfect. Ginny's were a faint memory and these were the best he'd ever seen. And the way her hair spilled onto her bare shoulders, he could hardly contain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry complied. His breath nearly stopped as Hermione grabbed the bottom of his sheet with her toes and lifted it up, revealing his throbbing member. Then she began to lightly rub her foot up and down the shaft while the other foot moved in to fit the tip into her arch. Harry didn't last long. Soon he was spurting globs onto the bottom of Hermione's foot. She just smiled and shifted it to Harry's mouth where he began to lick it clean. Hermione was aroused as she'd never been before. This passion went through the empathic link and Harry began to lose all sense of himself as he tried to make sense of the powerful emotions and urges that were flying through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione stopped herself before she did anything rash. Surely Harry had learned his lesson. Perhaps it would be best if she just released him now before she did something she'd regret...</span></div></div>",

That didn't seem fair to her. For fairness sake, she had to keep Harry a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her foot from Harry's mouth, she asked \"What did Ginny have you do for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked at his mistress with an enraptured expression and recounted the various tortures he had endured, and how he had serviced her orally. Hermione blushed with jealousy as she stomped her foot back down in Harry's face. He didn't even try to dodge or block it. As far as he was concerned, he had earned this punishment by displeasing his master. As he awaited his next command, Harry began to feebly kiss the bottoms of his mistress' feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin massaging my feet while I think of what to do with you, slave.\" Harry began kneading the bottoms of her feet without hesitation. He could tell that it felt good to her, and that was all he needed to be content. Because she didn't seem to mind, Harry began to intersperse the massage with worshipful kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked back down at her slave and realized that he didn't deserve any cruelty. He had only done as she'd wanted. He'd followed orders of his temporary mistress. As she looked upon him, she couldn't blame Ginny either. She knew what she had to do. She moved her left foot away from Harry's hands and began to move his member about. Within moments, it was ready for action once more. She slid off of the table and onto Harry's penis. Harry stopped massaging as he felt an exciting new sensation. He looked to see his mistress straddling him. Then Hermione began to ride him back and forth. Neither of them had done this before, so the act was brief. Harry felt himself expel his seed into Hermione. At the same time, Hermione shuddered in ecstasy and fell forward on her slave. Both of them were panting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked into his mistress' face. He knew that she was happier now than she had ever been. He felt honored to have been given her virginity like this. It was then that the magic of the bond began to fill him with dread and he didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione, however, did. She began to think of the reality of the situation. She could never release Harry now. She had essentially raped him. People went to Azkaban for that kind of thing. Harry might forgive her, but she couldn't take that kind of risk. For better or worse, she had to keep him as her slave for the rest of his life.</span></div></div>",

However, I'd suggest you start with a foot massage... he's quite good at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty ravenclaw girl twisted a lock of hair as she looked down at Harry, \"I think I just might.\" She sat at a desk and kicked off her shoes. \"Alright Harry, show me what you can do. Harry looked up from the ground where he was kneeling to his mistress. Hermione nodded her approval and he crawled over to Cho and began loosening up the muscles in her feet. As he worked, Choe's toes began to wiggle with pleasure. He took off her socks so as to get to her feet better and began moving his thumbs in circular motions all up and down her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho looked to Hermione, \"I think I've got things under control here. Thanks for the slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thank you for your generous donation to SPEW. Just remember, you only have him for 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho nodded and Hermione walked out the door. \"So, Harry, I know you have a bit of a crush on me.\" Harry continued working. \"Or at least you did, before Hermione enslaved you, am I right?\" Harry nodded blankly as he sought to fulfill his duties to his temporary mistress. Cho continued on, \"It seems cruel that a girl would cast the enslavement spell on her friend like that. However...\"</span></div></div>",

Cho squealed with delight as his tongue washed over her soles, covering them in saliva.  \"Keep going, Harry.  Suck my toes!\"  He wrapped his lips around her toes, his tongue darting in-between her toes, but unlike Cho, he felt no pleasure in this.  Cho was pretty and her feet were nice, but she wasn't Hermione.  Only Hermione's feet were pleasurable to worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this was lost on Cho.  \"Harry, stop!\" she ordered.  He did.  \"From this point on, you will put any and all thoughts of Hermione Granger out of your mind and focus solely on me and my feet.\"  She expected him to comply, but instead he just shook his head.  Cho cursed, clearly he was to strongly enslaved to Hermione for her to just order him to adore her.  However, maybe she could alter it instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her wand and cast a her spell.  As the spell hit him, Harry went form looking at Cho with indifference to adoration.  Cho smiled, while she hadn't removed the spell, she had substituted his desire for Hermione with her.  Mind you, it wasn't a perfect spell.  Shortly after leaving her presence, he would revert back fully under Hermione's thrall.  Still, at least she would get his best now.  \"Harry,\" she said, \"worship my feet.  And this time, do it with passion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stared at Cho's feet and was overwhelmed with desire; he loved her feet, needed her feet, would do anything for her feet.  He worshiped her with such passion she couldn't believe it.  Harry sucked her soles, planting large wet kisses.  He dragged his tongue up and down her feet.  At one point, Cho even shoved her whole foot into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting seriously turned on at this point, pressure building in her waist.  \"It's a pity I only have you for a day, right Harry?\"  As his mouth was full of her feet, all he could say was \"oursdcbahkmisdcressld.\"  For a brief second, Cho contemplated keeping Harry as her personal foot worshiper.  Then she realized the difficulties with such a thought and threw it aside.  \"No, Hermione's spell is stronger than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe she would be able to borrow him again some time.  And so long as Hermione was unaware of the spell Cho had cast, she would be able to return Harry to this state whenever she desired, so long as she was barefoot that of course.  That was the trigger she'd made for her spell, her bare feet.  So long as she was shod, Harry would be Hermione's, who would be none the wiser to what she had done.  After all, it wasn't as if the two of them were going to be playing footsie anytime soon.  For some reason, the thought of Hermione's feet made her feel even more horny than having her feet worshiped by the boy she liked.  She tried to shake it off, but just wouldn't leave her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she feeling like this?  <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

So, hidden under the cloak, she had given Cho a taste of her own medicine; a foot fetish for a particular girl's feet, one that bordered on obsession.  While it did not grant the total obedience of the enslavement spell, it had the benefit of leaving the mental facilities and initiative of the target fully intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Cho, she was having her soles licked and her toes sucked, all while imagining doing the same to Hermione.

She gazed fixedly upon the ceiling until Hermione came into view. \"So, you think you were doing this for Harry's own good? I'll show you what effect you've had on Harry's well being.\" With a wave of Hermione's wand Cho began to rise off the ground and her body reoriented until she was upright once more. Then she was leaned against the wall and the levitation spell was cancelled. From this point on, she was forced to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, get over here!\" Hermione bellowed. Harry crawled over to her like an over-excited puppy. \"We're going to show Cho all the good things she's done for you!\" Harry wasn't sure what this meant exactly, but then he was kicked in the face. He rolled over in pain, at which point Hermione began to stomp him. Cho wanted to cry out, but the body binding curse was completely effective. Hermione then had Harry lay on his back and spread his legs. She delivered a powerful kick to his groin. Harry cried out in pain... and ecstasy. He was overjoyed because Hermione was getting quite the mood boost form this demonstration. Hermione brushed her hair out of her face and turned to Cho, who was by this point crying from pity and fear. Hermione raised her wand, and let loose the enslavement spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho's mind raced as she tried to think of something other than Hermione, but she failed at every attempt. Soon, she could think of nothing but Hermione. Hermione released her of the body-bind curse. Stumbling forward, Cho looked at Hermione, \"...mistress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip down, slaves aren't allowed clothing.\" They were in a hallway, but there was no one around at the moment. Cho raced to remove every piece of fabric from her body. Hermione inspected her new slave. Looking at her beautiful body, Hermione felt a twinge of jealousy. This negative motion affected Cho as well, who suddenly felt very ashamed of her appearance. \"Harry, share some of that cloth with Cho. We want her covered up. Harry nodded. Due to the spell, he wanted Cho covered up quickly as well so Hermione would stop feeling jealous. He began to tear at the cloth he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Cho had a piece of cloth wrapped around her waist and another around her chest. Harry's tunic now barely covered his private regions due to the loss of fabric. Hermione looked over both her slaves as they stood at attention, side by side.</span></div></div>",

Hermione was thrilled. It was great having Harry as her slave, but he could only take care of one foot at a time. She had felt like a powerful woman before. Perhaps as a princess with Harry as a very submissive knight. Now that she had two slaves, she was clearly more than a princess, perhaps a queen. Sitting in her \"throne\" with her two subjects adoring her, she certainly felt like a queen. She wondered if more slaves could make her a goddess... Hermione shook her head. She was letting this power go to her head, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Harry and Cho were hard at work. Harry was rubbing Hermione's right foot and giving a rather fantastic massage. Cho was sucking the toes of the left foot, trying to get any gunk out from between them.

She stood and patted Harry on the head, bringing it in to rest on her hip, embracing the sensuality that she felt in having made this boy adore her.

If hes kissing her feet right away, he wondered how long it would be until he was kissing a bit higher. He gave a light kiss to the tip of Hermione's shoe and looked at her anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Ron. Now say 'Thank you, mistress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's just one thing left to do.

Then of serving Hermione, then of doing anything for Hermione. The last thought before he opened his eyes again was of Hermione smiling and how wonderful it would be to make her happy. As his lids lifted, he looked into Hermione's eyes. \"...mistress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione stood up and motioned for Ron to do the same. Then she locked lips with him. Her tongue breached his mouth and subdued his tongue. After about ten seconds she pushed him away. \"A promise is a promise.

In the corner, was even a small kitchen area where her slaves could cook for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, my slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCho blushed with excitement at this praise. \"Thank you, my mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry watched as Hermione strutted across the room and sat in the throne.

And make something simple for yourself and the rest of the slaves.\" Ginny shot up to do as she was told. \"Who out of you three has any experience giving foot massages before becoming my slave?\" Harry almost raised his hand at this until the word \"before\", so he just sat and looked a little disapointed. Ron however, did raise his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione raised her eyebrow \"Really? How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister used to have me rub her feet all the time. It was hers or mum's, and I preferred hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked to Ginny in the kitchen \"How good is Ron at these massages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he was the best out of my brothers. Only dad could do better, but he had a lot of practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione shook her head and chuckled. She had known that Mrs. Weasley ruled the roost, but didn't know it was this bad. \"Alright Ron, we'll see if you have what it takes to be official foot rubber. You can take my right foot and Harry can take my left. And Cho... see if you can scrounge up a camera somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs searched about the room for a camera, Ron and Harry crawled up to their respective feet.

She grabbed ahold of herself to try to stop the trembling that was shaking her whole body. She knew the enslavement spell well. She did her best to fight back, but in the end, she was staring at Hermione with eyes full of devotion. \"...mistress...\" she whispered as Hermione reached down to brush a few stray strands of hair behind her ear.

She had a perfect opportunity to have her crush, Harry Potter, all to herself and she blew it.  Or at least, that was what she kept telling herself.  The sad truth was that there was nothing she could have done; she simply hadn't had the money.  And now Harry was in the clutches of Cho Chang.  \"Really,\" she thought, \"what kind of person would do something like that.\"  The hypocrisy was lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginny,\" came a voice.  She turned and saw Harry at the entrance to the common room.  He was still wearing nothing but that bed sheet, though was it her imagination or did it look shorter.  Her face got red when she realized it just barely covered his 'important parts.'   \"Please come with,\" said Harry, completely oblivious to the Ginny's ogling.  He turned to leave and not knowing what to make of this, Ginny followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, Harry?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the mistress,\" he responded.  Ginny pouted at that.  What was Cho playing at?  Did she want to rub it in her face that it was her who had Harry?  If so, Ginny planned to give her a piece of her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, they came to an empty classroom.  Peering at the the door, Ginny asked \"Is Cho in there?\"  Harry nodded before entering the room.  \"Great, she thought.  It's high time that bitch got what's coming to her.\"  She stormed into the room, shutting the door behind her, ready to let Cho have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Cho Cha-\" she stopped in mid-sentence as her mind tried to make sense of thee sight before her.  There was Cho Chang, the Ravenclaw Seeker, with an enchanted look on her face, naked except for some torn fabric covering her chest and groin.  As she got a clearer look, she realized just where the missing fabric of Harry's makeshift tunic was; covering up Cho's privates.  Just what kind of sick game was she playing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my handiwork?\"  Ginny turned to see Hermione standing behind her, her wand in hand and barefoot.  Not waiting for a response, Hermione walked past the stunned red-head and sat on a a desk, her shoeless feet dangling just of the ground, swinging back and forth.  As she saw a look of lust that came over Cho's face as Hermione swung her feet, understanding flooded Ginny's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enslaved her, like you did Harry.  Why?\"  As horrifying as it was, Ginny couldn't deny that Cho's fate gave her no small comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled.  \"She tried to steal my slave from me, so I made her one as punishment.  Now enough questions, suck my toes slave.\"  When Cho didn't move, Ginny thought that the command had been for Harry.  It was only when Hermione looked at her that she got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no,\" dread filled Ginny as the realization of what Hermione had instore hit her.  She reached for her wand, but as Hermione already had hers, it was a futile gesture at best.  The enslavement hit her before she'd even touched her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting with all her strength, Ginny tried to resist the spell, to keep her mind and thought her own.  But no matter what resistance she mustered, her thoughts always turned back to Hermione.  How beautiful she was.  How intelligent she was.  How Ginny's only waking thought was to serve her and pleasure her.  The next words she heard were \"remove your clothes.  Slaves should be naked.\"  Desiring nothing more than to obey, Ginny ripped off her clothes until they were nothing more than a pile of rags at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of herself, Hermione couldn't help but give the girls naked body an admiring look.  Ginny felt herself flush with pleasure for the admiring eye of her mistress.  \"Slave Ginny, come show your devotion.  Lick my feet.\"  Ginny didn't need to be told twice, she dived right at those beautiful bare soles, licking with a passion she couldn't believe.  \"Harry, Cho,worship my feet as well.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two entranced slave walked over, Hermione had a change of plans.  \"Wait, stop all of you.  You two,\" she said pointing to Harry and Cho, \"strip.  I want all of my slaves completely naked.\"  Once that was done, and Hermione had stopped staring at Harry's manhood (her arousal having transferred to her three slaves) she continued with her amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want all three of you worshiping my feet at the same time.  Squeeze together, Cho on the left, Ginny on the right, and Harry, you'll be in the middle.  Oh,\" she added as if it was an afterthought, \"I want you all to finger yourselves as you worship my feet.  I want you to masturbate and orgasm right in front of me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen..     </span></div></div>",

As for the toes, Harry sucked on the big toes, leaving the remaining four of each foot to its respective worshiper.  Occasionally, Harry's tongue would collide with one of the other's and the two slaves would worship the same spot together, exciting Hermione. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they licked her feet, their fingers danced on their privates, following Hermione's command that they masturbate as they worshiped her.  Harry's was hard and red, while the girls' was leaking minor amounts already.  The combination of the fingering and the feedback from worshiping Hermione's feet had pushed the three of them to their limit.  They were going to explode any second.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that her slaves were nearing a climax, Hermione (in a sadistic moment) commanded them \"AH! Hold...AH...it in...AH...slaves!

He also couldn't help but feel comforted as Fleur moved her delicate fingers through his fur. Despite how horrible this whole situation was, he could feel his tail wagging as it struck the stone floor, rose quickly, and struck the stone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur smiled to herself. This was conditioning. It is a well known fact that by use of positive and negative feedback, it was possible to get a dog to do just about anything. The same principle applied to humans of course, but it was much faster with dogs. And the best part is, and she smiled to herself at this part, was that the conditioning would carried over even when Harry became human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak boy!\" Harry let loose a weak bark. Fleur smiled and put another dog treat in his mouth, \"Good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave what passed as a grin and looked to Fleur expectantly. While he still had all his human thoughts and memories, he had adopted a very doglike mentality. He had now come to respect Fleur as the alpha dog and his pack leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit boy!\" Harry did so immediately and opened his mouth ready for another delicious treat. None came though. Fleur did say \"Good boy!\" though, which mean she was happy with him and he might get a treat in the future. \"Rollover!\" Harry did. This continued with Fleur giving commands and Harry fulfilling them with the hope of getting another treat and not getting kicked. When looked at in those terms, it only made sense to Harry that he should obey Fleur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Fleur pulled out another treat. \"Sit boy!\" Harry sat. \"Good boy, now staaaay\" Harry sat impatiently as Fleur placed the treat on the floor. And then she stepped on it. It crumbled beneath her foot and the crumbs stuck to the bottom of her shoe. She moved the treat-laden foot to Harry. \"Lick it up, 'Arry!\" Harry's nose was much more powerful now, so I could smell all the horrible things on that shoe, but he also knew that the treat was there. He began licking. The taste was great and terrible all at once. His mind raced trying to determine the source of the various particles that he was lapping up. The dog treat was easy enough. He could also taste soil. He thought he could detect some potion ingredients. And there were many other tastes he wasn't sure about yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he stepped back and looked up at Fleur. As a dog, he couldn't really feel human attraction like he used to. There were different hormones and pheromones involved. As such, he didn't see her as the beautiful blond, but as his alpha, and he needed instructions from her.</span></div></div>",

You've been such a good boy that you vill be getting a reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail wagging with excitement, he wondered what his reward would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to be making puppies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nearly dropped in surprise and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always vondered vat vould 'appen if a 'uman in dog shape impregnated a natural dog. Vill there be puppies? Vill they 'ave an 'igher intelligence? I'd like to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry followed Fleur down the hallways of the castle, the human part of his mind raced. What kinda of moral dilemna was this? Would he be able to impregnate a dog? Would his children really have a human intelligence and a dog body? No matter how they turned out, he could be sure they'd be spending their lives as pets. Perhaps they'd even be inbred so as to maintain the intelligence of the line. Even under the best of conditions, this would be an awful life to live, and Harry didn't think he could contribute to making it happen. He suddenly noticed that they were now standing outside the Beaubaxton carriage. Fleur was talking to a boy with a blank look in his eyes. It was hard to tell if he was under the effects of an enslavement spell, or just the power of Fleur's veela attraction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vould you be a dear and fetch my Lucia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Fleur, I'd be happy to.\" and the boy ran into the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright 'Arry, 'ow about ve get you warmed up for Lucia?\" At that fleur removed the shoe and sock from her right foot. \"Start 'umping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's ethical concerns dropped to the back of his mind as he mounted Fleur's leg and began thrusting and gyrating as fast as he could. As he began panting and stiffening, Fleur kicked him off. \"Now now, 'Arry, you 'ave to save your seed for Lucia.\" As if on command, the boy from before walked out of the carriage carrying a small poodle. Fleur thanked him with a kiss on the cheek and sent him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was mad with desire and any thought of morality or concern for his offspring had vanished by this point. Once Fleur's dog was on the ground he mounted her. Fleur cheered him on as he went at it. When his seed was spent, he lay on the ground panting. As he calmed back down, the pure horror of what he had done hit him. \"Oh, 'Arry, Lucia is sure to 'ave many puppies. I may need you to breed vith the offspring though to assure the success of this new line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't so sure that he wouldn't end up doing just that. It was late now. He should be headed back to his bed for the night, but he was sure that he would not be going back tonight. As if she were reading his mind, Fleur took this opportunity to put a collar and leash on Harry. She drug the exhausted Harry along and tied the other end to a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, 'Arry!\"</span></div></div>",

Like a slave?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her and gently took her big toe into his mouth and gave it a light suck, she couldn't stop the moan from escaping her mouth as she felt his tongue lightly caressing her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes Hermione,\" he replied eagerly, \"I'd give anything to be your foot slave.\"<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He wasn't thinking clearly at all and Hermione was going to take perfect advantage of that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Harry, in that case I will let you be my slave.  I'll even let you lick my feet, even though that's pretty pathetic don't you think?\"  Hermione let scorn enter her voice.  \"I mean feet?  That's the lowest part of your body and you're hoping to spend your days worshiping them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry flinched back at the words.  \"I-I I'm s-sorry if you don't want me to do that, I, I uh.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione slapped Harry hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What woman would want to have a grovelling worm like you touch them?  You're lucky I'm your friend because otherwise I'd ignore you forever.  You're really sick Harry, you know that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed and looked down in shame.  Hermione loved the psychological torture she was putting him through.  And he had seen nothing yet, he was in for a very long year at Hogwarts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes keep your gaze down, you're not worthy to look at my eyes. From now on you will always look at my feet, the source of your perverted desire.  Do you understand Harry, never look me in the eye again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry mumbled an affirmative.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione slapped him again.  \"When I give you a command Harry I expect you to answer \"Yes Mistress.\"  Is that clear slave?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress, sorry Mistress.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could see that Harry was still eager to get at her feet despite the abuse.  She wondered if he might change his mind however.  Especially after she did some of the things to him that would really make him suffer.  Hmm she needed to make this permanent.  So that even if Harry changed his mind he would always be her slave.  An idea sprang to her head.  She could enchant a collar for him that as long as it was worn would make him obey her.  Yes that would be perfect now he would not be able to escape regardless of what she did to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Harry, go ahead and kiss each toe, but only once I don't want you to get greedy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was overjoyed at being given permission to kiss her feet.  He took his time and gave each pretty toe a long kiss.  He was on cloud nine as he kissed his best friend's feet.  Hermione was barely paying attention to him, she was thinking about what she would need in order to make the spell work perfectly.  After Harry had finished giving her toes the kisses he knelt down with his hands behind his back awaiting his Mistress's next command.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry I need you to gather some materials for me.  I'm going to write a list, I want you to find everything by sundown.  That is of course if you still want to be my foot slave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course Mistress Hermione, it is the only thing I want, please let me be your foot slave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed, \"Oh I'm sorry Harry, its just so funny how eager you are.  You really are a bit of a perv aren't you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's elation turned to shame again.  He really wished Hermione wouldn't mock him that way but ultimately if he could still play with her perfect feet it would be worth it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione finished making out the list of items that were needed.  She handed them to Harry and said, \"Run along slave, I'll be waiting for you're return.  If you do a good job I'll let you lick my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took the list and ran out the door hurrying to get what he needed.  Hermione was going to fashion the ultimate slave collar.  The theory was sound and it would force Harry to obey her absolutely.   And once she had that ultimate control she was going to make Harry's life a living hell!  </span></div></div>",

No one would be able to break this spell even the headmaster.  It was no simply spell that could be cast with a flick of a wand and a word this was serious magic and it would bind Harry completely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry returned obediently with various items needed for the spell.  The most important item was a dog collar.  Harry handed the items to Hermione who smiled at Harry and then kneed him right in his balls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione watched Harry's face go pale with pain as he crumpled to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why,\" Harry croaked after a few moments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, I can do to you what I want and you had better not question me.  Because you questioned me, stand up and let me knee you again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave out a cry of disbelief at the command.  It had hurt so much, maybe Hermione didn't realize how much it had hurt since she wasn't a guy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry if you don't get up now I'll give you a third, now stand up and spread your legs like a good slave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought about weather her feet were really worth it but his fetish was too strong.  He had to get at those feet again!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got up and spread his legs a bit and closed his eyes. Hermione giggled at how much he was willing to go through just to be her foot slave. She walked around him slowly, enjoying the tension that was building.  She touched him lightly with her hand and he flinched.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry you are so scared, that's good.  You should be afraid of punishment, it will teach you to obey.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress,\" Harry whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione slammed her knee into Harry's crotch with all her strength.  He let out a high pitched yelp of pain and collapsed on the floor.  Hermione put a foot on his cheek and looked down at him, \"Is it worth it Harry?  Is it worth the pain to be my slave?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could tell Harry was having some second thoughts.  He looked a bit green around the gills and tears threatened to fall from his eyes.  Hermione stroked his cheek gently, \"There there Harry, I won't be so mean all the time but its important to get off to the right foot, so to speak.\" Hermione was lying of course, this was just a taste of what Harry was going to endure as her slave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finally nodded, \"Yes it's worth it Mistress.  I'll do anything to be your foot slave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled down at her friend, \"Good answer, now crawl over to the circle I've prepared there and kneel in the center.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry obeyed and looked at the various magical devices and preparations Hermione had made.  He looked very curious as to what they may be but he remembered his earlier lesson about asking questions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione saw the look he gave the objects and said, \"I am going to collar you slave.  Only this collar will be magically enhanced to make you obey me.  It will also be invisible to all others so no one will know you are so enchanted.  With it, I can make you do anything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry trembled a bit. \"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione walked over to Harry, \"Yes Harry, anything.  You promised to be my foot slave forever and I won't have you changing your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never do that Mistress, I'll always be loyal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, \"I don't believe you Harry.  What if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but you would never do that,\" Harry protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its about power Harry.  Its about my power over you, I want it to be complete.  If I'm going to put up with your pathetic perverted foot desires, I want to make sure I get something out of it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could tell Harry was incredibly nervous.  The realization that this would be forever was a big one and Hermione gave him a moment to think about it.  She took a seat in front of him and slowly crossed her legs and dangled her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on Harry, just say yes and you will be mine.  Oh the things I am going to do to you, you're going to wish you had never been born, just say yes already! </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione kept these thoughts to herself, no need to scare him out of agreeing to be her slave after all.  Hermione saw Harry watch her foot slowly rock back and forth.  A bead of sweat fell down his forehead.  This was the moment of truth.  Was he going to be her foot slave forever?  </span></div></div>",

If Harry had been allowed to look at her face he would have seen a look of pure sadistic delight that would of had him running for the hills.  Hermione quickly explained what he had to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you said yes, we are going to have so much fun!  You will need to say 'I will obey you forever Hermione' three times.  The first when I finish my spell on the collar.  The second time will be when I place the collar around your neck.  The third time will be when I lock it, can do you do that for me Harry?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded still nervous but willing, after all he trusted Hermione.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione began the spell, she recited it perfectly.  The collar glowed with power.  As she finished she motioned for Harry to say his part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will obey your forever Hermione.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled and then put the collar on Harry's neck.  She pulled it tight so it dug a bit into Harry's skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry ignored the pain and once again said, \"I will obey you forever Hermione!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was wet with excitement.  Now was the moment of truth, here was the moment of no return.  Hermione locked it and waited with baited breath for Harry to seal his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the magic, this was powerful stuff.  He knew that once he said those words he was putting his very life in Hermione's hands.  But he had made his decision.  Harry shouted the final words, \"I WILL OBEY YOUR FOREVER HERMIONE!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic lurched and twisted in the circle and then suddenly ceased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked at Harry and felt the magic take hold.  Harry was hers do as she willed.  She let out a dark laugh.  A laugh better suited for a villain and not sweet, studious and kind Hermione.  Harry felt a deep sinking feeling in his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you did that Harry.  Oh you poor thing you have no idea what you have done,\" Hermione could barely contain her glee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up Harry, spread your legs.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood up and his body went into autopilot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry I'm going to kick your in your little man parts.  Stand as long as your body can do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror filled Harry's eyes as he felt the compulsion settle on his mind.  Hermione lashed out with one petite foot and kicked him hard where it really hurt.  Harry's squeaked in pain wanting nothing more than to curl into a little ball.  But his body wouldn't let him.  It had to remaining standing because Hermione had commanded it.  Horrified Harry could do nothing but take the next kick and the one after that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed in between blows.  The look on Harry's face was priceless.  The look of pain, terror and betrayal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\" *kick* are *kick* so *kick* stupid!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't take it anymore the pain was driving him mad.  But he couldn't disobey Hermione.  Thinking quickly he shouted at the top of his lungs.  \"SOMEONE HELP!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione quickly put an end to that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry shut up.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mouth clicked shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I'm going to have to give you some commands so you don't try anymore funny businesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never attempt to communicate about our special relationship.  Never attempt to remove your collar.  Never attempt to get someone else to remove your collar.  Never attempt to draw attention to our activities.  Always look after my best interests.  Never do anything that in anyway could cause you to no longer have to obey me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked at Hermione with renewed horror.  What had he done? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione felt another wave of sadistic thrill rush through her.  \"You can speak now slave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry opened his mouth and begged, \"Hermione what are you doing?  Please... please it hurts so bad.  I think you are doing permanent damage.  I won't be able to have kids.  I thought we were friends... please I'll be a good slave, only stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed in Harry's face.  \"KIDS?  You think you will ever have children?  You stupid boy, you'll never be with a woman.  You'll die a virgin.  Do you think I'm going to let my slave actually have sex?  Do you think I'll ever release you?  No.  You are mine now.  And I don't need the threat of pain to make you obey.  That's not the point of me torturing you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't believe his ears.  How could sweet gentle Hermione be saying and doing these things?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione could see the look of confusion on Harry's face.  \"I'm sure your thinking how I could be doing this, aren't you?  Well I'm tired of being a little goody two shoes.  Its time I did something for me.  Its time for my pleasure to take prominence.  Just like you have a fetish for feet, guess what I have a fetish for?  Making people suffer.  I've always hidden it.  I've always suppressed it.  I've always tried to be good and not think about things like that.  Well no longer.  Its time for me to get my pleasure and you're going to give it to me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't believe the nightmare he had found himself in.  Hermione kicked him again.  This time his body did give out and he collapsed onto the floor puking his guts out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wrinkled her nose.  \"Well isn't that disgusting.  Just like you Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh cruel thought came to Hermione.  She casually stepped into the puddle of vomit and then sat back down on a chair.  \"Well Harry since you like my feet so much, why don't you clean up all the disgusting vomit from my wonderful feet?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry loved feet but not like this.  This was... wrong.  This was disgusting.  This was vile and unthinkable.  And he had no choice but to do it.  Sobbing in despair Harry crawled over to Hermione and began to lap the putrid mess from her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry performed his revolting task Hermione thought about how else she should torture Harry.  It might be interesting to humiliate him in front of other girl's at Hogwarts.  Or she could just keep him to herself.  Choices... choices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Embrace them completely.  But he would get no joy from it.  No pleasure.  No erection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had finished cleaning her foot so Hermione snapped her fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough slave.  I'm going to go buy something that will make your servitude even worse.  While I'm going lick the rest of your disgusting mess up.  After your done with that strip naked and kneel in the corner until I return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione please...\"  Another flash of power filled Hermione.  Harry didn't enjoy his treatment.  He was begging for release.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yes truly power is an aphrodisiac</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what Harry?  Kick you in the testicles again?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry flinched away from Hermione.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruel girl laughed and stalked forward.  \"Open your legs Harry, let me stomp on your delicate boy bits.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's legs flung open thanks to the collar around this throat.  Hermione's slim leg lifted up high in the air and then came crashing down.  Harry curled into a ball sobbing with pain.  Hermione laughed and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione choose not to wear any shoes.  When she returned she would have Harry lick the filth from her feet, making it even worse for him.  She lefts the Hogwarts grounds proper and went to a forbid 18+ shop.  The owner was an old cranky witch who ignored the rules as long as the customer paid.  In the shop there were all sorts of novelties and devices.  Dildos, blow up dolls, pornography, paddles, chains, and even a few chastity devices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione immediately looked at them and herd the old witch cackle.  \"Oh my, worried that your little boyfriend might be running around behind your back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked at the old hag coldly, \"No.  I just want my slave to suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, a girl after my own heart, tell me dearie how much do you want the boy to suffer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smirked, \"More then you could possibly know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch looked her up and down. She didn't seem to be a cruel sort but she could tell in the set of her eyes that her customer meant business.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case my dear, I have the perfect device.  A device not just like the muggles use but one enchanted to make it extra painful for the wearer.  But I should warn you, this device can be next to impossible to remove.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed, \"You really have no idea how much I want my little victim to suffer.  Its never going to be removed.  He will never have sexual pleasure again and I am going to revel in his agony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch gave another cackle, indeed truly a girl after her own heart.  The witch went to the back room and took out the chastity device.  It was metallic and it was clearly designed to hold a male cock.  It also looked quite small and tight.  Inside Hermione could see that there were spikes.  As the male member grew it would brush up against those spikes and cause quite a bit of pain and damage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks perfect, what is the magical effect?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches scratchy voice moved a bit lower, \"Oh yes, yes that's the best part.  The owner of the key can enchant the device to do a number of things.  It can make the wearer itch down there like itching powder.  It can be turned sizzling hot or frigidly cold.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione eye's grew wide.  It was perfect.  \"Wonderful, I'll take it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch cautioned the girl, \"Be very careful. Once locked in the device it can be only opened on a full moon.  A month can be an awfully long time.  Be sure not to lose the key since there are no duplicates and another one can not be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably melt it down in front of my slave after I tell him that,\" Hermione bragged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch cackled again.  \"A girl after my own heart...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione paid for the specially made spike lined chastity device and hurried back to Hogwarts.  She couldn't wait to fit this on poor Harry.  She glanced down at her feet, they were absolutely filthy.  Yes this was going to be a perfect evening. </span></div></div>",

There was no way he had wanted to do that and if he had the ability to stop himself he would have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect.  He is mine forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took a seat and told Harry to crawl over to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was obviously embarrassed by his nakedness and tired to hide his private parts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Harry don't be shy, show me the damage I've done to your little boy bits.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knelt in front of Hermione and spread his knees, he held up his aching balls and penis.  They were swollen and red, the one on the left was actually a bit purple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must of popped a blood vessel.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you regretting your choice to be my slave Harry?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, \"Yes Mistress, you hurt me badly.  And my puke... that was so disgusting.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good I'm glad you're aren't enjoying this, that's the whole point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry bowed his head sadly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've got a present for you Mr. Potter.  A special one just for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took out the special chastity device she had purchased and explained all of its nasty little features.  She carefully watched Harry's expression.  It grew pale, scared and when she got to the part where this was the only key in existence she saw true terror on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Hermione, if you ever had any feelings of friendship toward me don't do this.  Please, please, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione felt herself flush with sexual excitement.  To see the mighty Harry Potter groveling and begging for mercy, mercy that would never be granted to him was just too wonderful.  She let him go on for a bit until he grew repetitive and then she slapped him twice silencing him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough slave, time to put on the device.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry trembled as Hermione placed the spiked chastity device on him. She sealed it up and then used her key to lock it.  Harry gave a pitiful whimper as he heard the device click shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm lets test it out, lets see I just have to will it hot and it...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a scream of pain as he privates suddenly heated up intensely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Harry this is only the first level of heat.  The second level is where it actually gives you real burns.  Oh and of course if you ever really irritate me I'll set it to the maximum level and your little wank meat will incinerate.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to keep out from screaming but it hurt so bad.  It hurt and it hurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was eager to test out the other settings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets try cold.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the heat went away but the cold was jarring.  It shrunk Harry's manhood like a cold shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you really do have a tiny one don't you slave?\" Hermione tapped the cage and Harry's balls with her foot idly.  Each tap of her foot made Harry's cock brush up against the cold melt in the cage and caused him to flinch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally lets try the itching version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face flashed into a mask of horror as Hermione willed the device to cause him to itch.  His hands clawed at the device desperate to scratch the burning itch there.  He rolled on the ground and Hermione laughed  at the sight.  Harry was trying to get his fingers into the device but they were too small, it felt like chicken pox on steroids, like bull nettle nestled under his skin like the worst rash imaginable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione ended the effect and clapped her hands.  \"I really must thank that old witch, this is truly the perfect device.  I am going to have so much fun with this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry cursed himself for ever agreeing to this.  Who would have thought that Hermione would be so unbearably cruel?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right slave, I know you agreed to be my foot slave so its time for you to actually spend some time with my feet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a little better at that prospect but then he got a closer look at the feet he was about to worship.  They were absolutely filthy.  Hermione had deliberately stepped in mud and muck to make her feet as filthy as possible.  The muck and mire caked every inch of her soles and Harry swallowed thickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on than slave, clean them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry glumly began his task.  He loved Hermione's feet but not like this.  He began to scrape off the dirty with his teeth and tongue.  It tasted pretty bad and he had to go over the same spots over and over again to get it all.  Hermione watched him and knew that Harry wasn't enjoying this.  Just as she had planned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should make him do this every day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also felt good to have a warm tongue on her soles.  She hadn't thought that having a slave worship her feet was going to be all that great, it was just a means to an end in enslaving him but after experiencing this, she decided it was rather pleasant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry continued to work and after half an hour her feet were looking much better.  Harry was also starting to enjoy himself more, now that he could taste less dirt and more Hermione.  Once he started enjoying himself he started to harden and when that happened...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow, ow,\" Harry yelped in pain.  As his manhood had hardened inside the metal chastity device it has bumped into the spikes.  They dug in painfully, actually breaking the skin in a few places.  His hard-on quickly deflated and Hermione got a good chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've done a good job on my feet, as a reward I think I had better let you keep on worshiping my feet. I know you love it so.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had no choice but to continue.  And as he licked, kissed and sucked on her glorious feet he stiffened again and once more the spikes sent waves of pain through his body.  The pain was horrible as it was in the most sensitive part of his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Harry, he can't stop from being turned on by his little perverted foot fetish but when he does his itty bitty boy bits get cut.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry started to cry again.  He hardly ever wept and this evil sadistic girl had made him do it three times today.  And this was just the first day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cycle of foot worship and then horrific pain continued Hermione began to play with herself.  She put her fingers down her skirt and under her panties.  She had never felt such power and such ecstasy.  Soon her own screams of pleasure were louder than Harry's cries of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she came down from her climax she looked around worriedly.  It was possible someone had heard their mutual cries even with the thick stone walls around them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry's hopes were soon dashed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry gather some old books here, I'll set a fire and we can watch it melt together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh the look on his face, its so filled with dread or helplessness its perfect!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione laughed as Harry's body jerked toward the old books, he was trying to fight the collar but it was futile.  Soon he had a pile laying at Hermione's feet.  The cruel teenager than lit the books on fire and dangled the key over the fire.  Harry watched it in horrified fascination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This key Harry represents so many things.  It represents your ability to have children.  It represents your ability to have sex.  It represents your ability to have pleasure.  It represents hope.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a mewling whine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It took less than a day to break the great Harry Potter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can drop this and end the Potter line right now,\" Hermione boasted as she toyed with the key over the flames.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the key in the air and as Harry cried out in complete terror she caught it just inches from the flame.  Hermione laughed as poor Harry nearly had a heart attack.  Hermione then moved her chair closer to the fire.  The stuck out her right foot and placed the key on the top of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I bet you really can't take your eyes off my foot now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione waved her foot back and forth over the flames, the slightly motion could drop the key down into the fire.  Suddenly she kicked her foot up and the key went flying through the air, it arched back down straight for the fire and Harry was sure his future hopes of relationships, sex and children was over.  At the last instant Hermione caught the key between her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one slave!  I almost missed,\" Hermione taunted the poor boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's teeth were on edge.  The girl he had known for the last five years had turned into a twisted sadistic monster.  And if that key dropped he would be lost forever.  He didn't know if he wanted to live that way at all.  As long as that key existed hope would remain.  A hope that may be futile but it was something he could cling to, that maybe just maybe underneath all the cruelty and spite the Hermione he knew and loved was still under there.  But with the key destroyed even if he could bring back that Hermione his manhood would remain locked away for all time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harry you have no idea how much I want to drop this key in the fire and watch all hope fade from your soul.  It would be so wonderful to see you give into more despair than even a dementor could give.  Oh so tempting...\" she mocked as she dangled the key between her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm begging you Hermione, I'll do anything, I'm not asking you not to do it just to give it some thought you can always do it later, please Hermione, oh please.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione really wanted to just drop it but there were other games that should play with poor Harry.  Perhaps she should give him a challenge.  A mission, a task something basically impossible and see if he could actually meet the challenge.  There were a number of cruel tasks she could think of.  On the other hand she knew she would probably have the greatest power rush ever felt if she just dropped the key right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Choices...

Sorry about that.  Not really, but foot slaves like you have other things to be worried about; and pleasuring yourself is definitely not one of them.

You can smell all of our feet now, and...lever 2.  The device went up in temperature.  Lets go.  Start smelling.\"  And with that, all 5 Hermoines placed their feet over his nose.  10 feet fighting to stay on his face.  50 toes trying to smother his nose.

She had given Harry careful instructions to make sure no one saw the Death Eater when he brought her room.  She had spelled the place so no one could eavesdrop.  Rubbing her hands together she thought about the anguish she was going to cause Harry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was exhausted after his ordeal.  This was one of the most dangerous stunts he had ever pulled.  He hadn't slept in 30 hours and only the thrill of success and the fact that his hated foe was now finally going to be brought to justice buoyed his spirits.  Harry entered Hermione's room with an unconscious Bellatrix underneath his cloak of invisibility.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione clapped her hands when she saw Harry roll out Bellatrix onto the floor.  Harry had a self satisfied look of accomplishment on his face.  No doubt he thought that Bellatrix would finally pay for her fiendish crimes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When you learn I'm going to have you pamper her feet and than let her go free... oh I can't wait to break the news!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done well slave, the key is safe, for now.  I'd like you to leave now, get something to eat and drink and wash up.  Return here in two hours.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, relieved he had finally gotten a break.  Maybe just maybe she would have mercy on him in the future.  \"Thank you Mistress Hermione. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione than proceeded to tie up Bellatrix and make sure she could use no magic that might harm her.  This was important, at least until Hermione explained the role she had in mind for Bellatrix.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Bellatrix woke up.  She tried to escape her bonds but Hermione knew what she was doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mud blood brat, you and the boy will pay for this,\" she hissed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione rolled her eyes.  \"Relax Ms. Lestrange, I could turn you into the authorities or even just let Harry kill you but I'm not going to do that.  In fact what I am going to do is something that will please you greatly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled, \"Just listen.\"  And so Hermione explained what she had in store for Harry.  At first Bellatrix didn't believe her but she saw that sadistic glint in Hermione's eye, the same one she had in her own eyes when she looked into a mirror.  Bellatrix agreed to have Harry worship her feet.  She would also verbally abuse and taunt him, degrading him for what he was doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix agreed to do all this and also said, \"Let me do more, let me hurt him.  I know you don't trust me enough for a wand but give me a switch.  Let me slap him, dig my nails into his skin, stripe his hide with a cane, let me torment him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione considered the Death Eater's words.  Letting Bellatrix have her hands free would allow her to torment Harry even more however this could be dangerous.  Bellatrix didn't like her either due to her mixed blood and it might be dangerous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could be dangerous but oh this could be fun</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Hermione choose?  </span></div></div>",

Hermione of course would be watching the action so there should be no chance that Bellatrix could find away to escape.

Harry returned right at the two hour mark and as he walked in he saw Bellatrix Lestrange untied.

You are not to fight her, you are to let her slap you, kick you, claw you, beat you and abuse you.  Strip naked and allow me to enjoy this delightful entertainment.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix let out a bone chilling laugh and than beckoned Harry forward with one finger.  Harry could see the black nail come to a point.  \"Crawl here Potter, it is time you were taught a valuable lesson.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter quickly (because he was made to by the collar) stripped and crawled over to the Death Eater who had murdered his godfather.  He hated this woman more than he even hated Voldemort.  She had robbed him of one of the few connections he had with his parents.  She had murdered him and laughed at the deed.  This monster should be thrown into the darkest dungeon, no she should be killed.  She was a dangerous vile monstrous person.  And he had to crawl over to her and pay her homage.  He felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel and let me get a good look at you,\" Bellatrix instructed.  She was sitting on a seat and watched the trembling Harry with her dark eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl has told me of your little perversion, you really should be thanking me you know.  You'll get the chance to touch my feet with your treacherous tongue.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I hate you,\" Harry responded harshly with a deep rage that Hermione had never heard before.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix's backhand struck like a viper.  It caught Harry across the face and made him stumble, he only barely kept upright on his knees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you will my poor boy.  I know a thing or two about pain, even without magic I will have you screaming.  I am going to make you thank me.  I am going to make you thank me for my feet and for killing that dog you were so fond of.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry saw red.  He yearned with every fiber of his being to lash out at Bellatrix, but the command of the collar was absolute.  He could not fight her.  The collar burned in his skin as her tried to fight the compulsion.  His entire body quivered, he was using all of his considerable magical ability to try to destroy the horrible mind controlling device that was on him.   After a few seconds where the earth seemed to quiver for a moment he collapsed back down on his knee's.  He could not break it.  It was futile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix traced her razor sharp nails across Harry's cheek.  \"You poor, poor boy.  It must be so hard to know that you have been delivered to your enemy by one of your closest friends.  How that must hurt, how you must hate the girl over there.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry did hate Hermione now.  What she was doing to him was beyond awful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its no more than you deserve for standing against the Dark LORD!\"  As Bellatrix made that pronouncement she dug her nails into Harry's face.  They sunk in and drew blood and Harry gave out a cry in pain.  His body wanted to jerk away but Hermione's command was to let her claw him and so he couldn't even flinch away.   Bellatrix drunk in his pain.  \"This is the price you pay for defying his will, it is but a taste.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix released Harry and glanced at Hermione.  Hermione was enjoying every second of anguish that Harry was being put through.  Bellatrix smiled at the girl as she saw that sadism that she knew so well that was inside her own soul.  Even though the girl was a mud blood perhaps an exception could be made, she had intelligence, ruthlessness and the right spirit for her kind of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend here did have some specific instructions though child.  She wanted to see you humble yourself before me.  She wanted to see you worship my feet, so I think its time you did that.  Worship my feet boy, show me what a pathetic wretch you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lowered his face to the Death Eater's foot and began to kiss those hated feet.  Bellatrix had size 8 feet with black painted toenails.  He kissed each toe slowly with reverent worship.  Hermione watched the disgust in Harry's face and began to play with herself under her skirt.  This was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix laughed, \"Potter you naughty boy, that actually feels good.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry seethed inside as he continued.  After kissing each toe several times he lifted one foot off of the floor and began to suckle on each toe.  Bellatrix arched her foot and shoved several toes in Harry's mouth at once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh go on you dirty boy, make love to my feet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shoved his tongue in between Bellatrix's toes, cleaning out a bit of sweat and sock toe jam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you belong, kneeling before your superiors.  You are a sick boy, I bet if your parents were still alive to see you now they would disown you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes blazed at the mention of his parents.  With every fiber of his being he wanted to break the accursed collar and kill the bitch whose feet he was worshiping.  Bellatrix saw the reaction she was continuing and continued the verbal abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mocked his parents, mocked how they died. She mocked him and Hogwarts, she talked how she brutally tortured the Longbottoms and how she was going to finish the family off when she got a hold of Neville.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact I think I'll break him and than have him worship my feet just like you're doing to me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to scream in rage but all he could do was run his tongue along Bellatrix's sexy arches and long toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think I'll kill the ugly little boy with my feet.  I'll break his mind and body and finish him with these very feet.  Go on, kiss the feet that are going to kill your friend.  Do you know how I'll do it?  I think I'll shove my foot deep into his mouth and down his throat.  Choking him, gagging him, suffocating him.  Here let me show.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix shoved her whole foot into Harry's mouth. It barely fit inside.  With a push Bellatrix shoved her foot in deeper gagging Harry.  She stood up from her chair and Harry fell onto his back from his kneeling position.  Her toes tickled the back of Harry's throat, it was getting very hard to breathe.  Bellatrix lifted her foot back out again and than rammed it deeper into Harry's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gasped in pleasure as she felt an orgasm start to blossom as she saw Bellatrix fuck Harry's mouth with her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh are you sure you haven't done this before Harry?  Have you serviced your teacher's while on your knees, you dirty perverted boy.  Go on suck it like a cock you worthless cur.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was red faced from humiliation, anger and the difficulty he had in breathing.  When Bellatrix jammed her toes into the back of his throat he couldn't breathe so he had to snatch in bits of air in the half second she gave him when she pulled back right before thrusting in.  Those black painted toes were suffocating him from the inside of his throat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix saw Hermione distracted.  She could probably make an attack on her while she was lost in her massive orgasm.  Still... there would be risks involved for her and Hermione had promised to let her go.  Bellatrix gave it careful thought, her moment to act would be right as Hermione climaxed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do?  </span></div></div>",

If someone slipped a dung bomb into it, it should be smoking.  It was still sitting innocently on the floor, with all the compartments closed.  If something stinky was in it, it should have been noticeable before now.  Okay, so it was probably not his backpack or something in it.  Harry couldn't eliminate it entirely because Fred and George might have slipped a new test product into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned at a wide-eyed kitten on the plate.  Kittens were cute, but could emit a powerful stench.  Harry's eyes were beginning to water which may confirm the source, but why would someone collect magical plates of cute kittens that reeked like a stoat sandwich Hagrid forgot and left in his coat pocket all summer?   Ah, to torture students with detention, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbridge had not cast a bubble-headed charm upon herself.  Something in her nose to prevent it from smelling the stench?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly ... what the heck was Harry doing?  Attempting to look up Umbridge's nose was comparable to ... Seamus airing out his wedding tackle as he did his morning stretching.   Hold on, that scent was vaguely familiar, now that he was thinking of Seamus.  His trainers ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to drop Umbridge's quill, but thought that might lead to trouble, so he feigned an emotional moment (he was being tortured here) and knocked his glasses off his face to the floor.  While retrieving them, and replacing them on his face, he spied the source of the paint-peeling reek ... under her desk, Umbridge had slipped her hairy, pudgy piggies out of her shoes.  </span></div></div>",

As he passed the room of requirement where he had taught DA lessons the previous year, the door materialized and opened. He stopped and looked to see who had been using the room. He looked around the edge of the door and saw Hermione standing just inside. <br>\r\n\"Hermione? What are you doing here?\" Harry said<br>\r\n\"Testing out a new spell I found in a book\" Hermione answered <br>\r\nHarry rolled his eyes and thought it was typical of Hermione to want to test every spell she found in a book. <br>\r\n\"Do you want to come in and help me?\" She said,smiling<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Harry said hesitantly <br>\r\nHe entered the room and looked around. It was completely empty. <br>\r\n\"Lay in the middle on the floor\" Hermione said in her usually bossy tone<br>\r\n\"Umm why?\" He asked, raising his eyebrows<br>\r\n\"Just do it!\" She yelled<br>\r\n\"The floor looks dirty.\" He said, unsure of why she wanted him to do this.<br>\r\nHermione pointed her wand at Harry and muttered something. Harry's mind went blank as an Imperious curse much stronger than he had ever experienced took over. He found him self walking quickly into the center of the room and laid down. Chains sprung out of the floor and bound him there as a chair appeared over his chest, the front legs under each of his arms. Hermione removed the curse and walked slowly toward him.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" He asked, now frightened<br>\r\nHermione sat on the chair with one leg on each side of Harry's head, ignoring his words. She started to undo the laces on one of her shoes.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Harry asked, confused <br>\r\nHermione pointed her wand at Harry again and said<br>\r\n\"Silencio\"<br>\r\nHarry opened and closed his mouth, trying to speak with no sound coming out. Hermione had now removed both of her shoes and was in her socks. The smell wafted over Harry and he tried to move his head away but only managed to turn his face toward one of Hermione's socked feet. She smiled and pushed his face back so he was looking into her face.<br>\r\n\"Ready to try my new spell?\" She said, grinning evilly <br>\r\nHarry shook his head violently and looked into her eyes with a pleading expression. She ignored him and pointer her wand at him for a third time.<br>\r\n\"Nasalentio\" she said<br>\r\nInstantly, Harry's nose burned. His sense of smell was magnified ten times more sensitive than usual. Hermione smiled at the expression on his face, then lifted her foot and placed it on his face. He tried to move his head away but she held him strongly. <br>\r\n\"Smell!\" She yelled, grinding his head into the ground.<br>\r\nHe reluctantly took a breath through his nose and the stench of her feet filled his brain and he almost vomited. She smiled as he suffered under her foot and covered his face with both her feet, blocking his face from view completely. She sighed and produced a book from inside her robes, reading silently as Harry breathed the only air that was available to him; the thick stinky air from between her socked toes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could he let his best friend - her boyfriend - just leave like that? To think, she once considered Harry Potter to be a good, strong leader. Now she saw him as a complete waste of space!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to contact Ron, Hermione came to a decision that just made sense. She had to make Harry realise that he had made a mistake in fighting with her boyfriend and forcing him to leave. Then she would either walk away, or make him suffer for his foolish mistakes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he would just leave like that,\" Harry said grimly while they ate a spartan lunch of bread and whatever fruit she had managed to procure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving just like that. Seriously, Harry,\" Hermione's voice was low and dangerous, catching him somewhat off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean - he was selfish. Selfish and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I was going to wait for a more opportune time to say this, but I can't bear your complete and utter nonsense for even another second!\" Hermione thundered, standing up, her eyes full of anger and hatred for her companion. \"YOU forced him to leave Harry - no one but you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she shot her hand out, connecting hard with his cheek and emitting a slapping sound. Both teenagers gasped in surprise; Hermione herself couldn't quite believe what she had done! It reminded her of the time she had struck Draco Malfoy back in the third year, though that was a feeling of sheer satisfaction. This was more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to apologise,\" Harry said quietly, a look of shock still plastered on his face. \"Then I can't. He-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK! This time she full on punched him in the nose, causing him to cry out in pain and slump to the floor. Clutching at his nose and feeling the hot liquid sensation of blood begin to gush from it, Harry stared up at her with genuine fear. In the seven years he had known her, he had never seen her like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, you selfish ego-centric idiot! He is my boyfriend - someone who I love and care about and you treated him like dirt! Did you think I would just forgive you? I was going to leave the next day, until I realised that it would be too dangerous to find him! You need to pay for what you've done - for all the crap you've put me through in the last seven years included! The number of times I've risked my life for you? I've been paralysed, turned into a cat...gone to hell and back for you! Enough is enough!\" She roared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please don't go!\" Harry called up at her, blood still pouring from her nose. Although he was frustrated with her outburst, he knew deep down that he needed her. He wouldn't last more than a couple of days without her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg me - beg me to stay then we'll see!\" Hermione said disdainfully, her eyes still sparking with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gulped; was he really going to swallow his pride in order to get his friend to stay...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry was on his knees before her as she regally crossed her legs.  The pain rendered him speechless for several moments.  When he could breathe properly he looked up at Hermione and saw the rage still dancing in her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Hermione I beg you.  You are the smartest witch of our generation!
