            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is a typical day in the small medieval village of Norlec.The peasants are out, trotting between bartering stands, hunting for their nightly meal. The nobles and merchants, on the other hand, are locked squarely away in their manors and shops, content to enjoy the warm summer day in their interior shade. It is in this second group that you, a gastromancer's apprentice, find yourself. Your mistress, a one Madame Lustria, is the owner of a small alchemy shop. It is there that you spent most of your young life, slaving away behind the counter, refining all sorts of spells and potions on your journey to become a full fledged magic user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, it seems, is no different. Madame Lustria has departed for the morning and had left you alone to finish a customers order. It is nothing special; just your run-of-the-mill aphrodisiac. A hint of faerie's wing here, a splash of minotaur semen there and you were sure to have a decently potent product. You had made this potion many times before and, to be honest, you were getting tired of it. The days of your inexperienced youth had passed and you are eager to move on to bigger and better challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand at the counter, imbuing the potion with the last of the necessary magical essence, the sound of the rickety old door creaking open catches your attention. Turning back, you are greeted with the image of a thicker woman. She is sporting a large set of breasts and a fine layer of blubber throughout her body. The black haired beaut is sporting an excited grin; a grin you recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my dear apprentice,\" Madame Lustria says, \"How goes the potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost finished, Madame. The potion should be ready long before the client arrives.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work, dear!\" she continues as she presses herself against the counter. \"Oh, and I got some very good news for you, dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow nervously. Though you respect your mentor, her idea of \"good news\" often clashed with your own. Sucking up your pride, you inquire further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a quest for you to embark on. No more making potions for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body jerks so hard out of shock that you nearly dropped the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious, what is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, calm down. It's not too amazing, but it should be something you can handle. After all, you are an adult now, though just barely. Why, I remember when you were just a little...\"</span></div></div>",

Madame Lustria was the overly nostalgic type. Not a day would pass without her reminiscing about the way things used to be. Sometimes you couldn't help but wonder if perhaps she was dissatisfied with how you had turned out. Though socially you two are close, your physical appearances were about as far from each other as they possibly could be. Lustria was curvier, sporting grapefruit sized bosom, wide buttocks, and a slight pot-belly that drove the men at the tavern wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, in comparison, are a twig. Your breasts are nearly non-existent, looking more like mosquito bites than lumps of flesh. The bumper matched the headlights, so-to-speak, leaving you with an equally flat buttocks. Of your features, the only ones of any note are your feminine hips. Lustria had been feeding you for years in preparation for your eventual transition into gastromancy, but as it would seem, your body simply had not yet taken hold. It was for that reason, you figure, that Madame Lustria had held you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enough reminiscing,\" you dismiss, \"What exactly is this quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a nearby cave that the peasants claim has been swallowing people up. Complete bull, really, but you know how the uneducated get. The mayor's gotten worked up, though, and he hired us to go check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you, since I'm letting you handle this on your own. I wouldn't worry too much, though. It's probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you conceded, brushing your red hair from your eyes, \"Though it will be nice to get some practice. When do I have to be off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even react, she wrapps her pudgy finger around your thin twig of an arm and drags you to the door. Knowing better than to resist, you let her shove you out. The rickety door slams shut behind you.Armed only with your robe and gastro magic, you make your way out of the town and into the nearby forest. The town guard were kind enough to point out the general area the \"killer cave\" was supposedly located in and you find it in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach, your keen eyes notice something amiss. Examining the surrounding further, you discover the tell-tale signs of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To you, the signs are clear. Discarded flagons of ale, still moist with recently drunken alcohol. Piles of trash and other debris sat beside them, lazily strew about beside the cave entrance. Trees nearby were etched with the scars of sword scratches. There was no mistaking it; these were bandits. Fearsome ones, too, if the peasants were to be believed. Even with your powerful gastromancy, you can't help but feel a lingering sense of fear. You had never entered actual combat before, much less against a group of experienced fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you steel your resolve and silently slip into the cave. Lustria would never let you live it down if you returned to her for help. In addition, she would most likely delay your training ever further than she had already had. Turning back is not an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the dark, damp hole, you began to notice more and more signs of life. More trash, more debris, and to your shock, blood. You become a bit more shaken, realizing that if you're not careful that could very well be your own sanguine stain. Before you can examine further, however, your alert ears catch the sound of jovial laughter not far from your position. Continuing on, you eventually reach a larger part of the cavern. Inside, you see about three bandits, huddled around a fire. They are large brutes, composed of two humans and an orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught up in their own discussion, none of them notice as you slip into the room and take shelter behind a towering pile of crates. Now safe for the moment, you begin to formulate a plan on how to deal with the murderous scum. Had you been the masterful Lustria, it would have been simple; You would start by jumping out and casting a daze spell on the group, freezing them just long enough to send the orc down your gullet. Then, just as it wore off and the other two began to charge, you would hit one of them with a shrink spell and counter the remaining one. He would be taken off guard, too surprised to act as you easily swallowed him as well. Your bloated belly now stuffed to the brim, you would casually approach the inch-tall remainder and decided his fate. In the end, he would either wind up smashed beneath your heel or receive a one way trip up your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you are not Lustria. You do not posses the skills to take all three on at once. You are going to have to be crafty to take care of these worms. It is then that you notice something promising. Across the room, sitting beside the orc was a glass jar. Inside this jar sat a small pixie. Pixies, the little beings of magic they are, are a coveted race. For most, they are captured due to their reputation as horny little things, willing to suck off any race for freedom. To a gastromancer like you, though, they area a quick power boost. Swallow (or chew) one down and their magical energies would temporarily become yours, boosting your base skill level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting, but again, it sits right beside the orc. Do you risk using a levitate spell to bring it towards you or did you instead try to take them out one by one?</span></div></div>",

The boost will be more than enough to change the coming battle and you are willing to risk stealing the damn thing if it means you will be less likely to end up as some orc's sex slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking out around the box, you place your right arm forward, aiming it directly at the pixie jar. You wait for a perfect opportunity; for a moment where the group would be truly distracted. It takes a while but your patience eventually pays off. The orc, speaking in a language you don't understand, suddenly shoots up and begins yelling at the top of his lungs. For a moment, you are worried they had noticed you. Relief washes over you as the orc approaches his compatriots and draws his sword, perhaps offended by something his friend said. Not one to waste an opportunity, you cast your levitate spell. At the moment, your weak powers only let you levitate up to ten pounds. More than enough for the current task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brutes fail to notice as the insignificant jar floats away. It slowly makes its way across the room, ducking behind an indiscriminate pile of crates. You confidently snatch the jar from the air as it pulls up to your position. Pride overflows from within you, forcing you to stifle a cheerful giggle. With nary a clue left of your trick, you have successfully accomplished your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to unscrew the lid to the jar, you are faced with another question: how to devour the pixie? As a gastromancer, all that is required is that you devour it. Any method is acceptable. As you see it, your options are to send the pixie down your gullet, up your backside or unbirth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Because of your situation earlier, you had never had the opportunity to indulge in some breakfast. It has been well over twelve hours since you have last eaten and you are positively starving. Tempting as the sexual pleasure from anally voring or unbirthing the pixie may be, these base lusts are unable to surpass your primal hunger. You have become set on orally devouring the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you actually eat her, though, you decide to get a closer look at your next meal. Drawing the jar to your face, you examine the being inside the glass cage. She's a pretty little thing, blessed with a curvaceous figure and beautiful violet locks. Like most pixies, she's around six inches in height; small enough for you to swallow effortlessly. If you even want to swallow her, that is. Chewing the girl up with your pearly incisors is a method as well. One that tickles your dominant desires particularly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie, glad to be free of her sexual masters, locks her shimmering blue eyes with yours. She has a look of gleeful hope, one that would surely disappear if she knew of your gastromancery. Eager to feast, you begin to unscrew the jar, raising a finger to your lips to let the pixie know to remain quiet. She returns an affirmative nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small struggle (that orc screwed the lid tight!) the lid comes off with a pop. You reach in a grab the pixie with your dextrous fingers. The pixie, believing you to be a friend, remains docile even as you slowly inch her towards your hungry maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, though, you have one more decision to make. Swallow her whole or chew her up?</span></div></div>",

As fun as it iss to chew your meals, you decide that the pleasure of having the pixie writhe in your stomach is more fulfilling. With nothing holding you back, you devour her in earnest, slamming your clenched fist into your mouth before the pixie even knows what hit her. Her entire form slides into your mouth, kicking and punching at your tongue and teeth in a futile effort to stop the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese efforts, of course, result in little. She quickly passes through your mouth, soon finding herself at the top of your throat. Again, she gropes around, hoping to catch herself on your uvula. For a moment, one of her hands  actually manages to grab it, though the warm saliva coating it causes her to slip and continue her descent. From there, there is little the pixie can do other than accept her slide down your esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later and the pixie finally passes through the stomach valve, landing in the awful-smelling chamber with a sickening splash. All five of her senses are assaulted. Her vision is blinded by overwhelming darkness. The smell, as mentioned, is entirely awful. The taste, as her face had come into contact with the acid, ss a conglomeration of whatever meal you had eaten last. The sound is that of your stomach rhythmically churning in a foreboding manner. The touch, most importantly, is the all-important tingle of acid that will soon be breaking the helpless pixie down into nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, in comparison, are feeling great. Your stomach has been filled, satisfying the painful hunger you had felt. Better still, you can feel the tingle of magic amplifying within your stomach. Though the acids have not yet begun their work on the pixie, your stomach is blessed with magical absorption, allowing you to immediately absorb the magic of those trapped in your stomach. Because of that, you have to act quickly to utilize the overflow of magic before the pixie passes away. Once she was dead, the magic will fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your flat stomach proudly as you consider how to deal with the three bandits. You now have the power, thanks to the pixie, but you still need a plan. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Cat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious sign is the small piles of fur scattered throughout the area, another is the scratches against the trees, indicating that something had been using them as a scratching post. As you get closer to the cave, you start to slow down, doing your best to remain hidden. You carefully sneak into the entrance and slowly follow the walls of the cave. After a minute of sneaking, you freeze as you hear a purr from deeper in the cave. You quickly move to a small outcropping in the cave wall, before craning your neck around the corner. Further down in the cave, as the cave opens up, you see five catgirls sleeping together on a large bedding of straw. Most of them look fairly small, probably only being kittens. In the middle of the group though, is a much larger cat girl with a large, squirming gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be the reason for the killer cave,\" you think to yourself, \"That cat girl must be eating the townsfolk to feed her kittens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate to think about taking out a family of cat girls, but you can't just leave them alone and let them eat the town. Suddenly, you hear a noise from the pile, so you press yourself deeper into your hiding place. After a moment, you peek around the corner to see the largest cat girl standing up, their large stomach swaying side to side. You see her stretch her limbs before she lets her hands rest on her belly. You see her begin to sniff in the air, and after a moment, she turns towards you. You dip back into your hiding spot as you hear her footsteps getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did a little mousey wander into my house while I was sleeping?\" The cat girl said in a taunting voice, \"I sure hope so, 'cause mama needs all the food she can get for her little kitties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing starts to become erratic as you hear her get closer. You try to steady yourself, placing your hands against the cool cave wall. After a moment, you ready yourself for when she walks around the corner, preparing a paralyzation spell. The first thing you spot is her bloated stomach, which peaks around the corner for a moment before she follows. As she turns to face you, you see her licking her lips in anticipation, but you quickly shoot off your spell with it hitting her dead center in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl freeze's in place, the spell stopping her movements completely. You jump at her, hoping you can pin her down and swallow her before the spell wears off.</span></div></div>",

With the cat girl now flat on her back, you get up on your hands and knees before crawling over to her head, positioning yourself behind her. Taking a deep breath to calm your nerves, you take the plunge, opening your mouth wide and slipping the girl's head between your lips. You hold onto her stiff shoulders as you take your first swallow, her head entering your throat. Your lips stretch wide as her shoulders begin to enter your mouth. They're quickly followed by the cat girl's breasts, and you pause at the crest of your biggest challenge yet. You look upon the large, squirming gut in front of you and are unsure if you'll even be able to get it down but feeling a twinge of movement inside you, you push forward along the mountainous gut. At first, the process is easy, you're easily able to open your mouth wide enough to slide over the first couple inches of her belly but as you continue on, you begin to reach your limit. You feel a small amount of pain from the corners of your mouth as your lips strain to stretch over the cat girl's stomach. Using your hands to squish her belly, you finally manage to get it into your mouth with a satisfying *pop*. You take a moment to breathe a sigh of relief, the hardest part now over, but as you look forward at the rest of the cat girl, you do see something that'll give you a bit of trouble. You see that the cat girl's legs are starting to move, meaning that your spell had run out. You quickly get to work on getting the rest of her down before she causes too much of a fuss in your stomach. As you slurp down her waist, you feel her tail pressing against your tongue. Swallowing again, you tilt your head back, allowing the cat girl's slender legs to slide down your throat. With a final *gulp*, you finish sending the cat girl to your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your meal now fully inside you, you flop to your side, your large, stretched stomach lying against the cold stone floor of the cave. You slowly stroke your stomach, feeling your enhanced digestive acids begin to work on breaking down your large meal. You feel your stomach's occupant struggling wildly, although after only a few minutes their struggles die down to almost nothing. With your stomach now more manageable, you stand up and turn your attention over to the kittens. </span></div></div>",

Just moments ago the thought of eating the kittens would have made you feel horrible, but with the absolute impossibility of swallowing the large mother cat girl staring you in the face it became absolutely fine. A stroke of brilliance even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment it was as if time had frozen, your mind contemplating three options at lightening speed. The first was to swallow the mother cat while the spell was weakening. But standing a full head taller than yourself with breasts the size of cantaloupes from her villager meals and an ass that was closer to the size of watermelons it would take you at least a couple minutes to swallow her down. And the prey filled gut put the final nail in the coffin for that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning away occurred to you as well, but your own bookish habits and the enforced laziness that Madame Lustria always insisted would help you gain the weight and magical power had destroyed your physical stamina. Not to mention the toned legs and defined arms of the mother cat girl which gave testimony to the physical pred\u2019s strength and speed. You\u2019d never make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour magic was already used up completely, the one spell enough to push the limits of your puny mana. But the kittens were merely ten or fifteen feet away. The largest of the kittens was maybe as tall as the mosquito bites you pretended were breasts and due to youth was no more shapely a woman than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you took no chances, going for the runt of the pack who was even smaller than that. You never could remember being in the middle space. You recall being on the far side of the mother cat, consciously deciding to eat one of the kittens, and suddenly you had the smallest one\u2019s legs in your stomach and belly in your mouth, gulping as fast as possible as the mother cat shook off the paralysis spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother cat tried to run at you, but tripped as the lingering after effects of the paralysis spell were still destroying her coordination. It wouldn\u2019t have stopped her from kicking your ass or running you down, but it bought you another dozen seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was all you needed to finish your meal.

Monster!\u201d She was almost insane with grief and fury, able to watch your belly visibly shrink as you continued digesting your first prey. Her claws wildly, and fruitlessly, swung through the air as the levitation spell denied her any purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you had to act quickly as the mana you had right now was temporary following the use of Velox Digestum. It was the best spell for regaining mana quickly, but it had three major drawbacks compared to letting nature take its course or using one of the other digestive spells. Right now the concerning part for you was that as soon as your stomach was flat your mana would revert to zero within about 3 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the remaining 3 kittens stirring from their mother\u2019s screaming yowls, you cast your strongest ice spell on the mother cat to silence her. It works, suspending her in a block of frosted ice a couple inches thick. But even though you currently have near endless mana, you are still a young and inexperienced mage. Maintaining a spell while casting another requires a fine tuned multitasking concentration that still eludes you. As a result, the levitation spell ends even as the ice spell freezes her and the mother cat crashes into the ground with an ear splitting crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kittens all snap awake and notice their mother\u2019s blue skin and shivering form. They also see your still shrinking stomach and realize one of their sisters is missing. The kittens may be young, but they still had sharp fangs and deadly claws that you can see them preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious at yourself, you present them with a savage scrawl. For the moment the mother cat is still incapacitated from the combination of the three spells inflicted on her, but you can\u2019t eat her while the kittens claw at you! Even worse there\u2019s not enough of their sister in your gut to reliably subvert their minds back to sleep, not with your ham fisted skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you consider your short list of bad options, the largest of the kittens jumps at you and claws your arm. You manage a barrier spell, but can feel your mana dip even lower. You cannot afford to defend or to wait. You need to attack and win quickly while you still can!</span></div></div>",

Of course Velox Digestum was still running, but that was because it only shut off when there was no food and no mana left. This had to end both fast and efficient, which meant wasteful spells like fireball were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw yourself to the ground to dodge the kitten\u2019s second clumsy attack and had an idea as you saw their foot paws on the rough, uneven cave floor. With a word of magic you made cracks open and shut in the rocks that the kittens stood on, trapping one of each of their foot paws in 6 inches of deep earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been intended to trap them, but your closest assailant lost her balance. A wide grin covers your face as the kitten falls into your mouth while the Velox Digestum still ran. You swallowed hurriedly, feeling the momentum of the confrontation finally swinging your way as you finish devouring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith powerful mana flooding through you again you blast the remaining three cat girls with your magic, using raw force to deal damage that incapacitated them. You smiled with grim victory, as the battle had been much too close and had taken far too long. The question was what to do with them now that they were all knocked out, utterly incapable of resisting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village\u2019s request only wanted the threat removed, and using certain slave magic you could reduce the cat girls to reasonably docile pets. But that would take days of work and they would always remember the hateful girl who ate half the family and enslaved the others... At least you wouldn\u2019t have killing what amounted to prisoners on your conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more obvious solution would be to just eat them all. The threat would be permanently gone, it wouldn\u2019t take too long and would even advance your Gastromancy! After all, your bottleneck is your twig like frame. Due to Velox Digestum\u2019s second major drawback you wouldn\u2019t gain an ounce from the two kittens you\u2019d already digested... but if you let nature take its course the rest of the family could help you thicken substantially.

You reflected on the madness in the mother\u2019s eyes when you had no choice but to eat the first kitten. As well as the fury, uncoordinated as is was, that had driven the sisters to act to defend their mother. That much raw emotion... is frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since Gastromancy is far from the only sort of magic in the world. One branch, you recall Madame Lustria warning, was based in emotional energy rather than physical or spiritual. In her own equally endearing and annoying way, Madame Lustria had warned you of the immense danger that such magic posed to their own users.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also touched on how strong such magic could be, especially in pursuit of revenge. Not exactly the warning you expected, but you learned more from Madame Lustria\u2019s tangents than her main points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, obviously without training it wouldn\u2019t come to that. But most people who would buy such an exotic slave as a cat girl were the rich and powerful. Nobles and mages. All it would take was for one of the kittens to be bought by a mage and listen as they work and too much could be learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a stretch, but you\u2019d seen among the bickering nobles that visited the shop exactly how long grudges could hold. And recalled two nobles, one who was kind and fair to all while the other was utterly ruthless to his enemies and tolerable to his allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kind and fair noble had more friends, but even then his enemies were innumerable. Yet the ruthless man had no rivals... only a graveyard and those allies who were trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, patting your empty belly as the spell comes to an end. You had reached your decision, and would nip this whole thing in the bud. The whole family was gathered together here, so if you finished the feast there was nothing to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the mother by her head and start to swallow. You take your time to make it by her cantaloupe sized breasts, which leaked the most delicious milk, and crest her massive belly that was still working on some poor villager\u2019s remains. Steadily you pull her in until with a final swallow the mother neko\u2019s body slid into your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your stomach jutting a solid 3 foot out from your mosquito size chest, and a bit wider than your shoulders to boot, you have a bit of difficulty standing. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to and you sit between the last two young nekos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull them both towards your mouth, and in the interest of speed you try to swallow them at the same time. It proves more challenging than the mother\u2019s prey belly, but not much and you manage with a good deal of struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel them separating as they reach your stomach, the unconscious kittens going to either side of their mother and stretching your now painfully full stomach to a new record... at least when you don\u2019t count using magic designed to strengthen the stomach in some fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly still extending out about 3 foot and mere inches, it now sprawls to the sides considerably and it was without doubt that your belly was bigger than you were. Clearly digesting such a feast would take a while, though you could speed it up or make the cave secure with magic. After all, you had ample mana with the feline family feast consumed. Doing so would reduce the benefits you gain in the long run though.</span></div></div>",

You could focus on defense and gaining the most possible by using magic wards and experimenting, or make use of one of the other 2 tried and tested Gastromancer bedrock spells to absorb your prey in a swift, moderately efficient manner.

Yet somehow you expected to find that maintaining good protective wards would take more than that in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant you had to carefully consider how to craft a better spell. Before you got to thinking about it deeply you put up a trio of wards on the cave entrance. One to sound an alarm, one to activate a stony net and one to paralyze and shock the intruder. They were spaced out to give as much time as possible for you to react. As your recent experience had taught you, in a fight seconds was as precious as gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wards set, you turned your thoughts to making the most effective and efficient spell to aid digestion you could manage. You suppressed a wince as one of you prey woke and started moving inside you, the pain distracting your thoughts as they had been a few times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started your considerations by looking at each of the three great pillars or bedrocks of a Gastromancer. Velox Digestum, the instant digestion spell was focused on turning pry into usable mana as fast as possible. It worked by enhancing the acid in the stomach and raising the temperature to match an oven, cooking any prey into slop at a visible speed. But until the processes of the body quit secreting acids it demanded an insane amount of mana every second. Ultimately 90% of the prey\u2019s mana went to maintaining the spell and the rest would almost always be eaten through before the stomach realized it could stop with the acids. It also ran the risk of burning a literal hole in the stomach of the unwary Gastromancer since the destruction it caused exceeded the rate at which the stomach could repair itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought causes you to wince in pain again as the contents of your stomach shift. You lightly growl, rubbing your overstretched middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNunc Sorbere was built for a different purpose, that being to allow the Gastromancer to quickly regain strength in the presence of an abundance of resources. Such as on a battlefield where each day the magic they wield horrifies their enemies and each night dozens of prisoners are fed to the Gastromancer. It focused on improving the elasticity and contraction strength of the stomach, and forcefully ground prey into pieces that the regular strength acids could more easily handle. It could be canceled at will, but was too slow for use in the middle of a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large movement from what had to be the mother cat makes you hiss with a stab of pain. Increased elasticity would be nice about now, but you\u2019d already decided against using Nunc Sorbere. Still, if the pain got much worse you\u2019d be willing to do quite a lot to get rid of the pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevoratur Plenum actually slowed digestion considerably. The full absorption spell sacrificed everything on the altar of maximum gains. Time, constant effort involved, magic for defending yourself... even several regular body functions being potentially messed up if you abruptly ended the spell! Devoratur Plenum worked  by giving the Gastromancer conscious control over every single subconscious body function from stomach contractions to heartbeat to a woman\u2019s period. Then the Gastromancer would reorder the priority temporarily and slow the function of things to a crawl while stripping and absorbing every last scrap of whatever meal they consumed. Given that it doubled results, it was considered the best spell for maximizing gains, but you were in no position at all to use such a dangerous spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time all three of your meals moved at the same time in a bid to escape while they could. The sudden agony was excruciating and made you think you\u2019d been run through with a sword! But it lasted mere seconds before the kittens lost their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the comparison made you think. The Stoneskin spell was among your favorites for defense. You lacked the strength to maintain it for a full battle, but even in brief moments you can see how it would have served you better than your actual actions had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoneskin didn\u2019t replace your skin or body with stone. Instead, it infused your skin with the properties of stone in addition to that of skin. With Stoneskin active you could have punched the mother Neko\u2019s stomach with enough force to floor her, since your hand would have felt like it weighed 20~30 pounds and the rest of your arm over a hundred. And swords became a joke as even a blow that might chip real stone were absorbed by your skin flexing just a fraction of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you thought with your excitement growing, if you cast Stoneskin on your stomach it would be an excellent solution! The toughness of the stone would save all the energy wasted repairing the stomach from self inflicted damage and prey\u2019s struggles. The weight and force of the contractions of your belly would magnify instantly and the pain would vanish as your prey perished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation you drafted and cast your newly made spell, Stone Stomach!</span></div></div>",

But far more surprising was watching your stomach shrink nearly half a foot in all directions as the crunching sound of your prey\u2019s bodies being smashed into each other so tightly that the died instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to think about how mangled they probably already looked as you looked in awe at your much more compact and busily rumbling stomach. \u201cFae,\u201d you ask yourself aloud, \u201cwhat just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally you review the effects of the Stone Stomach spell you had crafted. It allowed your stomach to secret it\u2019s normal acids, to bulge and flex when pressured and enhanced the force exerted when the stomach squeezed its contents. Odd, none of that should...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open with sudden, shocked understanding. While active your stomach was as resilient as stone, which meant that it took pressure an order of magnitude, if not 2 or 3 orders of magnitude, higher to make your stomach need to flex and stretch. So the moment the spell activated, your stomach followed the laws of physics and crushed everything in it until the pressure reached equilibrium again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly you realize that this means that the spell can be even more effective than you thought! Canceling the spell your stomach billows back out to the former size, and you grimace as you feel several sharp points against the skin of your stomach. Then, as your stomach reaches full size you reactivate your Stone Stomach spell and again hear several crunching and snapping sounds as you effortlessly turn the neko bodies into a slurry of pulverized meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spreads across your face as you realize just how efficient and effective the spell is. A dozen brief activations took you only a minute or so, costing less than leaving the spell active the entire time would have and progressing your digestion at a rate that would make Madame Lustria speechless. It wasn\u2019t as fast as Velox Digestum, but it already far exceeded the speed of Nunc Sorbere and gave better than 100% gains relative to nonmagical digestion like Devoratur Plenum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t dared hope that it would exceed that mark for absorption before attempting the spell, and you\u2019d have to test it to verify... but the fact of the matter was that you were expending extremely little energy. The work was all being done by the pressure your prey exerted on your stomach walls, and the steep pressure required to force a Stone Stomach to stretch even slightly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you thought as you calmed some minutes later, each of the three pillars still exceeded your invention in some manner. Velox Digestum was easily 10 times faster, probably closer to 100 times as fast. Nunc Sorbere allowed the Gastromancer to fit far more food into their stomachs while in use, while you suspected that Stone Stomach would inhibit a binge if not carefully applied. And Devoratur Plenum would still hold the crown for the best absorption spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stone Stomach deserved to line shoulders with the three, and that before you even began refining it. Better yet, it had the broadest application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling extraordinarily proud of yourself, you napped and fiddled with the spell for a period of time, and by sunset your stomach was completely empty. With a smile you turn your attention to the weight that finally stuck to your body, giving you a...</span></div></div>",

You estimated that you\u2019d gained 15 pounds, and it made quite a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, how tiny you were to start out played a big part in that. If Madame Lustria gained 15 pounds only the most astute would really notice, but the towering woman was taller than most men and boasted large breasts, hips twice as wide as you are and a modest potbelly. If you were to guess you\u2019d put Madame Lustria at over 250 pounds, being conservative. 300 pounds might have been more accurate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you had been absolutely diminutive before your big feast. Barely 5 foot tall, your 3 measurements had been 27 inch bust, 20 inch waist and merely 30 inches at the hips. The only reason you\u2019d even had a womanly shape at all was because your stomach was even smaller than the rest of you! All told you had been 75 pounds of skin, bone and vital organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course 15 pounds made a very visible difference on you. Sadly you were still a thin tiny thing, but you had grown.

Your breasts were small, but defined and perky, while your hips flared out just a bit and your butt would tempt boys everywhere if you wore a daring sort of skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes you blush and turn your attention back to the present. After all, those were uncomfortable thoughts for a virgin maiden like you... only even entering your head because of Madame Lustria\u2019s influence.

And so you arrived at the loose arrangement of a couple dozen houses and a tavern while most of the villagers would still be drinking together in the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated to go into the establishment, as this tiny and out of the way village was a good half day\u2019s journey from the much larger town of Norlec. Though with a population of only a thousand, Norlec itself might be better called a village. Still, in Norlec almost everyone recognizes you as Lustria\u2019s apprentice and that won you respect and fear in equal measure from the peasants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut out here in the middle of nowhere that protection and comfort wouldn\u2019t exist. You braced yourself mentally for the way you\u2019d seen the drunk men at Norlec\u2019s tavern treat normal girls. You didn\u2019t have much choice to avoid going in. Ultimately the Mayor owned the place and it was the only location where you could rent a room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath you pushed open the door and walked in. Immediately almost a dozen and a half men, the majority of the patrons, turned to the door and looked at you with the sheer distrust and disdain peasants always gave an outsider. You did your best to ignore the looks and headed to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who was running the bar was broad but short, and had a beard that was went down a third of his torso. You immediately were reminded of drawings you had seen of the Dwarven race, but he didn\u2019t quite fit that picture. Dwarves were shorter than even you by a decent half head or more, but he was 3 or 4 inches taller than you. Maybe a half? Might be best not to mention it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed by your silence and staring he spoke first. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a drink or a room than get out before I toss you out stranger.\u201d He gruffly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a small start, realizing just how rude you\u2019d been acting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was looking for Mayor Gomream?\u201d As you said the name you suddenly realized how Dwarven it sounded, which had initially escaped your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-Dwarf snarls. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at him lass. What business ya got with me when I don\u2019t know you from a horse\u2019s behind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten up at his insulting manner, trying to hold down your own anger. \u201cI am Madame Lustria\u2019s apprentice and I am here to inform you that the cave is emptied of all dangerous inhabitants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Gomream guffaws at that. \u201cThe old bitch took in a runt like you? Do you take me for a fool? Even if you were a Gastromancer like her you\u2019d be the weakest Gastromancer in history!\u201d He calls to the whole room, explaining to the other peasants in a quick and effective way just how ridiculous the claim was. They all shared his merriment and heaped up even more insults and rough comments on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your rage swiftly rising at the insolence show to your master and the laughter your honesty was met with. You had come to receive your proper payment and a room for the night, but if this was how they dared to treat you than maybe a demonstration was in order to cow these superstitious animals.</span></div></div>",

By the time her tray full of mugs hit the ground you were at her hips and the room was going cold with shocked fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating as efficiently as possible you finish swallowing her down before anyone can recover from their shock.

Here, let me show you a predator\u2019s spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the peasants in the room backed away with terror as the sound of rock shattering bone echoed in the tavern and your stomach shrank visibly.

You smiled at the villagers in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, as I was saying. The threat that used to live in that cave is no more. Which leaves the matter of payment.\u201d You smile at the half-dwarf Mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes Mayor Gomream to grumble under his breath as he went to open up the chest that contained the village\u2019s treasury. He took a small coin purse and put a handful of coins in it before handing it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you grabbed the purse you knew it was too light.

So to a villager even a single Gold piece is a treasure able to buy a cow or a wagon, Silvers are the staple coin used to buy a good meal or a couple for a tool, and Coppers are spare change to make the values actually come out properly.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw the two dozen coppers sitting in the coin purse you looked back up at Mayor Gomream with unconcealed fury. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d You demand. It might be a decent tip for a waitress, but the amount in the coin purse wouldn\u2019t even buy more than a mug of whatever alcohol he served... not even a meal to go with the drink! Maybe a loaf of bread on the market place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Gomream grins. \u201cThat\u2019s the reward money minus a few fees.\u201d He seemed inordinately proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t share the feeling. \u201cWhat fees?\u201d You seethed. The reward for risking your life should have been at least 3 or 4 Gold with some Silvers, and he wanted to play games while giving you a pittance!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinder\u2019s fee for Jerom, message delivery for George, taxes for the Governor, Lord and King, Master\u2019s fee for Madame Lustria, a collection fee for myself acting on the part of the village and the cost of buying my waitress as a slave so you could eat her.\u201d Mayor Gomream rattled off quickly and naturally. \u201cOh, don\u2019t forget the church\u2019s fees for overlooking the use of evil magics. That\u2019s a steep one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling nearly floored by the long list you blinked as you tried to find a hole in it to take advantage of. You knew the church, taxes and Madame Lustria\u2019s Master\u2019s fee should add up to basically 2/3rds of the reward. Which put you down to 1 Gold and a handful of Silvers... not the worst price for a slave girl though probably the most expensive meal you\u2019d ever eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore fees what was the agreement you made with my Master? There should be a copy in writing sent back here with the messenger.\u201d You asked, hoping that Madame Lustria had included the normal clause about increased pay with increased number of removed threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Gomream\u2019s face twitched. \u201cI\u2019ll go dig it up. Have a seat and some patience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. Now he would have to treat you fairly. There was no way for him to get around it in the end you were certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later he slapped the scroll down in front of you and you eagerly started reading. The legalistic language was as slippery as always, but the essence of the matter was straightforward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the event the cave had been harmless to start with the Village would have owed 2 Gold for coming out to check on things. In the event that there were dangers lurking around the cave the price would go up immediately but would depend on what form the dangers took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandits would run 5 Silver a head while curses would charge over 10 Gold to break since most were nasty. A brief look finds you the price tag for \tanthropomorphic beasts, such as werewolves, centaurs and nekos. 75 Silver each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cave had been home to a family of predatory anthros. Nekos to be exact. There were 5, now there are none.\u201d You explain happily. That gave you 5 Gold before fees and clearly meant that the stingy Mayor Gomream had to increase what he paid you dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any proof?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to retort, the swallow your words as you realize that you don\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face is clearly all the answer he needs. \u201cLooks like I over paid you according to the agreement than as you cannot prove that the cave wasn\u2019t dangerous before you camped in it. I guess that means I need this back.\u201d He smugly takes the meager coin purse and writes a few figures on the back of the scroll before looking up. \u201cAnd you still owe me 37 Silver and 79 Copper for the purchase and consumption of my waitress.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You had precious little time though, as they were already standing back up. \u201cVelox Digestum.\u201d You said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, there were 23 patrons, 2 remaining waitresses, at least one cook and possible tenets in the upstairs rooms. And all of them had to disappear along with Mayor Gomream to prevent the worst possible outcome. It would be one hell of a task, and you needed every last scrap of magic possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you did was ward the building to look and sound normal. It took moments that you nearly didn\u2019t have, but a suction spell in the next second stopped the men at the door before they escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the waitresses, a brave and voluptuous thing, rushes at you with a kitchen knife. A bolt of lightning as thick as your wrist fried her and arced through several others in the room. Peasants, it became clear, couldn\u2019t stand up to your magic the way the catgirls had. Especially not to match the mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome 5 or 6 of them were knocked out already. The others were fighting the suction spell or trying to leave through the back. You cast a firewall spell around the entirety of the tavern, just inside of the illusion. If someone got too close to the building they\u2019d feel the heat, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. If even one of the people in the tavern escaped you\u2019d have to eat the entire village to control the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly ate the brave waitress while the villagers, now realizing they were trapped, attempted to hide. Once your stomach was filled again, continuing to maintain your mana levels, you conjured digestible ropes to bind the unconscious villagers and started to hunt out those hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t really that hard. A locked door would break open to a single force-wave spell, and the peasants were now so scared that most of them barely resisted when you restrained them with easy to digest rope and tossed them into the growing pile of the floor. As for the brave souls who resisted... a more potent spell and a gulp took care of them and of your mana levels. Soon all of the tavern goers, residents and workers had either been digested or were huddled up in your pile in the middle of the main room. Restrained for a most delicious and delightful feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you just needed to think of a good excuse for the destruction of the entire inn and death of all the people inside it. Once that was resolved you could eat the 17 remaining villagers in a more relaxed way that would let you keep the pounds that Velox Digestum had destroyed of your other victims and cast an illusion of that attack to fool the rest of the village into thinking you were their savior who had eaten the destroyer.</span></div></div>",

You let out a sigh of relief that you're not going to have to cut it open before positioning yourself at one end. You open your mouth much wider than a normal person can, a side effect of your gastromancy, before lifting the cocoon into your mouth. The silk leaves a bland taste on your tongue, so you quickly swallow, sending it into your awaiting throat. You gulp as quickly as you can while remaining quiet so as not to alert the spiders to your presence. It isn't long before the cocoon is fully inside your stomach, which is now lightly gurgling as it digests it's meal. You test out your magic by casting a night vision spell on yourself and find it working as intended as the cave lights up around you. You stand up, cradling your bloated stomach and begin making your way back out, now much easier because you can so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the cave you repeat the same process as before, extending your palm and casting the spell. A bright red fireball releases from your hand, shooting straight into the cave. Light floods the cave as the fireball flies through it, lighting any webs it passes on fire. Once it strikes the back of the cave it erupts in a beautiful explosion of red and orange, lighting the nest ablaze. You continue pointing your arm at the cave, shooting and fleeing spiders with more fireballs. You stand guard, waiting until the fire finally burns out. You keep your guard up as you return to the cave, making sure that the cave is totally clear, before returning to Madame Lustria's shop. You take notice at just how much magical energy it took, with your once extremely bloated stomach now the size of a large pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly return to Norlec, very pleased with yourself and how you handled your first quest.

You can tell how reduced that particular imprint is and know that it's not active now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquaring your scrawny shoulders, you use the last of the reserves granted by the jerky to ward yourself against the worst of the repulsion magics. As you do so, the disorienting effects fade enough that you can focus again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed into the cave with quite a bit more care now. It would have been one thing to deal with a wild animal or even a curse of some sort, but tangling with another spell caster poses some extra danger. You make sure to mask your own magical signature, not wanting to alert whoever may lie ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough soil and stone walls meanders down and down beneath the ground. Soon the darkness eats the light that leaked in from outside. You frown as you finger the last strip of griffin jerky in your pouch. You really should have been better prepared for such a trip, but Madame Lustria shoved you out the door before you could have stocked up. Not wanting to turn back and risk her thinking you incapable, you pull the strip out and soon gulp it down. Then you cast a simple dark sight charm.

Haphazard piles of more books and items overflow the bookcases standing against the walls of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay very little attention to all that though.

You're not sure what the ritual will accomplish, but you know it can't be good. You think back to all Madame Lustria taught you about magic rituals, and remember that the easiest way to stop one would be to break the circle. Normally, this would be easy as the circle would be made of something like salt or ash, but this circle was carved into the stone floor, making it a lot harder to disrupt. Normally, a simple earth molding spell would be enough for this, but your magic reserves were already extremely low, and you'd completely run out of food. Even if you did have enough mana to cast the spell, you're not sure how you'd deal with the demon. Looking around the room for something, anything that might help you, you notice the table covered with alchemist's supplies. It was covered with mixing bowls, vials of ingredients, and other equipment, but what intrigued you the most were what seemed to be some completed potions. It was impossible to tell from this distance what the potions were, but they truly seemed to be your only option, so you steady yourself and begin to sneak over to the table.</span></div></div>",

You're careful with your footing, making sure not to kick aside even the smallest of pebbles and alerting the demon. It isn't long before you make it to the table, but it seems that luck wasn't on your side, as the demon takes a quick scan around the room. You try to hide from its gaze, but with nothing to hide behind, you're hopelessly stuck in its sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, what's a little girl like you doing in here?\" The demon says, slowly stomping towards your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was j...just exploring,\" you manage to stammer out, \"and then I stumbled upon this cave and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't really matter. Now that you're in here,\" The demon tosses the table to the side, shattering the last of your hopes as now nothing is stopping the demon from getting to you, \"You're not getting out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon quickly grabs you around the waist, hoisting you up to his eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really a shame you had to stumble in here,\" the demon says, \"I do think you look rather cute. I wish I could keep you, but I'm afraid my companions would ruin that for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a horrified expression as a smile slowly spreads across the demon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who cares what they'll think, maybe I'll keep you anyway. At the very least, I'll take what I want from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon quickly takes you over to another one of the tables before pushing everything off and placing you on your back on top of it. He starts tearing at your clothing, removing the scraps until you're lying naked in front of him. He holds you down, keeping a tight grip on you. You watch in horror as a large, thick, red penis rises from in between the demon's legs. Its thickness rivals that of your arms, and you close your eyes as the demon begins to rub it against your vagina. You brace as you feel him pull back before suddenly thrusting his cock deep into your pussy. You wince in pain as your body stretches to accept the ginormous cock. The demon starts out slow, moving his cock in and out, making deep, long movements. Soon though, he begins to pick up the pace, shoving his dick into you faster and faster, his thighs slapping against your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...Please, stop,\" you manage to moan out in between his thrusts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, urgh, too late for that, ugh, now.\" He says, grunting and moaning in between his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he speeds up, he lifts you from the table, quickly lifting you into the air before slamming you back down on his cock. You can do nothing but cling to his arms and grimace as his strong hands hold you in place. His grunts and moans come at shorter and shorter intervals, and in a short matter of moments, you feel his hot cum squirt inside you. You stain your body as you feel gallons of his cum filling you up. After a few more moments, he puts you down on the table. You try to move, but find that your body is far too exhausted. You open your eyes and see that his cum inflated your uterus, making you look as though you were slightly pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff, huff,\" the demon lets out heavy breaths as he looks you over with admiration, \"I don't think I've ever had a mortal take my cock as well as you, huff. It almost makes me feel bad for what I'm about to do next.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see him kneeling before the table, picking up your legs and bringing them towards him. You try to kick your legs, hoping you can escape as you watch his maw open wide to accept your feet. You feel the demon's sharp teeth graze against your legs as he closes his mouth around your calves. You're dragged roughly against the table as the demon takes a large gold, sending your feet into the demon's throat. You feel the throat's powerful muscles pulsating against your feet pulling your further, deeper, towards the demon's damp stomach. The demon quickly makes his way forward, stopping shortly at your pussy to give it a quick lick before sliding his lips over your bloated stomach. With you now halfway inside him, the demon stands up, with a hand held against your back to support you. You try everything you can, punching, pushing, you even try casting a spell, but the spell fizzles out as the demon slides over your barely existent breasts. The demon smiles around your body as you finally reside yourself to your fate, letting your arms go limp. Your arms get pushed over your head as his lips slide over your face, shoving you into your dark, fleshy prison. The demon licks between your finger before finally swallowing, sending the rest of your body down his damp throat. After a moment, you're deposited into a slimy, humid, stifling sack that you can only assume is the demon's stomach. You feel a tingling against your flesh as his acids begin to pool at the bottom of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Buuurrp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the stomach reverberate around you as the demon lets out a loud pouch. You feel the demon pat his stomach, right against your back before hearing him say, \"Man, I take back what I said about feeling bad, you we- *URP* were delicious. And now I get to finish what I started on a full stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in utter defeat, feeling your air supply growing thinner with each burp. In a few minutes, you pass out not even able to fight the acids as they fill the demon's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your journey ends here, with your body slowly being turned into nutrients as the demon finishes his ritual.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yeah, this cave was definitely cursed. You remember one year of your apprenticeship under Madame Lustria had concerned all different kinds of hexes and curses, so it took a while to definitively say what kind of curse this actually was. After some time thinking, you realize that this is a curse that steals vitality of the land. Food in the area affected by the curse would be less nutritious, crops wouldn't grow as well, and it became impossible for new babies to be born. Definitely a nasty piece of work, but fortunately there was a way to end the curse. These kinds of magic needed some kind of focus to keep the curse in place; a magic circle, a crystal, or something else that anchored the curse's aura in place. As soon as the focus was broken, the curse would dissipate naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe identification spell that you cast earlier let you know that the focus keeping this curse around was located inside of the cave, and so after taking a moment to cast a light spell on a stick you found nearby, you walked in. The inside of the cave was eerie, the light on the tip on your makeshift staff causing creepy-looking shadows to be cast on the wall. It didn't help that the impossible sensations that you sensed earlier became nastier and more intense as you ventured deeper into the cave. The purple smell shifted to a sickly crimson smell, you hear the taste of rotting trees now, and so on. It was easy to understand why none of the villagers had ventured very deep into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the same sensations seemed to keep out other creatures. You kept wary nonetheless, but no goblins jumped out of the darkness, or skeletons rose up behind you. It seems that whoever cast the curse had expected that the unpleasant sensations of being near its focus would be enough to deter anyone from entering the cave. Correctly so for most people, but for a young sorceress out to prove herself? Not a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour of trudging through the cave, with the sensations enough to cause some nausea, you find the source of the curse in a particularly large and round room in the cave complex. The focus of this particular wasting curse is...</span></div></div>",

Her skin looks more like wood instead of flesh, and she has moss growing on her head instead of hair. It doesn't take you long to peg the creature as a dryad, a fey spirit that usually inhabits older trees. As a spiritual being, a dryad's body is suffused with magical power, which means that using one as a focus for a curse isn't odd. Seeing the dryad also helps you understand the curse a little more; this particular curse steals the vitality from the surrounding area, and stores it in the focus. This has left the dryad, said focus, rather engorged as her body expands to contain the stolen vitality. Her breasts, belly, and butt were all very round and glowing slightly, as the magic pulsed within them. She also appears to be unconscious, and won't be waking up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you've found the source of curse, it's time to deal with it. The first thing you think of is freeing the dryad from the light cage. With the dryad no longer in place as a focus, the curse would disappear. The dryad would also likely be in debt to you for saving her life, and that could be very handy. After all, the fey take their obligations <b>very</b> seriously. The dryad would likely do anything you asked her to as a way of repaying your for saving her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a second thought occurs to you. You could also devour the dryad. Her body, after all, is currently suffused with magical energy. And said energy would transfer to your own magical reserve after she had been properly digested. Of course, there was always a danger of infusing too much magical energy into yourself. If you couldn't handle it, you might die, or worse. But if you could, think of all the magic power you'd have at your fingertips! Maybe Madame Lustria would be able to teach you spells that you couldn't perform before due to a lack of magical power in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter decide quickly; being in the center of the cave is making your nausea worse.</span></div></div>",

The effect of the curse no longer plague you. You rush to her side and try to sit her up as your hands grab her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryad's skin looked like wood and was just as smooth yet still rather squishy and plump like human skin albeit thicker. This is the first time you've ever seen a dryad up close or been with a woman of her size. It was hard for you not to be envious of her assets. Out of curiosity you grasp one of her butt cheeks and give them a squeeze. The sensation was invigorating and pleasant. You reach with your other hand to grab her breasts and squeeze them. The feeling was equally arousing and quite difficult to grab since its bigger than your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour inspection is interrupted when the dryad stirs in her sleep and starts coming to. Quickly you release your hands and try to act innocent as the creature awakens. She moans and slowly opens her eyes. \"What...what's happening? Where's the cage?\" She looks down and sees your hands and shrieks jumping back looking quite startled. She crawls away though with her large figure she does so slowly. You stand up and assure her, \"Its alright. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm Far and I'm  gastromancer here to save you.\" You don't tell her that you're only here to end the curse or that you're an apprentice in order to impress her and get the plant girl to be indebted to you. She calms down and steadied her breathing. \"You are? Wait a gastromancer? How do I know you won't try to eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did I would have already done it.\" You point out. She seems to accept your reasoning and lower her guard. \"I suppose you have a point. I'm sorry for being so suspicious but after being tricked into being used for a curse its not easy for me to trust strangers. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Rosette. I can't thank you enough for rescuing me and will do anything I can to repay you.\" Already you can see that sparing her was starting to pay off. Before you can ask her to serve you she interrupts with, \"However we should escape before my captor returns. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the dryad through the cave no longer being nauseated by the curse. However you are distracted by Rosette's ample butt as she ran. It was hypnotic the way it bounced with each step. You couldn't explain why you found this so fascinating but it just was. You follow the dryad until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She groans a little, starting to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving her a chance to wake up, you force her feet into your mouth and began to swallow. The art of devouring large creatures is one that Madame Lustria has made sure you learn well, and several magical rituals and alchemical potions performed on you allow your mouth to open wide to accommodate the dryad's expanded form. You can feel a tingling as her magic-infused body disappears into her gullet, providing a sweet taste with a hint of wood. Finally, it's done, and you slump to the floor, your stomach a big globe in front of you. Fortunately, gastromancer robes were built with a slit in the torso to allow large guts some breathing room. It's never been that big before, and you decide you like the feeling of fullness and heaviness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling feeling returns as you start to digest the dryad, and you can feel the magic power that was once the dryad start to become yours.</span></div></div>",

Your formerly nonexistent breasts actually exist now, and your already wide thighs have some new padding on them, leading down to thicker thighs.

Madame Lustria was always reminiscing about the past, not a day would pass without you being reminded of something embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look back up you see both your and Madame Lustria\u2019s likeness in the metallic surface of a potion bottle across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Lustria\u2019s reflection was that a tall, buxom woman. Her long, black curls reaching her lower back just above her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison, you only come up to Madame Lustria\u2019s chest. Most of your thin being is swallowed by an over-sized robe, with the exception of your head. Your naturally straight, black hair is tied back into a tight bun, to help avoid it getting in any potions. Your big, dark brown eyes stare back at you, surrounded by your slightly feminine features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Madame,\" You suddenly ask. \"What exactly is this quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at you! Speaking up for yourself.\u201d She teases, \u201cThere's a nearby cave that the peasants claim has been swallowing people up. Complete bull, really, but you know how the uneducated get. The mayor's gotten worked up, though, and he hired us to go check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm letting you handle this on your own. I wouldn't worry too much, though. It's probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" You nod, brushing a strand of black hair back into place, \"but the practice will be good. When do I head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even react, she wraps her pudgy finger around your thin arm and drags you to the door. Knowing better than to resist, you let her shove you out. The rickety door slams shut behind you. Armed only with your robe and gastro magic, you make your way out of the town and into the nearby forest. The town guard were kind enough to point out the general area the \"killer cave\" was supposedly located in and you find it in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach, you discover...</span></div></div>",

Initially, there was nothing, but soon bones and rags of former clothes laying all over the place. Grabbing a rag, you inspect it, trying to see what you're dealing with, though you still have no idea what you're dealing due to the many scenarios that pop up in your head. Dropping it you sigh and continue on. After what you assume was about a few hours, as you spot more piles of bones growing bigger, you hear something up ahead and silence your motions. Going against the wall, you slowly slide along and pull out a dagger, as your last resort, since you're not as powerful as your master. Nearing the corner, you could hear something moving there and take deep breaths before peeking around the bend. Looking over there, you see...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to your surprise, a girl around your age, wearing ragged clothes, was drawing on the ground with a sad expression. Putting away the dagger, you approach her, startling her as she notices you and she runs behind a large rock in the cave.<br>\r\n\"Stay back! I'm dangerous!\" She warns you, stopping you in your tracks before you smile and introduce yourself.<br>\r\n\"I'm Far, so what's your name?\" You ask, the girl glaring at you with caution.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of hostile hesitation, she answers.<br>\r\n\"Lup, now leave before you get hurt!\"<br>\r\nStill smiling, you come closer as she attempts to dissuade you from proceeding towards her.<br>\r\n\"You by yourself?\" You ask, Lup nodding her head before trying to speak, only for you to interrupt her.<br>\r\n\"So I really don't see why I should be afraid. I can't ignore someone who's sad, so let me help you!\"<br>\r\nLup pouts for a bit as she stares at you, but gives in and walks out from the cover of the rock before talking. You didn't get a good look at her before as you were too far away from her, but at this distance, you could see how fat she was, most of it settling into her hips and butt.<br>\r\n\"I'm a cursed child!\" She shouts, catching you off guard.<br>\r\n\"Can you narrow it down a bit, please?\"<br>\r\nAccording to Lup, her curse activated a few months ago, when she turned ten. Sudden spikes to her appetite hit her randomly, but that was the okay part. However, that only occurred during the day and at night or whenever she gets stressed, she would morph into a monster, consuming anything in sight. The lives of her family and the villagers nearby were the first to fall prey to her curse. Lup was then chased out of her home once the survivors figured out she was the culprit and this has happened to her everytime until she found the cave. Sadly, her troubles didn't end, as her cursed form went out to hunt, bringing back people who wanted to kill her and she would always win.<br>\r\n\"I see, I think my master could help you, but it's nearly nighttime, so I have to put you in a safe spot,\" you said, as she stares at you in worry.<br>\r\n\"You gotta leave, or you'll die. Don't worry about me; just go back to your master and come back in the morning. I'll be fine,\" she said, though you shake your head no.<br>\r\n\"I must refuse.\" \"Why!?\" \"You're lonely, so I'm not leaving!\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"I know you hate being alone, as I've been an orphan before meeting my mistress.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to be like this for the rest of your life?\"<br>\r\nA long silence follows before she speaks in a quiet voice, her lips quivering as tears build up.<br>\r\n\"No, I really hate being alone.\"<br>\r\n\"Good, then I need you to remain calm or I'll have a hard time,\" you said, smiling at her decision and you come closer to Lup.<br>\r\nShe doesn't have time to shriek as you quickly engulf her head and slurp up her fat body. Once her toes slide past your lips, you thump down onto the ground, your belly smothering most of your legs and you utter a massive belch. Lup struggles for a bit before settling in and you pat it as you talk to her.<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that, but it's the best way possible for me to carry you during your transformation, so bear with it,\" you said to your first meal, hoping she'll understand.<br>\r\nA muffled sound comes from your gut and the girl stops moving. Getting up onto your feet, you carry your large stomach from the floor with difficulty and leave the cave. It was smooth sailing from here as you didn't encounter anyone and thought it was easy for a first time doing a quest until you exited the forest, just as the sun sets. Hearing a massive creak, you feel Lup moving around and soon she starts growing, her movements becoming violent as her voice changes to something animalistic. Losing your balance due to the sudden movements, you fall onto your side hard and you hiss in pain. Getting up again, you drag your stomach, as Lup has grown too big for you to carry and eventually reach the town gate. Leaving through the secret entrance was your mistress, Madam Lustria.<br>\r\n\"I was getting worried about you for awhile, seeing you didn't come back in the evening. But it was for not. Anyway, let's get that belly inside and have you digest all of that to a manageable size,\" she says casting a spell to levitate your belly.<br>\r\n\"Actually, Madam...\" You start off, going over what has happened and once you finish, you wait for her to answer as you secretly return to your home.<br>\r\n\"I see, I'll see what we're dealing with,\" she said, opening the back door of the alchemy shop and you both enter.<br>\r\nWith a flick of her hand, your robe covered belly become transparent, allowing you to see a large humanoid mix between a wolf and a lion.<br>\r\n\"Only way for her to deal with it is to make hers to control,\" she said, you becoming a bit depressed before she adds in more.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll teach her how to do it. In fact I was going to teach you transformation magic later on. But for now, go to bed and rest as I'll alert the mayor about the quest completion.\"<br>\r\nWith a nod, you trudged to your bed and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-e up, Far! Come on, it's morning!\" A voice urges you out of sleep and you wake up to a beautiful woman sitting on your chest.<br>\r\nThe woman's green eyes stare at you feverishly as she adjusts her long, wild, brown hair and hops off you.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Fae!\" \"You too, Lup, so where's master?\"<br>\r\nLup points downstairs as she shifts her hands onto her wide hips. Seven years has passed since you met Lup and age did a good job for her. The fat she had never disappeared as it relocated a bit of it to her breasts and rest of it towards her massive ass. Her boobs were rivaling your master's at the moment, but her hips flared out that you had to push Lup out of doorways she would get stuck in. The amount of flesh sticking out of her rump would require a person to make an XXL shirt as the back part of her panties, minus the part swallowed by her crack and it would jiggle at the slightest movement. After mastering her cursed form, she would leave a  part of her transformed, like having animal ears, giving the shop more customers than before. As for you, you grew taller and your ass and hips grew more, giving you a more feminine look than before, much to your dismay.<br>\r\nAs you're getting dressed, Lup was nearby and you pat her head, the woman drooling in delight as she happily receives it. During the years, she grew more attached to you and once you both hit puberty, she's been letting you know there's a woman beside you. Occasionally, she would ask you to eat her and sleep in your stomach, which you would comply to her demands. Going downstairs after changing, you both eat your breakfast as Lustria decides on what to do as there's no request needed to be done at the moment.<br>\r\n\"Alright, since there's no job to do, I thought we should do some refresher courses on your gastromancy and we'll start off with...\"</span></div></div>",

Because she wasn't an emission type, being the close range type, she could only make people, other than herself, just lose a couple of inches, a good foot or two if she's touching them.<br>\r\n\"Lup, you know you have to do it in order to improve your abilities,\" Lustria starts off, but Lup quickly replies back.<br>\r\n\"I know! I know! I've been doing it for the past seven years and no change had been seen in it. In fact, I used it on a thug yesterday, making him shorter than the woman he was harassing, but I didn't see him become tiny!\"<br>\r\n\"Hush now, child! Magic is far more alive than one would think! Your magic is just temporarily stunted and eventually, you'll be do it like Fae has done already!\" She replies back, Lup now noticing that the both of them were standing on your hand, in their birthday suits.<br>\r\n\"As expected, Fae, well done! You can go ahead now,\" Lustria said, pointing at her lips and you wipe your mouth with the sleeve of your robes, only to find drool on it.<br>\r\n\"You were giving 'that' look at us,\" Lup adds in, before Lustria gropes her ass from behind and nibbles on her ear.<br>\r\nIf she wasn't doing any research or requests and had nothing to do, Lustria would try to sate her insatitable sexual appetite, you being the victim of it.<br>\r\n\"If you guys want to, sure,\" you said, tossing the two into your mouth before swishing them around and tasting something salty from Lustria.<br>\r\nEventually, you get tired of having them there and you gulp them down, tracing them until you couldn't feel the bulge. With a satisfied pat to your chubby belly, you go do the things you needed to do and rub your stomach when you felt the occasional movement from the two women inside of it.once that was done and dealt with, you decide to go for a walk after closing up shop. As you're enjoying your stroll, you find a pretty flower growing in a pot and bend over to smell it.<br>\r\n\"Big brother!\" A young, female voice calls out behind before something impacts your massive behind, earning a surprised squeak and a sloppily, wet, butt trumpet.<br>\r\nOnce the thing detaches from you, you turn around to see a little girl returning to a group of children, a nun standing off to the side.<br>\r\n\"Mildred! I told you not to do that again!\" You scold the girl, blushing madly at the assault as you fan behind you.<br>\r\n\"I can't help it if big brother's booty is so big and nice and smelly!\" She giggles back, much to your displeasure.<br>\r\n\"It really couldn't be helped, couldn't it?\" Another voice comes in, you grimacing from its sound and turn towards it as an awkward smile approaches your lips.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Abigail! What you doing here?\" You reply to the f-cupped knight guard standing in front of you, her arms crossed and her eyes was giving you a stare that could vaporize you in an instant.<br>\r\nAbigail was opposed against you and your mistress, as she thought that what you two did was wrong and immoral, much unlike the rest of the town. Her sense of justice was very admiral and would help someone in need or take down any evil doers around, but because of that, she ended up inside the both of you in a humiliated fashion before you eventually let her out (Lup, as well later on, though she was quite reclucant on let Abigail out).<br>\r\n\"Just going on a walk, that's all, so see ya!\" You continue on, wanting to leave quickly, but the guard stops you.<br>\r\n\"You may have fooled everyone else, but you didn't fool me at all!\" Abigail starts, but Mildred steps in.<br>\r\n\"Stop bullying my brother! Everyone knows that most tsunderes won't get the person they like, so confess already!\" She shouts, you doing a bloody spit take while Abigail blushes madly and babbles some nonsense.<br>\r\nThinking it over, you have noticed that she would look over at you, but because of your mistress's jobs, you never had time to give it any thought.<br>\r\n\"There's no way she actually likes me, with the way she hounding me, but Lup, on the other hand, there maybe a chance. But does she like me since I've saved her, or does she think of me as a friend or family member?\" You think to yourself before stomach gurgles and your eyes widen before you run to release them out.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Abigail was trying to calm herself down by talking to the kids, but one of them makes a snarky comment.<br>\r\n\"I think they would make a good couple, as her dad was trying to make some moves on the Hungry woman, but always ended up in her guts somehow.\"<br>\r\n\"That's...\"<br>\r\n\"She has no girl power what so ever!\"<br>\r\n\"Her saving grace is her boobies, but that's no good at all!\"<br>\r\n\"Can do boy things!\"<br>\r\n\"I first thought she was a boy!\"<br>\r\n\"The opposite can be said for him!\"<br>\r\nHer mental health was dropping rapidly from their abusive remarks and once she heard that last comment, she turns to you as you didn't make retort on blaming genetics.<br>\r\n\"H-hey, wait!\" She shouts running towards you and grabbing your shoulder.<br>\r\nBut the moment she touchs you, your ass explodes, a thickly, green cloud of flatulence comes out of your butt, surrounding the knight and immediately at first sniff, she passes out. Without looking back, you run into the woods and once you think you're alone, you raise your robes, revealing the huge, bubble butt you built up over the years as Lustria's apprentice. Your big cock springs into life as your fist sized testicles rested underneath it and you spread those massive cheeks of yours apart. Another burst of gas erupts out of your anus before you feel something coming out and release a sigh of relief after it passes, knowing full well that one of them ate the other. Releasing your ass cheeks and robes, you turn to see, right on the ground, an engorged...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to my first interactive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you take the place of Fae, an apprentice Gastromancer. As the name implies, a gastromancer is a witch or wizard who gains their powers by devouring other living creatures. Do you have what it takes to become the next great magician? Or will you become just another layer of fat on some other being?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules</b></u><br>\r\n1. Any kind of vore is allowed, go wild. I will not put limits on it. This includes oral, giantess, shrinking, breast, anal, unbirth, etc. Hard vore is acceptable as well, but put always put a choice to opt out of it first as many people seem to dislike it.<br>\r\n2. Scat is allowed but again, like the above, put a choice to opt out of it so that those who dislike it do not have to read it to continue the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Try and use proper grammar and spelling. I understand English is not everyone's first language, but try your best. If you leave it legible I'll even correct errors for you in case you miss them.<br>\r\n4. Chapters must be at least a paragraph long. I'm not asking you to write a book for each entry, but some length would be nice.<br>\r\n5. No derailing! Though I allow everything, try and stick with the flow of previously established chapters. Don't, for instance, choose an option that ends in oral vore and suddenly switch it to another kind without reason. <br>\r\n6. Finally, sexual content is allowed and encouraged. Gay and lesbians are fine as well, though again, please don't take a line of heterosexual chapters and suddenly switch them to homosexuality. Put in some good build-up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGift points for those who add as well.</td>",
