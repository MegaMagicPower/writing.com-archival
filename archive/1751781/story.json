Doomsday and a 1984 society-plan set by Durandal was averted thanks to the help of the now current PLANT chairwoman Lacus Clyne and Supreme Admiral Kira Yamato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's the problem, Meer looks and talks exactly like Lacus Clyne, however, due to her risking her life for the real Lacus, the true Clyne did Meer a huge favor and help pay for the hospital bills when Meer took the bullet and lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her reflection in the window. The former pink hair was returning to it's dark gray roots, but her face looked the same. Just Lacus with a different hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave another sad sigh and walked towards the table of her apartment and looked for more adds. Hopefully there must be some job openings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah screw it I'll go on a walk and clear my head!\" said the former pop-star, standing up quickly and allowing her above average breasts to bounce. She dressed up in a simple pink shirt and jeans and headed towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhens he got out of the complex and walked around the park, she saw some people ignoring her. She was so used to the attention of being the real Lacus Clyne...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, this was for the best. After all she was an imposter and supported a madman's policies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lost in her thoughts, thinking of what to do in her life-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeer landed on the ground with a thud as she was jsut bumped into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I'm so sorry! Here let me help you miss!\" said a young voice. Meer reopned her eyes and gazed upon the person helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was of the same height and possibly, age, as her, skinny and lanky, dressed in a simple white dress shirt and jeans and he was carrying a bag of some kind. He was a Coordinator thanks to his silver hair and pink eyes. He blushed when he took in Meer's pretty face and he offered his hand, which she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you and I'm sorry for bumping into you like that,\" apologized the former popstar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing! I was looking down at the ground thinking of life and what to do with my current career right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's your career?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm a photographer. I hope one day to take pictures of beautiful girls for the modeling industry. Like yourself!\" Meer blushed at the blushing young man's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh me? I'm not pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are and I so apologize! That angelic face, those radiant blue eyes and that awesome mix of gray and pink in your hair!\" he began to think a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...you aren't looking for work are you?\" asked the young man. Meer perked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am. I got...pink-slipped 2 months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I live up on Aznable Way, and I got plenty of rooms so that I can take care of my future models. So how about it miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeer thought. Right now all she was ever good with her life was singing and looking pretty. She had no time to do school while as Lacus Clyne so she would be destined to burger flipping or even wrose, prostituiton if she did not take up this young man's offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was pretty, despite how girly he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: Look up Homura Sekirei on google to get a clear picture).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Although I may ask, what sort of models do you specialize in Mister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akira, Akira Weston. Well I specialize and take photos in the...\"</span></div></div>",

Have you heard of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus size?\" Meer has heard of the genre but never gave it much thought other than that they were rising fast in popularity. She was swamped in Durandal's schemes and the pressure of the real Lacus to give it much thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a fast rising industry with healthy girls posing for the camera! I'm a photographer and the head of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you run it! That's great!\" Akira rubbed the back of his head sheepishly though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's an independent company..and I'm it's sole member because I made it just a week ago.\" That deflated Meer a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...well how do you plan on well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan on posing for you! That's simple, you can live with me and you need to put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeer's eyes rose. She needed to do the bane of what all models did not do. Gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much are you paying?\" She eyed in suspisously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"umm...how does 25 grand for photo sound? And room, utilities, and food?\" he said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeer's eyes bulged. That much! How rich was he!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!\" Akira beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome! You're the third girl who has accepted. Shall we head to my car and I shall give you and the other two girls a tour of my place and your future residency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" But inside Meer was nervous. She and two other girls are going to get fat...but then again, that could be a good thing right? Letting go, gaining weight, no pressure from the public. She'd live a life of luxury of this kid was telling the trurth that he'd pay her 25,000 credits a photo and a new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they walked together and towards Akira's car, a brand new one and two females in the back waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice ride...\" awed the former popstar. He grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got it a day ago. Let's ride Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meer.

She still found it wierd that this handsome young man who was an entrepeuner for a soon-to-be plus size magazine offered them room, food, the whole shebang for them to model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive took about 20 minutes, and soon they entered the Kings Hills, a wealthy surburb in Argentus 2. All of the houses were exquisite massive mansions or very modern and futuristic one to two story houses. The house that they had driven up to was the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls! Allow me, Akira Weston, to give you,\" he paused he blushed at the 3 girls. \"Casa de Weston!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...how and where did you get the money for this...\" awed Meyrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inheritance. My father was a big time arms contractor to ZAFT.\" Weston looked away with a somewhat sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blood Valentine huh?\" asked Luna, already knowing the answer. Akira nodded, but a grin popped right back on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough of that! Let's go on inside! After the tour we can all go out to this great dinner spot I know of. My treat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Hawke girls nodded and Meer said \"Sure thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so what do you girls feel up to tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought you had a place in mind?\" asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually alot of places. My mom was a food critic before she bit the space dust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...hey girls, let's huddle on this,\" Meyrin grabbed Luna and Meer whispered into each others ears as they talked.

An Endless Sea of Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within this sea, drifted a piece of wreckage from a black avian-esque mobile suit. An AMX-04G Qubeley Mass Production Type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the Neo Zeon mobile suit was a lone green space ship, a freighter that slowed to a stop next to the ruined mobile suit and an oblong mobile armor appeared from the freighter and flew towards the ruined mobile suit. The mobile armor was spherical in appearance and had two oblong prongs and a single blue occular eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an RB-79 Ball, an antique mobile armor used by the Earth Federation, has now been stripped of weaponry and sold to civilian markets for a profit. The Ball grabbed the black avian mobile suit and turned back towards the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hangar closed, the Ball opened up it's cockpit and a figure floated out. He pressed several buttons and the airlock became secure, oxygen flowing into the freighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, time to see-Whoa! That's a Zeon logo!\" Said the figure. Through his spacesuit and helmet the figure was a male, and was in his late teens or early twenties. A grin then formed on his face. \"I bet people will pay a killing for this type of mobile suit!\" He soon reached up to the cockpit and put in some commands on the key pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better see what's in the cockpit, and dispose of the body as well, if there is one,\" said the man. One thing he hated about his freelance job was that he would come across the usual spaced corpse. It was never a pretty sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cockpit he peered inside with a flashlight and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a floating body of a young girl, at least from what he could tell given the feminine shape of the body. In addition, the pilot suit was black with red high lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...Is Zeon that desperate to use such young girls...\" Said the appalled man. He reached inside and grabbed the girl by her hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't stiff, usual of most corpses, but was rather flexible. The man's eyes widened,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's alive!\" He brought her around and saw her face through. It was a girl no doubt, and she was young. Age ten or eleven at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he gasped as he saw her twitch her face. He backed away, floating in the zero gravity as he and the girl floated out of the cockpit and into the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the girl's eyes widened and she looked at the man tiredly and said...</span></div></div>",

The man could tell she was ill, both physically and mentally. <i>What did the Zekes do to her?</i> he then wondered, apalled. \"What's your name?\" he then asked her.<br>\r\n\"Master...\" she trailed off, and she closed her eyes.<br>\r\nThe man panicked, <i>Shit, she's dead.</i> he thought. Laying her on the floor, he placed his ear on her chest to check her pulse. <i>Pulse is good.</i> he noted. He then placed the palm of his right hand over her nose, <i>Still breathing. Must be exhaustion. How long was she out there?</i><br>\r\nGrabbing her, he started carrying her towards the ship's \"medical bay\", which was very poor when compared to that of other, more \"standard\" ships. Putting her on the bay's bed, he then quickly inserted an IV full of hydrating serum. As he did, he noticed the little girl's face seemed to be twitching. She was sweating heavily, as grunted as if in pain.<br>\r\n\"What the hell did they do to this poor little girl?\"<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished placing the IV, he then grabbed a small cloth and soaked it in water. After doing so, he placed it over her forehead. \"Hopefully, you'll get better this way and the medicines.\"<br>\r\nThe girl continued her twitching and grunting for a little while more, but eventually stopped doing so.<br>\r\nThe man stared at the little girl, somewhat dumbfounded at all that had happened so far: the little girl was lucky, as many slave traders roamed this particular area, in search of stray survival pods to then sell them in the slums of the many Sides and the Lunar cities.<br>\r\nThe man then remembered how his lost love had once desired to have a little daughter.

A daughter he had tried to give to his long lost love, and now he would take care of her for the sake of that lost love.<br>\r\n\"Very well, then, I'll take you there.

To prevent this, she travels to the space colony Industrial 7 as a stowaway aboard the Neo-Zeon freighter, The Garencieres. Unfortunately while entering the colony she accidentally ran into a construction area and fell out of the center of the colony. However she was rescued by a young boy named Banagher Links.

'I've just... never really done this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then began to rub Audrey's belly, causing her to let out a small \"ah.\" as she felt Banagher's hands move around her belly, as all her discomforts began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B,Banagher.\" Audrey said, after a minute or two of enjoying Banagher's massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y,Yeah?\" Banagher asked. he was feeling less nervous after doing this for a few minutes, though he was still afraid that Audrey was about to tell him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you go a little lower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did as she asked and while Banagher's massage already felt good, it now felt absolutely amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh yeah. That's the stuff.\" Audrey said as she leaned further back into Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt embarrassed about saying something like that but Banagher was just so good at rubbing her belly that she couldn't help it. He was like an angel. That might not have been a bad comparison, even if it was incredibly cheesy, he did save her life after all and it didn't feel like that would be the last time either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's soothing massage accidentally forced the gas in Audrey's belly out, causing Audrey to burp loudly, she quickly placed a hand over her mouth, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me.\" Audrey said, she's been burping so much today, despite her normally excellent manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Banagher assured. \"Just do whatever you need to feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few seconds to think about what Banagher said, Audrey let out an even bigger burp without excusing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what was more embarrassing, her loud belches, her bloated gut, her huge appetite, or the almost sexual comment she made earlier, but it was definitely all worth it to meet Banagher and get to this moment. And she had to admit, it was nice to let go and be an ordinary girl. She didn't have any regrets about anything she did this day.</span></div></div>",

She had orders to retrieve Mineva and return her to the Garencieres, by force if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the solder side of Marida viewed this as nothing more then another mission, her human side, the side that saw Mineva as a little sister, was concerned about the boy that Mineva was with. She knew nothing about him and as most older sisters would've, she was afraid he was dangerous. The soldier side of was also concerned, the fact that she knew nothing about him made him a wild card and she had both heard of and seen many missions fail because of an unpredictable element. Mineva was the princess of Zeon, It's light, She couldn't afford to fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida continued to observe from a distance, she knew she needed to keep a balance action and observation, placing emphasis on over the other could easily result in the failure of a mission, especially in a civilian district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to Marida as if the boy was holding Mineva, but she didn't seem to be resisting or even uncomfortable, if anything she seemed completely relaxed. Marida knew that she didn't understand people, she knew it was completely possible that Mineva was willing sitting in his lap but she needed to know what Mineva had done since arriving in the colony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat confused her the most however, was Mineva's bloated belly. She knew that Mineva wasn't pregnant and she knew that she would never pig out to such a ridicules extant. Perhaps it was a clever ploy to convince anyone who had seen her that she was pregnant, throwing her pursuers off, though she wasn't certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mineva's belly and how much she must've eaten to cause it to swell so much, made Marida think about her own belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida was no longer the slim and fit soldier she used to be, having become incredibly obese. As a result of letting her training and diet slip her mind for a while now, she ended up gaining so much weight that she weighed 348 lbs., making her incredibly obese. This certainly took the expected toll upon her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was her absolutely huge stomach. It was a massive sphere of adipose, big enough that it went past the hem of her pants. In fact, it was so huge, it actually had a notable hang due to the effects of gravity pulling the massive weight down, causing it to obscure the young woman\u2019s waist and crotch. There were several prominent rolls and love handles on the sides of the titanic beast, and they melded seamlessly with the ample amount of back fat the redhead had accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Marida\u2019s chest. Her cleavage was modest beforehand, but now it was absolutely huge. Each boob was massive, filled with so much fat that they were trying to burst out of her bra. Granted, they were still just as perky as ever due to Marida\u2019s youth, but they each boob was as big as a honeydew nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, one couldn\u2019t leave out Marida\u2019s now prodigious posterior when describing her. While it used to be toned and fairly small beforehand, now it was massive and blubbery. All the muscle that used to be there was completely gone, instead replaced by copious amounts of flab that caused each cheek to jiggle profoundly when the soldier even so much as walked. The amount of jiggling and jostling it did whenever she ran only served to remind the young redhead of how huge her ass had become, to the point that it caused many rips and tears in her old pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were Marida\u2019s arms and legs, just as flabby as the other areas of her body, and their effects just as heavy as they were literally. First, her legs were so thick with fat that they chafed against each other constantly, not even having the smallest of gaps when one looked at the upper area. It seemed they were almost permanently fused together, their great jiggly masses bouncing along with every step the young woman took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead\u2019s arms weren\u2019t exactly much better: while they weren\u2019t too bad near her hands, like her legs, the further up they went, the thicker they were. They had lost all traces of muscle, and were attached to hands that were very thick, with sausage-like digits to seal the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Marida\u2019s face. It was much fuller than it was when she was slim, definitely. She now had cherubic, fat cheeks that went along well with her double chin. Combined with the copious amounts of neck fat she had, along with how her face was usually red from exhaustion, it gave her a very cute appearance. However, this never detracted from just how piercing her gaze could be whenever she needed to use it. But when she was relaxed, allowing her more human side to show through, she certainly looked like quite the nice person to cuddle with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, poor Marida\u2019s wardrobe hadn\u2019t been updated at all to accommodate all of this. Her uniform\u2019s shirt was so ill-fitting that it rode up over her dome of a belly, enough to rise well past her navel. Her stomach and waist were both so huge that they ended up breaking many of the standard-issue belts given to the redhead, so she had to get a tailor-made one. Her pants, while not having as many tears and rips as some previous pairs, still had a few. In short, she was practically bursting out of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! A lot better.\" Audrey replied with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had been rubbing Audrey's belly for quite a while by now, he was happy to know that it was helping her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready to get up. Let's go.\" Audrey said, after a few more minutes of her tummy being rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was just about get up, when Banagher hit a really sweet spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.\" Audrey moaned. \"Maybe in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a dozen minutes later that she was finally ready to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRP! Alright, I'm ready to get up for real this time.\" Audrey said, getting up with a smile still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks for the \u2013UURRP- massage Banagher.\" Audrey said, blushing with a nervous smile on her face. She was such a dork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Just let me know if you need me to rub her your belly again. Or, uh, if you need my help with anything. Aside from getting to the mansion that is.\" Banagher replied, blushing with a similar smile as Audrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a small giggle at this, it was fitting that her best friend was as dorky as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair continued walking to their destination. Marida knew they were going to take an elevator to the colony builder, and decided to cut them off.</span></div></div>",

It felt just as good as it did before, though they would've like to sit down. Even though they were getting used to this, blushes still appeared on their faces. They are still teenagers after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wouldn't be able to enjoy this moment for long however, Marida was waiting for them at the elevator's stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends didn't notice her immediately, they were stuck in their own little world. Marida didn't mind though, in fact she didn't intend to interrupt them. They would have to acknowledge her soon. And it was nice to see Mineva happy. Though Mineva Lao Zabi, The Princess of Zeon wasn't here, there was only Audrey Burne, Banagher's close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey unleashed a loud belch, patting her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.\" Banagher complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher.\" Audrey didn't know what was coming over her, but she was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after thanking Banagher for complimenting her belching skills, something Audrey never thought she would do, she noticed Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Marida?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey instantly moved away from Banagher, blushing even more. She instinctively tried to button her clothes together, having forgotten in the head of the moment they had popped off. Panicking, she tried to pull her blouse back down over her belly and pull her pants' zipper up. Neither attempts at looking presentable were met with success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing such an uncharacteristic lack of manners from Mineva, not to mention just how loud her burp was, surprised Marida, leading to a small look of shock on her face, which was mostly just her bottom lip lowering slightly. She quickly recovered however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida looked at Banagher. She could tell that he wasn't someone how would hurt Mineva. She quickly turned her eyes back to Mineva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go back.\"</span></div></div>",

He knew they couldn't just try to run away, while Marida appeared to be too fat to catch up with them, even if Audrey was still bloated, the two men with Marida would still catch up. Despite this, Banagher could still see a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" Banagher said quietly to Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can\u2019t handle Laplace's Box right now,\" Audrey argued. \"whatever it is, it will simply be used by Full Frontal to start a meaningless war, which will bring nothing but more hatred, you understand that, don\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" Marida replied, Audrey's words had no effect on her. \"I understand that I have orders to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie.\" Audrey said, raising her voice a little. \"You weren\u2019t given your powers for this, you know very well that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey abruptly stopped speaking, as she say the two men behind Marida move towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry.\" Marida apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gently rolled Haro between the two groups, before pressing a button that sent the elevator back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danger! Danger!\" Haro exclaimed as he rolled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your hand.\" Banagher said, as Audrey did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaro began to emit a beeping noise as he flapped his \"ears\". This caused the two men back up slightly, Marida's group was worried it was a bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they came to the conclusion that Banagher needed them to, he throw Haro high up in the air, causing the two men to panic, now positive that it was bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!' Banagher exclaimed as he used the rails to jump onto the platform that was now above them, guiding Audrey to do the same as they were still holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men attempted to chase after them by doing the same, but do they were only able to grab onto the ledge, Banagher and Audrey were already standing up by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher delivered a swift kick to the larger one, knocking him down. Unfortunately, this allowed the other one enough time to pull himself up, Banagher was completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey realized that Banagher was in danger, and belly bumped his assailant off the platform, causing her belly to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed at this, embarrassed. Banagher actually liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job.\" Banagher complimented as he caught Haro before they began running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" Audrey said, running with him. She was picking up a lot of useful skills today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was having trouble running however, she was simply too bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida used the larger man that had fallen down to jump up onto the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!' Audrey said, as she saw that Marida land onto the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked back, realizing what Audrey was warning him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began running after them. She started to pant and sweat, her face red from exhaustion, her body jiggling and wobbling violently, reminding her of just how out of shape she's gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile having a bit of trouble running, Audrey was still faster than Marida's extremely obese form. Despite this Marida was beginning to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey platform they were on was starting to disconnect form their destination. Banagher and Audrey jumped over to it, with Marida doing so as well not long after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let go of Audrey and tried to push Marida off, it was hard to make someone so fat even budge, but Banagher did so by force of will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher fell off the platform with her, but Audrey grabbed his hand and manged to pull him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was lying on the ground trying to get her breath back as she heard her stomach growl. Giving an exasperated sigh, she placed a hand on it in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher were sitting down, panting and trying to catch their breaths, they were almost as exhausted as Marida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Banagher said, still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're -pant- welcome.\" Audrey, completely exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's stomach let out a sickly growl, which caught both teens' attention. All that running wasn't good for Audrey's poor belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need -pant- to throw up now.\" Audrey said, feeling all the food and drinks in her stomach starting to come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have -pant- a napkin?\" Banagher asked, they might end up having to share it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey realized that she didn't, she threw out the napkins that came with the hotdogs when she finished eating. If she threw up, she would have to show up to the mansion with vomit on her mouth or her clothes, and she wasn't going to ask for permission to vomit on Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold it down.\" Audrey answered.</span></div></div>",

The two men that were accompanying her had already returned to the Garencieres, Marida had told Zinnerman that she would return when she had finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida was enjoying quite a feast, her table was filled with hamburgers, fries, hot dogs, soda, pizza, and ice cream.

Marida unzipped her jacket along with her pants and undid every button she could find, easing the pressure on her big tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida continued eating, more sauce and bits of ice cream continued to land on the redhead's large body, sometime even in her cleavage. Marida didn't care about how messy she was getting, she needed to eat and that was all that mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Marida had finally finished her feast. Marida let out an incredibly loud belch as she leaned back in her chair, hands on her big gut, feeling how hard and full it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.' Marida said, not understanding how pointless it was to bother excusing herself at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her belly was already big, Marida's gut was now absolutely huge, to the point of turning her shirt she was into a tube top. Marida had to admit that she was impressed, both with how much she manged to eat and by how large her belly was. Unfortunately, Marida had a massive stomachache from eating so quickly, but she wasn't going to let it keep her down, she just needed to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a few minutes tending to her aching belly and belching, Marida heard a beeping noise come from her watch, it had been an hour since she started eating. Marida began to heave herself up from her chair, a task easier said then done. It was hard to resit the urge sit back down and wait for her tummy to digest her meal, but Marida knew that she would break the chair if she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida manged to finally get up after a dozen seconds of what felt like exercise to her. Marida took a moment to catch breath. She looked down at the orb of fat disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely going to have to start exercising again.\" Marida thought. \"I need to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida began the arduous walk back to the Garencieres, rubbing her swollen tummy and belting out massive burps the whole time. She hoped that she would still fit in her normal suit, she needed to spend some time in zero gravity.</span></div></div>",

She's looked after me for a long time.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though she does feel like one. I never got to know my family.\" Audrey explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" Banagher said. \"I never know who my father was and my mother died a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher had never opened up to anyone about his family. While he talked to Micott and Takuya about it, it was only once. He was bringing it up now because Audrey hurting as much as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both my parents died when I was very young.\" Audrey said. She wasn't sure if she wanted to get so personal with Banagher but it felt good to talk about it. \"Should we talk about something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's nice to talk about stuff like this. You're the only one I've ever opened up to about this.\" Banagher answered, happy that he finally found someone that would understand how he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Audrey and Banagher talked about their families, Micott and Takuya were having a field trip to the Snail along with their class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Banagher never showed, huh?\" Takuya said to Micott. They were both worried about Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Petit MS that crashed on our school campus, I hope that wasn\u2019t him.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't crash, that was a forced landing. We don\u2019t know why he did it, so we shouldn\u2019t be spreading rumors about him. If he gets kicked out of school, he\u2019s gonna be living on the streets. It\u2019s not like he has a home to go back to.\" Takuya replied. \"If he doesn't show up today, then we'll go look for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't stop me if you tried Takuya.\" Micott said before looking through her binoculars. She was still worried but she might as well try to enjoy the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon noticed two figures walking together. She zoomed-in, revealing them to be Banagher and a girl she didn't recognize. They were even holding hands as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher?!\" Micott exclaimed. \"Who's that girl he\u2019s with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with her gut?\" Micott mentally added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Takuya said, grabbing the binoculars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was very confused. Is Banagher into fat chicks? Is that why he ignored her this morning? She was going to have a talk with him when he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see he's okay.\" Takuya said, relieved. \"Something wrong Micott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. I'm just wondering who that girl is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out soon soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott wondered if Banagher really was into fatties. If that was the case, then maybe she would put on a few pounds herself. She could definitely make being fat work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wanted to know about that girl. He couldn't have known her for more then a few hours but they already seemed like close friends. While she wasn't sure if she trusted her, it was nice to see Banagher talk to someone new.</span></div></div>",

Haro!\" Haro exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey chuckled. \"I can see why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been upgrading him since middle school.\" Banagher said. \"That's why I'm into electronics. Sometimes I think about playing the piano like my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play the violin. I could show you when this is all over.\" Audrey suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I can play as well as I can eat.\" Audrey said as she gave her belly a little shake. She was still a little embarrassed but Banagher was helping her feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can play even better.\" Banagher assured. \"Any friends you'd like to introduce me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never had any.\" Audrey said. \"I was sheltered so I never got to know anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher felt sorry for her. While he was always a little shy he still had Micott and Takuya to talk with. Audrey must feel so lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have me.\" Banagher said, smiling. \"I'm you're friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher,\" Audrey replied. A warm smile on her face. \"Thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher could reply, tremors interrupted them as the builder unit moved back, the colony starting to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The walls of the colony grow as more and more foundation blocks are added.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" Audrey said. \"The world itself is growing\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly a breathtaking sight for them. This wasn't the first time Banagher had seen it but watching the colony grow with Audrey had caused him to see it in a different light. It was a sight that they would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally reached the mansion. Their journey was coming to an end. Or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s it.\" Audrey said, both of them staring at the sight before them. \"I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s really a mansion out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began walking towards it when Audrey realized that she needed to ask Banagher a very important question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, wait!\" Audrey said as they stopped walking. \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my belly any smaller? Do you think I can cover it now? Maybe I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being kinda weird, Audrey.\" Banagher was caught off-guard by Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a loud sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Audrey admitted. \"I just want to look presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be yourself.\" Banagher said. \"That's how we became friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey accepted Banagher's advice. She nodded before they continued walking to the front door. \"Be yourself\". Audrey felt like she was in a whole different world. One where she had a friend. One where she was herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reached the front door. Audrey realized that when they went through it, they would be at her world and she would be Mineva Lao Zabi again. Her heart began pounding, she felt like she was about to lose everything. She felt like she was about to lose Banagher. When this day began, she would've abandoned Banagher when she didn't need him anymore. Now she couldn't imagine doing such a thing. She needed him and she wanted him to need her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher knocked. There was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe no one's home.\" Audrey said. The deal wasn't going to be held for a few more hours so it's possible that the man she was looking for wasn't here. At least that meant she would be with Banagher longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear a piano?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Audrey said. All she could hear was a few birds chirping. \"I don't hear anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher ignored her and entered the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us! Is anyone here?\" Audrey said as she followed him into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked up the stairs. Audrey blushed as her belly jiggled with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher entered the room the stairs led too. He couldn't explain it but he felt drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, you can\u2019t just\u2026\" Audrey stopped as saw the beautiful sight that stood before them. The room had six tapestries in it. They should be related works as the base colors and structures of all these works were the same. They had a woman standing at the middle of a garden with flowers and animals woven in them. The imaginary world the woman was in would remind one of a small outer space. There were two beasts on both sides, and the completely different parties created 6 scenes. Amongst the two beasts, one of them was a lion, and the other one was one with the body of a horse and a long thin horn on its head\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A unicorn\u2026\" Audrey muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who was taking fruits from the tray the maidservant was holding; the woman playing the harp at the table; the woman making a crown of flowers. The woman who let the unicorn rest on her knees and looked at the mirror; the woman holding a flag with a moon on it; and last of all, a woman standing in front of a small tent, putting her jewellery into a box a maidservant's holding. The unicorn and the lion were on both sides of the tent, and the woman who looked like she was putting her jewellery away was entering a tent. The tent had the words 'A Mon de D\u00e9sir' written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my only desire\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read all of that?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember this.\" Banagher said. \"I\u2019ve seen this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've seen it too.\" Audrey said. \"What's it's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady and the Unicorn.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two continued to enjoy the painting, it was beautiful. Audrey gently grabbed Banagher's hand. She couldn't put it into words but it just felt right. She felt Banagher hold her hand, she could tell that he was feeling tense. He needed someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, do you like The Lady and the Unicorn? I do!\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" Banagher said. \"'To my only desire.' The beast of possibility... The symbol of hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice quote. Did you come up with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it just sorta came to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher gave a little smile. It was weird, how Audrey made Banagher feel, a warmness permeating his heart that he didn\u2019t get from most other people. The closest was Micott, but even that was different than what Audrey made him feel. It was almost as if she was helping to fuel his happiness and confidence, which he was tremendously grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that that\u2019d be very important later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to enjoy the painting. Eventually, a loud yawn filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Audrey said, blushing. \"I'm feeling kinda sleepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you've eaten yourself into a food coma.\" Banagher said, a friendly smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's when you eat so much you fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I did eat a lot.\" Audrey said as looked down at her filled up tummy, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling pretty sleepy myself.\" Banagher said before yawning. \"Do you want to lay down for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well, yes. But I don't know where we could sleep. This isn't our house after all.\" Audrey said, concerned with being polite, as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone will mind if we sleep in the guest room.\" Banagher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, we'll pass out on the floor if we don't get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey replied, taking Banagher's joke completely seriously. \"Alright, you've convinced me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher soon found themselves a room. Much like the rest of the mansion, it was filled with incredibly expensive furniture. Despite this, everything looked like it hadn't been used in a long time, yet the room was still clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a pretty nice room.\" Banagher said as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My room is kinda like it.\" Audrey instantly realized she said too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is your family rich or something?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was having difficulty coming up with what to say. She had to tell Banagher something but she didn't know what. She couldn't tell him that her family wasn't rich, she just admitted to have a fancy and expensive bedroom. And she obviously couldn't tell him that she was the princess of Zeon. Audrey really wished she could just tell Banagher the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well, I'm rich. I mean! My family is rich. But you know, it's not a whole lot of money. I mean, it is but that's not my opinion.\" Audrey twiddled her fingers and tried to avoid looking at Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Audrey. You don't need to tell me anything.\" Banagher said, a little smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at Banagher and breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher laid down on the bed, letting out a sigh in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so nice to relax after everything.\" Banagher said. He noticed that Audrey was staring at him and seemed nervous. \"Is something wrong, Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" Audrey was blushing. \"I-I've never shared a bed with someone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher immediately started blushing. He hadn't realized just how intimate he was getting with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I-I haven't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both silent for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, w-what should I take off?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just your shoes.\" Banagher said. \"A-And your coat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blushed as she took off her coat and shoes. While she wasn't revealing anything other then her bloated gut to Banagher, she still felt nervous. Banagher blushed just as much as Audrey as he removed his jacket and shoes. He was just as nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher then laid down in bed together, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh. Do we talk and stuff?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you-If you want.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey came up with a conversation starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your favorite video game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Dangan Ronpa. Have you heard of it?\" Banagher asked, excited to geek out with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have. Tell me about it.\" Audrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about a group of special high school students that are trapped in a school called Hope's Peak Academy by a teddy bear called Monokuma. And the only way anyone can get out is if they kill someone and don't get caught.\" Banagher said as if it was the most normal thing ever. \"After every murder, a class trial is held between the survivors who investigate the case then vote on who they think the murderer is. If they get it right, then the murderer is executed. But if they get it wrong, then the murderer \"graduates\" and is allowed to leave the school, while everyone else is executed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty interesting, Banagher.\" Audrey said. It sounded complicated to her but it still sounded like a good story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I told you a little too much at once. Heh heh.\" Banagher said with a goofy smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'd actually like to know more about Dangan Ronpa. Can you tell me about the characters?\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Their all really great. My favorite is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to geek out together. After a while, Audrey started giggling profusely, truly enjoying the time she was spending with Banagher. However, she felt a bit of a disturbance within her gut, a gurgling that forced her to put a hand on her stomach in shame. This attracted the attention of Banagher, much to the young woman's' embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong, Audrey?\" he asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, I just -UUURRRP!\" she belched out, growing red in the face. \"Excuse m-me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Do you want a belly rub?\" Banagher asked, a nervous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes please!\" Audrey said, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey moaned in satisfaction as Banagher began rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. UUURRRP! Excuse me!\" Audrey said as she and Banagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're excused.\" Banagher said as he continued to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher continued to geek out for several hours. It was actually starting to get quite tiring, forcing the two teens to start drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey woke up a few hours later, stretching and yawning. She wasn't sure how long she'd been conked out, but looking out the window, she could see the Sun was setting She looked over at Banagher, who hadn't yet woken up. He looked so cute sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Audrey realized that her meal had an effect on her, and not in a good way. Her stomach, which used to be completely flat, now had a fair amount of pudge to it, filling a little bit of her lap. There weren't any rolls or anything to speak of, but it was certainly straining the hem of her pants quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were a tad fuller as well, feeling somewhat snug against her bra, and they rested on the creamy flesh that made up her stomach. Audrey always had a respectable chest, but it had just gotten a little bigger with all the calories she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were thicker, not enough to touch yet, but getting there, and they were connected to meaty thighs. They seemed to jiggle quite a bit more when she moved them, to which she was quite embarrassed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was fuller too, no doubt due to influence from her legs, and it was filling up her mattress more than the young princess would care to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face hadn\u2019t actually seen much change (granted, she couldn\u2019t tell anyways), although her cheeks were just a little bit fuller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face was beet red as she looked over how much weight she had gained. She had no idea how she was going to lose this fat. A loud yawn interrupted her thoughts. Banagher was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Audrey.\" Banagher said as he stretched.</span></div></div>",

How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm feeling fine. It's quite a beautiful day, isn't it?\" Audrey asked, staring out at the scenery outside. \"Like something out of a painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it is.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Audrey's attempt at distracting Banagher, she knew that he noticed her weight gain. While Banagher could tell that Audrey was embarrassed about her weight, he still found her to be incredibly attractive. He wanted to say something to help her feel better but he knew it was better to not say anything for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh.\" Banagher sheepishly scratched the back of his head. \"That guy you're looking for should be here now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Audrey replied. \"His name is Cardeas Vist. He's in charge of the Vist Foundation. Do you want to meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Banagher said, a sweet smile on his face. \"I'm probably out of my league. But I want to be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Banagher.\" Audrey was smiling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt her belly jiggle as she and Banagher walked back to the room with the painting, catching both of their attention. Audrey's face was beet red. Banagher decided to start some small talk to help Audrey get her mind off of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh. Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes I did. I even had a dream about us.\" Audrey's eyes instantly widened when she realized what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I actually dreamed about us too.\" Banagher was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is t-t-that so? Well, umm, what was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was us y-you know, going to school together and hanging out after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that so?\" Audrey asked, caught off-guard. \"Because, honestly, that was the same type of dream I had. But that seems incredibly coincidental...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are having a good time together.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey said. \"It was a nice dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was.\" Banagher said. They were both smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered the room with the painting. It appeared that no one had entered the room since they left it. Banagher and Audrey looked at The Lady and the Unicorn. It felt so familiar to Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen this before.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interested in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice interrupted their thoughts, startling them. The two teens turned around and saw a man standing at the door. He looked at Audrey, who was frozen, and again looked back at Banagher. The man slowly entered the room. Banagher felt the pressure in the room get even more intense. He subconsciously took two steps back, when Audrey grabbed his hand. They both looked at each other, ready to talk with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lady and the Unicorn\". It\u2019s a tapestry believed to have been created in France before the middle era. And it\u2019s no replica. My predecessors went through a great deal of trouble to acquire it prior to the One Year War. I\u2019m head of the family, Cardeas Vist. This is my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must apologize for coming into your home without permission.\" Audrey said. \" My name is\u2026 Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m aware of who you are.\" Cardeas stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we\u2019ll skip the formality.\" Audrey said. \"As long as you understand my position, that\u2019s all that really matters. I\u2019ve come here to ask you to rethink this course of action. I\u2019m referring to Laplace's Box and your plan to hand it over to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas turned his attention to Banagher. \"I think you had better leave.\" Banagher felt nervous but he would never abandon Audrey. Cardeas immediately returned speaking to Audrey. \"It\u2019s too dangerous. We shouldn\u2019t be talking under these circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zinnerman is a rational man. He wouldn\u2019t cause trouble unnecessarily.\" Audrey replied. She noticed that Cardeas seem annoyed at her attempt to get him to reconsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you consider your protection unnecessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was beginning to get annoyed at Cardeas' attempt at dodging her questions. She hadn't gained weight just to be dismissed. Banagher noticed that her hands were trembling slightly. Unable to understand what they were saying, all Banagher could do was stare at them as they talked. Just as he thought, he was out of his league. But he was determined to stay with Audrey until this was over. And after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" She began. \"Why are you doing this? I've heard that Laplace's Box has guaranteed the prosperity of the Vist Foundation for decades. Why give it to us now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Cardeas avoided her questions. He faced Banagher. \"Excuse me. You\u2019ve been asked to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are people after her.\" Banagher wasn't going to leave Audrey, no matter who asked him to. \"I won\u2019t leave her alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have the slightest idea who they are or what they want with her for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Banagher immediately answered. \"I don't, but I know that I should to be with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel that he should still be here, 'Audrey'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Audrey was furious at Cardeas for dismissing her after coming all this way, her anger was immediately replaced by fear and anxiety. She had no idea what to say. Audrey didn't want to put Banagher at risk but she also needed to be with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I-I-I, he doesn't have to be h-here if h-he doesn't want to. Y-You can go home if you want, B-B-Banagher. I'll c-catch up with you.\" Audrey stammered. \"T-Thanks for everything B-Banagher. It-It was really c-cool. And I'm going to s-shut up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Banagher would've given a friendly laugh and Audrey would've too, but the brunette knew that Audrey needed to hear what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, I can still help. You came here to prevent a war, didn\u2019t you? And doesn\u2019t he have the power to do something about that? Hearing you talk about the war is so different from hearing my professors talk about it. More grave. You've made me see how bad it would be. So please, let me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... My heart was pounding when I saw you fall from the sky this morning. Everything that felt off in my life just slid into place. For the first time in my life I knew what I was suppose to do. I don\u2019t care who you are! Just say that you need me and I'll... Just tell me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey took a deep breath. She had her answer. Banagher's words made her realize that no matter where they are going, they were going together.</span></div></div>",

He knew that Audrey understood the situation and he trusted her to make the right choice but he still wanted to sate his thoughts. \"We went through a lot to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned her gaze to Cardeas, her face looking very serious. \"I urge you to rethink the consequences of what you're about to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concern about this\" Cardeas responded. \"You\u2019re not wrong. I\u2019m aware that Full Frontal is being called the second coming of Char and not to be taken lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you--?!\" Audrey was then cut off by Cardeas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it\u2019s not that simple.\" Cardeas stated. \"Even if given the key, it will still take someone qualified to open Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laplace's Box?\" Banagher thought. It felt familiar to him but he didn't know anything about it. In fact, he didn't know anything about what Audrey said could cause a war. While he knew that she was correct, he still would like to know what is going on. Banagher decided to ask Audrey exactly what the situation is after she was done talking with Cardeas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key to the Box?\" Audrey asked, almost as confused as Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have taken steps to create something that will ensure that this is no easy horse to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I doubt things will go as you say, it seems our business here is done for now.\" Audrey faced Banagher again. \"Banagher, let's leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" Banagher said as they began walking out of the room. Neither of them had any idea where they were even going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can arrange transport for you both to Banagher's class.\" Cardeas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would appreciate that. Thank you.\" Audrey said as she and Banagher continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey were both silent as they walked out of the mansion. Banagher had trouble deciding to what to say. He had never seen Audrey this mad before. Even during their confrontation with Marida, the blonde wasn't like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sat down on a bench near the mansion's gates. She gave a sigh before looking at Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to you had to see me like that, Banagher.\" The blonde apologized. \"I didn't mean to get so upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize.\" Banagher said as he sat next to her. \"I'm a little angry myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm not sure if I made the right choice.\" Audrey said. \"Do you think I did?\" This was the first time Audrey had ever asked someone if she did the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did.\" Banagher assured. \"There wasn't anything we could do there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Audrey said. \"Thanks, Banagher. I needed to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this whole time that you would make the right choices\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't help by smile at this. A blush quickly appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Banagher nervously scratched the back of his head, trying to word his question in a way that wouldn't seem awkward. \"What's Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a powerful relic.\" Audrey answered. \"I don't know what exactly it is. Only that it has the power to destroy the Earth Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a a small pause as Banagher contemplated what Audrey told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does-Does anyone know what it is?\" Banagher knew he was getting involved in something dangerous but having it confirmed made his heart beat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a select few in the Vist Foundation and the Earth Federation.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that key that guy mentioned?\" Banagher had a feeling that it was more then just some simple key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Audrey said. \"This is the first time I've ever heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Banagher and Audrey could continue their conversation, they heard a car pull up to the mansion's gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time to leave.\" Banagher remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens got up and walked towards the limo parked near the gates. Banagher stopped and looked back the Vist foundation mansion. Audrey noticed this and walked back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" She asked. Banagher had been acting a little odd since they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. I'm fine. Let's go.\" The brunette stated as he walked towards the limo with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached their destination nighttime had arrived. Banagher's class was currently staying at a hotel. The limo left almost as soon as the brunette and blonde stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could've at least waited until we checked in with your class.\" Audrey thought out loud. \"Yes I'm aware of the irony of asking for politeness after belching so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda charming.\" Banagher said. \"Uh, that could've been worded better. Heh heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should burp a little more then!\" Audrey joked. They both burst out into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how you feel about being in the same class?\" Banagher asked as he and Audrey walked into the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm feeling a little nervous.\" Audrey admitted. \"More then a little nervous, actually. I know the driver said that your teacher has been told that I'm a new transfer student but do you think this will work? I don't even have a uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been through harder stuff.\" Banagher said. Pushing Marida's incredibly obese body certainly was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Audrey said. \"But what about your classmates? I don't think I'll fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Banagher said. \"We're friends and the first thing you did when we met was tackle me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I apologized for that.\" Audrey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't?! Please forgive me, Banagher! I-I owe you an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher let out a small laugh, which confused the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did! I'm just messing with you. Sorry.\" Banagher had a small grin on his face, though his apology was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sighed before laughing herself. \"Alright, you got me.\" Even she couldn't help but enjoy Banagher's little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two close friends continued to chat as they headed to the top of the hotel. Which they had been told was were most of his class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, Banagher noticed that the only one missing was his teacher, Mr. Bancroft. He wasn't surprised. After all, the class was already under the hotel staff's supervision and he did need to take breaks from looking after his students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see Micott and Takuya?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Their right over there.\" Banagher said as he directed Audrey's attention to the table where they were sitting. \"Ready to meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you don't tell them about how much I've been eating and burping.\" Audrey joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're secret's safe with me!\"</span></div></div>",

She recognized her as the girl she saw Banagher with when she and Takuya accidentally spied on them, though her stomach was much smaller now. While she was glad to see that Banagher was okay, she was worried about his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name's Audrey. We just met today.\" Banagher answered as he and Audrey took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also just transferred to your class.\" Audrey said.

Why did you trust her so easily? She's probably one of those people that think the Federation is evil or whatever.\" Micott said, puffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot, idiot.\" Haro muttered in Banagher's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Micott. Just be glad that Icarus is safe.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icarus?\" Banagher and Audrey uttered, blinking in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya turned his laptop's screen towards the two, revealing that it had the front page of the \"Daily 7\", a news site that Anaheim Electronics run. Banagher and Audrey saw the photo of the Torohachi in the lawn and the headline \"The Icarus that challenged the Artificial sun sadly fell onto the park\", and immediately turned off the webpage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher groaned in both annoyance and embarrassment. Audrey wasn't familiar with normal lives but even she could tell that anyone in Banagher's situation would cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Icarus is a Greek deity, r-right?\" Audrey attempted to comfort Banagher. \"Granted, he's most famous for falling due to his hubris but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you two do after crashing?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey told me she had to meet with Cardeas Vist to prevent the war.\" Banagher explained, both to inform his friends on what happened and to get away from the Icarus subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the chairman of our school, right?\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He lives inside the Snail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would someone as big as him live in a place like this?\" Micott asked, finding the idea hard to believe. \"The chairman\u2019s just a title to him. He never even appeared in the graduation ceremonies before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I actually heard about him having a house over there.\" Takuya interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Audrey said. \"We got to talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it go?\" Micott asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey exchanged a brief glance before sinking in their chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, uh, didn't really do much there.\" Banagher stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did learn a little more about the situation.\" Audrey noted. \"But, uh, that's pretty much it.\" The blonde didn't wan to bring up the belly rub Banagher gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the bed was comfy. And we saw a nice painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott groaned. \"Let's talk about this tomorrow. I'm going to get a snack, you guys want anything?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours earlier, before Banagher and Audrey had their nap, Marida finally reached the Garencieres after a while of waddling. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the ship, carrying around such a large, stuffed belly was exhausting and the tummyache she had wasn't helping. After such a long and tiring day, Marida just wanted to relax in the Kshatriya, rub her aching belly as it digests her massive meal, and belch out some of the gas in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reporting to Zinnerman, Marida went to her room on the Garencieres to put on her normal suit. Before she put it on, the redhead held it in front of her, reflecting on how she had gotten so fat that her normal suit had to resized. She sighed, this was embarrassing. She was relived to see that it still fit her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida then left the ship to enter the Kshatriya. Whilst Zinnerman (along with a few others as back up) went to negotiate with Cardeas, the fat redhead was to wait in there, ready to sortie in case a fight occurred. Being in zero gravity felt so relieving to Marida, she felt much better now that her big belly didn't weigh her down. When she was in zero gravity was the only time when Marida would feel like her old self, before she had gained so much weight. While she still had a big gut, large boobs, a fat ass, and a chubby face among other things, she could move like she used to, she didn't have to worry about her weight slowing her down. And it felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily maneuvered her way into the Kshatriya's cockpit. While Marida wasn't fat enough that she got stuck, she wondered if she would ever gain enough weight that she would. Her pilot's chair had already been resized to accommodate her massive girth. Piloting a mobile suit was something Marida's weight never got in the way of, which she took solace in. On the battlefield of mobile suits, a pilot isn't skinny or obese, a pilot is lucky or unlucky. While she didn't want to fight, the battlefield was a place where she could be herself. There she wasn't Marida, the gluttonous fatass, she was Marida, the soldier of Zeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida rubbed her bloated belly as she belted out powerful belches. She looked over her body, it was embarrassing how fat she had gotten. She remembered the first time her belly had broken one of her belts. At this point, she had lost track of many belts her fat gut had broken. As soon as this mission was over she was going to start working out. Marida unleashed a massive burp. It was weird burping inside of her helmet. The obese redhead thought about how her attempt to retrieve Mineva had gone. She hated how her weight had affected her performance but she wondered if she truly would've won had she still been slim. The boy who was with Mineva had proven to be a surprisingly capable opponent. He was able to fend off two grown men and Marida herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead released another loud burp, easing the pressure in her big tummy. As she continued to burp, Marida wondered what the relationship between Mineva and the boy was. They seemed to be friends and trusted each other immensely. Somehow, despite being her opponent today, Marida trusted the boy to protect Mineva. She hoped that they were both okay, while they should both be at the mansion, where both Zinnerman and Cardeas would see to their safety, what if they weren't? If they were somewhere else, then Marida would immediately head out to look for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt herself begin to drift off into sleep. She wasn't surprised, eating so much food would make anyone sleepy. She continued to tend to her aching belly as it became harder and harder to keep her eyes open. Marida closed her eyes, she could use a nap after today. Marida unleashed a massive belch. There was only one thing on her mind as she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, keep Mineva safe.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the present time, Marida had just woken up. She stretched and gave a big yawn. The fat pilot looked down at her large stomach and ran a hand over it. Her gigantic meal had been digested, adding even more pounds to her already massive body. She would have to weigh herself after the mission. At least her stomach didn't hurt anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Marida just had wait for her orders. While she was a very patient woman, she would often enjoy a snack while she waited. It was actually part of the reason she had gotten so fat. She was going to be sitting around for a while anyways, so why not eat a burger or two? Marida actually felt a little peckish. While she wasn't so hungry that she wanted to devour a massive feast like earlier, she could use a little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that a small box was floating around her cockpit. Odd, she hadn't asked for anything. Upon closer exception, she noticed that there appeared to be a letter attached to the front of it and a large bottle of water on the side of it with, a few cans of soda next to it. She plucked it out of the air and read the letter's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push yourself too hard.<br>\r\nZinnerman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd please stop calling me master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was far from the first time Zinnerman had told Marida to not call him master. A smile graced Marida's face, she was truly lucky to know Zinnerman. She opened the box to discover that it contained some hamburgers, just what she needed. The redhead happily began chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit into her meal, however, Marida felt an odd sensation. She stopped eating, something felt wrong to her, like something bad was about to happen. She wasn't sure what was the cause of it but it made her feel uneasy. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat. She remained alert and returned to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Audrey and Banagher were happily chatting with Takuya and Micott. Audrey was reading a mobile suit magazine that Takuya usually read. It felt kinda weird to her to realize that despite her attempts to prevent war, she knew very little about the machines used in war. Before today, the only things the blonde princess knew about mobile suits is that they were incredibly large, humanoid machines used to wage war and that there's a special type of mobile suit called a Gundam that was a symbol of hope for the Federation. She didn't even know what a \"Jegan\" was before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything you like?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think I like the ReZEL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's got a pretty nice design, which isn't too surprising, given that it's based off the Zeta Gundam.\" Takuya stated. \"What's your favorite mobile suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually only recently got interested in this stuff.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever need someone to give you an introduction, you've got me.\" Takuya boasted with a confident grin. \"I bet I could tell you all about nearly every mobile suit there is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you for the offer.\" Audrey was actually caught a little off guard by Takuya's enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she's as much of a geek as you are, Takuya.\" Micott teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of mobile suits, I actually saw a new one this morning.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this caught Takuya's interest, as well as Micott's and Audrey's to a lesser extant. \"No way! Where did you see it?\" Takuya enthusiastically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at the museum, right after we saw the Zaku.\" The brunette clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it look like?\" Micott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get a good look at it but it was white and it had a horn.\" Somehow when Banagher saw it, the painting at the mansion flashed through his mind. As did images of his mother playing the piano and a man whose face he couldn't see.\"It's like it was a Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, was that the \"unicorn\" you spaced out over?\" Micott said in an annoyed tone. The face she was making wasn't too different from the one she made when Banagher stopped listening to her in the middle of a conversation this morning. The only way this could've seemed even more stupid to her would be if Banagher tried to convince he saw an actual Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry about that.\" Banagher said with a nervous smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's a Gundam?\" Audrey asked. Ironically, despite being the princess of Zeon, Audrey was fascinated by Gundams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. It didn't have the V Fin but who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a V Fin?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Audrey, you've got a lot to learn.\" Takuya said in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida felt a chill overcome her massive body. She felt the cry of her fellow soldier, Savior. It\u2019s the cry someone makes before their life is extinguished. She shifted uncomfortably in her chair, griping the controls harder. Marida grunted as she felt the hanger shake, she heard a distant explosion. She trembled as that horrifying chill passes through her body. \"Don\u2019t get swallowed by this,\" Marida told herself. \"I can't let myself get distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida, what the hell was that?\" Gilboa said from the Garencieres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gilboa, have you heard from the Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost the connection. The Minovsky particles are getting denser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we engage inside the colony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemy has surrounded the colony. Our only option is to cut straight through, find the Captain, and get the hell out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that.\" Marida didn't want to fight in a civilian area, but she had to save Zinnerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she headed out, Marida figured she should probably finish eating first. She wolfed down the rest of her burger and then chugged the rest of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida Cruz, Kshatriya, heading out! UUURRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Marida felt a sharp killing intent. \"The enemy's here.\" The Kshatriya then launches it's Funnels, the 2m-long attack drones then exited the port and aimed in multiple directions at an unaware Jegan that was guarding the entrance as he and his companions prepared to enter. The funnels then each simultaneity fired a shot into the Jegan's cockpit, killing the pilot and destroying the mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Funnels returned to her, Marida launched the Kshatriya and then used the Funnels to blow a hole in the gateway leading into the colony. While she was very capable soldier, the redhead couldn't fight that many at once with them all surrounding her and she was well aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hotel, Audrey, Banagher, Micott, and Takuya were still causally chatting, completely unaware of the fighting going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, we're going to a party on Saturday, you wanna join us, Audrey?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...\" Audrey had never been asked to go to a party, or anything social before she met Banagher. \"I appreciate the offer but I've never been to one before, I'm not sure if I would fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Audrey.\" Banagher said. Inwardly, he thought about how ironic it was for him to say that, given how miserable his time at a school party was the last time Micott and Takuya dragged him to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just stick with us and you'll be fine.\" Micott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're going there anyways, I suppose I should tag along.\" Audrey stated. \"Thanks, everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. So other then mobile suits, what are you into?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey placed a finger to her head and closed her eyes, seemingly lost in thought. Banagher was curious himself to see what she\u2019d say, since he\u2019d only known her for a short time, himself. A few moments later, the blonde opened her eyes and gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose the entertainment around here has fascinated me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher happily said. He couldn't wait to show Audrey some video games. \"Are you feeling up to a look at some of the stuff at my place later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked at him, surprised at first, before she let out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sounds like fun, thank you Banagher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Banagher's classmates that were walking not far from them noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tom, what do you think that is?\" One of Banagher's classmates asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back there, what's that?\" Micott said. She spotted what appeared to be a light in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others turned their attention to what Micott was referring to, as did the rest of the class. Audrey recognized the sight, it was the thrusters of a distant mobile suit, Marida's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marida had the Kshatriya uses the thrusters on it's binders to dodge the beams coming at her, causing her gut to jiggle and bounce with every movement. three of the Kshatriya's Funnels then fired at a Jegan from multiple directions, one shot pierced it's right leg, another struck an area next to the cockpit, and one priced the cockpit, killing the pilot. Unfortunately, without the pilot to keep the mobile suit flying, it fell down towards the town and soon hit the side of a highway, it exploded as soon as it made contact. The debris rained down on the unsuspecting civilians, injuring and killing some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida angrily gripped the Kshatriya's controls harder, her anger at what had happened clear on her pudgy face. She knew that civilian casualties were inevitable in war but she hated it so much when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting raged on. A ReZEL Commander Type was forced by Marida to crash on to the roof of Banagher's school. The pilot was protected by the safety airbags and saved from a concussion, and in his groggy vision, glared at the enemy suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned Zeon monster!\" The pilot resumed firing at Marida, determined to still aid his allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida grunted, her stomach hurt. Piloting a mobile suit wasn't good for a full stomach. While she wasn't stuffed, there was still a lot of food in her sloshing belly. Still, she remained focus on combat. As she dodged the shots the downed ReZEL fired at her, Marida felt a chill from not just the the enemy pilot's intent to kill but also his hatred, causing goosebumps to appear over her massive body. Marida kept her eyes on her opponents as she released the Kshatriya's Funnels, she noticed that one of them was missing, there should be three of them, she only saw two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senses and radar alerted her that the third enemy was behind her and was nearly in range to strike her with his beam saber. The other ReZEL still in the air fired his Beam Gun at the Kshatriya which dodged the shots. A ReZEL then swung it's beam saber over it, the Kshatriya countered the attack with it's own beam saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off my \u2013UUURRRP- back!\" Marida burped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese pilot then had the Kshatriya slash off the ReZEL's right arm. The ReZEL fired it's Vulcan Guns at the Kshatriya, which then broke the blue mobile suit's visor with one of the Sub-Arms hidden in the binders. The Sub-Arm then tore the beam saber from the severed arm and gave it to the Kshatriya's left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So \u2013UURRAAP- heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya was now wielding two beam sabers. A ReZEL then fired at the Kshatriya with it's Beam Rifle, the green mobile suit dodging each shot and closing in, it's chubby pilot intending on destroying the ReZEL with it's Beam Sabers. The Federation pilot then switched his rifle to emit a beam saber, which he used to clash with the Kshatriya's. Marida made the Kshatriya impale the ReZEL from above, killing the pilot. She left the weapon in the mobile suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had to deal with the mobile suit on the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll shut you down! UURRP!\" Marida sent three Funnels at the downed ReZEL that was still firing at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swept down to the Federation mobile suit and open fire. One shot hits the cockpit in the center abdomen, one shot hits the mechanical arm with the beam rifle, the ReZEL is down. However, the last hit pierces through the thruster pack from the side, hitting the small reactor core hidden inside. A nuclear explosion occurs, lighting the night sky of Industrial 7 like a miniature sun. Marida leaves the area, ashamed that she was so careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and his class saw the fighting and the damage it caused. The fear was obvious in their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are holes in the colony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, isn't that around where the school is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is war.\" Takuya ominously stated. His friends turned their heads towards him. \"This is the beginning of a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A war...\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, I need to go back to the mansion.\" Audrey suddenly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cardeas said that he has the key to Laplace's Box. I need to know what has happened to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's dangerous, Banagher but whatever Laplace's Box is I have to make sure it never falls into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher shook his head in frustration. \"Let's make sure everyone gets somewhere safe first, okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class made their way to the doors that led from the Snail to the colony. However, the doors were shut and there was no response to their pleas to open the doors. Banagher walked over to the access point on their side that was away from the rest to the class and attempted to open the doors with it, Audrey, Takuya, who was holding Haro, and Micott, with him. Banagher pressed the button for access, but the passage point seemed to be locked, and there didn't seem to be any reaction from the number lock. The brunette hit the machine in frustration. A look of worry was on Takuya's face, as well as Micott's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, open the doors!\" Takuya shouted, anger clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher somehow sensed that a nearby mobile suit was about a fire, a chill came over him. He looked behind him and saw a stray shot heading towards the doors. The shot hit where the rest of Banagher's class was. The impact shook the area and sent a powerful gust of wind towards them. Banagher grabbed Micott and held her close to him, shielding her from the harsh wind. When the gust was gone Banagher looked at where his class was, he didn't see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya dashed towards a Jegan and slashed it half with it's Beam Saber. The large mobile suit then moved towards the top of where the doors once stood and began to cut a hole through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida!\" Audrey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Banagher,\" Takuya began as he stood from the spot he took cover in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher looked at Audrey and then Takuya, he was so glad to see that they were alright. However, he and Audrey then saw the doors begin to grow bright red as heat over took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Micott, you're not hurt, are you? What about the othe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya was cut off as Banagher and Audrey forced him and Micott down. A red beam destroyed the door. It was a shot from the Mega Beam Launcher of a ReZEL Commander Type that was in it's Waverider mode. It quickly passed through the hole took out it's Beam Saber. It then fired two grenades form it's Grenade Launcher. The Kshatriya dodged the shots but was forced to retreat as the ReZEL got closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey, Banagher, and Takuya watched, they were rendered speechless by how close they were to the fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Micott was horrified by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esther, Marco, Dennis, Tom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott was slowly moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micott!\" Banagher grabbed Micott to keep her form going anywhere on her own as it was still too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott began sobbing. Audrey was filled with guilt. She knew that the wars Zeon started killed many innocent people, but this was the first time she had ever seen it and the effect it had on their friends and families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I have to go.\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Audrey couldn't believe what Banagher had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya, Audrey, take care of Micott.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go back to the mansion. There's something very important there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, Banagher!\" Audrey interjected. \"I'm the one who will be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you risk your life for me. Far too many already have.\" Audrey said, sorrow evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, everything will be okay.\" The brunette said, a comforting smile gracing his face. Banagher's words somehow made Audrey feel confident that everything would be okay. She loved his smile so much. For most of her life, Audrey was rarely around people that would treat her like a person instead of a symbol. Banagher's smile was so open about their friendship, whenever she looked at his face, even now, she could tell that he was her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going to happen to me, I'll be back, I promise. Now please, look after Micott for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded. \"I will.\" She didn't want Banagher to leave but she trusted him to return safely. She knew he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Banagher turned his attention to Takuya. \"Takuya, did you recognize that mobile suit that just tore through here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like a Zeta-type transformable suit. I think it's from the Federation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then its mothership should be at the Snail. You have to get there. It can protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher very gently moved Micott into Takuya, who grabbed hold of her. Banagher then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go!\" Micott shouted. The brunette stood up. Takuya attempted to keep her from leaving. \"You can't leave me here. Please don't leave me! Banagher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I being too cold?\" Banagher thought to himself. \"Still, it's better that I go then Audrey. I don't know why but for some reason I want to go back there. I feel like... there's something there I missed. Something very important.\"</span></div></div>",

The ReZEL then closed in and struck it with it's Beam Saber, which clashed with the Kshatriya's own. Marida then had the Kshatriya grab the Federation mobile suit's face and then crashed it into the artificial sun. The Funnels destroyed it before it get up. With no enemies left in the immediate vicinity, Marida left the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher reached a lift that leads to the Snail and the battery for it was still running. As he was about to touch the control panel, the lift that was moving up let out a slight electronic sound and stopped in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it opened, a tall man with sideburns aimed his gun at Banagher, the teen instinctively closed his eyes braced himself for the shot that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shoot the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette opened his eyes and lowered his defenses, he saw a that there was another man, a bearded one wearing a thick trench coat. He could tell just from looking at them that they didn't belong to the Federation or the Vist Foundation, they were very clearly wearing regular clothes. Unbeknownst to Banagher, this was Suberoa Zinnerman and his subordinate, Flaste. As they passed by him, Zinnerman then fired his pistol into the control panel, turning it nonoperational. He let go of the pistol, it was evidently out of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been able to get in touch with Marida?\" Zinnerman man asked Flaste as they left Banagher's vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida. He knew that girl, she was Audrey's friend, the one who attempted to bring her back, and the pilot of the green mobile suit that was destroying the Federation mobile suits. He would have to think about what this meant later, he needed to focus on finding another lift to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marida made her way through the Industrial Block, she soon spotted Audrey, who was carrying Haro along with two civilians she didn't recognize, Takuya and Micott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey somehow felt Marida saw her. She instinctively looked at the Kshatriya, she would recognize that mobile suit anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monoeye on the Kshatriya's head looked at Audrey as well as Micott and Takuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, why's it looking at us?\" Takuya uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marida could make an attempt to retrieve Audrey, a Loto, stepped out of it's hiding spot and fire it's Missile Launcher at Marida's mobile suit. This unit was piloted by Daguza Mackle, the commander of the Earth Federation Forces' ECOAS special forces team. The Kshatriya shielded itself with it's binders and manged to dodge a few shots. The dust from the explosions blinded Marida's vision, it wasn't a good idea to move as full speed while she couldn't see but she had no choice, the Federation unit would surely fire at her gain if she stayed still. Marida had the Kshatriya move upwards at north eastern angle, her vision locked on the Loto. This resulted in her crashing into the upper part of a wall, Daguza immediately fired again, had the Kshatriya not shielded itself in time, those shots would've caused massive damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had her gaze fixated on the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Micott shouted, snapping Audrey out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we've gotta get outta here!\" Takuya added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza exited the Loto and prepared to fire an anti-mobile suit bazooka at the Kshatriya. He already had the unit in his sights when it removed itself from the wall but he needed to ait for it to get closer before he could fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin in seconds, the Kshatriya launched it's Funnels and was now in range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaguza fired and the Kshatriya shielded itself, Marida expected it to be a regular missile but it wasn't. It detonated before it could make contact and disabled the Kshatriya's cameras. What was once was a clear image of Marida's surroundings was replaced by a blinding light. The tubby pilot grunted as she closed her eyes as the light was hurting them. Daguza immediately jumped off the Loto, and Marida's Funnels soon wildly fired, a beam pierced through the front of the Loto, evaporating the control zone and cutting through to the back. The Loto exploded and blew apart the armor on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal...\" Takuya uttered in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teens then noticed that the flaming debris of the Loto are heading towards them. They braced for the impact, Takuya held onto Micott tightly, whilst Audrey held Haro even closer, her eyes closed. Fortunately, a ReZEL knocked the debris away from them with it's shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're saved.\" Takuya uttered as he and Micott looked up at the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey heard those words, she opened her eyes and looked at their savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the second time I almost died today.\" Audrey thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Federation mobile suit. It's an RGZ-95. A ReZEL, Micott!\" Takuya continued. \"Hey, we're students at the Industrial College. They blew holes in the colony, so we escaped. Can you help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ReZEL's piloted exited the mobile suit's cockpit and turned off his helmet's visor. His name was Riddhe Marcenas. Audrey noticed that he seemed to have a pendent wrapped his wrist but he was too far away for her to see what it looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher continued his search for a lift that lead to the snail, he came across a room unlike any he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room was a white mobile suit being held in place by a box-shaped container cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it. Pure white armor, translucent visor at roughly where the eyes are, and protruding long horn on the forehead. This was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mobile suit he saw this morning at the museum. The cockpit at the abdomen was opened, as well as the cockpit's door. He floated up to the cockpit and stood at the edge of it, there was man in the cockpit whose back was facing him. Cardeas Vist. He noticed that Banagher was behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gael? You made it.\" Cardeas said as he turned around to discover that Gael wasn't there, Banagher was. \"It's you. Why are you here?\" His voice is different from the voice Banagher heard in the villa, and it seem that he\u2019s a changed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the key. Audrey said that it can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.\" Banagher explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Banagher a second to processes what he was told. \"This is the key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It will lead it's chosen rider to Laplace's Box. This is the Unicorn Gundam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were planning on escaping in it, weren't you?!\" Banagher accused, his voice filled with rage and frustration at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I did, I wouldn't survive.\" The head of the Vist Foundation stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher slammed his fist against the side of the cockpit in frustration. \"What the hell's wrong with you?!\" He shouted, even he was surprised that he was letting out all his anger and frustrations. \"You act like you're so superior, but you can't do anything! Audrey came to you trying to stop this war from breaking out, and you had the power to do that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion occurred near the room and flames began to enter it but the two ignored it. Right now, they had to talk and nothing was going to prevent that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those people... they had plans for tomorrow... for next week... they had a future! They weren't supposed to die like this! I lost my mother, but it was different. This isn't the way people are supposed to die. It's wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People should be treated with dignity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas words resonated with Banagher. He looked as the man before slowly stood up, clutching a wound on his chest. \"We're supposed to respect one another's lives. But once we grow out of childhood, though we know better, we still cause meaningless bloodshed. We've done it to the Earth as well. We devoured the resources then sought out new frontiers to exploit in space. Humanity grew out of control and must endeavor to regain its dignity. We must revive the hope that was born one hundred years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through the potential that lies within, we will demonstrate the true power and compassion of humanity.\" Banagher didn't know why but somehow everything that was being said felt familiar to him. Even the words he just said felt like he had said them long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you still remember.\" Cardeas stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To transcend what is immediate and realize our god-like potential, the greatness within us that is, possible.\" Cardeas stuck his and out as he spoke and Banagher slowly grabbed it. You've come this far, but are you confident that your conviction will not waver? The weight of the burden she has to bear is immense. You'll need the resolve to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders if you go with her. Do you have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pondered his answer for a moment. \"I don't have confidence or resolve. All I know is that I need her to need me. I have to be with her. I have to help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas' clips curled up, and a smiling face was right in front of Banagher. It wasn't a wry smile nor a mocking smile, but a satisfied smile that was mixed with pride and some sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this.\"</span></div></div>",

The monitor's light flashes, and the words access authorized is shown on the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher then sat in the chair and put his hands on the control sticks on both left and right side. A flashing light appeared and scanned Banagher and the data it collected on the monitor appeared. A silhouette of Banagher's body was there, the words \"Biometric Scan\" were to the right of it and \"Now Registering\" were to the left of it. The latter words soon changed to \"Complete\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've programmed it to respond to you and you alone.\" Cardeas explained. \"If you can prove yourself to be a suitable pilot, and I know you will, the Unicorn will grant you powers unrivaled And then show you the path to Laplace's Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is Laplace's Box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dark curse that has sentenced the Vist family to serve as its guardian for a hundred years. But if used properly, it can bring light to this Universal Century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna... your mother didn't want to see you fall victim to this curse, so she took you from me.\" Before now, Cardeas' words would've been nonsense to Banagher but somehow, everything felt like it make sense to him. it did make sense to him. \"She must hate me... as I'm sure you do as well. But now you must go. Fear not, If you trust in the possibility that lies within and try with all your might, the path will show itself to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardeas warmly placed a bloody hand on Banagher's cheek. Something he hadn't done in so long. Banagher placed his over Cardeas', it felt so familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's selfish. You can't say all that to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me.\" Cardeas said as he began to float away. His hand left Banagher's cheek, leaving a bloody hand print. \"I wanted more...so much...\" Banagher grabbed Cardeas' hand hoping to stay with him but he soon lost hold of him as Cardeas left the cockpit. A smile then appeared on Cardeas' face as he looked at Banagher. \"Banagher... My wish has finally come true, Anna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cockpit closed as the flames consumed Cardeas. Banagher fell back in the chair and placed a hand over his right eye. \"Father? Did I... Was he... My...\" An old memory resurfaced in Banagher's mind, an old memory of him leaving the mansion with is mother when he was little. The view of the surroundings the cockpit gave him vanished. Tears left Banagher's eyes as the truth set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, an image he knew every well appeared on the cockpit's screens, The Lady And The Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'To my only desire.' The beast of possibility... The symbol of hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father showed that picture and was the one who taught him the meaning behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father... Mother... Please forgive me, but I... I must go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher grabbed the controls, he was ready. The Unicorn's eyes light up, giving a human feel to it. The restraints in the container left the mobile suit and the Unicorn began to step forward amidst the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven far away in palm of a ReZEL, Audrey could still feel Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida could feel Audrey as she made her way to the colony's exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot noticed that something that emerging from the flames nearby. It was a mobile suit, the Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did the machine come from?\" Marida thought. There was something about it that set her on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida released her Funnels and fired them at it, the Unicorn dodged the beams and charged at her. The Kshatriya took out it's Beam Saber but the Unicorn pushed against mobile suit and crushed the hand that held the Beam Saber, crushing the Beam Saber as well. With the strength of the Unicorn, Banagher knew that he could defeat the enemy in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... Get the hell outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe increased the Unicorn's thrusters to their maximum strength. The force was enough to active the Kshatriya's airbag, there was barely enough room in Marida's chair for both the airbags and her massive belly. It didn't take long for them to near the wall at the end of the tunnel. The Funnels fired a hold through it which the Unicorn forced the Kshatriya through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airbags in the Kshatriya's cockpit deflated back into their inactive form, allowing Marida to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida emitted a huge burp, the pressure from the airbags hitting her forced out the gas in her big belly. With the air pressure on the machine gone, Marida controlled the thrusters like she\u2019s launching and leaves the white mobile suit. Both mobile suits turned around so that they face each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's open!\" Marida released all twenty four of the Kshatriya's funnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher pained at the sight, he didn't what to do. Suddenly, the display console immediately flashed the words NT-D, and the fixate equipped on the chair rest moved on its own as it clamps onto Banagher\u2019s head on both left and right side. Everything then began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Funnels simultaneously fired at the white mobile suit but the Unicorn was protected by it's I-Field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parts forming the shoulders of the Unicorn broke open from the gaps in the armor, and the sliding armor revealed a frame that\u2019s giving off red light. The same phenomenon happens with the legs, knees and thigh. The front armor of the waist and the torso open up as well, causing the Unicorn to look bigger. The red luminescent glow is becoming stronger, causing the bright patterns decorating the white mobile suit to become clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wrists slid, and two beam saber handles appeared at the back of it, hanging on the shoulders like a decoration. The one change that\u2019s most obvious however is the head. The part like a mask opened, and the visor on the complex eye slid off, causing the Unicorn\u2019s face to look completely different. The one horn that\u2019s represent the unit splits in half and shows a V-shape, showing the main camera. The two cameras that are positioned like human eyes glowed, and the unit had a golden V-shaped horn on its forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn readied it's beam saber, Banagher was ready to defeat his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn board the Nahel Argama with Micott and Takuya, Audrey looked at the sight as she held Haro in her hands. She had seen this sight before, the mobile suit she saw was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Unicorn Gundam dashed towards the Kshatriya, destroying two Funnels along the way with a single slash of it's Beam Saber as if they were no threat at all. With the gap between the two suits quickly closing, Marida activated the Kshatriya's thrusters to get away, as the mobile suit wasn't designed for close combat and she wouldn't be able to use her Funnels on such a fast opponent before they managed to to strike her. But in spite of the the Kshatriya's increased speed, the Unicorn reached in a small matter of seconds. It slashed it's Beam Saber at the green mobile suit but the Kshatriya shield itself with it's Binders, resulting in three fourths of it's front left Binder being sliced off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida grunted form the impact, her gut jiggling. She put more distance between herself and her enemy using her mobile suit's thrusters but the white mobile suit quickly followed after her and would soon reach it. She fired her Funnels at it an attempt to slow it down and damage it but like before, the Unicorn kept at the same speed and manged to dodge all of the Funnels shots. It destroyed two more Funnels as it got ever closing, not slowing down in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarida turned the Kshatriya towards the Unicorn, realizing that she would to prepare to meet it in melee combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing is built with Psycho-Frame throughout the whole body?\" Marida noted as she watched the Unicorn dodge more shots from her Funnels and destroy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Unicorn Gundam destroyed another Funnel as it dashed towards the Kshatriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam...\" Marida said aloud to herself, rage building within her. \"Gun \u2013UURRP- dam... UUURRAP! Gundam is... \u2013UUUURRRP- the enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kshatriya ignited it's Beam Saber and charged towards the Unicorn Gundam. Their sabers clashed with each other and the suits rotated in sync with each other as they did so. They soon moved away and then charged at each other again. They pulled away from each other yet again but charged much sooner this time. Banagher striked before the Kshatriya was able to and cut off even more of it's front left Binder, and destroying the thrusters the Binder had and forcing the Kshatriya to retreat a good distance from him, using it's remaining thrusters. The uneven amount of force caused it to flip 360 degrees vertically, resulting in Marida's entire body jiggling around all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a ferocious belch, Marida charged at her enemy before she felt Zinnerman calling for her. She immediately calmed down, stopped her charge and looked towards where her captain was. She saw a Geera Zulu and focused on the image in her cockpit. She saw that he was in the the palm of the mobile suit's hand, along with Flaste, and was making a movement with hand that singled for her to return to the Garencieres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese pilot realized almost too late that she had let her guard down and the Unicorn was about to land a strike on the Kshatriya's chest. She activated it's I-Field just in time to prevent any damage and began her retreat. She fired all twelve of her mobile suit's Mega Particle Cannons at the Unicorn. Banagher maneuvered the Unicorn Gundam in between every shot. With her mission of securing the Garencieres' escape complete, Marida quickly left the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Neo-Zeon's retreat, Industrial 7, Banagher's and his friends' home, was safe. The adrenaline left Banagher and he felt his exhaustion catch up with him. he struggled to keep his eyes open, he still had to make his friends were safe, but his entire body felt so heavy. Not even when he fought Marida in-person had he felt this exhausted. In spite of his best efforts, Banagher Links, now the chosen pilot of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam, fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Unicorn Gundam was retrieved by a ReZEL sent by the Nahel Argama, the ship Banagher's friends were now on. Since Banagher was now asleep, he was naturally unable to respond the ReZEL's pilot's messages. Correctly deducing that the pilot was unconscious, the Argama's mechanical crew began to hack into the mobile suit itself to open the cockpit. However, the Unicorn had a very strong defense system against hacking, making progress very slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere on the ship, Audrey, along with Micott, Takuya, and Haro, were currently in one of the lounge rooms. They had just been escorted there by Mihiro Oiwakken, a communications officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait here for now.\" Mihiro said, standing just outside of the door frame. \" Let me know if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you received any word about who was piloting that Gundam?\" Audrey asked as she walked up to the officer. The blonde couldn't explain why but she couldn't shake the feeling that Banagher was the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, from what I've been told, the hatch hasn't even been opened yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was disappointed to hear that. Of course she didn't want Banagher to risk his life but at least being the pilot of the horned Gundam would mean that he was accounted for. She would never forgive herself if he got hurt doing something for her. She hoped, more then she ever had for anything before, that he was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, are you doing all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA friendly voice inserted itself into the conversation. Audrey and Mihiro looked towards the source of it, a young, blonde Federation officer walking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm the ReZEL pilot that pulled you guys out. My name's Riddhe Marcenas.\" He said as he finished walking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Audrey Burne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go take a look?\" Riddhe offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the Gundam.\" He clarified. \"You are curious, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensign Riddhe...\" Mihiro uttered. While it wasn't exactly against regulations to show civilians mobile suits in the hanger, it still wasn't something the captain would likely approve of. Not to mention that they should be resting after the hell they had to endure today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, Ensign Mihiro.\" Riddhe assured her. \"I know a secret spot where we can steal a peek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna go!\" Takuya suddenly said with a big grin as he ran right next to Audrey, much to her shock. \"This Nahel Argama was the mothership of the Gundam Team in the first Neo Zeon War, and now it's carrying this new Gundam! It's just too cool. It's like destiny, or... or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very clear from the look of surprise and confusion on her face that Audrey was caught completely off-guard by Takuya's enthusiasm. After having spent almost her entire life aorund cynical and stoic soldiers, it would take a while for her to get used to someone being so upbeat. It took her a few moments to regain the stoic look she usually had on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah.\" Riddhe said. He wasn't expecting to see such enthusiasm from someone had just barely survived a terrorist attack. It was a good trait to have in times like this, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you coming, Micott?\" Takuya said as he and Audrey looked at their brown-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Micott said in a depressed tone, lounging on the couch as she held Haro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Takuya's face instantly vanished and was replaced with a look of worry. He walked over to comfort his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm coming too.\" Mihiro told Riddhe. \"If that Gundam hadn't shown up when it did, you and I wouldn't be having this discussion now. I for one want to meet the pilot who saved our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro's words only made Audrey even more worried about Banagher, the worry was visible on her face. Feeling a sudden craving for a snack, Audrey walked over to the nearby vending machine and ordered a bag of tortilla chips. She opened up the bag and sighed as she looked at it. She couldn't believe that she was actually eating comfort food. The blonde began eating her snack.</span></div></div>",

And as any observation room should do, it provided them with a perfect view of the Gundam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they're saying.\" Takuya responded. \"It looks so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.\" Riddhe said to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey turned her face away from the others as they turned their eyes towards her. She hadn't been seen since U.C. 0088 so she hoped that no one could recognize e her as Mineva Lao Zabi but it seemed that hope was in vain. She braced herself as much as she could for the words \"You're Mineva Lao Zabi!\" but she never expected what Riddhe would actually say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You look like Natsume Swanson, you know, the famous actress.\" He said in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey blinked twice in surprise, a surprised look on her face, feeling a huge weight leave her shoulders. Though she wished it would leave her gut too. \"I-I don't know much about the entertainment industry.\" In the span of a few seconds her expression had changed from showing her grim acceptance and guilt into showing sheer confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro closed her eyes and frowned, clearly suffering from a bad case of second hand embarrassment. Micott had her eyes halfway closed, she couldn't believe just how bad he was at this. Audrey just returned to her bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ensign!\" Takuya suddenly said, immediately grabbing everyone's attention. \"The cockpit is opening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at the Gundam's cockpit to see it open, just as Takuya had said. As it finished opening, they saw Banagher sitting in the pilot's seat, unconsciousness and with a bloody hand print on his left cheek. It was a sight none of them would ever forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott covered her mouth with her hands, a terrified look in her eyes. The Burnett was completely scared speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher!\" Takuya uttered in shock. \"Why is he...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he be the pilot?\" Riddhe asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey had a completely stoic expression but this was merely a facade. Had it reflected how she really felt she would've looked as horrified as Micott and incredibly guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher! What happened to you?! This is all my fault.\" Thoughts such as this flooded her mind. \"Please be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher was immediately rushed to the med-bay. Thankfully, he wasn't wounded, he merely passed out from the sheer amount of G-forces that were exerted on to him. Of cruse, he would still need plenty of rest but that was all he would need before he was as good as new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Banagher slept in the med-bay's, he dreamed of the life he had with his parents, before his mother took him away to live a normal life, away from the dark curse of the Vist family. His friends waited in the med-bay for him to wake up and fortunately, ti would only a little over half an hour before he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher. Banagher.\" Haro said as Banagher's eyebrows and eyelids began to move, showing that he was regaining consciousness. And sure enough, his eyes did open, much to his friends' relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Doctor!' Takuya said, sporting a relieved smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Argama's doctor, Hasan, got out of his chair to look over his patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher...\" Micott said in a concerned-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are-are you okay?\" Takuya said, sounding equally concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's eyelids were halfway down, he still felt so tired and his body still felt so heavy, the brown-haired young man was barely able to stay conscious. He looked aorund the unfamiliar room to see who else was there with him. He saw Micott, who was holding Haro, Takuya, and Audrey, all looking back at him. As soon as he saw his blonde friend, his eyes opened more, as if her very presence was enough to vanquish his weariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey.\" He uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicott looked at Audrey, surprise that her name was the first thing he said as he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, can you hear me?\" Hasan before he grabbed both of Banagher's wrists. \"If you can hear me, squeeze my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihiro grabbed the communications phone and dialed for the bridge. \"Mihiro to the bridge. The boy is just regaining consciousness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Hasan asked Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little dizzy and really tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any parts of your body you can't feel? Any aching or pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, your condition is as good as I was expecting it to be.\" The doctor said. \"All you need is some rest and you'll feel fine soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on board the Nahel Argama, a Londo Bell ship. You'll be filled in on the details tomorrow, once you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Banagher was finally released from the med-bay. Along with his friends, Banagher was given his own room, since it would take a few days until the Nahel Argama could reach somewhere to drop them off. After putting his regular clothes back on, he decided to go check out his room. He wasn't expecting anything amazing since this was a warship but he was a tad curious and it couldn't hurt to get a head-start on getting used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his room's door he saw Audrey sitting on his couch with Haro and the table across from the bed was nearly overflowing with food. Needless to say, this was far from what Banagher expected to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Audrey.\" Banagher uttered, walking into the room and closing the door behind him, confusion evident in his voice. \"What's with all the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for you.\" The blonde answered. \"After everything you've done for me, I wanted to do something for you, even if it's just something small like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there's anything small about the amount of food you got.\" Banagher said as she sat down next to Audrey. \"Thanks, I really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome but before we begin eating, I want to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" Banagher had a confused look on his face, he honestly had no idea what his blonde friend wanted to apologize for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For having you go back to the mansion.\" Audrey's guilt was clear as day on her chubby face. \"If you didn't go you wouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm really sorr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Audrey, it's not your fault.\" Banagher cut her off, a comforting smile on his face. \"Now, how much food are you going to eat?\" The brunette had a big, goofy grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey let out a laugh, her friend was just being too cute. He certainly knew how to cheer people up. \"Well, given that my belly has gotten a bit bigger from my hot dog binge,\" Audrey gave her pudgy belly a light slap for emphasis, causing it to jiggle. \"I'm sure I'll be able to eat even more then I did last time!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whoo, I couldn't eat \u2013UUUURRRP- another bite.\" Audrey said, rubbing her bloated middle with a content smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me \u2013UUURRRP- neither.\" Banagher said as he rubbed his stuffed belly, sporting a similar smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher were leaning back into the couch and rubbing their stuffed middles after having consumed the entirety of the feast Audrey had prepared for the both of them. Both their pants were unbuttoned and unzipped to make room for their stomachs. Banagher's belt had been undone and Audrey's coat was unbuttoned, Mihiro was kind enough to sow the buttons back on and Audrey was not going to break them again after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said I was going to eat a lot but I didn't think we would \u2013UURRRP- actually eat everything.\" Audrey stated, giving her tummy a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either.\" Banagher said. \"So out of everything we ate, what was your favorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I'd have to say the hot dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you'd say that.\" Banagher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave it away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then let out a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both teens felt gurgles in their bellies, accompanied with sharp pains in their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I don't think my stomach is agreeing with me.\" Banagher groaned, giving his belly a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine isn't either.\" Audrey moaned, rubbing her belly. As much as her stomach hurt she was more concerned about Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey couldn't bear seeing Banagher in pain like this after all her kind friend did to help her.The chubby blonde wished there was a way she could help ease her bloated friend's stomachache when she remembered the soothing belly rubs Banagher gave her when she had a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um, B-Banagher...\" Audrey started, blushing. \"D-Do you want me to r-rub your b-belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens' faces were practically blushing scarlet when Audrey finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, s-sure! That'd be great!\" Banagher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey then moved a little closer to Banagher, who shifted slightly in his spot so that his gut was facing his friend. Audrey then slowly and nervously placed her hands on Banagher's belly. A few seconds of awkward silence filled the room, both teens blushing heavily. While Banagher had already rubbed Audrey's belly, her rubbing his was a completely new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, y-you can s-start whenever you're ready.\" Banagher stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right! Sorry.\" Audrey stammered. \"This is my first time doing something like this. I hope I'm not bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're not. I'd never consider you annoying, you're my friend.\" Banagher said with a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face went even redder. \"I-I-T-Thank you, that really means a lot to me, Banagher.\" The sheltered girl stuttered out, giving a shy, dorky and friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's your reward for being such a great friend, a nice belly rub! As soon as I can work up the courage that is, heh heh!\" Audrey giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much time as you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudre nodded and turned her attention back to her friend's tummy. After a few more seconds of silence from the both of them and the blonde preparing herself, Audrey gulped and began gently rubbing Banagher's belly. Banagher let out a moan of pleasure as Audrey's hands made soothing and rhythmic motions on his belly, all his discomforts fading away as a soothing warmth filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels amazing, Audrey.\" Banagher said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it does, B-Banagher.\" Audrey, a kind smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, Audrey's massage accidentally forced a huge burp out of Banagher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! Sorry about that!\" Banagher said, his blush returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey giggled. \"Don't worry, just do whatever you need to feel better. That's what you told me to do, right? So you should do the same.\" Audrey giggled a bit more, Banagher was just so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second to process that a girl and prim and proper as Audrey, who unbeknownst to him was even a princess, has absolutely no problem with him letting out a huge burp right in front of her, Banagher started giggling with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey continued rubbing Banagher's belly, a belch occasionally flying out of his mouth. It was a new yet enjoyable experience for the both of them. Audrey's massage felt absolutely amazing to Banagher as he let his bloated gut surge out and felt Audrey move her hands in soothing circles on his stuffed belly, easing the pains and aches inside it. The burps and moans of pleasure he would let out were clear signs of how much he was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was enjoying it just as much. After seeing her brown haired friend go through so much, some of which she blamed herself for, she was so happy that she could finally help him feel better. And not to mention, after living such a sheltered life, she loved that she could finally hang out with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes into Audrey's massage, Audrey's bloated belly let out a low grumble and she groaned. It was clear from that and the look on her face that she was indeed feeling unconformable. Being the caring guy that he was, Banagher immediately picked up on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does your stomach hurt?\" He asked in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh -UUURRAP!- Yeah, kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about I give it a good ol' belly rub?\" Banagher said with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone else if your situation said that I would say they should lie down and rest. But you've always got energy to help others, don't you?\" Audrey said with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Banagher enthusiastically said, a big dorky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher placed his hands on Audrey's stuffed belly and began rubbing it, causing her to let out a moan of pleasure as the pain in her tummy faded away and she was filled with the same soothing warmth that Banagher felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Banagher giggled. There was something funny about a girl as polite as Audrey giving a big burp as her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Audrey and Banagher rubbed each other's bellies at the same time. Both would often let out a mighty belch due to the massage. Audrey and Banagher loved rubbing the other's belly and the rubs they received as well. Neither would dare admit it but there was something they really liked about the bloated bellies they were sporting. Perhaps it was because they were a result of them hanging out and having fun.</span></div></div>",

As they rubbed each other's belly, they happily talked o abut a variety of subjects, such as movies, videos games, and TV. Right now, they were currently watching a marathon an anime that covered the White Base's journey during the One Year War, a personal favorite of Banagher's. Though they were only a few minutes into the first episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this covers the White Base's -UUURP- entire service?\" Audrey asked her friend, still rubbing his belly as he rubbed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y -UURP- Yeah. This is one of my favorite shows, I've been a huge fan of it ever since \u2013UURRP- I was a little kid.\" Banagher answered. He always loved geeking out with his blonde friend. \"I've even got a lot of the models. You wanna \u2013UURRAP- see them when this is all over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, Audrey had an important question on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is Dozle \u2013UURRAAP- Zabi in this?\" Audrey felt really weird referring to her father by his full name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah, he shows up in the next episode.\" Banagher answered. \"He's actually really popular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He is?!\" Audrey said, a little louder then she intended. She really didn't expect that her Father would be so popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like him because he looks like a stereotypical villain when he's really a nice guy and a great dad. I'm sure you'll like a lot too. \" Banagher had no clue how awkward this conversation was for Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will.\" Audrey said, giving a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over fifteen minutes later, the episode ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Banagher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really good.\" Audrey answered. \"Who are your favorite characters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I like them all so it's kinda hard to pick but my top three are Amuro, Sayla, and Frau. Do you have any favorites yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher's mention of Sayla stood to to Audrey, as she knew that was the fake name that the daughter of Zeon Zum Deikun took, with her real name being Artesia Som Deikun. From she was taught by the members of Neo-Zeon that looked after her, Sayla was now living a normal life with few (even inside of Neo-Zeon) knowing of her heritage. Audrey hoped that she would one day be able to live like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Amuro and Frau.Though from what you said about him I have a good feeling that I'll like Dozle too.\" Audrey still felt weird referring to her father by his first name. \"And if you like Sayla then I'll probably like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then moved on to the next episode. A little bit into their viewing, Banagher and Audrey both felt their stomachs gurgle, they were about to let out a burp and it was going to be a big one. They both looked at each other and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanagher and Audrey both belted out a massive belch at the same time. They immediately started laughing, their faces blushing bright red. Of course, they were still embarrassed but they were having way too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha ha, I'm getting pretty good at this, huh?\" Audrey asked, covering her mouth in a mock gesture of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Banagher concurred, chuckling. \"Although you have a long way to got if you wanna match up to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, no way! I'm definitely way past you in skill!\" Audrey said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not likely, but okay!\"</span></div></div>",

Eating yourself sick, breaking belts, popping buttons, belching, seeing your stomach swell to an incredible size, gaining weight, getting fat, she couldn't comprehend why anyone would want to do any of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might still be hungry.\" Banagher clarified. \"You could eat as much as you'd want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banagher, I just had five hotdogs and a large soda, I'm full.\" Mineva said.

She couldn't really blame him if that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving her answer, Mineva stomach let out a loud growl.
