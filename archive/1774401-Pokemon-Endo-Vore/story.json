Everyday, you battled with countless trainers, strong and weak, only to win all of them. Today, you decided that you should take a long, deserved break from all the challenges. You are taking a stroll in a quiet forest to enjoy the pristine natural sights around you. You hear the random rustling of leaves in the wind. When you looked toward the ground, the sun casts dappled shadows onto the grassy grounds, creating the illusion of a intricate, moving carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were enjoying yourself when suddenly, a strange feeling appeared upon. You felt dizzy, nauseous and disorientated. The forest around you started to blur, rendering you unable to distinguish the sky from the ground. You feel yourself falling unto the ground, cringing at unknown pains. You blacked out..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you waked up again, you feel a lot better but when you look at your surrounding something is very different. Around you, grasses become as tall as trees, soft winds become hurricanes, a small forest clearing becomes a wide meadow. The sight has you flabbergasted and distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've been shrunk\", you said out loud, \"What in world has happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can further comprehend your situation, the ground below you started to tremble. The shaking got more and more intense; something huge is approaching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tremors finally stopped, you realized that a long shadow casts over you. You couldn't help but look up at the thing that is blocking the sun. Your jaws dropped, the creature is so tall that you couldn't see its face. From the size of the creature, you estimate that you are now the size of an tiny insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough fear has gripped you, you unknowingly started shouting and screaming, attempting to get the attention of whatever the thing is.....To your surprise, it seems to notice you and started to bend its body over to check on the source of the screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it puts it face closer to you, you realized that it's a Pokemon albeit far larger than normal from your perspective. You started to cower in fear, unable to process the image before you. Out of nowhere, a booming voice suddenly emerges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? I've never seen any creature like this before.\",  the voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly looked up and see that the Pokemon is a.....</span></div></div>",

You also realize that Lucario is moving toward you, seemingly thinking that you're some exotic critter of this forest. The towering figure gradually lowered it head toward you, eventually getting on all four (essentially lying) to get a clearer look at you. It's unmistakable, the tall, blue ears, the bright, red eyes, and the protruding, aura organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've encountered Lucarios belonging to various trainers along your journey, but this time it's dozens of time your size. The occurrence has left you speechless and, frankly, frightened. You eventually find yourself surrounded by its huge paws, each with a long spike on it. You look up and find that Lucario's snout just hovers a few feet above you. The Lucario looks at you with its typical blank face. However, its eyes immediately give away the indication that he is curious about you. You see your awe-struck reflection in Lucario's ruby-red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, you look like a human trainer but you are so small.\", Lucario suddenly speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi....hi there. You... must be the Lucario from around this forest.\", you managed to say without realizing that the Pokemon was actually talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really are a human.\", the Pokemon said, \"But...how do you happen to be so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I can't even explain., it all happened so fast and......wait a minute...You can talk?\", you asked Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course I can. Haven't you heard of something called ESP? Extra-sensory perception? Simply put, I'm 'talking' to your mind.\", Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Psychic, right?...\", you said, \"Anyway, Lucario, do you have any idea what causes me to shrink.\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't really heard about the mystery of this forest, do you?\", said Lucario, \"This forest has some mysterious powers capable of random effects on both humans and Pokemons. It has many unknown powers that are beyond comprehension. In your case, you're shrunk but you seem to be normal overall. In an extreme case, I saw a Pokemon literally transformed into completely different stuffs. In your current form, any Pokemon could have easily made a meal of you. But seeing and recognizing that you are a human trainer, I wouldn't do such things, yet. Even if I do eat you, I cannot digest you.\"</span></div></div>",

But I hope you keep your promise about not digesting me.\", you said as you enter Lucario's mouth, catching sight of his glimmering fangs and fleshy tongue. You slowly moved toward the \"cavern\" before you, pondering for a moment before you move down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled relatively smoothly downward through Lucario's gullet and into his esophagus. The rhythmic moving of the walls leaves no doubt that your \"new home\" is in a living creature. Eventually you landed in Lucario's stomach. Upon first sight, you realize that the stomach is completely empty of any liquids, save perhaps the slippery coatings of the stomach wall. The interior of Lucario is dimly lit for some reason but you have no idea of the light source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable in there because you'll be staying for the long term. If you want to, you may explore my body. You can take any of the holes in my stomach to start.\", you heard Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that there are indeed several holes leading to other parts in Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

You remember that ever since you were a kid, you alwaus have the fascination about being eaten by a Pokemon and made to explore their interiors. But that used to exist only in your fantasies. Now, you are in the stomach of your favorite legendary Pokemon, Lucario, thinking about what this rare opportunity means for you despite being shrunk to microscopic size. What has surprised you further is that this Lucario has some very unconventional interior; how is it possible for a stomach to have more than one hole? It's so strange yet a very interesting thing to check out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the Pokemon's heartbeat can be heard all around you like a gentle music, as if it's luring you to explore the unknowns in the giant Lucario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving that continued wondering in the stomach won't get you anywhere, you move across the soft stomach floor to one of the holes. There must be at least two dozens of them all around this huge stomach. There is no way of telling where each of the hole will lead to so it'll be up to you to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick the hole nearest to you and enter it. The passage way is a bit tight but it is just large enough to allow you to walk through. The feeling you experienced can be described as walking in a damp tunnel made of extremely soft silk. The passage twist and turn, going upward then downward as if it is never ending. After what seems like half an hour worth of travel, you finally reached the end of the fleshy tunnel. When you got out of the tunnel, you find yourselve in a wide chamber that is dimly lit. There is apparent light source but you think the walls might be giving off light themselves. When your eyes adjusted to the environment, you realize that there is a glowing blue ball at the center of the chamber. The 'ball' is  fixed in place by a pillar and it is connected with several blood vessel-like tubings. The sight mesmerized you, it's so beautiful.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again, trainer.\", Lucario's voice blared overhead, \"It looks like you've started your little adventure in me. You're now at my \"Aura Maker\", that's the part of me that allows me to use my supernatural powers for both weapons and meditation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move yourself closer to the ball of energy. When you approach it, you can feel the intense energy it gives off; it feels like a strange tingle throughout your body. The glowing ball continously swirls with a faint static sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to touch my energy. I'd like to share it with.\", Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", you asked the Pokemon curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you will be living in me for the forseeable future, why don't we just be personal friend, just between you and me.\", Lucario explained, \"Once you touched my Aura Maker, you will also be granted some of my powers which you could only use in my body. I hope that you can accept it as a symbol of our new, unique, and special friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

You daydream and let your imagination fly for a while, until you realize that Lucario is trying to communicate with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still there, trainer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I just...got distracted\", you said sheepishly. \"I'm going to take the powers now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! You won't regret it, I'll make sure of it! Just touch the sphere and you will have powers in a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly approach to the sphere, and you touch it with your hand. Instantly, you feel energy going through your fingers, and you start to glow with some sort of blueish aura. You are amazed, and when it ends, you're too stunned to even move or remove your hand from the sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, my friend?\" You hear Lucario asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is...awesome. I feel full of energy, thanks for this\". You say cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should explain better what sort of effects my Aura Maker had on you. Now we have a bond that will protect you and let me know exactly where you are, even if you leave my body. You also have a few powers that only have effect while you're inside me, or even touching me. You now can breath in any environment inside my body, meaning that you could be submerged in anything and you wouldn't feel a difference. You can get to virtually any place in my body, something that was impossible before, even with your size. Now if you find any obstacle in your path, you'll always be able to go through it, whether it is a small hole or a wall blocking the way. Your last power is that now can teleport anytime to the place where you will live inside my body, let's call it...your headquarters. You only have to concentrate on it, and you'll be there instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I understand everything. Thanks, Lucario\". You feel happy to know that you'll be safe inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting dark out here.\" Lucario said \"I know you humans need to sleep many hours, more than me. Would you like to teleport to your headquarters? It is easy, just clear your mind of any thought and focus on your headquarters. You haven't seen it yet, so an image doesn't work. However, wondering about that place should work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou think it is worth trying, but you also would like to try to find your way walking through Lucario's body, just to see what other surprises are around. Besides, exploring  would help you figure the location of many things by yourself. Then you think again about the convenience of teleporting and not having to spend any time trying to find it. After all, you didn't know how far you was from the headquarters.</span></div></div>",

Besides the inherent risk of teleporting through unknown grounds, walking might just allow you to take in more of the gargantuan Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I want to stay on the safe side of things\", you said, \"You'll never know what will happen if you teleport without knowing your destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence, then Lucario spoke: \"I understand what you mean......If that's the case, then take the original path back to my stomach, you should see another tunnel that leads up from there. By taking that tunnel, you should be able to reach the \"headquarter\" in no time. There will be many splits along the way, but the headquarter is at the very end of the tunnel which should be easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the curious person always are, You followed Lucario's instruction and made your way back to the vast stomach. Indeed, another tunnel is visible at the other end of the soft chamber. The only difference is that this seems to lead upward the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked toward the tunnel and started ascending it. The twists and turns of the passage disorients you, the softness of the ground made it even more of a challenge to properly scale your way through. For some odd reasons, the ground gradually resembles \u00a0a long flight of stair the higher you went. You felt gushes of warm air as you continue to ascend the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere at the midpoint of your trip upward, you begin to see splits along the way. Some of them are marked with simple pictograms. You recognized some of them as the lungs and heart. The rest of them makes no sense to you. Because you are exhausted from day's ordeal, you decided to explore them the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a total of fifteen minutes, the tunnel seems to end at a larger area. You assumed that this is the headquarter Lucario mentioned. You entered the area and take the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in a room-sized chamber that is blue and has a faint glowing aura to it. On one side of the chamber, there is a raised rectangle that is covered in what looks like fur. \u00a0 The colors on them match those of Lucario. It is big enough is fit you comfortably. \u00a0You walked there and tried sitting on it. It's extremely soft and warm. This is when you noticed another thing across the chamber: a large viewing window. The elliptical opening is currently showing a beautiful star-filled sky. It must've gotten dark during my trip here.\u00a0The shimmering amid the dark sky mesmerized you. Throughout your travel across the land, this is the first time you have seen this many stars appear all at once.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved toward the window, speechless........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the night sky like I do?\", Lucario suddenly asked. The closeness of the voice surprises you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I exactly?\", you asked the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my head, silly\", Lucario said with a chuckle. \"I don't call it the \"headquarter\" without a reason. In case you're wondering, you are currently looking out from my left eye. Do you like the setup of the chamber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course!\", you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you like it, but I think maybe you should get some rest after such a long day.\", Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\", you said as you lie down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Night, I hope that you have a nice dream. Tomorrow will be another adventurous day for you.\", Lucario said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately feel drowsy as you adjusted yourself in the bed. Staring out the 'window' at the stars aided you and you fell into a deep sleep.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to focus and listen, expecting to hear <i>anything</i> that could tell you where you are. Then you hear it, very softly. It is a heartbeat. You open your eyes and you see trees and a river, but everything is surrounded by a blue wall, forming an ellipse that looks like a window. Then you realize it wasn't a dream or an hallucination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt out of the bed and Lucario instantly greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my friend. How was the first night in your temporal home?\" Lucario says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that. While you slept, I meditated about the situation and about what we can do to return you to normal size. I'll tell you my conclusions while we eat. I hope you understand that only somebody with extraordinary powers can help you, and it may take a long time to find. Some weeks, maybe even more than a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind how long it takes, as long as I'm inside you\" you reply. Somehow, it is pretty obvious to you that Lucario is smiling now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm looking for breakfast right now, but it seems it will take a while. There is a special chamber near that will be your food area, so don't wander too far. When it is time for breakfast I'll tell you, meanwhile, you're free to do whatever you want. I recommend you don't go lower than where the tunnel you used to arrive here splits for the first time. There are many things to see just in the small area between that point and my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. Do you recommend any place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, above each new road there is a sign that will show you what to expect to find. There are most obvious organs in my chest, which are my heart and lungs. However, seeing how just the day started, there is also a place for you to relax and take a bath, and there is another that will allow you to get acquainted with the rest of my body, just outside the headquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acquainted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a big map that points to every destination in my body, meaning you can see every organ and every room. Keep in mind that I can change it anytime to adjust my body to your necessities, you just need to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and get outside of the headquarters, and you glance to the tunnel and try to see as far as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You exited your room and went through the tunnel, looking for the Map Room. As Lucario had previously mentioned, you saw tunnels that leads to an eating area, a bath room, and so on. But as of now, you are more concerned with familiarizing yourself with the locations in the Pokemon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you less than a minute to discover a tunnel marked \"Map\". The sign has a depiction of an paper map with a compass rose on it. Without any further delay, you headed into the passageway. Surprisingly, it didn't take long for you to arrive in another chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side of the chamber there is what looks like a large screen made of gel-like substance. There is an outline of Lucario embedded on the screen that is filled with countless circles and lines (resembling a map like those you would encounter on a subway). You also noticed that there seemed to be a panel located on a raised platform at the center of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked slowly toward the center, your body trembling with curiosity. It is impossible for Pokemon to have electricity within their body and a display screen. The various contraception within Lucario just confused you further as to what he is fully capable of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stepped onto the platform, you notice that there is an impression of a hand print on a stump of flesh. You placed your hand onto it and the large screen in the room instantly refreshed itself. It now shows a couple of recommended location based on your preference.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n.....Wait a minute...does that mean that Lucario can read my thoughts now?.......Pokemons are so mysterious.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at the available options presented to you on the display along with a short description:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dining Area</b>- In this area, you can enjoy the food that Lucario ate.

You will have to visit this place yourself to find out what I prepared for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could read the next destination, you heard the Pokemon's voice around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's breakfast time and I have found more food than usual today.\", Lucario said, \"Come on over to the Dining Area and enjoy your meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right over!!!\", you said.</span></div></div>",

There was a something that looked like a set of table and chair near to a wall, and a hole above them. On the other side was many squares and rectangles, and when you approached them, you realized it was many appliances made of fleshy material. Amazed, you sit on the chair and wait, and soon enough, a piece of cooked meat falls through the hole, directly on the table. It was like a piece of meat looked through a magnifying lens, you could see every detail of it, reminding you of your size. You know that the same meat would not be considerate enough for breakfast if you had your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to find some meat, and thought you may like it. I'll just have some berries for myself\" Lucario says. You're just too grateful to answer. Some minutes later, you remember to ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was something you wanted to tell me, Lucario. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I meditated about you and your situation and I think I remember something similar that happened once. Looks like it only affects the foreigners to this forest. It was a Pok\u00e9mon, that got shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It drowned. Somebody found its body laying on a puddle after it rained\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was silent, thinking how lucky you was to be under Lucario's care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that I heard somebody say that that Pok\u00e9mon could have obtained help if he had tried to contact our local Psychic-type. He is the only one around here, but I think he doesn't have enough power to help you. However, I think he may direct us to the one that can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where does he live?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't live too far. I think we may talk with him tonight or tomorrow morning. But <i>you</i> will be the one to talk, to explain how you felt and that kind of stuff. Then he may give an adequate answer.\" Before you have a chance to ask how, Lucario says: \"I'll tell you how it will happen when we get there. Don't worry, you won't have to leave my body to do it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you had finished breakfast, and was eager to walk around. You are so excited you feel like Lucario could feel it, and you are right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any plan? I may guide you around. Just wait a minute\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you sit on the chair again. You wait and then see the entrance to the Dining Room opening and you see a Lucario. It walks directly to you, and you're too surprised to move. The Lucario smiles. \"It is me, my friend. I'm using my aura to create a replica of me.\" Then you see the Lucario extend its paw and touch your arm. You <i>can</i> feel it. Looking back to the Lucario, you realize he is translucent, even if it doesn't seem like that at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I said I would guide you, I meant it literally\" Lucario says cheerily. \"Do you have something in mind?\" you ask. \"Well, I was thinking to give you a tour. I thought of a couple tours, taking today and tomorrow, just so you know better me whole body. I assure you it will be worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday I may take you on a tour through every system in my body, so you see how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would we visit?\" -you ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't spoil the surprises, but I'll tell you that we'll start in the <b>lungs</b>. And from there, we'll visit my <b>circulatory, nervous, digestive, urinary, reproductive</b> and a system that only Steel type Pok\u00e9mon have, located along with our <b>bones</b>, in that order. I'll be with you in every part of the tour.\" Lucario smiles. \"Are you ready for it?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First I'll need to do something, wait for a while. Then meet me in front of the map room\". Then the aura representation of Lucario leaves. You obey, playing with your thumbs until you consider you waited enough. You get out of the Dining Area, and arrive to the map room. You arrived just in time to see Lucario coming out of the map room, with a thin rectangle of something that looks like plasma on its paws. \"Take this, you'll see its utility when we arrive to my lungs. Now follow me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two walk for a while until you arrive to two tunnels you had seen before, last night. You recognized the pictograms that are on the entrances, one going to the heart and the other one to the lungs. Lucario opens the one leading to the lungs. You walk until you arrive to a very tall, large and soft chamber. It had a gray-ish color, besides the common pink tone that dominated Lucario's insides. The whole room was moving, with a steady rhythm. It is obvious to you why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stood on what seemed the center of the room, and said \"This is the first stop. Touch the screen I gave you.\" Aftger you touch the rectangle, it seems to turn on and another outline of Lucario appears. Shortly after that, a blinking dot and another outline appears. It takes the shape of Lucario's respiratory system, and the blinking dot stays on the right lung. You are amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Fighting types have a bigger than normal pulmonary capacity. It helps us to protect the heart and other possible organs while we're in battle. Besides, it helps us to oxygenate the whole body, increasing our resistance. The lung doesn't look big because you're tiny, it looks big because it is actually huge.\" Effectively, you look up and you realize you can't see the ceiling, or whatever replaces the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you have some fun? Jump.\" A bit stunned, you jump slightly and notice you bounce a little. Lucario smiles and says \"You can jump as high as you want and for as long as you want. It won't bother me.\" So you try to jump higher every time. There is something exciting in the whole jumping activity, and you quickly start to enjoy it. After some time of jumping, you realize you have reached a high point in the lung, and you are able to see what is on top. A series of tubes protrude from the top of the lung, and you don't need to look to the map to know that it leads to the rest of Lucario's respiratory system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to take a challenge, human?\" You hear Lucario's telepathy speaking to you \"Those tubes that are on my lungs are pretty thin, even you at your actual size wouldn't fit in them. At least you wouldn't if you hadn't received my powers and friendship, now you'll be able if you want to. I challenge you to climb my whole trachea and larynx, until you arrive to my throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? I'm not sure...the air currents won't help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure that nothing happens to you, even if it means breathing very softly. I'll be waiting you in my throat, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're confident on your strength and ability, and feel compelled to accept Lucario's dare and climb. It sounds like a nice way to spend time. At last, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

If you could do it, I'll let you visit my Lucario Store. Consider that a little detour from your trip. Over there, you'll find countless types of merchandise to your liking! \u00a0ALRIGHT then......on your mark. Get set....... GO!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lucario shouted, a counter on the portable plasma screen started counting down from 10 minutes. You quickly stowed the device into your trainer's bag and jumped for the highest point in the lung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it's slightly difficult for you to keep in rhythm with the air flow in the lung, but then a particularly strong gust blew you toward one of the entrance at the top of the lung. When you approached the hole, you felt your body shrink in size to accommodate itself into the narrow opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must be one of the special abilities that Lucario shared with you.', you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your new size, you arrived in what seem to be an organic cavern with countless openings and entrances. \u00a0You tried to follow the airflow since you know that you will eventually arrive at the meeting point between the two lungs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running into several dead ends and loops in the lung branches you arrived at a larger tube like structure that extends all the way up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed that you have arrived at the trachea. Looking around for something that may aid your ascent, you realized that the walls around the trachea are ridged and perfect for climbing. You latched yourself onto the ridges and started climbing. It was a steep climb, far steeper than the rockiest path on Mt. Chimney. Occasionally, due the slippery nature of the trachea, you sometimes slipped down a few notch, slightly hindering your progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe higher you climbed, the brighter it seems to get. You though that you must be getting close to the throat and to the finish line. Your surrounding turned brighter and you could make out the shape of an arch \u00a0at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickened your pace as you finally reached the end of the tongue. You collapsed onto the squishy tongue and decide to rest for a while. Looking up at the ceiling, you see the humongous uvula gangling overhead and the fleshy pink roof of the mouth. Turning your head, you looked at the \"entrance\", and saw closely for the first time the sparkling white teeth of Lucario. Some of them look razor-sharp while others have a smoother shape. Lights peaked out from various openings between the teeth, forming several rays that shone on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden loud beep from your plasma device sends your mind reeling back. You removed it from your bag and saw that you spend a total of 7 minutes and 12 seconds climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\", you heard Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and saw the holographic Pokemon leaning against his own molars with a playful smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did far better than I expected\", Lucario said, \"now, keeping my part the deal, I'll take you to the store. Wanna check it out now?\"</span></div></div>",

Follow me\". he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario starts walking back to his throat, and stops near the edge of the humongous emptiness that leads deep inside Lucario. \"You should hold my paw. There is a shortcut here, and it is kind of risky. Not that you would get hurt, but it would be a waste of time if you fall down.\" You grab his paw, still amazed that despite he being n holographic representation of your host, it still feels very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your companion start walking along the edge of the throat and find a narrow ledge on a side of the throat. Lucario starts walking carefully on it, and you follow as close as you can. Looking to the front of you, you can see a small entrance at the end of the ledge. When you are almost done and almost reach the entrance, you slip and almost fall down the esophagus, but Lucario is able to keep you on the road. You recover quickly nd continue walking, until you find yourself in front of a small sphincter. You press on it and it opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps in front of that, you enter a brightly iluminated room. There are many flesh-like formations, resembling shelves, and they're filled with varied forms of merchandise, all of them with Lucario's trademark blue and black. \"How did you make or obtain all this stuff?\" \"You'll never know\" he says with a smile. \"Take anything you want, everything is freen and made for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around the room, picking random stuff. The variety is amazing, you find stuff for everyday life, mere toys and figurines of Lucario and even what seems like a costume. You keep grabbing until you aren't able to take any other things. You walk around trying to find where to put them, and there is a fleshy table on a corner. You put your stuff there and se it dissapearing. \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything was moved to the headquarters. You can't walk around my whole body with all those things, it would be a burden for you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, whatever you say. Interesting place.

There are a couple that has detours that I'll let you check without any other requeriments other than being near to them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is next?\" you ask excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My circulatory system. We'll go to my heart, spend some time there, maybe visit another detour that is near. Then we'll let my own blood to carry us to the next stop of the journey. Here, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario walks around until he find another two sphincters, different from the one you used to enter. He picks one and you folow him.

In the center, there is a huge clearing with glowing arrows here and there. Upon closer inspection, you realized that they indicate some type of directions. When you looked in the general direction of one of the arrow, you found that it ends an enclosed tunnel with translucent wall. There are liquids inside flowing at tremendous speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Heart Concourse.\", Lucario explained, \"From this place, you'll be able to travel to any places where there are blood streams in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what do the arrows on the ground indicate?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tell you where each bloodstream could take you.

You don't have anything to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and walk to the tunnel. At the end of it, there is blood flowing at high speeds. You look to the left and see it going down. \"Say, where is your heart exactly?\" \"We're going inside it.\" he replies. Then he runs and jumps in the river of blood. You see him fall in there and get carried away. Remembering that yesterday you had heard your host saying that you would be able to breath anywhere, you imitate him.

You better be ready, because it will be a wild ride. My heart is very strong.\" You nod and approach your companion. You focus on listening the heartbeat, and effectively it keeps getting louder. You enter to a darker place, and you realize you're directly in the heart. You look around as quick as you can, and you see contracting walls, and in front of you, one of the cardiac valves. You get ready and go through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is like falling from a tall building. You don't know what is happening, everything is going too fast. \"Maybe walking isn't a bad idea\" you mutter to yourself. \"It is all matter of getting used to this!\" you hear Lucario telepathically. The speed decreases after some minutes, so you can resurface again. Everything is going like a blur, and you're still confused. Something touches your shoulder and you turn around to see Lucario. \"We're near our destination. Get ready\". Then he pulls you under the current and through the walls of the artery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two fall to the soft floor, and you note that you're completely dry. A bit reddish, but dry.

Making up you r mind, you walked into the entrance with Lucario, ready to take in the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the chamber appeared dark and highly humid. There is also a scent that you can't quite place. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you gradually see faint glimmer of liquids in the empty space ahead of you. You realized that there is a 'stream' about 10 feet wide in the front of you carrying transparent liquid. The liquid is flowing at a medium pace, like that of a quiet stream. Along the stream, there are several dozens of net-like structures of varying size. They seem to capture some kind of debris that you see between the nets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the start of my reproductive organ.\", the holographic Lucario said, \"From here, water is channeled in from various parts of my body to be used as raw materials. Before the water can used, they have to go through an extremely rigorous filtration process that makes it far purer than any water you will find in the world. As you can see, these net-like things are precision filters. As the water goes through them, the nets will remove even the most microscopic of dirt that might enter my body. Obviously due to your current size, the surrounding might appear gargantuan to you, but the stream is about the actual size of the stream before you is only about the size of a thread. Pretty interesting isn't it? You will discover the next step to the process if you follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked with Lucario toward another entrance in the chamber. The next chamber is much larger than the previous one. This one is about the size of a large Pokemon Stadium. All around you see suspended aqueducts as wide as rivers made from flesh that are diverting water toward the center of the center in a star-like formation. Other than the 6 feet walkway in the roughly-circular chamber, the floor becomes inclined the closer it is to the center. In the center of the chamber there is a deep vat that is collecting water that are falling of in awe strucking waterfalls. Out of interest, you placed your hand under one of the waterfall. The water felt warm and pure as strong force of the waterfall slightly wobbled your balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this room, the water will go through further filtration by allowing any particles to settle at the bottom of the vat.\", Lucario continued his explanation, \"The waste that collects beneath the container will be removed and sent to my bladder from disposal. The even cleaner water will be sent through another pipeline to teh next chamber for processing. This is only step 2 of 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you continue on to the next step, you will see really interesting part of the reproductive organ.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They do a formation and then it flashes and disappear. It has a fast rate, approximately two times every second. On the opposite direction, there is another vat, but it isn't filled with water.

This screen...\" he says, motioning you to come to the screen. \"...basically shows the genes that those cells will receive. Every green dot means that an specific gene was added. When there are enough dots, the screen flashes and the information gets transfered to the cells. As you can see, every time it is different.\" he finishes the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the vat again, and crouch. You focus and watch the liquid, but you can't see a single cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be almost microscopic, but that doesn't mean that there are things smaller than you or things you can't see\" Lucario says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there is a chamber without an entrance...and that is the only way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Are you thinking about going there? I think you shouldn't. I don't know what wold happen to you if something happens and you get my genes on you. Just a suggestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. It has sense, so you obey him. He goes to another tunnel, and after it you find yourself in a bigger room. There are many containers, each of them with a different content. You're curious about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cells goes through every of these containers, to add diverse components that will be essential. I don't want to bore you with the details. Over there is the finished product\". he says, walking between the containers until you reach a larger one. It has a funny scent, but it doesn't bother you very much. It was the same than the first one, just stronger. \"Here are the cells. They're alive now. Each one of them is potential offspring. They get replaced constantly, and that is all\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but you only have said four steps, and you said there are five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to...\" he says. You walk a bit further to another door. \"It is here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. The last step of the process is obvious, if you think about it\". Then it strikes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to enter, I'll just warn you it is a relatively long walk, due to your size. And it will be slightly longer coming back. That entrance follows the same way my sperm would follow. It goes through my cock until the very end. You could be there, there is no danger.\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't I fall?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not\" he replies \"for your safety, there is only one exit of my body, my \"back door\" and I don't think you will be seeing it yet. In some weeks you will, but I doubt you'll be waiting impatiently for that moment.\" he opens the entrance to the last step of the process \"So, are you coming in?\" </span></div></div>",

I think it will be an awesome thing! Besides, I could always learn more about the more intimate side of legendary Pokemons\", you told Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's get going. Be prepared 'cause you are in for a surprise!\", Lucario replied with a strange smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the door directly into the cock. The first thing you noticed is that there is a long tunnel ahead of you. The tunnel is about 20 feet wide and has an oval shape to it. The only reason you could walk in this otherwise inaccessible part of the body is due to your size and a suspended walkway made from metal in the center point of the fleshy tunnel. To your surprise, you can actually feel the walls pulsating in rhythm with Lucario's heart just by standing still on the walkway. At times, you can see countless gallons of liquids being transported in the canal below. The liquid always accompanied a strong smell of antiseptics which isn't what you expect to encounter in a Pokemon's cock. You asked Lucario about this strange thing. He told you as matter of fact-ly that the urine contains medicinal quality that Lucarios used to heal themselves. He added that no humans before have ever tried to research or experiment with it for obvious reasons. At times, the torrential sound of the 'river' below occasionally made you fearful of being swept away if the 'water' gets too high. But you remembered Lucario's assurance that nothing will happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for some 10 minutes you came to large dome-shaped chamber with a small ball-shaped like protrusion in the center. You can also see a large screen next to the object that is displaying some information about water level though you are not sure what they mean. The floor in here is netted so you could actually still see the 'canal' below you. As you looked around, you realized that the room has a red glow to it and with that, you could make out the intricate veins that seemingly surrounds the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you have reached the end of my cock.\", Lucario said, \"This room here is the farthest point you could travel up my penis. As you can see, there is a round object at the center of this room. That is the nerve ending of my cock; in other words, the most sensitive part in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The display screen you see there indicates the level of my reproductive semen that remains in the reservoir chamber you came from. The time table there indicates the estimated release time of my urine.\", Lucario continued, \"It also tells you my current stimulation level which is currently 0 as you can see right there.........Since you got this far in my body, why don't you try your hand at your \"techniques\" on me? I haven't done 'it' in a good while.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're kind of nervous. You shyly poke the strange orb, and instantly note than the number increased slightly. You are startled, and keep poking it. After a while, you relax and start touch it with your whole hand. The orb moves, and you see the number growing even more. Around you, the whole chamber moves, undoubtedly you're causing a slight excitation. You look at your companion, and he just stands there smiling. Nothing on him has changed. \"Once again, I'm an holographic representation of myself.\"  so you shrug and keep moving. There is something strangely appealing on the whole activity, and you keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the number approaches 100, and you see a strange liquid starting to flow beneath you. You look down, and see the same indescribable substance that is filled with empty cells. It is flowing slowly, but steadily. You keep going until it finally gets to 100, and you see that the current grew a lot, almost touching the net floor you're standing on. The whole room is pulsing, and you can see that everything outside is pulsing too. It goes for a few seconds, then the current decreases, and you see the number falling down quickly.  After it stop, you touch again the orb, but the number refuses to be higher than a mere ten. The chamber around relax and soon the current is gone. You ask Lucario about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is natural. I'm used to do this a few times every month, not too often. You can't force my body further than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something more, the truth is that I expected to see something different outside this room. I saw the same liquid that was in step three, nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most Pok\u00e9mon appreciates their possible future descendants. If it isn't for reproductive means, the only thing that will happen is that there will be a flow of empty cells. The pleasure stays, though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of understand, but it definitely is something unexpected. You two exit the chamber, and start going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the experience, my friend.\" Lucario asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...strange. I think that is all I can say\". you say, not finding another word to describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in some days, if you want. I certainly won't mind\" he kind of smiles. The truth is that you're starting to be weirded out, despite everything. You're not sure if you actually want to return. Maybe when you're alone, not with the aura formation that is leading your tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you go past the entrance you had used to enter, and you see that the tunnel goes further. Some time later, you go in front of another sphincter. \"Behind that, there is my bladder. There is not much to see, it is a big container, no more.\" \"But you had said something about healing properties and other stuff\". \"Everything that gives the attributes to my urine happens in my kidneys, not in the bladder. Maybe you want to see later by yourself.\" The thought of something that you at first had considerated to be just waste and ended having medicinal properties is mind-boggling. You promise yourself you'll ask Lucario to take you to his kidneys before the day ends. You keep walking until you arrive to another tunnel, you realize you're going up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is noon, and I'm getting hungry. What about you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, me too. What did you mention earlier about lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had said that we'll eat lunch at my stomach. Or maybe I should say -you'll eat lunch- You have already heard this many times, but I'm a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Lucario. Don't say it again. I trust you and all, but I'm sure that it will be kind of dangerous, right? Are you able to control your own acids too? you ask, then you feel stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. Besides, they wouldn't even affect you. Basically I'll go by myself to the dining area and bring your food. Then I'll eat my part, or I should say that my body will eat my part. You'll sit on a corner and relax. It is all part of the tour, you just have to see part of my digestion process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with it. And where will go later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are two options. I think it is time for another challenge, after the whole explaining part. Not in my stomach, I mean in the next part of the tour. You can choose to either go to my brain, or we can go further in my digestive system and explore my intestines. Both places have another challenge and reward for you, and I assure you that both are worth it. Choose one, and we'll explore the other one just after we finish the challenge and you claim your prize if you are able to complete them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that if Lucario said that if he says that it will be worth it, you know it will. You try to imagine what kind of rewards you could obtain in his brain or his intestines. You can see the end of the tunnel, meaning that you arrived back to the stomach. You finally tell Lucario your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You enter the stomach, and Lucario shows you a spot where he says you'll be fine. He then enters through the tunnel that you had used to get to the headquarters. While you wait for your host to bring you the food, you observe around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first place in Lucario's body you observed, and it didn't have any changes. It still was slippery, big and empty, although the last one would change shortly. There was also a few holes around, and you already knew where most of them would take. You count six, and you remember where they take. There was still two that had unexplored terrain behind them, so you approached them and opened them, and you tried to see what was there. You couldn't see the end of them, something you had already expected. You return to your spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, Lucario returns carrying a big berry like it were made of foam. He looked around to orientate himself and walked to you. \"Here, have this. I'll have some of these too, thought you may like them\". he says, and you receive it. You instantly fall down with the berry on top of you, not having the enough strength to hold it like your friend did. Somehow you manage to recover and you observe the berry, noting it is bigger than you. There is no way you would be able to eat all of it. You take a bite and enjoy the taste, sweet but had a sour aftertaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, a hole in the ceiling of the stomach opens, and a mush enters the stomach. It falls with a splat to the floor. While you eat, you keep observing. Chewed berries, of many types, judging by the colors. They form a pile, while liquid starts to accumulate around it. You observe until you feel full, and nothing has happened to the berries. It isn't like you had expected to see them dissolving in front of you, but you certainly was hoping for more. Lucario must have noted something on your expression. \"I just thought it would be funny if you had lunch here. Nothing will happen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and tell him that you can't eat more. There was still half of your lunch, and it was delicious, but you are full. He takes the rests of the berry and tells you that he will take it to your dining area, in case you want more later or tomorrow. While he is away, you look around, and soon you can't resist the temptation to approach the other side of the stomach, where Lucario's food was being digested. The amount of liquid had bigger, so you couldn't touch the mush without having to almost cover yourself with the acids. You shrug and stick your hand in the liquid, until it covers your wrist. It feels like the liquid was effervescent, and after a while your hand goes numb. Worried that you may have gone too far, you pull it out and observe it carefully. There aren't any marks nor burns, and soon you start to feel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario returns, and you couldn't avoid telling him about what you had done. \"It is the gastric acids, obviously. You have natural immunity, but I don't know if you actually would enjoy being in a pool of this. Specially if you was worried after the sensations you had.\" It is logical, so you just agree with it and get ready to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're going to my brain. Can you see that hole on the other wall? It will take us to my spinal cord. There is some kind of elevator in there. Follow me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour companion and you avoid the acids and enter the hole. After five minutes, you arrive to a large bone, and you find a small hole on a side. You enter through it and find yourself in a cube, with many buttons on a side. It is opaque, and the only other thing here is the spinal cord, like wires behind you. Lucario presses the second highest button, and the elvator starts to move up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, isn't it? This is recent, just so you can move faster, if you want. This follows my spinal cord, and just so you have an idea of how this works, the lowest button takes you to my feet. And the second lowest to my tail. Not much to see in those places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the brain is the second highest? What is higher than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just a room for you to relax and listen to the sounds of nature, amplified by my ears. Check it out later\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stops, and you two enter the brain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elevator stopped with an audible beep. As the elevator doors opened, you and Lucario are greeted by a humongous room that rivals the size of the stomach that you're previously in. The circular room by your estimate is about 180 feet in diameter with a 'ceiling' at least 30 feet high. The walls around you are soft and pulsating in synchronization with the heart. Light sources came several globe-like objects that hangs around the ceiling. To your surprise, the brain seems to be further divided into levels as evidenced by a stairwell running at one side of the chamber. This leads you to wonder how much more places can Lucario take you to; something tells you that the results are probably near infinite. On the ground floor where you are, the chamber resembles a large office lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked around the room, you can see that there are a circular set of couches that sits at one-side of the chamber. The couch are blue and yellow in color, which compliments Lucario's coat quite well. In front of the couch, there is a large table that has a large transparent screen. There isn't any sort of buttons visible around the screen nor is there a remote for it. \"Whoa.....this is starting to look like a living room.\", you thought, \"I wonder what can we see on this television thing in Lucario. I'll check that out later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to look around the chamber. Another thing caught your sight, this time it's table with something that you haven't seen for days.........a computer. But several things distinguishes this computer from the one back at your home. First of them, this computer is made from things resembling solid gels with glowing veins and nerve points running through it. Another is the the lack of a keyboard or anything resembling a button. The only thing that caught your attention are two palm imprints on the table in front of the screen. Seeing that there is probably no other options, you placed you hands onto the imprints. The computer instantly starts up and a menu pops out with a list of options along with a description of each. Many of them are generic features that you would find on your computer. Two options stood out among them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. <b>Online Web</b>- <i>This is something that Lucario has developed especially for the occupant in his body. This allows you to access, believe it or not, the internet virtually at any times. Lucario discovered this function when he was using his aura force. When changing the frequencies of his kinetic power, he happened to come across one that is filled with information. Although initially confused, Lucario eventually discovered that humans have developed the technology to transfer information over the air. Besides your typical webpages, you can also access materials created by Lucario.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <b>Direct Control</b>- <i>When you choose this option, you will be able to assume direct control of Lucario. By direct control, it means that you temporarily get to be Lucario himself. During this state, you will see, smell, hear, feel, and sense everything from the viewpoint of Lucario. While you are in control, the original personality of Lucario can still talk with you about various details.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there is not much to do now and you haven't really used a computer for sometimes. You allowed yourself to settle in and delve further into the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You do your usual stuff, and leave a message to your family in case that they get worried for your absence, seeing how your vacation time was almost ending. You spend longer here, until you absent-mindlessly look around and you see Lucario on one of the couches, seemingly asleep. He may have been tired of waiting for you and decided to rest. You remember that the description of the computer had said something about materials created by your host, so you stand and walk towards Lucario. You touch his head until his hologram wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but how do I activate what you have done here in the Online Web?\" you ask, going back to your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch that area of the screen. There are a few things, and I may create more later. They take time, so for some days you'll have to only use the options available\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch the indicated area, and a new menu appears. It has some interesting options, and others that aren't that interesting. There seems to be a map of the brain, a Pok\u00e9dex from Lucario's point of view, an application where you can see your exact location in the world, among others. You open the map, and see that the brain is divided in many sections. You're a bit disappointed that there are less possibilities than you thought, but the options you see are very good, so your disappointment vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brain is divided in levels. Some are locked, while others seem to be public access. You frown, remembering that Lucario had said that you could access any part of his body, yet there was areas in the brain you couldn't visit. You decide to ask him for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're locked temporarily. At least until after the challenge. If you win, those areas are instantly unlocked, and you'll be able to see them. If you fail, well, then I'll unlock them in a week or two. It is just an incentive\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to the screen, and examine further the areas that are beyond your reach. Apparently, the locked areas are where Lucario seems to store his secrets and details about his life, taking almost half of the brain. The unlocked areas are places where you can do something or see something. You touch a random area and a small window appears, describing the area you touched as a place where you could control Lucario in more detail, with more features than the version that there is in the computer. You touch another area, and another window appears, this time saying that it is a place where you could check what is happening in any part of Lucario's body, almost like an internal control. Finally, in the back, there is a hall. You activate the small plasma tablet you received at the beginning of the tour and try to see what is beyond that hall. It seems to lead to those curious appendages on the back of your host's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be basically your connection to the world, at least in the short range.\" he explains. \"You'll have the occasion of using it tomorrow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around more, until you finally close the map. An option that wasn't there before appears on the top of the list. \"I just made that\" Lucario says \"it is a place where you could talk with the Pok\u00e9mon of this forest. Most of them are actually interesting, and there are many species. There are many that has the same ability I have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the ability to have somebody inside them, if the occasion happens.\" he finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off the computer. \"Okay, want to take the challenge? Remember the prize.\" you nod. \"Basically, you'll have to do a series of basic tasks in the Direct Control\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here in the computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, in the one that is better. You saw where it is. I'll tell you what to do while controlling me, and if you manage to be successful, you'll be able to visit those places that are locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strangely, the stair looks like any other part of the brain but it feels as solid as steel. You carefully make your way up into the next level. The room is similar in shape to the one below but there are major differences. First of all the room is dimmer and more muted in color. There is no other feature except for an area at the center of the room. The area appeared as a recessed area on the floor with a lone bright light shining from the top. As you approached the area, you felt your excitement skyrocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It alright to step into the lighted area.\", Lucario said, \"By stepping into the area, you will be able to immediately assume control of my body.\", the holographic Lucario instructed, \"There is a lot you can learn about a Pokemon once you get to 'be' one yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as Lucario said and entered the recess area. Suddenly a blinding light flashed into your eyes and you felt extremely dizzy and disoriented. You fell to the floor, trying to get the feeling off you. After a few minutes of nauseating feelings, you gradually felt yourself returning to normal. When you opened you eyes, you are no longer within Lucario. You're beneath a tree in a dense forest. The sun shined down through the trees, creating strobing flashes on the grassy ground. Several new things you noticed are that you can hear better and you can see farther and clearer than before. When you held up your hands, you realized that they have become paws. A quick assessment of your own body removed all doubts that you are now in control of Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, again.\", said a  voice in your head, \"You have successfully assumed control. The experience later on will be amazing for you. Before we do anything else, I think I should familiarize you will several things first. First of all, since you are now in control of my body, you have all of my abilities and power. This means that you will be able to use Aura and Psychic moves. Secondly, I made my left paw into an organic controller for your convenience. As you can see, I have a total of three fingers and one central palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy pressing your first finger, you will be able to access a virtual map of the area you're in. The map will be superimposed over your field-of-vision but it won't be obstructive. The second finger will act as an info button. By pressing it, I can give you new information when you need help. The third finger will activate the aura scanner which will allow you to locate any of interest in the near proximity. Finally, by pressing on the palm, you will start the next challenge that i have design just for you. If you got bored with controlling me and wanted to return within my body, just hold done the palm button for 6 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready for the game?\"</span></div></div>",

If the time ends and you haven't finished, I'll take control if my body instantly and you'll lose. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you think. You hope that it is enough to communicate with your host, and it seems so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing you'll have to do is to find a certain black rock in the forest. Once you find it, you have to destroy it using any kind of attack you want. You can start now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do is activating the map. It seems that you can control it with your mind, so you try to find anything that can mean there is a rock near. The forest is really big, and you hope you don't have to spend a lot of time looking at the map. Yo take mental note of three or four possibilities of the map, after seeing strange shapes, meaning that maybe there was rocks in there. You run through the forest to each of the marks, and effectively, every one of them ended being rocks, but not of the color you was searching. You activate the map again and try to focus on a further part of the forest, thinking that maybe Lucario wouldn't make it so easy placing the rock near your original position. You memorize another three locations and run, and luckily, the first one was the one you needed to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do is punching it, like that were enough to do some sort of attack. The only thing you manage to do is slightly hurting your friend's fist, meaning that you felt the pain too. You keep yourself from swearing loudly and think about how you could activate the powers. After a while, you figure that maybe focusing on the attack you're trying to do may help. You imagine it in your mind, and surprising enough, you kind of feel Lucario's body moving by itself and throwing a ball of aura at the rock. Pieces of rock fall, and you stop in shock for a moment. Then you repeat what you had done before, until the rock is completely gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, but it took you forty minutes to achieve this. Not finding this place quickly really hurt your performance\". You feel your confidence falling. \"Okay, for the second part. While you was busy with this, I contacted an acquaintance, and he agreed to help. You'll have to catch that bug over there\". Your head turns around automatically until you see a Mothim. He is far, but you can see him perfectly. The Mothim starts to fly away, and you hear Lucario shouting in your mind. \"Go! You only have twenty minutes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running around the trees, trying to localize your target. You use aura to help you in the task, and you faintly see many shapes, obviously belonging to other habitants of the forest. Annoyed, you turn it off. The bug kept moving fast, and soon you lost him. You kept running around the forest, hoping you would be lucky enough to spot him. After some time, you manage to hear a noise behind you and see your target flying near, high in the air. You react quickly, and jump as high as you can. Somehow, you catch one of its wings with your paw. You both fall, you not being used to falling from those heights. You let the Mothim go, and your vision blackens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sort of force throws you out of the lighted area, and you see Lucario near to you. \"You was successful. Some minutes more, and it would be over. Not bad for a beginner. Now you have learnt the basics of this function.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand, and nod. Lucario keeps praising you for your success, while informing you that your former target was unharmed and left. After walking a while through another floor of the brain, you arrive to the entrance of another area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this point, there is everything about me or my life. You'll find anything, even memories or dreams. I just thought you would like to know me better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I'll check it later, if you don't mind.\" Lucario nods, and guides you around his brain, until you're back to the elevator. You enter, and Lucario presses one of the buttons. The elevator starts moving, and you ask Lucario where you are going. \"I have you two options, don't you remember?\" he says with a smirk \"You chose to go to my brain first, so now we go to my intestines\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator soon stops, and you and your host exit. You're in a round tunnel, nicely illuminated. You look to both sides, and only see the walls going for a few feet, before turning into a curve. You reach your bag and grab the tablet with the map, and try to make it work. An outline of Lucario's digestive system appears and, effectively, you're in middle of his small intestine. Yet it isn't small to you, it has 25 feet of diameter from your point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put away the map and look at Lucario, and ask him what way you'll be going. He points to your left, and you two start to walk. Your friend and you spend a long time walking through the intestine, talking about trivial things and your experiences so far inside Lucario. In some moment, Lucario decides it is time for talking about your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't have to explain to you the digestive process, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not. But I can't avoid feeling we shouldn't be here. We had lunch like three hours ago, wouldn't the food be coming to this exact point?\" - you ask worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I control almost everything in my body. The food is still in my stomach. It is ready for the next step of the process, but I thought you wouldn't like to be swimming in digested berries. When we're done here I'll empty my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, and focus on what is around you. The environment is almost pretty. The villi is strange, and is constantly moving, and everything has a nice shade of pink. Lucario explains to you that if you ever went through the villi you would get to part of the circulatory system that aren't connected to the Heart Concourse you had visited hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Lucario speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, do you want to take the challenge I have for you here?\" -he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Depends. I don't see what I could do here, so impress me.\" He stays silent for a minute and then replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What would you say if I told you that you could get your senses amplified permanently?\". You are stunned. How could that be possible? Lucario is pleased with your expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is a place in my body that has an orb like the one that gave you part of my Aura. If you touch that orb, your senses will be amplified instantly to match mine, in terms of strength and ability. These effects will be permanent, and you'll be able to control them. I think you'll like it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement grows. It is something you had never expected, even after seeing what Lucario is capable of doing. Gaining something like that just by touching a sphere of energy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is the reward if you complete the challenge successfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...what do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll just have to find the entrance to the room. There is only one in my whole body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start having a bad feeling. \"And...where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In my large intestine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your excitement is falling. Going that far inside the bowels of Lucario wasn't in your plans. \"It is an important room, and I'm afraid I can't modify it. The only thing you have to do is to find the entrance.\" you hear him say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But at least it is clean down there, right?\" you ask anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is as clean as a colon can be. I'm not a perfect host, you know. Sorry. At least the air is breathable, considering what is around.\" he says, almost with guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. You really don't want to go too far. But the temptation of obtaining the reward is strong. Almost desperate, you beg Lucario to give you clues about its exact location. After a while, he finally answers. \"I'll say it once: If you start seeing large amounts of waste, then you have gone too deep\" he says annoyed. You don't know if he is serious or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another curve, you see a ring of muscle. You know what is behind it. Lucario turns to you and asks: \"Okay, you had time to think about it. Will you try to complete the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You touch the ring of muscle, and it opens quickly. You run into the large intestine while the entrance sealed behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel is brightly illuminated, and it is pretty wide. Much to your surprise, you don't see anything nasty around, so you start walking. A few steps later, you're forced to breath. And although the air does have a smell that reminds you of your location, it isn't like the overpowering stench you had imagined it to be. You slowly get used until you don't note it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep walking, and checking your portable map every once in a while. This place isn't as terrible as you thought, the biggest difference is that it has much more slime on the floor and the walls (it almost covers your shoes) than any other place you had visited, but you haven't seen any waste or other remains of food. The yellow-ish walls move constantly, and it is a strange feeling to watch it. The walls are full of veins in strange patterns, and sometimes to run to the wall thinking you had found the entrance, but when you look closer and touch the wall you find out that it was just veins. You're getting a bit frustrated, as you can't find it. You consider contacting Lucario so you don't get bored, but you have no idea what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you check the map again, you find out that you have seen a bit more than half of the colon, yet you haven't found the entrance to the room you're looking for. Your pride is telling you to keep searching, it is telling you to not to give up. You look in front of you and focus on the long tunnel in front of you, which goes into a curve, the first you see in this place. You're calm, now you know that Lucario wasn't serious about the waste part. You consider going deeper, as you're sure that your host would make it impossible for you to exit his body accidentally, even if you get to the end of the road. But your legs are starting to tire out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a part where there is no slime and sit. Maybe you already got past your objective.

You run into it and come to a big room.

So being so far from his mouth, you decide to try out your gift for teleportation. You think really hard about the mouth and in a second you were worped on his tongue.<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see the light of day. Then you jumped onto his paw and he brought you to the ground. Then you focus really hard about size and you grew to the size of a small preemie Lucario baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario laughs at your success seeing the maximum size that you grew. He says that he has a challenge for you...You shout \"I accept\" before he finished. He laughs at your enthusiasm knowing you would probably say yes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now that you are excited about your transformation. I want you to find the biggest rock in this field and destroy it. This is similar to when you tuck me over, but now you are not as strong. So go and have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree, but \"what is the reward?\" The Lucario though for a second and said \"I know of a hot spring not to far from hear. If you win I will take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished, you tuck off running. You tried the Lucario vision, but it was not a big field of vision, but more than you had a second ago. After five minutes of running around you find a nice size rock and then avoided to punch it. That did not work last time so you focused on your aura. You struggled to think of a power ball to throw. After some frustration you tried to focus on clearing your mind since that is how to use \"aura\". A minute later you feel a little power and tried to throw a ball and a few small chips of rock flew off. Not getting to excited to loss focus you try it again. After a while you throw the last ball exhausted the rock is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario came over and congratulated you on your success and you smile. He picked you up and when to the hot spring for the rest of the day. Two men and a hot spring. At last it was night, it was time to go back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back in bed, you tough how wonderful it was today. With a sigh you wondered about what will happen when this vacation is over and you are still living in your friend. Then about how to repay your friend for all he has done for you.

The dog-like creature looks at you with curiously with its dark eyes. The giant Arcanine is more than 200 ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...this thing smells like a human but how does it get so small?\", Arcanine exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey........\", you screamed, trying to get its attention. You saw the Pokemon raised it ears a little, apparently hearing your faint call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really are a human, but why is it that you're so small? You wouldn't last long out here.\", the Arcanine asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened. I somehow got shrunk walking alone in this forest. For now, I don't know what I can do about my problem.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine looked at you for some time before speaking again: \"I can understand your feeling. But then again, you're highly unsafe out here. But don't worry I got an idea. Why don't you live in my body for the time being until we can find out the source to your problem. My body can sustain you with food, water, shelter, and any thing you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's preposterous!\", you exclaimed, \"Am I not going to be digested just by entering your stomach, let alone live in your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine suddenly give you a little smirk: \"You don't have to worry about it. My acids won't affect you because I can control almost everything in my body, so I can \"tell\" my body to recognize you as a guest, not some food. So you can just allow me to do the rest for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine opened its mouth and signal for you to enter it. Despite being a little scared about being swallowed down,the Arcanine is right, you wouldn't live long this size alone. Well, you thought, it's better to be with this seemingly nice Arcanine than to venture on in your current form in this mysterious forest. You enter the mouth and you immediately feel the soft tongue beneath you moving. You have a clear view of the Arcanine's rows of sharp teeth glistening with saliva. Moving farther, you come toward the huge gullet where you take a deep plunge into Arcanine. The esophagus is constantly pulsating and moving you toward the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling for an unknown time, you arrived at the Pokemon's stomach. The stomach is quite huge, the equivalent of huge lobby. There's no acid in the stomach confirming that Arcanine's statement that he won't hurt you. What makes you realize that this Arcanine isn't some ordinary one is the fact that its stomach have more than two holes; you roughly estimate that there are at least 6 holes in here, where could they lead to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thinking about asking the Arcanine or going on alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Those holes you're seeing in my stomach now will take you to various parts of my body that I have made to accommodate your stay within me for the time being until we can figure out a solution to your shrunken state. And don't worry, my body is extremely resilient so you won't have to be concerned about hurting me when moving around inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me some idea about where I can go in your body? I'm getting a little stuffy and bored in this stomach despite it being so huge.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your current location, you should be able to see 6 holes that leads to various tunnels throughout my body.\", Arcanine said, \"They will take you to the following locations from left to right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Eyes</i></b>- My eyes can be used as an observation area for you if you ever want to see the outside world after some time. That chamber will also function as an \"Arcanine POV experience\" if you ever want to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Brain</i></b>- The most important part of my body. You can visit this location to have a clearer picture of my inner thoughts or to share with me any of your private thoughts or secrets. I can also allow you to take control of me for some time under certain conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Secondary Stomach</i></b>- This is the place where you'll be living for the time in me. This stomach contains a living quarter, an eating area and a restroom for your own convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Leisure Place</i></b>- This is the room where you can do a variety of games, entertainment, etc. with me. In here, you can interact with a virtual 'avatar' of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Intestines</i></b>- This is where the food I ate before goes. It is a long winding path down there. But, in order to keep you safe from outside danger, I won't allow you to travel to the large intestines or exit my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Testicles</i></b>- My reproductive organ. You can visit two of my lovely and huge 'balls'; they are more than able to accommodate you. In that place we can engage in more 'intense' activities if we ever have the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now, human?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Presented with a lot of choice to choose from, you tell Arcanine about your decision to go for his eyes since you are interested in Pokemon anatomy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Arcanine, I decided to visit your eyes.\", you said, \"Umm...Before I go, is there anything that I will find something fascinating there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure will.\", the Arcanine replied, \"Just use the first tunnel from the left to get there. We'll talk again once you get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly nodded in agreement as you enter the first and leftmost tunnel in Arcanine's stomach and make your way upward toward it's head. The way up is filled with countless twist and turns, and near-vertical pathways that you have to climb using a lot of strengths. Along your way up you, you encounter what seems to be \"floors\" and each of them has a hole which no doubt leads to other parts within Arcanine. Maybe, this passageway also allows me to visit the Arcanine's hearts, lungs, and spines, you thought to yourself. You decided to explore them later once you visited the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moving through the fleshy tunnel for up to half an hour, you arrived at a puckered-up opening. You move toward the opening and pried the pink fleshy pucker with your hand. It opened with ease, as if Arcanine intended to welcome you into a new part of his body. When you get your body completely within the hole, you find yourself in a large chamber surrounded by fleshy walls, purple veins, and a strange, slimy liquid. The most astounding features that you see in this elliptical space are two extremely huge, white spheres. The size of the spheres are so tremendous that it made the observatory sphere you saw months ago small in comparison (think about the EPCOT ball). There are also several wide strand of flesh that are holding the spheres in their place. Those strands of muscle attached themselves, in a web-like fashion, to the walls of the chamber you're in. You approached one of the spheres, completely fixated and amazed by its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Could this be......', you thought, '....the eyes...? But how did they get this huge?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's due to the fact that you're so small, it makes my body parts looks rather gargantuan from your perspective.\", Arcanine suddenly spoke, \"Those spheres you see before you are my beautiful eyes. Obviously, they are one of the important parts of my body. If you want to, you can enter one of them and see the surprises within. It's safe for you to move around, you won't hurt me in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way the Arcanine said the word 'surprises' has caught your curiosity. You move yourself even closer to Arcanine's eyeball. You choose the left one since there wouldn't be a difference which one you enter. When viewed closer, you realized that the eyes are covered in a think mucus-like substance. You touched the surface with your bare hand. It feels slimy and warm and it has a faint pulse to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...the strangest of things happened. Despite its solid appearance, you feel that you can push your hand deeper into the eyeball. For some reasons, the fleshy just dissipate where your body comes into contact with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....has...to be one, weird 'inside story' exploration you're taking me through, Arcanine.\", you thought as you pushed you're body against the slime-covered 'eye-wall' and travel deeper into the eye itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all that remains outside the eyes are you feet, which you quickly pulled in without much effort. You find yourself in a spherical room that resembles a large auditorium. Strangely enough, there is also a stair made of flesh near the edge that allows you to move to a high place within the eyeball. Certainly, the Arcanine has an extraordinary body to make it easier for you to access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you took the stairs upward. When you came to the end of the staircase, you find yourself on some kind of \"observation deck\" that has enough room for only one-person. From this vantage point, you can see a circular opening that is showing the forest you were just in hours ago. You assumed that Arcanine is still in the woods moving toward who-knows-where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...so you have finally arrived at the Observation deck.\", you hear the Arcanine said, \"If you ever got bored, this is the place for you to enjoy 'live' images of the outside world; occasionally, it will be refreshing to see something other than fleshes and veins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm..certainly.\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view Arcanine is seeing continue to change before you, from wide meadows to pristine creeks to sun-mottled woods. They're beautiful, beyond human description. Seeing thing through the eyes of a Pokemon is a tantalizing experience and it made you think whether you could do something else in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plains, forests, meadows, flowers.........It made you a bit sleepy seeing the same stuffs over and over again despite the fact that Arcanine is traveling deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you ask the Arcanine what else you can do in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many other things\", Arcanine replied, \"I knew you would be bored in there. So, why don't you try out the \"Vision Capture\" on the observation deck. It could be fun for you, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\", you asked, \"Sounds like some kinda interesting stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, indeed. I often used that innate function to record my daily activities so I can create a log of what I've done. I often used it to remember the Pokemons that I have encountered, the roads I have taken, and many other track-keeping purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, how did you come to have that ability?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcanines are often described to have good memories and senses.\", Arcanine said, \"The \"Vision Capture\" is a Pokemon technique that all Arcanines naturally have at its birth. It basically works like this: Once I used the move, from that point on, everything I see will be 'recorded' and transmitted into my brain for storage. If you're interested, you can access the database at your 'bedroom', which I'm going to lead you to later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou getting to like this Arcanine more and more with each passing minute. Maybe being inside a Pokemon isn't a bad thing at all, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had me curious.\", you tell Arcanine, \"So how do we start this \"Vision Capture\" experience, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's relatively easy. I'll be the one who activate the move. But ...don't get disappointed from your lack of control. For your amusement, you can capture any  images and films with my eyes while I'm doing the \"recording\". Those images and \"videos\" will be sent to your \"bedroom\" where you can view them in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to try it out, now?\", the Arcanine asked you.</span></div></div>",

You do as instructed and you see what looks like a huge computer screen on front of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA computer screen....within a Pokemon? That's unheard of, you thought. When you moved closer to the the computer screen, you realized that it is made of some kind of soft membrane that is soft to the the touch. It's slightly slippery and wet, in some ways similar to what you would feel when you touch a plastic wrapper. The instance you touched the screen, it refreshes and a few words materialized on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, human. This screen is the \"Vision Capture\" I talked about earlier.\",  the words said, \"While I often performed the \"Vision Capture\" move myself, the screen allows you to use my move at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen before you again changed its content. It is now showing two buttons: \"Take Snapshot\" and \"Record\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know were to begin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just press either \"Take Snapshot\"  Or press \"Record\"  to start the vision capture.\"  You looked at the panel for a few moments before making your decision.  You waited for Arcanine to look at something interesting.  All of a sudden, Arcanine came to a large lake in the forest. The pristine, blue water of the lake gleams in the sunlight, shimmering harmoniously along with the wind. A picturesque environment that is only known to wild Pokemons. You quickly pressed the \"Take Snapshot\"  Button and waited for a few seconds before seeing an image of your snapshot appear on the panel.  There was a message reading \"Would you like to save this snapshot?\" You pressed yes and the screen read \"Snapshot saved to brain-databank.\" Presumably, you thought, Arcanine is probably able to store up to billions if not more of videos and snapshots based on his need to keep track of his record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you tried \"Vision Capture\", you were having a bit of fun.  You then Started to record the vision on the \"Vision Capture\"  The recording showed Arcanine walking around the lake and back into the forest and even encountered another Pokemon.  You kept recording.  The Pokemon was a Chikorita.  The Chickorita used razor leaf.  Arcanine easily dodged it and countered with flame-thrower.  The Chokorita was engulfed in flames.  After the smoke settled the Chickorita had already fled.  You stopped recording and pressed yes to save it to the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\"  Arcanine asked.  \"It's awesome, it's like making your own movie!\"  You replied with glee.  Arcanine smiled again and then asked.  \"What do you want to do next?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment before finally deciding to......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Back in the place you started, you take a careful look at the other holes in the stomach. Where can I go next?, you thought.....After thinking for a while, you randomly chose one of the holes without asking Arcanine where it leads to. When you entered it, the passage seems to take a downward slope in the Pokemon's body, indicating that the destination is in a lower part of Arcanine. It roughly took you 10 minutes to travel through the soft, rubbery tunnel and get to your new destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way into the new chamber before, only to drop your jaws in amazement. The room is as vast as the stomach but with a lower 'ceiling'. The 'lighting' in here is also different; it has a more orange hue. The most striking thing about this place is that there are several huge bodies of unknown liquids that almost covers the entire chamber save for the entrance you are standing at. There also seem to be separated into independent 'pools'  of liquids that are interconnected by bridges made of bones. The liquids have different colors and tint in each of the pool. The ceiling above you constantly spraying mists down into the chamber. You got extremely curious and went over to examine the what the liquid is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you placed you hand into the liquid in the 'pool' nearest to you, but nothing obvious happened. But when you removed your hand, you realized that it began to give off a unexplainable yet pleasant smell. It vaguely resembles cologne but with far light smell and a distinctive touch, you could say that its musky. You wondered about what possibly could be the function of such pleasant-smelling substance in Arcanine's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see that you've found this place.\", Arcanine said, \"The place you're in is where I produce many of the substances I used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please be a bit more specific, Arcanine?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is what I called the \"Odor-Producer.\", the Arcanine replied happily, \"Many of the liquids here have different practical uses. They are constantly produced in the form of mists that will condense into the pools to form the correct ingredients. For example, the one that you just touched a while ago is what I used to clean myself with; It acts as a strong cleaning agent capable of cleaning the toughest dirt, sorta like the soaps you humans use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sound convenient.\", you said, \"But what do the other liquids do. Can you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to put it in a quick way......The <i>pink one</i> is for 'attracting females.' The <i>green one</i> is for 'marking territories.' The <i>blue one</i> acts an internal 'cooling fluid' after I use fire moves. And the <i>red one</i> (the one you just touched) is 'cleaning and personal 'hygiene'. That's about all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. I never know that Arcanines used so many types of stuffs. It's really an eye opener.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my? You should definitely be surprised. Just wait until you look at other parts of my body, that will be an eye experience for sure.\", Arcanine said gleefully, \"But before you go on to explore other parts. Do you want to take some 'refreshment bath' here? It's always better to get yourself cleaned before going on a big adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do?\"</span></div></div>",

It isn't hard to see it. You find a rope made of flesh that seems to be tied to the sphere on the ceiling. You aren't athletic, but for your surprise, it is easy to climb. You make a great effort, and can see your progress. Soon the island is far from you, and the spherical structure that is your objective seems bigger. The rope ends in one of the holes in it. You crawl through the hole until you reach what you think is the core. It is a confusing place, as there are tubes of a transparent material and lots of strands of flesh around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here. I have no idea how this should work, tell me about this.\" you ask. Arcanine explains to you that each strand is tied to a part of the walls or the tubes, and control them.\"Normally the tubes would produce the genes, and after that it would be sent down to the bottom. Other parts in the bottom would produce different components, to ensure the success of the mating. But now nothing works, and I have tracked the source of the problem to this point, and I can't do anything about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start working. You pull strands, and note that many are tied to each other, something you suppose isn't right. You carefully try to untwist them, and soon you are successful. You check around for more knots, and break as many as possible. When you're done, everything seems to start working. The strands around you starts moving, and the tubes produce small particles of white liquid, which are transfered through a vent to the bottom of the testicle. Satisfied with your work, you notify Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how grateful I am.\" he says happily. You return to the rope, and you descend until you're back in the island. \"I'll wait until my sperm level is higher, then I'll try to mate again.\". You resume your investigation as best as you can, as you don't have the rest of your information. Time passes, and you finally decide to stop working and distract yourself. You step outside, and note that the level of the liquids around you are much higher than you thought would be. You rush to the elevator and try to get out of there. </span></div></div>",

You have seen this Pokemon a dozen of times on your journey but this is the first time that you have seen one this huge and up close. You look at your surrounding and discovered that you are standing right next to one of its huge black paws. Its claws shimmer in the dappled sunlight of the forests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray trained its gold-crimson eyes upon you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is strange, I never seen a bug like this before\", the Luxray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....You...can.... talk?\", you managed to exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...What a surprise! This bug can talk?\", the Pokemon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bug, I'm a Pokemon trainer. And I should be the one to ask you the same question...How can you talk?.\", you yelled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..easy there, little guy. If you really are a human and a trainer then why are you so small? And by the way, I'm not talking, I'm using telepathy.\", the Luxray asked as it tilts its head in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I was walking in this forest for some rest when I just abruptly shrunk without any apparent reasons.\", you said., \"Do you have any idea?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you said so, you find a small rock and climb onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I don't...But I do know that in your current form, you are a rather attractive prey to the wild Pokemons in this forest. They would eat you right away without any hesitation\", the Luxray replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answer sends a shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you're in luck today.\", the Pokemon said, \"I'm not the kind who randomly eat things and I'm full right now....So, let's make a little deal. I can keep you safe from those dangers. You won't have to worry about anything. In those time, we will figure out how to make you normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the Luxray with some suspicion. \"This is getting very very bizarre\", you thought, \"First, I got shrunk in the middle of the forest and now, this Pokemon wants to protect me for the time being.....It's beyond my comprehension.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray's request has left you a bit struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still doubting my intentions? If I were lying to you, I'd probably would have already made you my supper.\", the Luxray says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....al...right. What do you mean by protection?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will surely interests you, the lion-like Pokemon says, \" I'm going to protect you by allowing you to live inside my body. I can provide the food, water, and all other necessities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went a bit pale....\"But... but.....doesn't that mean that I'm going to be eaten by you and die? That's just.... extremely disagreeable to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you that it won't end that way. Well you see, despite my mundane appearance outside, I have very different internal anatomy capable of sustaining a human. I will not digest you. Trust me.\", the Luxray says in a genuine manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the Luxray heard your reply, he crouches down onto the ground, bringing its face to your level. Right in front of you, you saw the Pokemon opened its cavernous mouth. Almost immediately, you the warm, moist air emanating from the mouth. You also saw Luxray's short white fangs coated with drools before you. From their appearance, it looks they can easily bite something in half. Despite Luxray's assurance, you still hesitate a little. Without knowing it, you brought your eyes in contact with Luxray's. The excited and firm expression in those gold-crimson eyes have somehow convey to you the message that the Pokemon is telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop worrying already.

You have just met this Pokemon for a little more than half an hour ago and you are still unclear with the situation surrounding you. But you realized that the Luxray has a point: you are now small and vulnerable, and the fact is you'll make a good prey among the many wild Pokemons in this forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about all the other possible options, many of which are unrealistic in your opinion, you decided to take your chance with the Luxray. Together, you both with find time to figure out the why you were shrunk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I go.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter...and enjoy..human.\", the Luxray said enigmatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walked toward the Luxray's mouth and onto the pink tongue before you. It is soft, slimy, and cover with drools. You feel yourself slightly trembling because you have never literally 'enter the belly of a beast' before. You eventually come to the gullet. You looked down and saw a dark fleshy cave that extends deep down into the Pokemon. Normally, this passage is reserved for food and other unsuspecting preys to meet a gruesome end in the stomach . But today, it will become the entrance to your new, organic \"home\" in Luxray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gathered your courage and started to walk down the slippery floor of the gullet. Before going deeper, you turned your head back to the entrance. From this vantage point, Luxray's fangs and teeth framed the forest outside, making you wonder whether this is the last sight that preys would see before they die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you are fully in his mouth, the Luxray slowly closed its gaping jaw, engulfing you in near darkness. You continue to descend down esophagus, feeling the walls around you pulsating to the sound of gentle heartbeats. From your perspective, the \"passage way\" is about 15 feet wide and 7 feet tall. As a way of mitigating your uncertainty, you imagine that you are just traveling in one of the countless dark tunnels that you encountered on your journey to be a Pokemon Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled downward for another 5 minutes before you finally reached the stomach. The end of the esophagus is so slippery that you lost your balance and slide right down into the stomach, falling onto spongy floors and some liquids. Besides that, there is nothing else. No acids, no undigested stuffs, spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, trainer, are you finding my stomach rather comfortable? Again, I will not digest you in there. Feel free to explore around and if you got questions, feel free to ask me.\", said the Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, didn't you just said that you are already full? Then why is your stomach completely empty?\", you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray gave you a little laugh..:\"Ha ha....I was just using a figure of speech you humans would understand. As a Luxray, my primary source of food is sunlight and electricity. That leaves my 'extra' organs like my stomach capable of other uses, like allowing a human to live in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains a lot.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a closer look at Luxray's stomach. It's the size is about a large bedroom. You decided to lie down for a short rest on the soft floor. Then, something strange caught your attention.....There are three holes in Luxray's stomach. Seeing this, you inquire the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to tell you something\", said Luxray, \"There are three areas you can go in my body: A Personal Stomach, My \"Center\", and some parts of my bowels and reproductive organ. In short, here are some basic info:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Personal Stomach: Your private living quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--My \"Center\": An 'observation deck' for a Pokemon experience. Experience Luxray first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--The third part is self-explanatory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to rest for while or do you want to know me a little better?\", asked Luxray affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is the hole in the middle\" Luxray replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and try to walk across the stomach. The floor is spongy and slippery, so you had to put your hand on the wall to not to fall. Besides you didn't want to step on something important, or hurt Luxray in any way, although a part of you knew it would be impossible for you to hurt any organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally get in front of the entrance to your new \"bedroom\", you turn around and take a look to the rest of the stomach, amazed by its size. Then you look to the other two holes, planning to explore them later. \"How did I end like this\" you think while trying to open the entrance. Your hands slip easily, but it was a bit more difficult for the rest of your body. When your head and one of your arms are the only things left in the stomach, you tried to touch the floor and the walls of the Personal Stomach with your feet and arms. The texture didn't feel different of Luxray's stomach, and it is just a bit more dry. You finally got your whole body in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you dried yourself of any liquids, you look around. The Personal Stomach was almost as big as Luxray's stomach, but had some differences. Somehow, it was cooler than the stomach, and it was well-lit. You walk to the other site of your \"bedroom\", and you notice a small passage leading to another small room, some sort of luminiscent bulb-like object in the ceiling and something big  on the floor. You decide to check the later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had the same texture and appearance than the rest of the Personal Stomach, but it was flat and rounded, soft and a bit warm. You saw it had a height of 3 feet and was 6 feet long. It also had a smaller lump on it, almost at the edge of it. After examinating it for like a minute, you decide it has to be some kind of organ under the Personal Stomach, close enough to make this shape in your room. Just to be sure, you decide to ask the Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Eh...what is this? Looks pretty strange\" you said, while touching it so Luxray knows what you're talking about.<br>\r\n-\"It is your bed. A part of my liver or some other organ is pretty close to the Personal Stomach. Try it, and don't be afraid, you won't hurt me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes until you see everything blurry and yes, it kind of looks like a bed. Carefully, you get on it, and lay your head on the lump and relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How is this so well-lit? I thought light was impossible inside of a Pokemon\"<br>\r\n-\"It is just electricity. I don't even need to try, it just happens\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay on your new \"bed\" for some minutes, thinking about how bizarre everything was inside of Luxray. Who knows what other strange things would be in Luxray's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to check the passage you saw before. After going through the entrance, you get into a small room, smaller than 15 feet. There is a hole in the floor, too small for you to go through. You slip your hand through it, trying to feel something. Whatever it is, you don't seem able to touch the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is this hole for?\"-you ask the Luxray.<br>\r\n-\"It is like a sewer system for you. It is connected to my bladder. Do your necessities in there, and your waste will be eliminated along with my urine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, thinking how convenient it was to have your own...toilet, or at least something similar to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to the Personal Stomach, and wonder what to do next. It has been a pretty strange day, so sleeping for a while is an option. But there is also more explore in Luxray's body, and although you know you have lots of time to explore, you want to do it as quickly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Being in a Pokemon is something you have never dreamed of happening. Maybe being shrunk isn't so bad after all, you thought. After traveling back to the First Stomach, you look at the three passageways before you again. This time, you decided to take the one on the left. You make your way across the spongy floor to reach the entrance. Although it basically looks the same as the tunnel you used to travel to the Personal Stomach (bedroom+restroom), you have a feeling that this one is heading upward in an inclined fashion through Luxray's interior. You decided to ask Luxray about where the holes lead to before making your way further up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many things for you to see along this passage way, all of them probably of interest to you. Do you want me to talk more about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know more about your awesome interiors\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, human, there are many things along this passage, but I recommend you first visit these 3 places along the way up\", the Luxray says.,\"That way, It'll make your stay within me even more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Food Area</b>- A place within me that can be used to store food for you. Berries, fruits, vegetables,waters, and so on. If you got tired of having those, I can     provide you with some meats if you ever need them. And, as a plus for you, you're able to use the electricity to cook up the materials I've stored in there to make yourself some meals resembling your typical human foods. Don't worry about the effects of heat and smoke on me, they will be exhausted along with waste air from my lungs. Be sure to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Water Room</b> - If you ever felt dirty and tired, this is the place you should go to. It is basically a small chamber with warm water for you to take a bath when you need it. I have added some elements into the water to make it very effective at cleaning you up; it's the same stuffs that I use in my saliva. But the water in this room is safe for you to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Eyes</b>- As a trainer, you may know that we Luxrays have very good vision that can virtually see through everything. This ability has helped me find you in the first place. By visiting this part, you can see the world from my point-of-view, what the life of a Pokemon is like. And, of course, this place includes my famous <i>Luxray Vision</i>. Other than that, I know places where we can find lots of female trainers,sometimes when we are truly bored, maybe we can ...heh...heh...I definitely hope you check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...those 2 places sound kinda fun\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you visit those places, I'm sure it'll be more than just fun for you.\", the Luxray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do you like to go first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alright then, let's make your way upward to my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you take the tunnel on the left hand side, sqeezing yourself through its soft opening and into a long fleshy tunnel that leads up toward Luxray's eyes. On your way up, you saw two other holes that without doubt either leads to the \"Food Area\" or the \"Water Room\". You made the decesion that you will explore them some times later. The passageway is extremely steep, even more than that volcano you climbed while you're in Hoenn, battling an annoying bunch of slipshod trainers during your ascent. The brief recollection brought back good memories of your adventures. But now, you're on a new adventure. This time, instead of fighting to become the Pokemon Master of each region, you get to explore the endless 'inner World' of a Pokemon thanks to your mysterious shrinking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you got to the end of the fleshy passage and saw a puckered 'portal'. What's beyond is still a mystery to you. You gather up your courage and go forward to stretch open the pickered hole. It gave way with rlatovely little effort as if Luxray's body is expecting you to enter the chamber beyond. Within a minute, you made yourself comfortabke in the new chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gradullay settle down, you take a good look at your new surrounding. The room is about 8 ft wide and 9 ft tall, a moderately-sized one within Luxray. The room is brightly lit from natural light. You see two large semicircle windows in front of you. Both of them have golden and crimson tints to it. You believe that you have reached the eyes of Luxray, which to your surprise contains no eyeballs. Rather, the chamber has more resemblence to a central computer control room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your curiosity intensifying by the second, you move yourself closer to one of the \"windows\" and look out. From the Pokemon's 'eye-window', you now can see that Luxray is on a narrow forest route that is between a plain and the forest itself, traveling at a casual pace. You recognize the road as \"Route 42\" which connects your hometown with the next city. At the speed Luxray is traveling, you will arrive at a vast lake where you have to use a surf in a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there , human.\", Luxray said, \"Isn't it nice to see roadways and nature from my perspective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhmm...yeah, quite so.\", you said, \"There is one thing I have to ask you. How can I use you 'Luxray Vision' in this chamber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....it's easy.\", said Luxray, \"You can either tell me to activate it or you can use your Pokedex to do it, with many more features in the latter. But in order to do so, you'll have to allow me to modify and 'sync' your Pokedex to be compaitable with my body's electrkcity and functions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be for you?\", Luxray asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have a natural ability, I can work with your human technology with my own electricity. Some...sparks in the right parts of the machines and they will work differently. I can't explain it, it just comes with my type\" Luxray replies with a chuckle \"Just leave your Pok\u00e9dex on the floor and step back. You won't want to get shocked, it would hurt as hell\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey and go to the entrance to the eye. In just seconds, you see sparks of electricity jumping to the Pok\u00e9dex, hitting it. The last one hit it so hard that the machine jumped high, and fell on the soft floor again, unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done. I'm afraid the changes are permanent, so you'll have to buy a new Pok\u00e9dex when you have your normal size again. But it has many options that will be useful on your stay in my body. The Pok\u00e9dex is now synchronized with my own brain, so you can see your own location on a map installed. You also can check data about the organ you're in, and if there are any possible activities in there. Finally, its search function was modified so you can type something and your machine will give you results related to what you typed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're amazed at what Luxray can do. You recover quickly and ask \"But what happened about your vision? It was supposed to be modified just for that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn on your Pok\u00e9dex, and select the eyes. There are some organs where you now can perform an action for your own enjoyment without needing to ask me, and this is one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the map, and effectively see that it was replaced with a silhouette of Luxray. You tap on the head and it zooms in, and you're able to see the eyes. You tap on the eyes and a new window opens, with information about the eyes and what they can do. On the side, there is one button that is glowing, and you press it. The screen of the Pok\u00e9dex changes and turns into the same scenery Luxray is seeing. Instructions appear on the screen: \"Tap on the screen to use the Luxray vision\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap on a random point of the screen and everything turns gold, except a circle on the exact point you tapped. You move your finger through the screen and the circle moves. You tap on a nearby tree, and the circle moves there. You note that you can see inside the tree. There are some Bug Pok\u00e9mon, and many shapes close to them. You zoom in and you note that those shapes are berries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some minutes directing Luxray to places you wanted to check with the Luxray vision, and you examine everything. Finally, you get bored about it and close the Luxray vision. Wanting to explore more, you activate the search function. You see that, besides a place where you can type, there are other options, where you can tick the options you want to use.<br>\r\n\"Places for everyday life\" \"Places to train Luxray\" \"Places within Luxray's systems\" between other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately you see the screen on your Pokedex refresh and display new information about Luxray's brain:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Luxray's brain is composed of dozens of areas each with its own function and secrets. Areas that you may visit include <b>behavior, memory, regulatory, and \"moves\"</b>. When you visit each of these areas, you will learn more about Luxray.

You continued upward on the soft inclined path. Along the way, you wondered how is it possible the Luxray make his brain accessible to you. Does that mean that he could share his memory with you? You decided that is something that you want to find out when you accessed Luxray's memory later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take up much time for you to get there with the proximity of the eyes to the brain. When you entered the brain, you see a massive chamber before you. There is veins running all across the ceiling, floor, and walls around you. Surprisingly, there seems to be tunnels that branch to other areas in the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt your Pokedex rumbling. You brought the screen up to you face to see what is going on. \"Hello again, human.\", the voice on the Pokedex said. You immediately recognized the voice as that of Luxray. When you take a more careful look at the screen, you see that your location has been updated to \"Luxray's Brain\" with a blinking blue dot at the relevant location. There is also a program called <i>LuxTalk</i> that is open on your Pokedex device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk to me through my Pokedex?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, of course.\", Luxray replied, \" I was thinking that the brain wave around here might be too strong for you to handle; imagine yourself hearing my voice like it is now. Multiply that by 100 and you'll get the idea of the intensity of my brain power.....With the <i>LuxTalk</i> I installed on your Pokedex, that problem is instantly solved. Additionally, if you got tired of speaking all the time, you can also text your message to me and I'll be more than happy to reply to you in typed form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, back to the main topic.\", Luxray said, \"You are now currently at teh main room of my brain.

Over there, you will learn more about my predatory, character, and even sexual behavior in very interactive ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go there and discover for yourself.....I've saved just for you....\", the Luxray said with a smirk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shrugging, you start to walk to the tunnel where you would find the Behavior Area. It was a pretty short walk, and you entered into a dome-shaped room. It wasn't as big as he stomach, but it still was huge, at least to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange shape in the center, and in the frontal part the texture of the wall was different. It didn't have the trademark texture of the brain, it didn't have any folds or even a pink color. It was gray and smooth. You approach the strange blob in the center, and you realize it is some sort of chair, when looked from the front. You sit on it, and the wall in front of you lights up and turn into  lighter color, meaning it is a screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pok\u00e9dex lights up, and you realize you're still holding it. You look at it and see text. The Pok\u00e9dex was in a section where it explained the activities you could do in the brain, and had a part highlighted. \"You can use the Pok\u00e9dex for many things. Use its buttons.\" Puzzled, you press on and the screen changes again. It shows some sort of menu, listing five or six possible options. You select \"Predatory Behavior\", and press a button again. Then behind you, something emerges from the chair and envolves your head and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, those are sensors that will turn this more interesting. You will receive slight shocks that will affect your own brain and you'll feel like you're the one performing the actions\". The thught of being shocked doesn't sound fun, but it isn't like you have other options. \"Eh...okay, whatever\" you say nervously. Luxry may have noted soemthing in your voice, because he immediately asks \"Are you uncomfortable? Maybe you would rather to watch it like, say, a movie.

There is the entrance to it. You'll have to ascend to my head, but it'll be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like the idea of having to go up all the way to Luxray's head, but you're too curious about the \"experience\" Luxray offered you. You get up and go to the entrance. The path to the Center is very titled, and you again feel like leaving the exploration of the head for later or maybe tomorrow. After breathing deep you start to walk. You're not used to the spongy floor of Luxray's body yet, and in some parts it is so inclined that you have to use your hands to advance without falling back to the stomach, but you keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile climbing what you suppose is some passage in Luxray's neck, you see some tunnels and entrances, and you decide to explore them after you see everything in the \"Center\". \"Anatomically, at least one would lead to Luxray's respiratory system, but who knows what surprises there could be around here\", you think just before seeing one last ring on top of the road, and you hope it is the end of the passage. You calculate it took you nine or ten minutes to go from the stomach to where you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the ring, and take a look to the new room you entered. It is rounder than the stomach, and bigger. It seemed to have two floors, and some small stairs at one side of the room. The ground floor was hard and flat, and the room was ful of natural light, but it didn't have much in it. However, it had two big window-like objects, which you suppose are Luxray's eyes. You approach to them, and try to look through the \"glass\". You see the forest, but feel a bit dissapointed that Luxray's vision seems so...normal. Then you notice that the floor near the eyes sounds different than the rest of the floor of Luxray's head, and you deduce that directly below of where you're standing there must be another chamber, hopefully one where you can experience the advantages of Luxray's enhanced eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear something above you, so you look up. You're impressed of what you see. Above you there is what you suppose is Luxray's brain, on the second floor. It is much bigger than you, and seems to be full of activity, controlling everything in Luxray's body. You slowly go upstairs, always looking at the brain. When you stand at 10 feet of it, you hear noises again, this time louder. Listening more carefully, you recognize the noise as the sounds of nature, the wind, etc. Even higher there are two holes, each at one side. They seem to be from the ears, but you don't see how to get to them for now, so you look again to the brain. Luxray seems to feel your presence, and his telepathy almost sounds like he is yelling at your ear, and you suppose he sounds so loud because you're so close to his brain. Going back to the stairs you stop there and request the Luxray to repeat what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you curious about my brain?\"<br>\r\n-\"Of course yes\"- you reply-\"It is an amazing sight\"<br>\r\n-\"Want to get in it? It is the source to my power, all my senses are intensified there and you could even control me for a while\"-Luxray said.<br>\r\n-\"Wow...is that even possible? I mean, how would I be able to control you?\"<br>\r\n-\"Get in my brain and you'll see how\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be blown away by the sight..\", Luxray said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the second floor of Luxray's 'head chamber', the brain is huger than you imagine, possibly able to accommodate a large Pokemon gym you visited a few months ago. The second floor also gave you a good view of the two windows (Luxray's Eyes) you saw earlier. The Luxray now seem to be traveling in a beautiful meadow within the forest. You momentarily paused to see the beautiful flowers and trees before continuing your way toward the brain. Arriving at the front of it, you see no apparent placed from where you can enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-mm...Luxray, how exactly can I enter your brain to control you since I see no entrance around here?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can enter it by using the countless folds outside my brain, any of them would do the trick.\", replied Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me.\", you said as you approach a large fold near you. You entered the crevice and make your way literally toward the center of Luxray's brain. The brain walls sort of squish you tightly, but it allows just enough room for you to move sideways. After traveling for what you think is 5 minutes, you arrived at a small room somewhere in the brain. You take your time to look at your new surrounding. The floor of the room is kinda squishy and has a lot of small crevices from the fact that the chamber is in the brain. The room is lit by the same kind of light bulb-like fixtures you saw throughout Luxray's body, powered by the Pokemon's internal electricity. Near the center of the room, there seems to be a circular dome of a darker shade of pink. You went over to take a closer look at it. From the size of the dome, you believe that it probably can only allow for one person to stand on and use. Before you can open your mouth to ask the Luxray, the Pokemon's voice reached you head, sounding loud from the fact that you are at the \"center\" of Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sensed that you have arrived at the 'command center' in my brain.\", the Luxray said, \"And you were asking about how you can control for some time, right? Well step onto the 'control dome' and I'll tell you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way toward the dome you saw previously and you making your way to the top. The flesh and the slime has made it a bit difficult for you to ascend the dome. Once you reaced the top, you find that there is a small depression that you can get into. You move yourself toward that place. Almost immediately, several strands of 'brain muscle' materialize from the wall of the brain chamber. The cord-like strands are about 1ft in diameter and covered with red veins. The next thing you saw is the strands are latching unto your hands and legs, completely surrounding them as if you are wearing gloves and socks. Strangely enough, the \"gloves\" and \"socks\" gradually change their shapes into Luxray's paws and hindlegs, complete with black and blue fur. Despite the addition of the strands, you discover that you can still freely move around on the dome. Then, the Luxray begin to speak again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it looks like you're ready.\", said the Luxray telepathically, \"Don't worry about those things that i've attached to you. They are for sensing your movement to control me. Both the dome and those muscle strands are part of the control mechanism within me. All you have to do now is to get down on all four and you're good to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as Luxray instructed, falling down on your legs and arms, making it look that you're crawling. Immediately, the chamber around you suddenly brighten up and you saw a wide (180<sup>o</sup>) view of Luxray's vision, showing the field you saw previously; you assumed that the images are transmitted from the 'head chamber' outside and merged to form this \"IMAX screen\". But you can also feel and hear the winds around you as if you're actually a Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain a little about how to control me. To move me around, you just have to move your arms and legs in the desired direction; all my movements at this point will be exactly what you are doing right now.\", you hear the Luxray said, \"Basically, you're now temporarily me. But for your and my safety, you can only control my movement and you have to remain in this field; currently, you cannot use any of my powers and abilities. We'll get to that when you familiarize yourself with me over the long term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being unable to use any of Luxray's ability, you are already excited about controlling the Pokemon. After a few tries, you learned to walk and run on four legs. The experience is awesome. It gives you a sense of being \"wild\". You run around the fields for an hour, chasing some Bug Pokemons and randomly sprinting about. Eventually you got exhausted and tired. you tell Luxray that you want to rest. Almost immediately, the Pokemon re-assumed control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are kinda good at running and sprinting; you probably even be an excellent Pokemon if you ever were one.\", the Luxray said, \"There are many other parts in my brain that contains a lot of things you would like or do you wish to explore other parts of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, you decide to keep walking, just to know how big is Luxray's body, and to try to calculate how much time would it take you to explore <i>everything</i> he had to offer. Your head spins at the thought of all the surprises you could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, you calculate that there are approximately 106 feet from where you started, the brain. Then you look to the rest of the spine, or as far as you can. You can't see the end of it yet, even with the electricity of the spine. You start walking and try to ignore all the entrances you see. You try to imagine what would you find through them and what organs are close to you right now, but you know you won't be able to know what is behind the many possibilities if you don't explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of your imagination for a moment, you notice that you still can't see the end of the spine. You look back again and try to count how many feet you have walked by now. You think you have walked 2600 feet, yet you keep walking. You're sure that if the spine was so long (for your point of view) then there would be lots of places to visit. And seeing how you won't be getting out of Luxray's body (or too far from it) for a while, you have lots of free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, you notice the wire-like spinal cord seemed to be ending. It narrowed and finally ended, but the bone path continued. After a while you find two new roads, strangely enough, both with signs above them. You don't pay any attention to the fact of there being <i>signs</i> inside a living being and concentrate on where you could go now. Both paths seems to be going down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you, the spine continues, without spinal cord. It goes down, yet seems to slightly move. The sign above it has an arrow pointing forward and says \"Tail\". There is more text, but the first word is enough for you to know where it is going, but you can't avoid wondering if there is something to find down there. You don'r read the rest of the sign, just to make it more exciting to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look to your left. It is a slightly lower than the spine tunnel, but it is still pretty big for you. The sign above you says: \"Abdominal Passage. A tunnel from your actual location, ending in the chest\" You walk into it, just to explore a bit of it. It seems to continue in some sort of curve, and it is difficiult to not to fall down and roll to wherever it goes. Later, it turns to be easier to walk. Remembering where you are, you deduce the tunnel goes down the side of the large intestine, making the big curve, then around other organs. You walk back to the spine, counting eight entrances. It is hard, but you finally get back to the spine. You try to deduce which organs you could access from that passage, and think three possible organs, making you even more curious as to what you could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore picking, you remember to calculate how long is the spine. You finally stop at 5000 feet, not wanting to keep adding more numbers, even if you knew there was much more than it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you decide to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know there are many other options through the abdominal passage, but first you wan to know if there is any possible destinations in the tail. And you don't want to ask Luxray, you want it to be a surprise. Even if you don't find anything you would have explored and that is enough for you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand in the bone wall of the spine and start walking. Back to when you was a trainer, you had noticed that pokemon seemed to move their tails a lot, yet the one you're exploring isn't moving very much. You think that either the bones in the tail doesn't move as much as the rest, or Luxray felt you  and wanted to make it easier for you to explore. It still moves sometimes, and when it moves you stop and try to grab to the bone, so you don't fall down. The risk of falling adds some emotion to the walk, but you still can't avoid to curse when you hit the hard floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tail moves harder and you trip. You can't stop rolling, the floor is very tilted. You go too fast to appreciate the enviroment around you. After a while, you finally stop. You stand and look around. The floor isn't tilted anymore, it is almost straight. <i>Above</i> you there is where you came, the rest of the spine. You can't think of a way for you to go back to the body, at least without Luxray's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice there is an entrance in front of you. You approach to it and look around to try to find a sign or something that could tell you what is behind it. You don't find any, so you open the door-like wall, and with your eyes closed you enter. After the entrance closes you see you're in a round room, with some sort of dome in it. There are sounds of electricity, and it seemed to come from the dome. You approach to it and you notice it is almost transparent, yet it has a slight purple color. Inside it, there are sparks and you can feel static electricity around you. It doesn't hurt, but is a very strange experience, hard to describe. You decide to ask Luxray where are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're inside one of my Electric Generation Organs. Every electric pokemon has some of these scattered through their body, most of them concentrated in the part of their bodies that uses most of the electricity. You may use the electricity from them for many uses, depending of your location. Right now there isn't practical use for it in the tail, though. The dome in it is what produces electricity. Go ahead, touch it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to process the information, specially the \"touch it\". If it is an electricity generator, wouldn't it hurt? After all, it was electricity, and electric attacks are very strong. Then you remember that Luxray wouldn't hurt you, so you touch the dome. Your hair stands and you feel the electricity through your body, but it still doesn't hurt. You feel the same thing you felt when you was approaching it, but it was much stronger and felt strangely good. You close your eyes and just focus on the feeling. You finally open your eyes, and realize you touched the dome for many minutes, yet you don't care. You walk around it to know its size, keeping your hands on it so the sensation doesn't stop. It is pretty big, and it takes you a while to go around it. You find some sort of entrance to the dome. You stop and look into it, it seemed to go down and to the center of the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter, still with your hands on the wall. You're inside the dome, and see sparks flying around you. It is pretty surreal. You get in the center, into some sort of chamber. You notice smaller holes in it, each with marks that resembled a + and a -. There is something written in some sort of panel above you. \"Put your hands on the marks and move them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as the sign says. Strangely enough, the feeling of electricity is different in each hand. Then you start moving them. Around you, the sparks and electrical figures seemed to intensify, and one particularly strong electric wave hits the walls of the room, breaking into smaller waves. You keep moving your hands faster, and the electricity gets stronger. You're amazed with the electricity around you, and you continue producing electricity until you feel your arms tired. You finally remove your hands from the marks and the electricity seems to return to normality. You walk outside of the dome, amazed of your experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks for that, human. It was nice from you to recharge me, even if I didn't need it. Want to get out of my tail?<br>\r\n-Sure, I think there is nothing more to see here.- you reply.<br>\r\n-Okay, get back outside of the organ and let me help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, you open the entrance again and look again to the hole above you. You see the spine, yet you can't get back to the road. Then you see everything around you moving. You feel yourself falling to the floor and it lifts until the entrance to the Electric Generation Organ is above you, and the spine tunnel is in front of you. Then it moves again and you almost roll into the bone. You position yourself and feel Luxray lifting his tail, making it much easier to move. You finally get back to the spine, just in front of the abdominal passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a very strange day, yet you have enjoyed it. You decide to try to find the way to your bedroom, but you could also continue exploring instead of going to sleep. </span></div></div>",

So far, you feel that being shrunk and inside a Luxray is something of a wild dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you feel quite tired from your continuous exploration since the morning, so you decided to go to the \"bedroom\" Luxray mentioned earlier to take some rest. You make begin to make your way back to the head through the spine, dreading the thought of having to travel the 5000ft spine again. Then you remember the \"Abdominal Passage\" you saw before. You return to the end of the spine, where the two tunnels split. You make your way down the \"Abdominal Passage\", tranversing through a soft pink tunnel. When you traveled near the midway of the passage, you came across a sign labeled \"Personal Stomach.\" That's probably a shortcut, you thought. You take a more careful look at the sign. It is pointing toward the right to a hole in one of the many entrances in the passage. There is also a short description of the \"Personal Stomach\" on the sign. <i>\"The Living area for my human-guest.\"</i> it reads. The wording slightly caught your surprise, Luxray has reserved a spot within his body just for you. But come to think of it, after exploring numerous part of Luxray, the Pokemon has sort of begin to see you as a personal companion of some type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you feel kind of exhausted already and you didn't want to think too much, so you head right where the sign is pointing. Walking through the bony tunnel, all you could think of is to get to the 'bedroom' that Luxray has made for you. As you went farther down, the tunnel takes a downward path which you assume is because the \"Personal Stomach\" is , well, somewhere near to Luxray's first stomach (the one you're in earlier). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling down for minutes, you come toward another entrance. Without much hesitation, you quickly pulled the 'soft flesh door' open and enter the new chamber before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room before you is significantly smaller than other parts of Luxray's body; it's only slightly larger than your original room in your hometown. The room is made of stomach flesh but there is no signs of acids or any liquids. One thing immediately caught your attention, there is a squarish bulge on one side of the room. It has a darker hue of red when compared with the surrounding. You assume that the bulge is intended as a bed. There is another hole in the room. You venture in it to see what it got. It's a smaller chamber divided into two sides; one side with a little hole in the floor and the other with a disc-shaped thing in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your 'bedroom' \", Luxray said, This is the place where you can rest within me. The smaller room you're now in is both a restroom and bathing area. Basically, this place has all the comforts you can find in a bedroom. Well, not to disturb you any further, feel free to take a rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"light-bulb\" organ in the room dimmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Luxray\", you said.    \"You're always welcome\", Luxray replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back into the main room. Before getting on the bed, you take a short glance around this chamber. As typical with other parts in Luxray, the room is lighted by a bulb-like, soft protrusion on the ceiling. Besides the bed, you also notice that there a fleshy structure that is taller than the bed with a small, rounded bulge in front of it. You realized that it may be a desk. And completely out of your expectation, there's a fleshy device with a display on the desk. The screen is currently off, but you believe that it is some sort of gadget that Luxray made for you. You decide to ask Luxray later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than these things, the room is basically empty, but it's good enough for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie down on the soft, fleshy bed; it is extremely comfortable and warm. You think that once you get some short rests, you intend to continue exploring Luxray. Within a minute, you gradually dose off in the Personal Stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are amazed a Pokemon offered to protect you, but you are a bit nervous about living inside it. After all, everything has happened too fast for you to understand everything, and you wish to have a bit more of time to think about it. You manage to mutter: \"Eh...I would like to think for a while before going in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray just closes its mouth and looks at you. \"As you wish, human. Take your time.\" Then he lays down near you and looks around, ready to protect you agaisnt any possible dangers. Meanwhile, you just sit on a small stone and try to think about what to do. Less than two hours ago you was walking, thinking about where to go next and some minutes later you was trying to understand why everything was so big. And now there was a Luxray who wanted to protect you by allowing you to live inside him. It is confusing, but it is clear to you that you don't have a chance to survive if you stay outside, even if Luxray is with you. With no more option than trusting Luxray and get in your new organic home, you call Luxray, and tell him about your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm ready, Luxray. Let's do it\"- you say, while trying to hide your nervousness. However, Luxray notes it and tries to calm you down. -\"You'll have a great time inside me, human. There are places you wouldn't even believe possible to exist inside me, and you'll be able to get to any part of my body\"- You just keep looking at him, then he says. -\"If you don't want to get through my mouth, there are other entrances\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you ask him about what he had just said. -\"My mouth isn't the only way to enter in my body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you are pondering about which part to enter the Luxray from, Luxray's large ears caught your attention. The gold and blue hues of the ears are an extremely prominent feature of a typical Luxray. Previously, you wouldn't pay such 'obsessive' attention to the Pokemon's body; you usually kept the personal fantasy of exploring another creature's innards deep within your mind. But with the Luxray before you is offering you safety within his body and you in such microscopic size, you find that there is little alternatives but to somehow enter the Pokemon. After thinking for what seems like minutes, you finally made up your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to enter through your large ears.\", you tell Luxray, \"That's a part of your body that I have the least problem about entering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright\", Luxray tells you, \"Then into the ear will be. Also, there is no need to choose between my two ears as they both leads to the same \"place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same 'place?' What is that supposed to mean?\", you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you will have to enter to find out\", said Luxray with a smirk. As the Pokemon said so, he gradually lowered his huge head toward you. Closer and closer his head comes until he finally tilted his nose down onto the ground. With his head up close, you could see that he is far larger than you imagined previously.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get ready to climb up, human.\", the Luxray reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly made you're way toward Luxray's snout and walked up toward an area nears his eyes.You're initial doubt about Luxray's intention melted away as he looked at you with his bright red-golden eyes. Besides seeing your tiny reflections in them, you can also see honesty within those eyes, his intention about protecting you. After a while, you started climbing his face by grasping onto his thick, blue furs as you ascent the Pokemon. Finally, after much efforts, you reached a landing between his ears. You decided to take the left ear on Luxray. You approached the ear you chosen. Before you, you saw a sea of golden furs and a hole amid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the hole after moving through the thick forest of fur. Looking down, you saw nothing but darkness but in there is a 'place' that Luxray promised you would be worth visiting and staying in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....I'm going in.\", you shouted into the hole (remembering the fact that the hole is in fact Luxray's ear-hole).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. You won't hurt me.\", Luxray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou descended into the hole, gradually moving into a dark and moist environment deep within the Pokemon's head. Despite your initial fear that the ear might be dirty, to your surprise, the pink tunnel is spotless and sterile. Because of the pitch-dark surrounding, you have to put your hand against the soft wall to guide you deeper. Eventually, you came toward a soft membrane blocking your way. You naturally assume that it's Luxray's eardrum. While wondering how do you go further, you saw a marking on the wall. It is an arrow etched into the flesh point toward the eardrum. You shrugged at the sign as you move yourself toward Luxray's eardrum. Then the most bizarre of things happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe membrane is passable. You pushed yourself harder against the eardrum as it begins to accept your entrance. The feeling is like passing through a fine net.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your entire body on the other side of the membrane, you continued your way down the tunnel. After walking for more than 10 minutes, you found yourself in a large, rounded chamber.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I at Luxray's brain?, you thought, It couldn't be. There's no sight of the brain in here. If so, then where am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question was answered seconds later when you caught sight of two gold-tinted windows. The gold light flooded into the chamber, casting a mysterious hue to it. You approached one of them and looked out, seeing a forest path before you. You concluded that you may have reached somewhere in Luxray's brain and is looking out from his eyes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore amazing, you saw a seat place near the two windows and it has some sort of control panel on it. You went over to check it out. The seat is made out of spongy tissues and it looks quite comfortable to sit in. you sat down upon the seat....it is indeed comfortable. Once you adjusted yourself in the 'seat' you look at the control panel before you. There are two joystick-like controllers on the left and right of the panel. In the center, there is a small display surrounded by fleshy, red dot that looks like buttons. From your place, you have the perfect view of the windows (eyes); you can directly look out from here. The stuffs you're seeing now reminds you of some sort of futuristic train cockpit you saw at a museum exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my control room, human.\", the Luxray said, \"Here at that seat you're on, you can control my every single move and use many of my abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this kind of place exists within you?\", you said to Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a electric-type Pokemon so everything within me is 'digital' (even my brain) and run by electricity generated by myself.\", the Luxray replied, \"And this control panel before you is like a central console within me.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now, what do you want to try?\" , Luxray asked you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You imagine all the things you can now do, grinning mischievously. You are about to begin using the joysticks on the control panel. But before you can actually play with it, Luxray spoke up again. The screen at the center of the panel lit up, providing you with the status of the Pokemon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I allow you to be the pilot here, I believe that some instructions are at hand here.\", Luxray said with a  low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stick on the left controls my locomotion. Pushing it makes me go forward while pulling it does the opposite. The harder you push the joystick, the faster I will go. The stick on your right is for head movement; tilt the joystick in the desired direction to change your view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened intently to Luxray's word. The Pokemon then told you how to use his Luxray Vision, investigate an object, take images, and translate Pokemon language by pressing the buttons on the console in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....and I think that's about all you need to know to act like a Luxray.\", the Pokemon said, \"Now, let's start exploring this forest, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out of the window and see Luxray approaching a stream to take a drink of water. There is a brief feeling of uneasiness. Is it right to just abruptly take control of Luxray?, you thought. Will there be any negative effects?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Luxray felt your uncertainty, the Pokemin assured you that his personality will be fine during the time of your control; he just merely have to communicate using the screen on the panel. And should anything become beyond your control, Luxray can immediately regain control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Luxray......here goes nothing.\", you said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing that you can enter Luxray through his reproductive organ, a very bizarre thought surfaces in your mind. It's disturbing yet a strangely welcoming option, you thought. You look at Luxray standing in front of you and notice that between his hind legs are his 'testicles' and 'thing.' Its color is a mix of blue and black with yellow stripes. You stared intently at it, thinking about whether it will make a good point of entry into the Pokemon. After much pondering, you think that checking out Luxray's \"thing\" wouldn't be a bad choice; rather, you think it will be a more novel way of entering the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luxray, I made the decision to enter through your 'reproductive organ'. I think it'll be more tantalizing experience that way.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...That's a very 'straightforward' choice you just made.\", Luxray smirked, \"If you've made up your mind, then you're free to go for it. Just make sure you don't get electrocuted when entering; it will sometimes randomly generate electricity through the walls without me noticing it .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Luxray a polite smile and make your way to his cock. As you walked underneath the Luxray, you couldn't help but notice how massive he really is up close. To you, his paws look more like thick tree trunks and his body is larger than a Wailord. But most of all, his reproductive organ is extremely huge even though it is more than 100 feet above you. From the ground, you stare at Luxray's massive balls, which are about the size of a Pokemon Gym if you're not mistaken. The 'shaft' isn't small either; it is just as massive as the balls. With Luxray's waiting for you, you want to enter it sooner rather than later to be offered<br>\r\nprotection from the dangers in this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you realized a problem:with Luxray standing, his cock is too high up for you to enter into. You voice your concern to Luxray: \"There's a little problem, Luxray. At my current size, I think it is way too high for me to enter your reproductive organ. What can we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the Luxray chuckled: \"That wouldn't be a problem for my \"thing.\" Just wait and see what it can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what Luxray means by that. So you stand underneath him and wait. Moments later, the most extraordinary thing happened. Slowly and gradually, you see the 'shaft' extending itself longer and longer. Although this is a natural function for all Pokemons,  Luxray's organ is  unnaturally long, far longer than it is anatomically possible. You continue to remain where you are as the \"shaft\" lengthens itself toward you. Finally, it became long enough to touch the ground, slightly shaking the earth with a light thud. You now estimate the entire length of the 'shaft' has grown to about 120 feet (from your perspective).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, it'll be far easier for you to enter my cock, isn't it human?\", the Luxray said, \"You can now directly go up in my body to access all the fantastic stuffs. We'll talk more about that later and I hope that you'll enjoy the trip up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look straight up at the humungous blue cock. There is a large,slitted hole situated near the center of the head. Whoa!, you thought, I'll be the first living things to climb into the reproductive organ of a Pokemon; it's unbelievable....You walked toward the slitted hole which looks more like a tunnel at your microscopic size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you entered the tunnel, not knowing what surprises will come next. You back at the entrance of Luxray's cock just in time to see it slowly retracts off the ground and back into its original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk deeper into the 'tunnel', you saw countless veins surrounding the walls around you. To your surprise, there is a solid walk-ramp seemingly made from flexible bones for you to walk on. Occasionally, you see blue, electric sparks pass through them in a pulsating fashion. These must be the electricity that Luxray warned you about so you keep your hands and bodies as far away from the walls as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour's worth of walking, you come toward a three-way split in the tunnel. There is also an organic bulb-like lighting that shines on a little sign mark with the direction and destination of each tunnel:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign is labeled:<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n^   To Trainer's Quarter                                             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;   To the Balls/ Bladder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;   To Central Stomach      </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed at the variety of the destinations listed on the signs. All of them have an equal appeal as the first place to start checking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich route would you take?    <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How did you become so small?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n             \"I dunno\" you say.  \"I was just walking along when suddenly I passed out....when I woke up, I was shrunk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             The Lugia suddenly turns its head to the left as if it heard something.   Then it turns back to you. It.....she....studies you for a long moment before she speaks again.     \"I don't know what caused you to shrink, but this isn't exactly the safest of places.   I have a nest some distance from here.  I was just exploring this part of the world because I haven't been here before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     You then recall that Lugia tend to live by the ocean....but the ocean must be hundreds of miles away!  It must've been flying for most of the day to get here.  Of course, Lugia can fly pretty fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What to you mean by not....\" you start to say, when the Lugia suddenly scoops you up in its mouth and shoots up in the air.  You're able to catch a glimpse of a net being fired from the treeline before you enter the mouth of the Lugia.  You hear a muffled loud curse as the Lugia goes higher into the air.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n                'Sorry....but I didn't want us to be captured by that poacher' said Lugia, her voice coming from inside your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"It's alright\" you say.   \"just don't swallow me.....I really don't want to be digested by a pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  There's a mental chuckle before the Lugia answers you.   \"You needn't worry about that.  I can control all of my bodily functions.  All Lugias can, you know.  So if I do swallow you, you won't be harmed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"....I won't?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               'Nope' said Lugia's voice.  'in fact, you might want to explore my innards.   It's gonna be a long flight back to my home'<br>\r\n               \"Why are we going back to your home?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n              'Because I know someone that might be able to reverse your shrinking that lives near my home' said Lugia.   <br>\r\n                \"Why would  I want to explore your innards?\"  you ask.  <br>\r\n                  'I thought you might like to see what the inside of a pokemon looks like' said Lugia.   'if you return to your normal size, you could write a book about it' <br>\r\n                  The thought of exploring the innards of a pokemon does excite you.     'And besides' adds Lugia.  'there's more inside me than you might think' <br>\r\n               \"Such as?\" you ask.<br>\r\n                  'You'll see' said Lugia, and then she swallows you!    You go down her wide throat and land with a squishing sound in the Lugia's stomach.  </span></div></div>",

The stomach wall around you gave off a reddish glow from the bright sunlight outside. You attempted to stand up in the stomach which proves to be difficult because it is extremely soft. After walking a few steps on the stomach floor, you fell head-first into the fleshy surrounding. Out of precaution against another fall, you crawled along the floor attempting to get a hold of the size of Lugia's stomach; you estimate to be 300 feet in length and width. If you remain quite enough, you can even hear the sound of Lugia's wings gliding against the strong gusts above the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what seems like mere minutes ago, the Lugia told you that there is possibly someone who knows how to make you normal-sized again. Due to your current state, you'll have to trust Lugia to help you; you thought of the awful things that could've happened if you are left alone in the woods at this microscopic size. But being a Legendary Pokemon herself made Lugia an easy target for poachers like the one you just witnessed. The only sure thing you know now is that you and Lugia are safe for the time as the Pokemon continue the long flight toward her nest, hundreds of miles for here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that having way too much up in your head simultaneously isn't really a constructive activity, you explored the stomach as per Lugia's suggestion. Since she said that there are stuffs worth exploring within her, why waste the opportunity? You continue to crawl around the stomach until you found several large holes on one end of the stomach. The discovery sort of shocks you because it completely defies the \"rules of anatomy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats.\", you heard Lugia said boastfully, \"You are about to start your little adventure in me. To begin, there are two places I would recommend you visit first. First, you can take the hole on the left that will  take you to my Eyes. In that area, you can refresh yourself from the constant strain of fleshes and its red color by submerging yourself into my world. You can see spectacular sights like you never seen before. If you want to, I can be a guide of some sort; I can tell you about the stats of anything I'm seeing like cities, Pokemons, islands, etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second place is the \"Water Generation Organ\". In that chamber, you'll get to see how I can convert water vapors or seawater into a drinkable state. in addition to supplying me, you can also use the water both for drinking or washing. When you arrive at this organ, I will tell you the basic process of how Lugias do the impossible feat of making water out of thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a preliminary introduction, how do you think about my innards?\", Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth choices sound extremely interesting. You are having some difficulty in making a firm decision. After minutes of pondering you decide to explore.......</span></div></div>",

Even if somehow you enter the wrong path surely you'll find something interesting! You walk around the stomach and choose one of the holes. Your host surely feels you, because as soon as you get through it you hear her voice in your head. \"If you continue through this path, you'll get to my Water Generation Organ. It is a good starting point for your exploration. I'm a very large Pok\u00e9mon, and seeing how you're tiny, it may take you a while to get there. I'll think try to create something for you to move faster, but it will be ready later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep walking through the tunnel, noticing that despite you're inside another creature, you can see as if you were outside, you could see every detail of your surroundings. You rejoice at this fact, knowing that it means that your journey will be enjoyable and epic. After half an hour or so of walking your path is blocked by a ring of muscle, and you worriedly looked at it trying to find a way to get through it, as it looked much tighter than the ones in the stomach. You put your hand on it and, much to your surprise, it slowly opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room, and look around. It isn't very big, but it has some sort of fleshy cude of transparent membranes. You approach it, trying to find its purpose. You find a hole on the membranes, and enter. Looking closer, you see a small sphincter on the ceiling, barely big enough for you to fit through it, but you can't reach it. There is also a big hole on the floor. You carefully stand on the edge and try to see what is in the bottom. It is pretty deep, so you can't see the bottom. On the other side of the room, there is another hole on the ceiling, and another one directly on the floor under it. Remembering where you are, you ask Lugia for an explanation of this process, not knowing if she will be able to hear you from this point of her body. Surprisingly, she does and you hear her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can obtain drinkable water by using water vapors or seawater. Each one needs a different process. If I choose the first one, I breath water vapors. The oxygen and the rest of the air goes directly to my lungs, while the vapor goes through a different path towards this organ. The vapors fill the cube, until the vapor forms droplets and fall down that hole, to another organ, where I store the water until it needs to be used. You can visit it later if you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I use seawater, I just drink some. My body immediately detects the salt and sends it here, where it falls through the hole on the ceiling and continues through the one in the floor, until it reaches the rest of the water. It has to pass through this room because the walls of the holes can absorb the salt and send the excess of salt to its expulsion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting, I didn't know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many things you don't know about Pok\u00e9mon. Soon you'll know how my whole body works, and what I can do\" Lugia says cheerily. \"There is another path over there. If you go through it, you'll find a hall. I linked the most important or interesting parts of my body there, so you're able to visit them easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and locate the path, until you get to a long hall with many possibilities</span></div></div>",

This Lugia is truly humongous, you thought, but it's innards could qualify as another world itself and you have it entirely to yourself. Because of the sheer number of destinations to choose from, you decided that you should randomly choose a hole to begin your exploration of this gargantuan Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose a hole on the right hand side of the hallway and prepare to move deeper into the vast, fleshy confines. The route was long and winding and extremely soft. At certain locations, you have to crawl or else you risked slipping all the way to the start of the passage. An hour later, you reached another one of those ringed valves that blocked your entrance. As you moved closer, Lugia opened the entrance for you, welcoming the tiny trainer into a new part of the body.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber is dim, with only a soft ocean blue glow being emitted a small hole in the ceiling. When you walked farther in, you noticed that the floor is no longer slippery and slimy, it now feels like your walking on a soft carpet. You looked down and realized that you're walking on some kind of feathered surface. You guessed that it may be the same material as Lugia's coat. A further inspection of the room revealed a circular bed-like structure in the center of the chamber. It's blue and white like the exterior of Lugia. Out of curiosity, you tried to sit on it. It extremely comfortable and soft. You almost felt tired at the moment but the silence was interrupted by Lugia's telekinetic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like the new guest room I made for you?\", the Pokemon inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...yeah, it quite nice.\", you said, \"but how did you know how to create all these kinds of stuffs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have observed humans very often and I'm otherwise very familiar with their habits. I figured that you would prefer the comforts of a conventional room to that of a moist and dark area in my body.\", Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it.\", you said s you continue to look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that there is what seem like another smaller chamber on one side of the room. You entered it to discover a little raised hole in the ground. You went over to inspect it. The hole is too small for you pass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be the bathroom for you\", you heard Lugia said, \"Use it whenever you feel convenient.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..... Got anything else in here?\", you said as you returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you have to look around a bit more.\", Lugia said, a grin evident in its voice.</span></div></div>",

You enter and you're instantly greeted by the outside world, behind what seemed a crystal. Besides, you could hear the sounds of the nature outside, amplified. It is a beautiful sunset, and nothing that Lugia isn't moving, you deduce that your host must be at her nest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a place for you to relax. You may have fun inside me, but I thought you would need a place to sit and do nothing.\" You agree, and decide to spend some time in there. \"You're not in my head, I'm giving you an image of the outside world and sounds with my psychic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have an idea of how I can return to my normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it by myself, but not here. Far from here there is a place where my powers will be amplified and everything will be like before. It will take many days, maybe weeks for me to get there, even if I fly as fast as I can, but I'll make sure you don't get bored easily. I'll go to sleep soon, so I have enough energy to fly nonstop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall you used to arrive here is divided in sections, and each has a sign on the ceiling indicating what surprises await you. The holes that are closer to your guest room are rooms for your normal life, the usual things. If you keep going lower, you'll find holes connected to the most important organs of my body. After that, there are other rooms I thought you may like, and I'm sure you'll be surprised with them. And the last section has many organs that I think will interest you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can there be so many things inside you?\" you ask amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many things you don't know\" Lugia says cheerily \"I may be asleep, but you can go explore whenever you want. The only difference is that you won't have my voice talking to you or guiding you, but I'm sure that you'll still enjoy. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image in front of you dims a little, and you take that as that your host closing her eyes or something. You stay enjoying the sunset until the moon and the stars appears in the sky, thinking about everything that happened in the day. You process everything, and soon you realize that you have a question to ask Lugia, but you forgot. You call your host, hoping that she is awake enough to answer you. Lugia replies, even if the voice sounds like she is close to falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a question that I would like to have answered...then I'll leave you alone.

You moved toward the entrance and into the passageway. As you're accustomed to, the ring of muscle opened automatically at your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls in the tunnel is opaque, lit only by occasional bio-luminescent orbs in the ceiling. Along your way, you can hear Lugia's gentle snoring like a constant companion by your side. You wondered to yourself what might you encounter in this passageway that Lugia has left unexplored and unexplained. Will it be some new chambers? Or a previously uncharted Pokemon organ? Or will it be something else entirely? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're immersed in thoughts, you suddenly bumped against a wall of flesh. You suddenly regained awareness of your surrounding. You looked up to find that you are staring at an entrance far larger than the one; you estimate it to be at least 3 times larger than the one you entered from. A large sign above it has the same \"??????\" on it. Nevertheless, you touched the ring of muscle which opened fairly easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered the area you are greeted by the sight of a vast beach at night time. You can hear the sounds of the ocean crushing against the sands. The bright glow of the moon and the countless shimmering stars in the sky cast a gentle, ambient glow on the environment around you. Out the sea, you can see distant islands that stood out prominently with their tall peaks and dark blue glow under the moonlight. The wind is fairly warm and gentle in here. From your several previous experience with Lugia's other organs, you surmised that this is probably a virtual environment built by psychic powers. Wow, you thought, this Pokemon sure knows a real good scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when you noticed that there is something near the center of the beach. It's a raised stone pedestal in the center with a something on it. In comparison to your current size, the structure appears gargantuan; it felt as if the thing is larger than the Pokemon itself.  As you walked up the pedestal, you slowly make out the shape of a living thing. Something there is bobbing up and down. When you are close enough mere feet away from the thing, you are shocked to find out that it there is a Lugia curled up asleep. The Lugia looks like a perfect recreation of the one that allowed you to live in her body. You quietly went over to the sleeping Pokemon, nearing it's head. It's fur looks so soft to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout knowing, you stroke an area near the edge of its eye. The Lugia stirred a bit before slowly opening her eyes to look at who touched her. When her sight fell upon you, the Pokemon stretch one of its wings and slowly brought you toward an area near its neck until you are comfortably between the wing and body. Lugia curled her head back with her large eye right in front of you. You can see your reflection and your surroundings in the ocean blue orb. But there is something else you can see in there........<br>\r\n<br>\r\neyes</span></div></div>",

Maybe she didn't expect you to find this place this soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the eyes vanish and you start to relax again. Lugia is falling asleep again, and you close your eyes too. Everything around you is pleasant and nice, and it doesn't take long before you fall asleep too, against your will.

There is an organ that works as some kind of storage for my subconscious. I can't keep control of it all the time, so for my own health in the nights, while I sleep, it will be kept there. Normally it adopts the shape of any dream I'm having, but when my mind is completely empty, it displays my surroundings at home or wherever I am and myself sleeping. I want to protect you, so the projections of myself will too. When I'm awake it is completely empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that I saw in your eye? It seemed like...more eyes\" -you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, it is my subconscious, or a part of it. It is made of my life and my experiences, what you saw was the rest of forgotten creatures and other experiences, trapped deep where it can't hurt me or you. If my subconscious weakens and you're there, who knows what may happen.to you. It is not used to have somebody in there, so there will be a risk.\" - she says. - \"I didn't think you would be there so early. I had planned to show it to you later, so I left it unmarked so you could check it later with my protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall silent and don't know what to say. \"I'm going to see what else I can explore before breakfast\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hopefully, you thought, it would be something other than Lugia's subconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached another entrance, it opened up for you to enter. Unlike other locations you encountered so far, this room is looks like one you would find in an ordinary house. It is a \"bedroom-sized\" room that resemble a cross between a living room and a study. Much to your astonishment, the room has a blue and white wood flooring arranged in alternating patterns. The walls are a pale blue that matches that of the sky. To your left, you see a variety of books lined up on a shelve. How could there be books in here?, you thought, Either Lugia likes to gobble up books or the Pokemon has found some ways to make books out of thin air. Given that she is already able to make virtual environment that you can see, touch, and feel, that idea isn't really far-fetched. There is also a small reading desk beside the shelves. On the other side of the room, you see a single cushioned chair that is placed in front of what looks like a large display. You wondered what is the point of having a TV inside a Pokemon since you cannot receive channels or do anything else with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the TV suddenly turned on and started displaying some statics before it revealed a message displayed in bold letterings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"HELLO AND WELCOME TO YOUR PRIVATE ENTERTAINMENT ROOM\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen refreshes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>IN HERE, YOU CAN ENJOY A COLLECTION OF BOOKS THAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR FUN AND SOME OF TV SIGNALS THAT CAN BE RECEIVED WHILE IN FLIGHT</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, you thought, Lugia could write books?

While browsing through the book something falls down and you pick it up. It is several maps inside a envelope, each map and diagrams about a different part of Lugia. Between the mass of organs depicted in the maps, there are many blank parts, however, looking closer, you can see that there are paths leading to those blank spaces. You suppose that those are places that either are new and just for you or places you shouldn't see yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at the other books, and don't see anything special. Books about places of the world, history, and other things, maybe from Lugia's own knowledge. However, you don't feel like reading any of them right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go towards the TV again, and sit on the chair. On one arm there is a set of buttons for communicating with Lugia, and in the other one there is a control for the screen. You mess around until somehow you are able to see channels you had already known and some you like. You're baffled, but you quickly dismiss it. After the few things you have seen inside Lugia you shouldn't be surprised of this!. Normally you would spend a noticeable amount of time in front of a TV, but the novelty of the recent events eliminated any wish you could have of wasting time. You press some buttons again until you reach a channel that you're sure isn't on any broadcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to be a channel you can control, and it seems you can use it to see any part of the world instantly. You play around for an hour or so, seeing places you had never thought you would see. Soon you note that you're very hungry, and you press the buttons of the other arm of the chair. You type about breakfast, and receive a confirmation from Lugia that she already ate and that yours is ready. Lugia offers to guide you towards your eating area, but you tell her that you're able to find it by yourself. You exit the room, and look up and down the hall, and soon find the eating area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mere thought of swimming in urine is revolting to you, yet just few minutes ago that is what you was doing. You cringe at the thought, and try to think about other matters. You feel gratitude towards your host and friend for rescuing you, and you feel guilty for making her think that was her fault. You don't know what to say to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrive to your room, and step into your bathroom, to the part of it that works as a shower. You take of your clothes, and you're instantly doused with water. It doesn't feel like normal water, though, it has a different texture, but there is no doubt that Lugia knows what is better for you. When the bath ends, you are satisfied to see that there is no trace from the bitter smell of Lugia's urine. You go back to the main room and look for a towel in the pile of stuff you had brought from the Store, and find some new clothes, some of them with the blue and white colors you had expected, and the rest are colors you like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the wet clothing, and deciding that you never want to wear them again you throw them through the hole in the bathroom. You have the feeling that they'll end in the same place you visited one hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for this. I didn't think you would go there, much less...eh...it could have been worse, right? I mean, you could have tried to go further in my urinary tract...\" Lugia says awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou apologize to Lugia for all the troubles you caused her, and decide to go to sleep now to avoid getting in more trouble. After all, it was a lot of wine, and its effects are returning. Who knows what you would be doing now if Lugia hadn't called you out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up later than you usually do. Your clock says it is almost noon, and when you focus you can clearly hear the sound of the wind outside. Obviously Lugia is flying again. You get dressed and get breakfast.

You wander through the hall, looking for the green tunnel, but for some reason you can't find it. You focus on the signs over the entrances of the tunnels, until you find the familiar \"??????\" sign. It is over a normal tunnel, pink like the flesh surrounding you, no trace of green. You enter the tunnel and walk. until you reach the end. You open it, and step inside Lugia's subconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is surreal. The room you're in is completely empty, there is nothing, not even walls. All you see is an endless white void. The only object inside is the sphincter you used to enter, just behind you. You walk around it until you're facing the back of it, it is like a thin round wall. When you open it you see a different tunnel, this one different, as you feel a large amount of heat emanating from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the sphincter, and walk around the void. Your steps echo, and you don't see any limits. You deduce that the green tunnel and the images inside Lugia's subconscious only happen when she is asleep...either that or she is making the room empty. You suddenly hear something behind you. Startled, you turn around and see Lugia. She has her normal size, but once again it is like you weren't shrunk. You touch Lugia's head, she closes her eyes and smile, clearly liking your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a long time in the void of Lugia's subconscious, playing with her. From time to time she takes you on her back and fly around, although there is nothing to see, you like to fly. You're having fun, and lose track of the time. You feel tired, but Lugia is still as energetic as always. It is clear she wants to continue playing. You wave at her and walk towards the fleshy disc that is the entrance/exit, still floating in middle of the void. You open the side that lead to the unknown hot tunnel, when Lugia tackles you. She is heavy, so you need time to recover your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to yell \"What are you doing!\", but then you look at her eyes.

With you pinned down by her body which is surprisingly light for a Pokemon her size, there is no way for you to move away. Lugia started moving her head closer to your face, her blue eyes seemed to focus entirely on you with love. You completely froze at the implication she's giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the past few days, I really enjoyed you exploring my interior, trainer. Feeling you traveling through every part of my body gives me a feeling that I have a company with me. I never really had many other Pokemons to talk to because of my relative isolation and the lack of other Psychic Pokemon that for me to communicate with. Before meeting you in that forest, I have very few understandings about humans and their habits. I was just a Legendary Pokemon that soar the skies; something that was merely a myth to those below. But then, you suddenly showed up before me. I realized that this may be my first chance at getting to know one of your kind.....and several days later, I found out that I was right. With you at my side, even though you're a human, this may be the first time that a Legendary Pokemon has this much of a contact and affection for a non-Pokemon, a very good-looking and, frankly, attractive one that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\", you tried to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you felt her mouth touched yours. You closed your eyes in shock. Being kissed by a Legendary Pokemon. This is weirdest experience you ever had. Even though it seemed wrong on so many levels, you find it strangely appealing. Slowly, you opened your eyes and saw Lugia's blue ones right in front of you. You never noticed how beautiful the blue was before, because in your previous visit to her sub-conscious, it was 'nighttime'. This is first time you notice how they sparkle like sunbeams on a rippling ocean. Slowly, you lost yourself in her eyes and unknowingly started to reply to her kiss. You felt her huge lips rubbing against yours. Lugia kissed even deeper. You know that this is merely a creation in Lugia's subconscious, but the experience is very real for you. It was minutes later when you and Lugia finally broke the kiss and look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That was quite......\", you tried to say something but was still speechless from the kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivid?\", Lugia offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering that this is the subconscious, yeah, that makes sense.\", you said, \"So, what should we do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take a little detour from our destination?\", Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A detour? As in taking a detour off to the place where it's possible to restore me back to my size?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. We'll be traveling to a secret island that no humans have been to but I frequented often. I was thinking that maybe we both need some times to focus something else other than this 'restoring-you-to-normal-size' issue. Don't you think that's a great idea. Besides, you can consider this as an 'apology' for my mistake yesterday. And I promise you, you will surely enjoy it more than this encounter.\", Lugia replied, placing an emphasis on her last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the mean time....want to continue down that tunnel you want to enter.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll start flying to the island. We'll be there in an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open again the flat sphincter, and enter the hot tunnel. it was like walking inside a pipe filled with steam. Soon you're sweating, and you're starting to regret your decision. The sphincter wasn't connected to anything, where are you? You look at your clock, wondering what time is it. It is almost 6:00 PM, and while you're wondering how did you spend so long inside Lugia's subconscious, you hit another entrance. You open it as fast as you can, and you're instantly greeted with steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your vision clears, you see a small room, with a hole occuping almost all of it. It has some stairs that descend into a clear hot liquid. Steam is coming out of it, and you descend and touch it carefully. It is seemed hotter than it actually was, it felt very good. Your new clothes seem to be waterproof, so you submerge on the liquid. The hole isn't very deep, barely enough for you to submerge completely. On a side there is a narrow tunnel. You also find out you can breath, despite being underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in what will be your own thermal waters. It is a perfect place to relax, isn't it?\" -Lugia says. cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is perfect\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take this wrong, but this place is inside my salivary glands, so the liquid around you is....\" your host says softly. You find out that you don't care, it feels too good for you to be a bother, you don't care if it is saliva. You quickly tell that to Lugia, and try to relax. You float lazily, and swim around. You feel invigorated, thanks to the temperature. You wonder how you could come back here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nan hour later, you hear Lugia again. \"We're on the island. It is a beautiful place. You'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I said you would enjoy this more than our little encounter we had...do you want to know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. It seems logical to you that you'll spend some time outside. Sure, maybe you could convince Lugia to let you be outside using her psychic powers in that room you had visited before, the one that had transported your body outside while your mind was still inside Lugia. Although you're close to her mouth, you suppose that taking the underwater tunnel near to you will take you to her mouth and to an easy exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she want to do with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply to her...</span></div></div>",

She does, and sticks her tongue outside, so you step outside your host for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is getting dark, but you can see the trees around you.

You are feeling attraction towards Lugia, and it is nice to know she feels it too. But how far will it go? Even if you weren't shrunk, it would be strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia lays her head on the floor before continuing. \"I don't know how to say this...but I asked you to come out of my body so I could see your reaction. I'm happy to see that you agree with my feelings\" she smiles. \"I know nothing definite will come out of this for obvious reasons, but we should make it as good as we can. Listen, I'm willing to have a more intimate moment with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what you're hearing. \"Wait, are you saying we should...uh...mate?\"-you ask nervously, hoping that the answer is no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia laughs. \"Of course not, it would be too awkward, wouldn't it? I mean, you're a human and I'm a Lugia, we aren't even remotely compatible.\" You sigh, relieved. \"No, I mean that I want both of us to have a more intimate experience. It won't go as far as you fear, but I'll make sure it will be something you never imagined you would do with me. Let's call it a...close encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me in my subconscious again. I hope you don't mind, but I think it is the best place for this. I won't be offended if you don't go, it is up to you.\" Without saying another word, she opens her mouth again, and you enter her body again. You manage to get to the hall, and wander around deep in your thoughts. This day was certainly taking a turn you had never imagined, and you didn't know if you liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find yourself in front of the tunnel that leads to her subconscious, and despite everything, you're feeling curious.

The chamber looks substantially different than your previous visits here. You are currently in a cave made purely out of blue crystals. The hung stalactites hung above you like natural chandeliers within a palace. They shimmer with all the spectrum of the rainbow; like guiding lights, the glittering walls draws you deeper into the passage. You can also see through the transparent walls of the cavern toward the sandy beach you were on just moments ago. You noticed that it is a full moon tonight which explains why you can see so clearly in this subconscious world. Walking deeper into the cavern, you eventually reached a larger chamber that resembles a large hall, complete with stalagmite columns. Your footsteps echoes off the walls, creating the impression of sheer vastness. Lugia reclined gracefully in the center and beckoned with her psychic power for you to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she instructed, approaching her massive form with each step. When finally get to her, Lugia looks at you with the same affectionate expression she always wear. \"It seems that you have made your decision.\", the Pokemon said, \"I am truly amazed by your curiosity for me. Tonight, you're going to have some real close encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. This close encounter, what did you mean by that, certainly it won't go too far, right?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Why are you so worried about it? It's not that I'm going to pin you down and start mating or something. Even if I were to do that, this is my subconscious and anything we did here never physically happened. The place you see here is another one of my caves, and the most beautiful one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'll be safe, then.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia stood up and stretch her wings, changing the scenery around you so that it darkens and the ground becomes soft. A large circular bed similar to the one in your personal bedroom materializes. You suddenly shuddered as you felt the feathers of her wings brushing you in very intimate ways. Her blue eye glinted with mischievous affection. As if your mind is on automatic mode, you stretched you hands and started\u00a0plowing your hand into Lugia's thick fur as if brushing them. The Pokemon look down toward you and brought her head closer, nudging and licking your entire body. Her tongue felt warm, slender, and slippery. Each time you managed to look at her between the lickings, you see a wide grin on her face. No doubt Lugia enjoys doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more lickings, kissings, and embracing, you two lie down side by side, exhausted by the intensive play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\", you said, \"I didn't know that a close encounter with you can be so tantalizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But you haven't seen the even more awesome stuffs I have in store for you down there in the reproductive area.\", the Lugia said pantingly, \"Do you want to take a look at it or save it for a later time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A good 10 minutes later, you arrived at a huge sphincter that you estimate to be 40 feet tall. Seeing the large size of the entrance, you dare not to imagine about what will happen if a male Lugia is nearby. The sphincter is currently sealed tight with no obvious way of enticing it to open. At first you touched it like any other ring of muscles you encountered in Lugia, but that didn't work. Numerous other methods are tried like punching, massaging, and bumping but still, the entrance wouldn't budge. Finally, you tried climbing the massive structure to reach the center, where you hope a pinprick hole will allow you enter the uterus. After much slipping and falling,you managed to reach a nook where you can finally stand. Much to your delight, there is indeed a tiny hole for you to enter.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, you entered into the uterus, highly excited about learning a Pokemon's private. The first thing you noticed about the chamber is its auditorium-like size as evidenced by the echo of your voice.

On the structure, you can see many egg-shaped orbs that glows with a fluorescent purple. \u00a0Organic light fixtures that resembles small wall lights emit light blue radiance.

It should help\". you hear Lugia. You obey and walk around, trying to step carefully , so you don't cover yourself with the liquid on the floor. After a while, you find a wide staircase on one of the sides, made of the fleshy materials you are used to see. You climb the staircase, until you reach the top. In front of you there is a walkway. You start to walk slowly, noting that there are no handrails or something that could help you, so you try not to look under you, you have the feeling that falling won't hurt, but still would be scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the structure on the ceiling, which contains the eggs. You enter the structure and look around. You are surrounded by many big orbs, you accurately deduct they're eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, this is the place where I store the base for my eggs. When it is time, my body takes one of these eggs through a chute in the ceiling and transfer them to my uterus, filling it with my own genes. The male will give his genes too, and I'll keep the egg inside my body for near a week before laying it. During that week the egg will multiply it size until it is much bigger than it is right now\". In that moment you note that the egg isn't as big as you thought. You could climb one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new Lugia will be born after many weeks, identical to its parents. I...haven't been part of this process yet, but I hope I will. Mating hasn't been succesful yet, but I'll keep trying\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia finishes her explanation, and you exit the structure. You walk through the walkway again to the staircase and descend back to the floor. \"That is one of the interesting things about my reproductive system. Where do you want to go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alright then, go further down the uterus and you will reach my most personal part, and only you get to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entertained yourself about what is in store for you at your destination. Could it really be the place where you can feel something beyond the physical? After what you've seen in Lugia's subconscious, you wouldn't be surprised if you experience the cosmics. You wasted no time in finding another tunnel in the uterus to take you to Lugia knows what. The tunnel glows with a faint blue color as you crawl into the narrow spacing. The passage makes You wonder about the full potential of Lugia, beyond current understanding about Pokemons. You can feel Lugia giggling on the outside as if she reads your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached the deepest part in Lugia's body, you found yourself in a room that is similar to the personal bedroom you sleep in, but this one is far more elaborate and ornate. The walls are decorated with ancient writings and colorful pictograms that seems to tell storied fables about Lugia's legend and feats. You are sure that you've seen something similar in the museum at Goldenrod City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The bed in the center \u00a0of the room is made of blue crystals save for the mattress and sheets. The beddings are a dark blue with pale white swirls that shimmers like stars. The design felt alive. It would probably feel like resting in vast space if you sleep in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrewn on the soft floor are endless heaps of precious stones, coins, and jewelries. When you take a closer look at them, you can recognized some of them as diamonds with different colors. The rest looks like Matters that are non-existent in the world. Some of them are the most beautiful things you've ever seen. You picked up a gold coin to study it. The coin felt heavy and was minted with designs that you can make no sense of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my private chamber, where I guard all the lost tales about me, all the precious gems I've collected throughout the millenniums, the gold coins of ancient civilizations that worship me, and where you, my dear human friend, will be spending the night with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you are too surprised for words.\", said Lugia with a little laugh, \"Lie down on my bed, it will be so much easier communicating that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bed is as soft as the one in your guest room, and soon you're looking at the ceiling of the chamber, decorated with more carvings and writings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is obvious you're the first human to see something like this. Every legendary Pok\u00e9mon has a chamber like this deep within their bodies, often hidden in places where nobody would look. I had the only entrance in my reproductive area, as I felt it wasn't a place you would visit in your first days. Now I fully trust you, and I'm willing to share with you every secret of my life and powers. Do you want to hear my stories? The chamber is full of them, and every single coin and gem is a reminder of a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know more, Lugia. Let's do it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia starts telling you about her life, since she was born centuries ago. Her voice envelops you, and you almost feel like you're in front of her, looking at her while she tells you about her early years. It is an interesting story, and a few hours later, when you feel you're falling asleep, you wish you could stay listening for longer. In the morning you're back to your guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next two weeks, you keep returning to the private chamber and sleeping there, while Lugia flew to that place where you could return to normal. The stories are long, but Lugia and you link more with every word, and feel closer, much closer than any legendary Pok\u00e9mon has been with a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia lets you keep one coin or gemstone every night, and you soon have a small collection of expensive jewels, meaning that you would be rich when you returned to normal. It is still nothing compared to the treasure inside Lugia's chamber, but you're satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the stories are over, you are amazed of Lugia's experiences. She has told you everything about her life, trusting you with every detail, even those of a more private nature. You return to the private chamber, this time to tell Lugia your own story, not as interesting as hers, but she seems to like it and listens to you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks after the first time you entered the most secret part of Lugia's body, there was no reason to return, at least for now. Lugia said that she was moving the entrance to another part of her body, and that she would tell you when there was something else to say. She isn't going to be upset if you stumble upon it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up. You had been exploring around in these weeks and knew almost every part of Lugia's body, with a few organs left, more precisely, those that you considerated unpleasant or uninteresting. You complete your morning routine, and notice that something is different. You ask Lugia, and soon she replies:</span></div></div>",

One thing I'm sure is that this Pokemon has power on par with mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard Lugia's explanation, you are left to wonder who exactly is this Pokemon. While thinking, you decided to head for the Observation Deck at Lugia's head. It was a location you discovered in your previous week of adventure. It was a huge circular chamber with a 360 viewing window that allows you to get a panoramic view if the area surrounding Lugia. Although you forgot how the Pokemon did this, you remembered her saying something about her eyes having ability to see through the back of her skull and being capable of seeing 20 miles far. Over the last few days, you have used the Observation Deck for various things ranging from sightseeing to stargazing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving there, you immediately began looking at the skies surrounding you for any signs of the legendary Pokemon. At first, there is nothing other than the usual clouds and mists. Then, a bright golden sphere of light appeared on the horizon. You squinted you eyes on the unknown object in an attempt to discern its shape. But all you can see now is a globe of light with a trail of rainbow behind it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, you can see the form of a pair of wings and a long tail. Initially, you guessed that it may be another Lugia, but its body shape is wider and its beak larger and longer. The unknown Pokemon seems to notice Lugia flying near it and turned its direction right toward you. By the time the Pokemon arrived in front of you and Lugia, there is no mistakes that it was a Ho-oh, a rare Pokemon like Lugia herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh's body glistens with various color of light that radiates from its multicolor feathers. The Pokemon look directly at Lugia and you for a full minute before giving a loud screech. Lugia gave a similar lower pitched call in the Pokemon's language.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia sensed your confusion about what they were talking about, so she provided translation for your through telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia, what a coincidence for us to meet again.

It isn't something you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude of you! I was sure you would be nice enough to tell me, but seeing that you don't want to, I'll have to find out by myself.\" At this point, Ho-oh looks directly towards Lugia's eyes, and to an extent, your own eyes. Lugia tries to move, but Ho-oh blocks the way. Soon you hear words again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a different presence here besides yours, Lugia. And it is curious, it feels like it is...inside you.\" he says. You feel Lugia torn between admitting your presence or denying Ho-oh's words, so you take control of the situation. \"Why don't you tell Ho-oh about me, Lugia? Maybe we'll be able to continue if you do\" you tell Lugia. Your host seems indecisive, but then tells Ho-oh about you. She doesn't say a thing about what you have done, just that she picked you up in the forest and wanted to return you to normal. Ho-oh listens curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. A tiny human. I had never heard of something like that before. I'm not sure how I feel about this, Lugia.

I want to help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I at least see the human? I want to make sure you aren't in danger.\" Ho-oh replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the floor under you moving, and Lugia brings you to her mouth using her psychic powers to create a tunnel directly under you. She is annoyed and wants to end this as soon as possible. She sticks your tongue out, and you have the first direct sight of Ho-oh. The legendary bird is smaller than Lugia, but you was still tiny in comparison to him. You can't avoid feeling overwhelmed by the sheer size and obvious power of the Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh looks at you, thinking what to do. He is still unhappy about you, and you clearly see that something needs to be done. You consider telling Lugia to close her mouth, but before you can react...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The look he gave you gave you a bad feeling. His fire red eyes burned into you with laser-like precision. The more the Pokemon looked at you, the more hostile he seems to get. Then, without warning, Ho-oh suddenly grabbed you with his beak and flew out of reach for Lugia. You screamed out loud, knowing that you are now swinging from thousands of feet up from the ground, completely at the mercy of Ho-oh. The sudden movement even caught Lugia off guard, causing her to momentarily fall before regaining her balance mid-flight. After righting herself up, Lugia looked at Ho-oh with both surprise and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh! What is the meaning of this? Give him back to me right this instance.\", Lugia shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ho-oh ignored her plea and stared at her. There is nothing you could do but watch helplessly as the scene unfolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia, you have grown a bit too trusting of humans as I see it. Don't you know what will happen when he reveals all of your legendary secrets? \", Ho-oh said coldly, \"You seem to have forgotten that you are a Legendary Pokemon yourself; you're meant to distance yourself as far away from humans as possible.You are supposed to be mysterious, a mere legend throughout the millenniums and ,in that regard, you have failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the ancient rules alright.\", Lugia said defensively, \"But I believe that this to be an exception. As I told you before, I found this human shrunken and helpless in a forest. I did what I believe to be right and kept him in my body for several weeks already until I can find a way to return him to normal. That's certainly something you haven't done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Ho-oh giving a muffled gasp with you in his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is true, this human knows way too much about you by now.\", Ho-oh replied, \"You are now taking a very dangerous route, Lugia. What if the humans one day decide that they are going to catch you or worse, kill you to obtain your powers? What if this trainer one day decide that it will be in his interest to hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not the case here. Something about him tells me that I can trust this trainer. We've talked with each other for countless times and understood each other. He even admitted to liking me.\", Lugia rebutted, \"Now, give him back to me and leave us be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I cannot do that. Even if that is true, this human still cannot be trusted and is a present danger to you.\", Ho-oh said as-matter-of-factly, \"Frankly, I think you should just forget about this human and move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you can see uncontrolled rage building up within Lugia as her eyes glow blue as she shoots an energy blast in the direction of Ho-oh. The brightness of the beam caused you to close your eyes. As it got closer to Ho-oh, the Pokemon immediately summoned a protective field which completely deflected the beam. Opening your eyes, you see that Ho-oh is unscathed while Lugia is looking at the Phoenix Pokemon menacingly with her still glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, Lugia. Why the hostility here?\", Ho-oh taunted, \"I'm just trying to keep you safe from all humans. Is that how you thank me? You should seriously reconsider the next time you fired at me. I believe you know of my full potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia remained speechless as she briefly looked at you, sadness apparent in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give yourself some time to think about it. I'll be keeping this human for now.\", said Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, the Pokemon tilted his head up and opened his beak, causing you to slide down onto his tongue. He closed his beak, trapping you in darkness as you slide down toward his slimy throat. You felt yourself falling toward the chasm, but you fainted from disorientation before you landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ho-oh is sure that the human is securely imprisoned within him, he gave his wing a quick flap and flew away, leaving a shocked Lugia behind to figure what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Now you are at the mercy of anotherPok\u00e9mon, who clearly is hostile towards you. You seem to be in a big organ, and looking back to the few facts about anatomy you know, and the fact that Ho-oh leans more towards having the organs of a bird in his insides (compared with Lugia, who had more known organs), you deduct that you must be in Ho-oh's gizzard. Knowing the danger, you crawl until you're leaning on the wall, and try to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is obvious that Ho-oh is a problem. Now you're trapped inside him, and looking around, you know what is the biggest difference between him and Lugia. While Lugia's stomach was completely empty, a sign that she didn't want to hurt you, Ho-oh's gizzard has some pools of strange liquid around, acids you suppose, a clear sign that he doesn't care about what happens to you, if you die or not. You have to be careful if you want to live, but you're confident you'll be able to. You're still anxious, though, and think about Lugia, and what she could do to help you. You spend a long time there, watching the walls drip acids and trying to be in a dry area. Soon you hear Lugia's voice in your head. You're stunned, you must be miles away from her yet she still can communicate with you? You try to reply, and you are relieved that it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a connection. I can feel where you are, and I guess Ho-oh didn't let you out. I have a plan.

I'm inside him!\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh doesn't have any psychic powers. He won't know. Are you okay? Is there any danger for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to her your current situation, making emphasis on your location inside Ho-oh. Lugia tells you to put your hand on the wall, and you obey. Soon you feel an energy going through you and into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm passing my powers through you. This will weaken Ho-oh, not enough for him to be inoffensive, but enough for him to be forced to land. While he is weak I can reach him and fight, but I don't promise I'll win. He is much stronger than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can we do?\" - you ask, not knowing what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I see it, there are two options\" - Lugia replies.\"The first one is that you could try to escape by yourself from Ho-oh's body. Don't ask me how, I don't know. Explore around and find a way. After you're out, I can use our connection to find you. I'll be able to find you, it doesn't matter where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I don't know. From what I see there are only...three paths here in the gizzard, not including the way I came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second option is that you wait inside Ho-oh until I reach him. I'll fight him, but as I said he is stronger, and due to your size I don't know how you could help me. But you'll find a way, I know\" - Lugia says. - \"Please tell me your decision, I have to stop the connection, this is weakening me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder as quick as you can. Escaping by yourself sounded hard, as you didn't know where to go. and the second option, a fight, well, sounded more exciting, but you wanted to help and make sure that Ho-oh lets you out, and seeing your size you are clueless.

Compared to Lugia's \u00a0palatial and beautiful interior, Ho-oh's innard is far darker and more organic, bearing more resemblance to an actual body. Determined to make it out of this 'prison' alive, you tried taking one of the three paths available to you. The tunnel you took climbs at a steep grade and is made worse by the fact that virtually every surface in here is covered in slime. You constantly slipped and fall head over toes trying to stand straight. Thinking that you might eventually bruise your entire body, you resort to crawling on your belly, advancing inch by inch toward the place the tunnel takes you. After painstakingly moving up for forever, you finally saw lights above you. It was a welcomed sight for you. This must be another opening in Ho-oh from which you can use to escape it. Reaching the ledge of the tunnel, you stood up and started running toward the source of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of your joy to supposed freedom, you suddenly bumped your head against something hard. You fell on your back recoiling in pain as if a sledgehammer struck your head. You also hear Ho-oh giving a loud screech, apparently sensing you attempted escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think I would be foolish enough to let you easily escape me, little human?\", Ho-oh said chuckling, \"I have already closed off all the possible exits you could take. And for your information, you aren't even at an opening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh laughed mockingly at your failed escape.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you make it out, are you really stupid enough to jump from millions of feet up in the atmosphere, human?\", Ho-oh chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou right yourself up and looked around you. True to his words, you realized that you are in fact in a small chamber. The thing you bumped your head into is one of two large openings with a thick layer of slimy glass-like film covering its entirety. You can see Ho-oh's wings along with his beak here. You tried\u00a0to touch the surface of the stuff again which caused the chamber to momentarily darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\", Ho-oh screeched, \"Hey! You better stop doing that to my eyes or else I'll make things even more miserable for you like sending you down there for \"cleaning duty\" or......Back to topic, since you managed to get here.....why don't we have a little chat while I indulge in some 'joy-flying', human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the entrance behind you sealed shut and disappear completely.

Not that you have another option, haha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, trying to see a weak spot from the cords. It is impossible, so you decide to pay attention. Maybe you could talk and convince him to let you out. No, not even in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humans are a painful species. It is true there has been some progress thanks to your people, but at what cost? You all are too far from your original purposes, living peacefully with every other living being, included us legendaries! I don't mean that Pok\u00e9mon battles should stop. What people does is collecting Pok\u00e9mon, just to keep them in some place while only a few are free to fight. And most of times, they're released back in the wild! I have seen many Pok\u00e9mon getting caught, having illusions of being useful but then getting released, without even being part of a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened to me too. I was rather interested on being part of this, the human that caught me didn't seem bad. The first thing was filling that Pok\u00e9dex thing with my information. Then the next thing I remember is spending months in a field, far from my trainer, under the supervision of some human scientist, a professor. It wasn't that bad, but I was hoping that my trainer would return and finally take me to battle. He came back, but the only thing he did was releasing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left, and returned to my normal life. Again, a free legendary. But I was very upset that I was discarded, I'm one of the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon and was only caught to fill a Pok\u00e9dex. From that moment I made sure that the other Legendaries knew about this. From then some have been caught, and some has stayed with their trainers, battling. Others was released, but so far I'm the only one to resent that. And finally, a few was caught, and then <i>victims of experiments</i>. That was the last thing I wanted to hear. I promised myself that I would make sure humans would stay away from the legendary Pok\u00e9mon. And I managed to convince the rest. That many decades ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked for a long time, and everybody was satisfied, until you was shrunken and Lugia found you! I wouldn't have minded if the only thing she did was changing you to normal, but she had to tell you about her, show you her deepest secrets, and be excessively close to you! I had never thought it would happen, and I doubt that you would have acted like you did if you had stumbled upon Lugia in your normal size! Surely you would have at least tried to catch her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh stops, clearly needing to breath. You observe, and note that Ho-oh is descending. Lugia's powers had worked. Ho-oh landed, and continued talking. Another thought crossed your mind, you don't know what you would had done if you had your normal size and found Lugia. You didn't want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm keeping here with me until I make sure that you'll not approach a legendary. I want you to stay away, and to forget that you encountered Lugia, and forget everything you had seen and heard. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I do. I...that was a very tiring and kind of clich\u00e9 speech, you know\" - you say, before being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. I don't know how long you'll be within me. It depends on how much do you know. The more you know, the longest and hardest your life will be. Let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore cords tie your head, and you are forced to stay there while you feel pulsing through the cords. They keep constricting your head, until you're finally free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you have seen too much! Now I know everything you had done inside Lugia, and I don't like it!\" -Ho-oh yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace yourself for the impact of Ho-oh's words. Surely he is about to say what he'll do with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't expect any commodities here! You'll have to do stuff for me, keep my body working, and help me to complete my body processes. After I consider you had enough punishment, I'll take you to the shrine and return you to normal. Then you'll go away from us forever! Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're kind of scared. You don't like the sound of it. Ho-oh is definitely somebody to fear.\"I have to escape soon, how long will I resist?\" -you think. Then you have an idea. \"I may as well, do what he says. In some moment, he'll be careless, then I'll escape. It is matter of time. I just have to wait for the opportunity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Ho-oh. I understand.\" -you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You'll be going to your room. No bed for you, but at least you'll be warm, I'll make sure of that. Or maybe, <i>too</i> warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh opens a passage near you. You look at it, and decide to start your plan. Knowing what you'll be forced to do could help, but being in the place where you'll do your new work would be good too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, I would like to ask a question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Just one\". -he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, I have to remind you that you will need to do more than that to please me. I'm still not forgiving about you knowing about the secrets of the legendaries..... Listen up, I have planned out a system that might work out. During your time in my body, you will have to continuously maintain my body and obey every one of my commands if you want to live. After completing a task I assigned you, you will be given stone tokens, with the amount depending on the type of work you've done. After collecting a certain amount, you can use those tokens and exchange them for free time, food, and other things. If you failed to perform my order, you will be fined heavily. Any attempted escape will be ground for two days in the bowel. How that sound, huh? DO you accept it?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to take in Ho-oh words. Although you dislike the idea of having to serve your captor, there is little choice but to comply. Secretly, you hope Lugia would quickly find Ho-oh eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I accept it. Now, tell me how should I start?\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is one brave answer from you, human. Since you're so eager to start work, why don't you start by cleaning out the grime from my eyes. They are giving me lots of blurry visions and pain lately.\", Ho-oh said in a dominating voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better start now, human, or else you're sleeping in the intestines.\", Ho-oh commanded as he released the cords on your feet, allowing you to finally stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the two eye panels in front of you. Both at least 35 feet tall and with thick slimy dirt and debris that accumulated around the edge. The rest of the pane is filled with smudges and dust. In some places, you could barely make out the blurred view of mountains and cliffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how am I going to clean them? It's too tall for me!\", you exclaimed, \"This is just---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\", the Pokemon barked, \"You'll be provided with the necessary tools to do your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long cords similar to the one that tied you up dropped from the ceiling and circled itself around your waist. A sponge-like object materialized on the floor which you picked up. The cord lifts you to the very top of the chamber right next to the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start cleaning!

The dust and the smudges are very adhered to the surface of the eye, and in some points you have to rub harder to remove them, making Ho-oh yelp in pain. You feel a strange satisfaction every time your host expresses his discomfort, but you don't do it often. The edges of the eye are the hardest parts, as you have to practically squeeze the sponge between the surface of the eye and whatever tissue is up there. Debris and other things fall on you, and you soon are as dirty as the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cord tied to you lowers itself gradually, so your only work is to rub. While you're cleaning, you start planning your escape. You have a few ideas, but none of them seems good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is sure is that I won't escape through the eyes\" you think. Soon you have cleaned half of one of the eyes, and can see outside. Ho-oh seems to be trying to fly, but it doesn't matter how hard he tries, he seems to be unable to fly. \"That is a good sign. Where are you, Lugia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish one eye, and the cord instantly lifts you again to the top of the chamber, next to the other eye, you start the process again, feeling your arms tired. You lose speed, and worry that you may not finish in time. When you less expect it, Lugia talks to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you, Lugia? I'm still here, my only progress was bumping against the eyes.\" -you say in your mind, sounding annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry. I can see Ho-oh, but there was an unexpected problem while I was coming. Poachers in a ship. I was shot and stunned, and they used a strange machine on me. Now I have some sort of chip on my skin. I managed to escape, but now I can't use any of my powers besides telepathy and similar. I can't remove this chip by myself, it is on my back, my wings can't reach it, and it is ingrained to my skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be a Pok\u00e9mon or something to help you!\" you think desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. This is Ho-oh's territory. In this island...we're the only two living beings. The nearest land is miles away, and I don't want to stay too far from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what can we do?\" -you're almost crying. You had hoped for a quick rescue (with Lugia distracting Ho-oh in a fight, escaping could have been easier), but now you were in deeper trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still fly. Two options: you escape, I pick you up and we fly away as fast as I can. Or...you convince Ho-oh to let you out.\" -Lugia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain that there is no way Ho-oh will let you go. You're done with half of the other eye, and you get an idea. From your point, you can see Ho-oh's beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could escape while Ho-oh is sleeping, right? Through the beak\" you say, excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is worth trying.\" -Lugia ponders. \"I'll stop the conversation. I'm tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Lugia left you by yourself. Soon you're done with the eyes, and you notify Ho-oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took way too long, human. Three hours and half is an excessive time for such a simple task!\"-you hear him yell. You are terrified. \"I should punish you for your inefficiency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. You have no tokens, so being fined isn't an option. Would that mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Am I sleeping...on your colon tonight?\" you mutter. Ho-oh doesn't say a thing for some seconds, then talks. \"I would say yes, but I forgive you this one time, just because this was the first task and you did a nice job. Next time I won't be so forgiving! It will cost you fifty tokens to calm me if this happens again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief. The hole in the floor opens again. \"Now go to your room! I'll let you out when it is time for your next task. You're not a bad cleaner, I may as well command you to clean other parts of my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump into the hole, and fall to the smallest chamber you have encountered since you was shrunken. There is almost no space, and it is empty, just a pile of ten stones on a side, tokens for your work, you guess. It is also very hot, and soon you're sweating. You lay on the floor, and think. Waiting for Ho-oh to sleep...and then exit through the beak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay in your room for an hour. Your clock says it is already dark outside. You hear Ho-oh calling you again. \"Human, time for your second task! Go through this hole!\" A tunnel opens on a side, and you enter, not having any options. You had taken a decision.</span></div></div>",

The tunnel Ho-oh created stretched on for some time. When you reached the end of it, you find yourself looking at a pair of large skeletal joints that are connected to a thick beam of spine. The other end of the joints extended all the way to the walls until they disappeared into the flesh.\u00a0The joints are moving in synchronization with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, human. You are now at the point where my wings connect with my body.\", Ho-oh said, \"I want you to do a quick check to see if there is something wrong with the joints. Ever since capturing you, I've had a very hard time flying. Since I'm currently on the ground, give it a quick checkup and report to me if anything is wrong. Understand, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\", you answered confidently. Secretly you are laughing at\u00a0Ho-oh for failing to realize that Lugia has drained some of his powers. You decided that you should pretend to check on the joints and bones for problems. You started by surveying the sockets, they are huge; easily the size of large trucks. You checked the veins and tendons that connects them, making sure that you are doing a convincing job for Ho-oh. After looking at the spine and cartilage for a few more minutes you report your finding to your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I could see, there is nothing wrong with your wings or bones. I tried to check for some types of injury or strain, but there are nome. I think you are just exhausted from all the flying.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, human?\", Ho-oh replied, \"Then, I guess I'm just a bit over sensitive this time. I know you wouldn't have the nerve the sabotage my body. If you do get such ideas, in that case, you will endure the worst of my wrath and I will enjoy every moment of it..... Alright, enough talk, return to your room and get some sleep. You're getting five tokens for your effort. I'm getting some rest, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you momentarily shivered at Ho-oh's mention of his worst wrath, you take comfort in knowing that you managed to outright fool a Legendary Pokemon. Ho-oh's inability to intercept psychic signals also played a role. Once you returned to the room, you lie down and wait for the right moment to initiate your plan. Soon, you feel Ho-oh positioning himself for sleep and later, you can only hear soft snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and started moving carefully and slowly through the passage to the eyes. There are times when you have to stop out of fear that Ho-oh woke up. When you got to the chamber where you were tied up, the surrounding is now very dim due to Ho-oh's closed eyes. There is only a sliver of pale light coming in. It's a good thing that there is moonlight today. You tried to look around for the passage into the beak, feeling the rushing of air around you as the Pokemon snores on. Using the direction of the wind, you located a small hole large enough for you to crawl through between the eye panes. The ground eventually became hard like plastic and you could see lights ahead. You are just moments away from freedom. The wind in here is particularly strong. After crawling for a minute or two, you reached an opening in the beak. You lift your head out and felt normal cool air for the first time in hours. You smiled and laughed. Looks like Ho-oh isn't that much of an intelligent Pokemon after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the beak moved and you turned back to see....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the corner of your eye, you barely see a white and blue head, peaking from behind some trees. You recognize it as Lugia, and she starts approaching slowly, not noticing that Ho-oh is awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen reality hits you, and the moment is gone. Ho-oh lifts his head and launches you to the air, while you spin in the air, you note Lugia is going back to the trees. You reach your highest point, and you start to fall to Ho-oh's open beak. The impact against the tongue leaves you stunned, and you barely note when you're swallowed. You are disoriented until you crash against the floor somewhere. You look around, and recognize the avian stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you human! What was you doing outside my body?\" Ho-oh yells. You try to think, but not a single convincing lie comes to you. \"I-I-I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You was trying to escape, and I won't tolerate that kind of actions! You should be glad that I didn't kill you when I captured you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your head, intimidated by your captor's fury. \"Do you remember what I said I would do if you tried to escape? You just earned two days of punishment in my bowels! You'll sleep there, and when you're not needed you'll stay there until I call you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to convince him to forgive you, you tell him you will do anything to avoid it. \"No chance, human. You don't have fifty tokens. Now go to the other side of my gizzard and enter through the lowest hole.\" he commands you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you walk, avoiding the pools of acid and half-digested mush. There is a bigger amount than the first time, and this reminds you that you haven't eaten since the morning. You locate the hole, and manage to sneak through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start walking human! I'll tell you when to stop.\" -you hear the order. Not wanting to make things worse for you, you obey. After a few minutes, you're optimist about your punishment. The small intestine is almost spotless. And it doesn't smell different than any other place you have seen within Ho-oh. \"Maybe being down here isn't that bad\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of walking, you're starting to worry. The intestine is still clean, but you are afraid Ho-oh will make you walk deeper into his bowels. You're relived when Ho-oh talks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Go to sleep now. You'll need to rest.\" you happily obey. You search for the softest spot, and lay down. You try to sleep, but a few minutes later you notice that you have moved from where you was. You go back to your point and lay down, but a few minutes later you had been dragged down again. After this happens again, you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing awake, human? Sleep, you won't be allowed to rest when you're working.\" -Ho-oh says. You explain the situation. \"What did you expect? My body still has to process while I sleep. Sooner or later you'll arrive to the place you deserve. I would had made a shortcut to my colon, but I didn't think you would be stupid enough to try to escape\" - he says with clear malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resign and try to fall asleep as fast as possible, you don't want to be conscious when you arrive to the large intestine. The natural movements of the bowels are relaxing, and you finally manage to fall asleep. You only remember waking up for a few seconds, the enough time to note that you're still in the small intestine, and see a large sphincter, approaching at a steady pace. You black out again, hoping it is a dream.</span></div></div>",

You tried to move, but you find your hands and feet tied by cords on the floor and wall. Flailing you arms and legs had no effect on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you are awake now, human.\", Ho-oh said, \"I tied you down just to make sure you won't try to escape again.

You got four hours to finish you job.\u00a0And to prevent you from attempting another escape, I'm putting something that I can locate you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cords around you loosened and you plopped down into a puddle of white liquid. You felt something wrapped itself around your wrist and tightened itself. When you looked at it, you discover that it is a piece of flesh that has attached itself to your body. It made itself into a watch-like device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing on your hand is a locator. If you tried to leave my body, I will know at once. It also functions as your clock, timer, and token recorder. One more thing, if you did something wrong, I can discipline you with electric shock with that locator. Now, off to work, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting onto your foot, you started with the wall by removing the droppings on them. As you pried the slimy fece off, you can see the digested remains of berries, fruits, and plant parts in them. The smell got worse the more dropping you cleaned off. In a matter of minutes, a small hill has formed on the ground. You carried a heap of the stuff and take them to the end of the intestine. Along your way, you see that you have more places to clean. A five minute walk later, you reached a large closed opening on the ground. This must be the anus, you thought. You threw the waste into the recessed hole and returned to get more. The process repeats itself several hundreds time along the length of the large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work is grueling and labor-intensive but somehow, you managed to finished your job thirty minutes ahead of the deadline. You are now covered completely in droppings and smell just as bad. You called out to Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An adequate effort, finishing 30 minutes earlier than expected. So you can be a useful human after all. For your effort today, you will be given 25 tokens, but they will be used to pay off your fine. You got 25 tokens more to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you saw your reward deducted toward the fine. You started walking away from the anus to return to your sleeping place. Out of the corner of your eye, you noticed another tunnel that split off from the large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you going to take it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I cleaned every inch of this place, I should have a small reward at least.\". With that thought you decide to distract yourself from your situation by exploring around. You enter the tunnel and try to deduce where it would lead. There are no clues on the walls, but this tunnel seems to be part of the intestine, as there are marks of waste along the way. Deeper into the tunnel, the path seems more clean. You keep walking, looking at the locater. You also take your human clock off, seeing that you won't be needing it. Ho-oh must have noticed your movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, human?\" he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to explore around. It is okay, right? I'm still in your bowels, or at least pretty near to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh seems to think for a second, before replying. \"Okay, go around. You're free to explore my colon as much as you want, as long as you don't go anywhere else without my permission.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you aren't breaking any of Ho-oh's rules, you continue your path. There isn't much to see in the tunnel. When you start seeing finally the end of the path, you are forced to stop. \"Enough, human. This is as far as you can go. One more step and you'll be disciplined with an electric shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is over there, Ho-oh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see by yourself later, human! Get back to my intestine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely don't want to experience the pain of being shocked, so you turn back and start walking back. Along the way, you notice something that you hadn't seen before. There is a patch of swollen tissue on the floor, almost as big as you. You crouch and observe, and then gather courage to touch it. It feels scaly, very different than the texture of the flesh around you. \"What are you doing? That doesn't feel good.\" you hear Ho-oh. You press the patch harder, and Ho-oh lets a pained yelp. \"Stop that now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, and continue your way. Along the way, you think about that. \"I could take advantage of this on some way or other...\". You have a sudden burst of inspiration. \"This could work for a escape.\" you think. Of course, after the events of last night, you decide to be more careful, and to spend more time planning, until everything is perfect. You arrive back to the colon. To your left you can barely see the anus, now empty the space near it. Not having anything else to do, you walk and sit on the floor near this area, as you suppose that soon the rest of the intestine will receive more waste, and you hope it'll take a long time before that waste arrives to your actual point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think until the locater on your wrist says it is noon. You have a general plan, one that might actually work. It will take some days to complete, but you're confident it'll work. So far you think about using multiple distractions at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia fighting with Ho-oh could be one, and causing pain using that sensitive point in the tunnel could be another.\" You plan to place your human clock on the patch, then program any function of it to vibrate in a few days and cause pain. Hopefully Ho-oh will send you to check what is wrong, and then...\"I leave the locater there so Ho-oh thinks I'm working, and then I look for a way out.\" You frown, realizing the main obstacle for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to break the locater, so it isn't adhered to your wrist. Your hands are unable to do it. And you have only the rest of the day and tomorrow to do it and leave the human clock on the patch, as you won't have an excuse to return to this part of Ho-oh's anatomy after your punishment is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted. \"Human! I have noticed you have been in the same place for a while. You aren't planning to get out through my back door, are you?\" You say you was just resting. \"Doesn't matter. You won't starve to death, come and eat something. I don't care if you don't like it, you'll eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, and look for a path. Ho-oh shows you where to go, and soon you're in front of another entrance.</span></div></div>",

The chamber looks like the stomach you were initially in but it has a lot more features. There are several large tank-like structures the lined one side of the room. They have some degree of transparency enabling you to see that there are substances in them. The sound of liquids churning about echoes throughout the room. You can see large fleshy tubes that are connected to all of the tank, ending at a lone platform in the center.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked your way toward the center. When you got on the platform, the flesh suddenly transformed and grabbed you. The floor around you bend and distort. As you learned before, any attempted struggling will only make things harder for you. There is nothing you can do but submit yourself to the legendary Pokemon's plan. In a few moments, a chair materialized along with a small table. Tendons from the chair are holding you in place firmly. You hear Ho-oh's voice ring out from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well human. Welcome to your eating area. Those tanks you see there are where my food supplies are preserved. The things I ate will go through my stomach first to be processed and sent here. Those foods are usually meant only for me. But since I have to keep you imprisoned for a long time to come, I'll have to share some of them with you.\", the Pokemon said, \"In case your wondering, those will be the food you'll be eating; if your don't like them, well too bad they will be the only thing you'll be getting here. Also, since you are still on punishment, you can only eat low-grade food today. And yes, it'll cost you 1 token for this meal. Please put your 'locator wristband' on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ho-oh said that, you places your left hand on the table. You see the display indicating that a token\u00a0has been deducted from your account. A tube came down from above to the front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you lunch, human. You will find my own\u00a0food mix to be the most delicious.\", Ho-oh said, \"I've combined berries, fruits, meats, and various plant leaves to make it nutritious for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could complain about the content of your lunch, the tube latched itself onto your mouth, sealing it completely. Then, you saw liquid contents starting be pumped toward you. You closed your eyes, dreading the flavor of Low-grade food mix. The moment the mush landed in your mouth, you believed that you have tasted the most repulsive thing you've ever known. It's sour and at the same time extremely bitter. You wanted to gag from the taste but the food kept on pumping down your throat. You believe that Ho-oh is probably enjoying every moment of this force feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a torturous 3 minutes, the flow finally subsides. The tube detached from your mouth and returned to the ceiling. There are still some remnants of the mush in your mouth,causing you to cough in reflex. A slight burning sensation lingers in your throat. Ho-oh snickered at your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you didn't quite like low quality food here, human.\", Ho-oh said, \"You better be thankful that I didn't feed you my refuse. If you want something better, you better start showing me your best behavior from this point on. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly said \"yes\", feeling pretty much sick and disorientated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that the food problem is solved, it's time to continue your next assignment: Go back up to my eye chamber. You'll be attending some private lessons.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It isn't like you had other options, though. You look for a way out of your eating area, and try to remember how to get to the eye chamber. You knew practically nothing of the paths inside Ho-oh's body, and didn't want to get lost inside such a hostile captor. You decide to ask Ho-oh for directions, and much to your surprise, he does guide you. You sense that he is bothered by your lack of knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrive to the place you are looking for. The two eyes are as bright as you had let them yesterday, and much to your relief, Ho-oh is still in land. You wonder for how longer he'll be calm about this. Looking around, you note a difference. Now you can see some sort of table in middle of the room, illuminated by the light from outside. There is nothing on the table. You stand near it, and wait for Ho-oh to tell you what these private lessons are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen: you're going to be inside me, and I expect you to serve me well. You won't be able to do it if you don't know about my past, my body and how I work. You'll attend these lessons every afternoon, unless there is something more urgent. You'll have to memorize everything I say, as I won't say it twice. I'll check your progress with a test at the end, depending on what I'm teaching you. Understood?\" -you hear the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\". It isn't as bad as you think it could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh somehow deposits a few sheets of thin paper-like tissue on the table. Looking at them, you see any diagrams and maps oh parts of Ho-oh's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to memorize every path. I won't give you directions to any other part of my body, you have to learn to move by yourself. If you don't arrive quickly to the place I tell you, you'll receive punishment in the form of electricity thought the locator on your wrist.\"- Ho-oh says. You groan at this, as you feel that this is just another excuse to make you suffer. Why couldn't he open the paths for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start checking the maps. It is a tangled mess of lines and blots, and at first you don't seem to understand them. Time passes, and the chamber starts to get darker. Soon it gets too dark for you to distinguish between the many paths inside Ho-oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough time, human. Now I'll check how much you learnt\".-your host says \"It is an easy enough task: you'll get back to my colon by yourself. I won't help you in any way. You have one hour to get there, or you'll experience how being shocked feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display on your locator blinks, and you see the hour starting. You run towards the entrance of the eye chamber, and try to remember the correct paths. In your mind Ho-oh's body seems like a labyrinth, so you're a bit nervous. After running through endless tunnels for half an hour, you're in front of a sphincter that could lead to your goal. You breath deeply, in case you're right and you're received by the foul air inside.</span></div></div>",

You became slightly nauseous and started gasping for more air, only to exacerbate the smell. You walked into the tunnel just as the sphincter began to reseal itself. Without any doubt, you have arrived at Ho-oh colon. You heaved a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"41 minutes. Considering this is your first time traveling down alone, it's quite fast.\", Ho-oh said, \"You have memorized your lesson well, human. Right now, I'll be up flying soon after such a long time on ground. Until I give you your next assignment, take your brief rest now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear struck you, Ho-oh will be flying soon? How is this possible? Didn't Lugia mentioned that the power drain will take days to recover? You heard muffled sounds of feathers flapping followed by momentary weightlessness. The two possibilities you can think of are: the effects of Lugia's power drainage is starting to wear off or Lugia badly underestimated Ho-oh's power; after all, they haven't really encountered each other for centuries. The ground in the colon shakes violently as the Pokemon spread his wings for takeoff. Although flying and falling numerous time, Ho-oh managed to propel himself upward with more efforts. As the Pokemon soared high, you can feel a constant rumble beneath you. You started to get worried about Lugia since she still has difficulty flying and telepathy severely limited by the energy absorbing device. How is she right now?, you wondered. Will she be able to find me soon? Oh no! Does this mean that Lugia is left behind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to be overwhelmed, you heard a weak voice in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I never realized that Ho-oh has dramatically improved his own stamina.\", Lugia's voice said., \"Things are getting out of control now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now? With Ho-oh now up flying, we would be out of contact range soon!\", you said panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. I'm more worried about you. Looks like we might have to use some more extreme measures to deal with him.\" ,Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extreme? As in attempting to kill Ho-oh?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What we're going to do will be far more different. Listen here. I'll have to make it brief. We're going to lose connection very soon...According to legend, it was said that a human is potentially able to assume direct control of a Pokemon when they are within their body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The method differs from each Legendary Pokemon. Once the necessary steps are done, the human will be able to control the Pokemon as if it were a car or a plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I be able to do it?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The methods are lost to time. But try looking.......I believe....you'll find it......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe connection between you and Lugia weakened and broke off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat and reclined yourself against the wall thinking about the intensive task that Ho-oh will give you. Occasionally, you would see remnants of digested food flow down from the ceiling and through other tunnels elsewhere; all those will eventually end up at the anus you visited last time. You closed your eyes to take as much rest as possible.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*25 minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, human. I've got a new task for you.\", Ho-oh's voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly woke up from your sleep and make sure that you're ready for whatever the Pokemon demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Remember that tunnel I showed you earlier where I asked you to turn back?You are now permitted to enter that area.

You seem to be lucky, as you are able to find it. You enter the tunnel, and try to get over with this quickly. Soon you reach the swollen point you had seen before, and you realize that the destination is near. The tunnel seems to get brighter with every step, and soon you're in a small round room, seemingly filled with many screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're going to have a bigger part for now. I had to get to another place, but due to not being able to fly I have less time to waste. I'm going to fly as fast as I can, I'll need to concentrate on that, meaning that I would be unaware of everything around me. This is where you enter, human. You'll keep an eye on every screen. They are showing what is around me in every direction my eyes can't see. If you see anything I should be aware of, you must tell me. Got it?\". Ho-oh explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mutter a few words of agreement, and look for a place where you can watch every screen at the same time. There is no place, so you find out you'll need to keep moving. It is already dark, and you're starting to feel sleepy. There is nothing outside, just clouds and sky. There isn't anything or anyone, not even Lugia. You feel hopeless, and think about what she had said about a way to control Ho-oh. So far you hadn't seen anything that could point to it or anything that isn't normal, besides that odd point you had seen before. You don't know if it is a room or what it is, and you don't know enough about Ho-oh's body to have a theory. You leave it aside, and try to think of other possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some moment, you fall asleep. You're awaken by a violent shock, coming from your locator. You yell in pain, and Ho-oh laughs at your pain. \"Stay awake, human!\". You decide to distract yourself, and think about how you could leave Ho-oh's body while you're controlling him. Maybe you could make him stop so Lugia can dominate him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Ho-oh finally tells you that he'll rest. \"You can go to sleep now.\" he says. You don't say a thing, and just walk all the way back to the bowels. Once you're there, you look for the cleanest place you can find, and settle down there. Before you fall asleep, you try drastic measures and grab some of the slime of the intestine to try to make your hand slippery enough to remove the device on your wrist. After a while of trying you have progressed, and now it is stuck on your hand, like a clamp. You hope that it doesn't hinder your performance in whatever tasks there are tomorrow.  You fall asleep, but you note the cords appearing around you, just like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To save time and get over with this quickly, you decide to visit the palces in order, starting with the head and descending deeper into Ho-oh's body until you're done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're going towards your first destination, you write everything you know about Ho-oh's digestive system, in case he intends to check your notes when it is over. You already spent much longer that you wanted in those parts of his body, and didn't intend to return to any of those places in the next few days. Yu also examine the maps, trying to find any clues as to where the controls to Ho-oh could be located. There are many promising voids on the maps, but there are still mny options. You expect to explore them, after you remove your locator. Ho-oh wouldn't react nicely if he finds out that you're walking around without his permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive to the first of your destinations, and the most obvious place for the Control Room, the brain.

The walls of the tunnel resembles frosted glass, allowing you to see many of the other off-limit chambers in the brain. After looking around for a while, you continued on toward your intended destination. The room you entered has pink, translucent shelves arranged in a sunburst pattern with a lone table at the center of the room. On the shelves are block-like objects that are color-coded and marked with a written language that you can't understand. You curiously touched one of the blocks only to receive a light jolt from the locator. You withdrew you hand and yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\", Ho-oh barked, \"Don't you touch anything before I explain them, human! Even though this is the only part of my brain you are free to visit anytime, some information are still off-limit to you. Namely, you will not search my personal memories and anything regarding other Legendary Pokemons; especially Lugia. Am I understood, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yes\", you said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then. Listen up. The boxes contains information that you can access directly. To use them, just pull them out of the shelves and take it to the table at the center. There, you can open the box and view the contents, which are encoded on thin sheets of membrane like papers. Once you finished, put all the sheets in the exact order you found them and placed the box back where you got it. I do not want to wake up and see my memory collection in a mess. If I caught you doing that, you're going to face far more than a simple shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only listened and quietly complied with Ho-oh's demand. It seems that Ho-oh want to hide something from you. Is it possible that the Pokemon has more secrets than he is willing to divulge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you cannot understand ancient Pokemon language on the boxes, I'll do you a little favor of rendering them understandable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately with a flash, all the inscriptions on the boxes became legible English words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take an hour to look around before we continue on to the next part of my body. Be quick!\", Ho-oh demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the selection of boxes around you. The shelves are so numerous and filled with even more boxes. Searching for useful information will take some time here. You spent the next 10 minutes looking at anything interesting in the area near you: <i>\"Battle Records, Maps, Flight Paths, Captive's Info and Current Activity, Body Functions\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two items interest you greatly. What could Ho-oh possibly record about you? What kind of function does the Pokemon's body contain? You pulled out the two boxes and took them over to the table. You intend to do a little more research on your captor. As you opened the box containing your information, you hope that Ho-oh didn't somehow figure out you plan......</span></div></div>",

You note that there is nothing about how long you'll stay inside him. There are another sheets that contain information about your escape, and the plans Ho-oh had for you if you disobeyed his orders. And in the last one you had checked, there is a part that calls your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still unable to fly. Human checked the joints, found nothing. Didn't seem like I was sabotaged in that moment. Wait thirty-six hours more. If unable to fly, then interrogate human.

You browse the sheets again, but it doesn't seem like Ho-oh has a definite idea of your plans, nor about Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put all the sheets back in the box, and put it back in the shelf.

Much to your surprise, it is almost empty. \"I thought there would be more stuff in here.\" -you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to assist to private lessons.

You browse the only sheet in the box, looking for anything that could work for your plans. It is useless, but you realize you need to learn what is in the rest of the brain. The information should be in here later. Maybe the controls you're looking for is in another part of the head. You take the box and place inside the box the stylus and the paper with the few notes you had written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I'm done with the so-called tour I could say that I forgot my notes in here.

You entered and encountered a chamber with a large spinning disk that is slightly above the floor; suspended from the ceiling with tendons attached to a fixed center. The sound it gives off is reminiscent of the din that a computer might give off. Its placement allows the disk to swing around the room in every direction in the same way a tire swing would. You take closer look at the apparatus, which is giving off seemingly random blue sparks. Secretly, you are hoping that this isn't some kind of torture contraption that Ho-oh has set up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, human. You arrived at the second destination. This is my magnetic 'orientation-generator'.\", Ho-oh said, \"This is what allows me to always know the directions I'm flying and my body's orientation relative to the ground. Without it, I would be lost and utterly useless as such a majestic Pokemon. In addition, the organ also provides me with some capability to make electricity for my body's needs and, in the current case, your punishment if you disobeyed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently gulped at the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I figured that by now, you would've learned to obey me and be my good little human after all those punishment you received; they'll get worse with each subsequent violation you commit.\", the Pokemon smirked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only nodded quietly at Ho-oh's intimidating words. Staring at the spinning disk, you briefly had the idea of suddenly disturbing the device to confuse the Pokemon to buy you some time to find the body control, but logic tells you that it would be unwise. Making the captor Pokemon madder isn't on your agenda.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, human!\", Ho-oh screeched, \"Stop idling around and get out of there. We still got more places to go.

Mainly because you can see organs above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two moving sacks, increasing their size and then reducing, with a steady pace. There are also many tubes, all of them connected to a large blob on the ceiling. It doesn't take you long to realize that you're looking at the outside of the lungs and the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you outside? You are supposed to observe from the inside, human!\" Ho-oh yells at you. \"Okay, forget it. Everything you see is basically the motor of my body, and it has been moving for more than a thousand years. Not even you could stop it. You may have supposed that the heart is delicate but with your actual size it is impossible that you'll hurt it in any way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something I should know?\" you ask, hoping that Ho-oh slips and says something you shouldn't know, but you don't have many hopes on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! What could you do inside my lungs or heart? You're supposed to help me with my body, but there are parts I can deal with by myself.

You sigh, and decide to stop focusing on looking ways to sabotage Ho-oh's body or his plans for you. Maybe you'll see something while you focus on the task at hand. The brain still seems like the best option to know more, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going! I said you had  four hours to complete your so-called tour, and you still are in the upper half of my body. If the four hours are over and I ask you a question about a place you didn't visit and you can't answer...let's say that you won't sleep tonight until you learn your lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say a thing, but you're annoyed. You check the maps again and enter a path that goes to Ho-oh's abdomen. You have no idea what you could encounter in the area you're entering, but everything is getting hotter around you and you're sure that the destination isn't going to be a relaxing place such as the one you encountered inside Lugia's body, when you entered in a similar tunnel.</span></div></div>",

By now, you are wondering where the rest of the body tour would take you to. You continued in the tunnel until you reached a large room where it's even hotter. Around you, there are several tall towers of golden flames that extend toward the ceiling. Ahead, there is a round podium like structure with stairs for you to climb. When you reached the top, you are face to face with a large pool of molten metal. The heat emanating from the amber mixture is enough to distort the air in the chamber. On the edge of the pool stands a large statue of Ho-oh with his wings spread wide and head held high.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my Foundry Chamber, where I store melted gold to make weapons and artwork for other Pokemons.\".

I'm not called the Gold Pokemon for nothing, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can make virtually any kinds of things here?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, human!\", boomed Ho-oh, \"I can make anything from the hardiest spear to the most intricate carvings known to Pokemons. Although I once made artworks for humans like you, that was the distant past; several thousand years ago. If you want to get me to make you some things from my gold, that you probably won't have the chance of seeing, I assure you, human. Alright now, get on with your tour!

Now you was going to work, and judging by Ho-oh's words, you won't know what it is until you get there. You finally got to the second-to-last entrance.

You enter the new destination, and you certainly didn't expect to encounter Ho-oh himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides Ho-oh, the room is completely empty.

Although only a 'representation', the thing could probably inflict physical harm on you just as the real Ho-oh could if you're outside. Seeing that you have no other choice, you resigned yourself to start cleaning this 'unreal' Ho-oh. You begin by tidying the feathers on the Pokemon's long crown, carefully setting the ruffled feathers into a neat pattern. You tried to remove any dirt that are stuck between the feathers on the head and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, give my beak a little polishing. Then, give my wings a thorough cleaning. After that, start on my body, tail, and my talons. I expect them to be gleaming by the time you're done.\", Ho-oh ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you have nothing else to clean with, you remove your outer shirt and began wiping the gold beak with it. A brownish layer of grime started to come off the surface as your wipe across it. Occasionally, you would look up to find Ho-oh keeping a tight eye on your every move. You can tell that Ho-oh is enjoying every moment of this service. After spending a few minutes on the beak, it shimmers in the faint light of the chamber. You looked at your shirt which is now completely soiled with unknown dirt. That was one of your favorite shirt and you've used it as a rag for cleaning a 'representation' of Ho-oh stained with who knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\", shouted Ho-oh, \"Who told you to stop? Get back to cleaning me, human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly resumed cleaning. The wings are quite difficult to clean. As you found out, Ho-oh has specifically demand that you work carefully on the glistening golden plumage, only brushing them in one direction and carefully remove all debris layer by layer. He also told you that any feathers accidentally bent out of shape during cleaning will mean getting shocked in addition to have your tokens deducted. Hearing the punishment, you took extreme caution on cleaning the wings, cleaning the feathers gently and slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning both wings took you 35 minutes. So you quickly went to work on the talons. Both of them are covered in a layer of grime. You wiped them with the soiled shirt, cleaning all the parts of the leg and taking extra effort in cleaning the claws. You make sure that all the claws are polished sparkling white then you went on to work on the tail, straightening and cleaning the feathers there. When everything is done, Ho-oh look even more majestic than ever, in your opinion. You see the Pokemon  scrutinizing at all the details of his body; even went as far as to count the feathers on his wings to make sure that you haven't broken any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Pokemon is checking your efforts, you were quietly thankful that Ho-oh didn't ask you to clean the area around his back-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ho-oh finished his inspection look at you firmly. You prepare yourself for any thing from high voltage shock to physical pain. But instead, he still stood there looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will count your effort as 'acceptable'.\", Ho-oh said, \"Although some feathers on my wings are slightly misaligned, you did quite an adequate job of polishing my beak and talons. If I make you clean me a few more times, I think you would make a perfect, personal body maintainer for me, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny hint of rare approval by Ho-oh made you feel slightly better, even if only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't indulge on my words for too long, human. You're still considered a liability to me. Whether that changes depends entirely on your action.\", Ho-oh said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you still got one last place to visit as part of the tour. Get going and travel down! You'll see what I have in store for you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! There is a reason this is the last stop. You'll have to answer a few questions about my body, and if you don't get enough score, your punishment will be greatly amusing for me! Before we start, you have to wash yourself! When was the last time you took a bath, human? Stand under the chute!\" -Ho-oh demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have said something rude about how your actual state was the consequence of cleaning Ho-oh's eyes and body, and spending so many hours in his colon, but you had received enough shocks for the day. You obey Ho-oh, and you are instantly doused in water. You and your clothes are soaked, but you don't feel cold, mainly because the inside if Ho-oh's body is too warm. At least you now are clean. You also notice that the force of the water removed the locator that was stuck in your hand. You pick it up and store it in your pocket, not wanting Ho-oh to notice that you don't have it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh then proceeds you to explain the functions of the place and the rest of his urinary system, and notifies you that with that concludes your tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll answer ten questions about my body. You have to get at least eight questions right. Get to the other side of my kidney, and stand in a platform you'll see. There is only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the other side, and see the part of the kidney you hadn't seen. The stream of what you guess is Ho-oh's urine crosses the kidney until it reaches a hole in the floor, forming a small waterfall. Much to your despair, the only platform is directly in front of the hole. You cross a bridge that leads to the platform, and wait for Ho-oh's instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say it once. Fail, and I'll push you through that hole. You can check your notes. Are you ready, human?\" you reply you are ready, and the questions start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many different sections are inside my lungs?\" Ho-oh asks, and you can feel clear malice in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know. I didn't see that!\" -you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough luck human! This is your first wrong question! It isn't my fault that you didn't check enough places, I'll ask you stuff!\" -he mocks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are enraged. This is Ho-oh torturing you, but you try your best to answer the questions. Most of them are about places you hadn't seen, and you manage to guess correctly. Still, at the end you manage to answer five questions right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unacceptable!\" - your captor says cheerily. \"You deserve this!\" The platform you're on starts tilting, until it is vertical. You grab to the edge, you're hanging directly above the hole, and beg to Ho-oh. You don't want to go any further. Somebody had once told you that birds don't have a bladder, and you don't want to check that by yourself. You tell Ho-oh that you'll give him the tokens you earn in the next week, you make promises, and other things you wouldn't do normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only hope is that Ho-oh listens to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the efforts were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, human!\", Ho-oh snapped, \"Since you have failed my test, it is time that you endure a much more extreme form of punishment. Presumably, you will be far more willing to follow my instructions carefully once I'm through with you. Heh Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Ho-oh's mocking laugh ringing throughout the chamber. Your hand is already strained from holding yourself up for the last few minutes. Inevitably, the moment came. You lost hold of the platform and tumble toward the hole beneath. Falling into the hole, you are immediately surrounded by warm urine. Some of it went into your mouth, where it left a bitter and obnoxious aftertaste. Almost immediately, a sucking force began to form underneath you and dragged you into the urine. You are pushed through a winding tube, deprived of oxygen. Dizziness ensued as you are taken through a labyrinth, twisting and turning. Then, you see a circle of light in front of you. You deduced that you are about to reach the anus. This is bad!, you thought. Is Ho-oh about to drop me from several hundred thousands feet from the sky? Just how bad could it get? Oh, no..no.no.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment finally came. In a swift action, you were expelled from the hole with the remaining urine. You feel yourself in an immediate free fall, plunging downward in a stomach-turning spiral. You could barely open your eyes in the strong wind around you. The sun was just hanging on the horizon, casting an orange hue upon the sky and clouds. Normally, you'd enjoy this spectacular view. This time, it could be your last. You thought about what would happen to you afterwards. What would happen to Lugia? Before you resigned yourself to what could be a fatal plunge, you suddenly saw Ho-oh, as large as ever, circling around you. Initially, you figured that the Legendary Pokemon is loving every moment of the \"front-row seat\" he has in witnessing your end. But Ho-oh started directing his wings toward you.The beating of his wings created a gale which lifted you upward. You came face to face with him. His eyes still filled with rage as he gripped you with his talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the feeling of an endless fall, human? I sure hope you do. Because you failed to answer my questions correctly, enduring an hour of free plunges will serve as your punishment this time around. Feel happy that I'm not letting you die.\", Ho-oh said, \"Enjoy......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a particularly sinister tone in the way the Pokemon uttered the last word. Ho-oh once again released you from his talon You continuously felt yourself falling for several thousand feet only to be propelled upward by Ho-oh's wing-generated gale and left to free fall again. With each 'round', you grew increasingly disorientated, your stomach churned, and you feel that you are about to throw up at any second. You felt yourself being whisked up and down like a rag doll. Each time you managed to catch a glimpse of Ho-oh, he only flashed a smirk in your direction, indulging himself in seeing your fear and obvious discomfort. The process repeated itself for an hour. After countless free falls, you felt numb and barely on the verge on consciousness. On the final fall, Ho-oh circled down below you and opened his beak wide. The last thing you saw was the Pokemon tongue and then everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*a few hours later*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly started to wake up. Your vision is still blurry as you tried to look around the dim surrounding. When your eyes got focused and adjusted to the darkness, you found yourself back in the eye chamber and by the look of thing, it's night already. The faint light from the half moon shone through the eye windows, casting a ghostly white aura in the room. Ho-oh is still flying, but higer than usual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I see that you have finally woken up, human.\", Ho-oh said, \"How did that free-falling work out for you? I bet you will follow my instructions and do exactly as I ordered from now on.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"..yes, Ho-oh......\", you said, your voice barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then. I consider you to have learned your lesson well. Now get to sleep. We have a lot more things to do tomorrow.\", Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the locator in your pocket.....what to do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You promise yourself that you won't rest until you find a clue of where the control room could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how the tour was over and how Ho-oh told you to go to sleep, you suppose that asking him to let you go to his brain to retrieve your notes would be a stupid thing to do. You decide to follow the given instruction and wait until your captor is asleep before daring to sneak into such a critical part of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your room, and are received with the not-so familiar room, with a very low amount of tokens on a side. Checking the locator, you see that Ho-oh has taken back most of your tokens. This adds to your rage, and gives you courage. You stay on the room, trying not to fall asleep, until you feel that Ho-oh is likely to be resting. You decide to start your new quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the locator in the floor, in case Ho-oh checks where you are. Then you carefully start to walk through the many paths inside Ho-oh's body, until you reach the brain. Your captor doesn't seem to have noted anything, but now the hardest part is coming. You look around the first room, and find the path to the library you had visited earlier. The chamber is silent and dark, so you wait a moment to get used to the darkness. Soon you're able to see. The markings on the boxes are still in a language you can understand. Looks like Ho-oh was careless! And you're happy to see that you can read the boxes Ho-oh had forbidden you to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few boxes and place them on the floor. <i>Bodily Functions</i>, in case the controls are in a system. <i>Legends Mythology</i>, as it may give you a clue. <i>Ho-oh's Powers</i>, to see if you can disable them. And a box containing information about Lugia, you want to communicate with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou browse through the last box you chose, and are unable to find anything useful, at least about talking with her. You however stumble upon a small tidbit of information, hinting the location of Lugia's control room, apparently somewhere near her Private Chamber. Remembering that the only way to enter to Lugia's Private Chamber was through her reproductive system, you hope that Ho-oh's body controls is located in a different place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the box about Lugia back to its place, and focus on the other three boxes. All of them (including the Bodily Functions box, which was almost empty in the morning) was full of membranes with writing on them. You take your time to read carefully every single sheet, and thanks to the third box you learn that Ho-oh's powers are linked to the control room too. The second room told you that Lugia's words are true, there is a way to control Ho-oh <i>as long as one is inside that room</i>. And you manage to find the information you're looking for in the first box. It isn't the exact coordinates of the control room, but it tells you in what area this is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take mental note of the paragraph:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Besides the normal functions this system has, there is a part near this system that would override my brain and allow somebody to control my body. For safety reasons there is only one way in, and I'm likely to feel if there is an intruder in the area. But what are the chances of a guest stumbling upon this room?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the boxes back to their places, but before placing the last box back you take a look to the title of the sheet you had found the information you memorized, which told you which system it was. You smile, not knowing if you're happy or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head off to search for the control room. You take a path leading to Ho-oh's...</span></div></div>",

The risk of an intrusion are quite low as the current human captive I have was given explicit instruction to only use the library. It is clear that the human won't risk his chance of electrocutions or torture under my watchful eyes. But in the event someone does enter the control room, I will encounter a complete loss of control of my body. I will be nothing but a prisoner in my own head and a mere voice to my 'hijacker'. This is a scenario that I will absolutely prevent from happening. I will use absolutely all methods necessary to keep that from <u>ever</u> occurring.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh seems to record his own analysis a lot, unknowingly give out valuable information that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually returned to the hub that connects all the other chambers in the brain. Looking around you, you estimated that there are at least six other access points. Although the Pokemon mentioned the control room to be in the brain, Ho-oh didn't elaborate exactly which route it is. Looks like I have to have a look around here, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried the first route nearest to you. The tunnel takes you to a much smaller version of the library you just used. There is just one shelf and a few boxes on it. They are not labeled in anyway. What kind of secrets does Ho-oh have that it's necessary for him to leave the data unnamed. And for some reasons, the boxes glow pink instead of the blue that you are used to. Now, things are getting really interesting. Curiously, you removed one of the boxes and set it on a table nearby. You removed the thin membrane sheets and gazed upon the content. What you saw shocked you beyond belief. Before you, there are several pictures of various Pokemons engaging in explicit activities.Their privates in full display and looks of lust on their face. The photos are mostly Legendary Pokemons including Ho-oh himself and, to your surprise, there are a few of Lugia's. As you flipped through more of the membranes, you saw that Ho-oh imagined himself with far larger prowess and virility, engaging with other female Legendaries. There are some pictures of himself in an anthropomorphic form. Even more appalling, Ho-oh took the time to compose love poems of his wildest imagination:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Descending from the blue heaven,<br>\r\nI encountered a glorious Pokemon.<br>\r\nI closed my wings upon her,<br>\r\nCausing her a lovely shudder.<br>\r\nI shoved my spear of fire,<br>\r\nA Legendary bliss far higher.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are at the same time surprised and weird-out by the pictures. What in the world is this? Ho-oh's private <i>PlayPokemon</i> collection? Whoa, he sure has a strange side that he didn't show to you, you thought. His fantasies are sure bizarre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly occurred to you, maybe you could use this new information to tease or even blackmail him into doing you bidding. You took a moment to imagine the look on Ho-oh's face when he hears about it. But doing so, it'll probably get him raging mad both from revealing that you trespassed his brain and, worse, skimmed through his most intimate contents. You shuddered at the potential death wish and shelved the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly replaced all the membranes back into their respective boxes and returned them to the shelf. If you stay here any longer, you have a feeling that you might gross out. You left the chamber and went on to try out the other entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't feel like ever checking back the room you just left, and you really hope that you erased any clues of your short stay in Ho-oh's private library. The punishment for such an offense surely would be much worse than anything you have experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think about these matters, you arrive to a room that, at first sight, seems like the control room. It has screens and consoles spread around the room, but after a closer examination you don't see anything that could be the controls you're looking for. You observe the screens, and note that most of them are diagrams of every organ in Ho-oh's body. It seems like these screens show the state of every part of the body, and if something needs to be fixed or done in any part. You guess that this is how Ho-oh can find work for you. \"This may be a way to anticipate myself to whatever I have to do tomorrow!\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine everything around you. There are a few problems, and you're sure that sooner or later you'll need to help Ho-oh, most likely after he wakes up. A screen showing the bones is indicating that most of the joints needs to be lubricated for a better performance, while another screen says that Ho-oh has a few messages from other legendaries. Whatever organ needed to receive these messages is damaged, meaning that he can't see them nor can send. Directly under that, there is another screen that points that the vocal chords are starting to be wearing down. And the last warning message says that Ho-oh is needing relief and help on his more private matters. There doesn't seem to be more warnings. Before you leave, you note one last thing. Another screen points that the captive (you feel uneasy reading this) is, according to the locator, in his resting room. There is also a clock, and it says it is almost 4:00 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the room, ready to examine another part of the brain. Before you enter through another path, you see that there is a sign indicating Ho-oh's normal day. This makes you realize how long you have spent here. According to the chart, Ho-oh usually wakes up around 4:30 AM. You stop and look at the path you are about to take. You take the risk and go through it. At the end you manage to find what you're looking for. The control room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to enter, but there seems to be some kind of electric force closing the path. You are guessing this is part of Ho-oh's protections, and that the electricity is coming from the organ you had visited earlier, the 'orientation-generator' organ. You make a quick plan:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the locator in the room, and while Ho-oh isn't expecting it, sabotage the 'orientation-generator' organ. You don't know how, but you guess you'll think of a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run towards your room. You get there, place the locator in your pocket, and try to sleep. When you wake up, you realize that, much to your surprise, Ho-oh hasn't called you. He is awake, but it is 7:00 AM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise doesn't last long. \"I was about to wake you up, human! Today you'll have a heavy day, and you better follow every single instruction I give you!\" Ho-oh says. \"As a way of apologizing for yesterday's punishment, I'll let you choose the order of your chores.\" What? You can't believe what you're hearing. \"Don't be that surprised! I was frustrated for other matters and took it on you. But don't expect more from me! This is the only time I'll apologize to you, I assure you that everything that happens you from now is stuff you deserve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and get out of your room, ready for the stuff you know you have to do today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One the table are numerous new diagrams of the body parts that needs you attention.You already know the content of the work for the day but you feigned ignorance to play along with the Pokemon. This might just work out to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you in his eye chamber, Ho-oh started out with a long sets of instructions.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Alright, human. You got a lot of things to do today:<br>\r\n-First, you are going to maintain all of the major joints in my body. It has been hurting for several months now and it has made flying harder for me. <br>\r\n-Secondly, there is a special organ that I need you to fix. What it does is not of your concern. The only thing you need to know is that it's been causing a lot of trouble for me lately. Just go there and I'll tell you what to check.<br>\r\n-Thirdly, I seem to be losing my voice these few days. I want you to do a checkup of my vocal chords and apply the appropriate remedy if a problem is discovered.<br>\r\n-Your last assignment for the day will be elaborated upon once you completed the above works.<br>\r\n-As previously promised, you can perform the work in any order you like. There is no specific time limits for the above. All of them safe for the fourth one, must be completed by sundown.<br>\r\n-Now, off to work, human\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the chamber after you decided to check on the joints as your first assignment. The map you were provided indicates that the bone joints are located in a crawlspace that encompasses the \"ceiling\" of Ho-oh 's body and neck portion. That's a wide area to cover, you thought. The access hatch to the joints is located just below the head of the Pokemon and you wasted no time to enter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crawlspace resembles the interior of lattice metalwork or the structure support of an iron statue, the only differences are that bones are used in place of metals and the pink fleshes. The space is narrow, making you fall on your stomach to crawl into the wide crevice. You moved to the nearest joint to start your work. The joint looks dry, slightly yellowed, and every time Ho-oh moves it, it creaks loudly. You covered your ears each time the sharp sound comes out. There is that feeling that if no maintenance is done soon, the whole place is gonna collapse on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you have chosen to start with my joints, human. They're getting really painful the last few days. Describe their condition for me.\", Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks dry, blackened, and is creaking loudly whenever you move, Ho-oh.\", you said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. Listen up!!! I want you to lubricate all my joints with the lubrication fluid I provide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flexible tube appeared besides you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use this tube to spray lubricant onto my bones. To use it, just simply squeeze it and spray the stuffs onto my bones. The tube can be extended for the entire length of my body. Now get started, human.\", ordered Ho-oh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin on the first bone joint by squeezing the tube as instructed. A beige-colored slime sprays out and coated the joint. After a few wiggling done by Ho-oh, the creaking sound mostly subsides and the joint seems to move with a lot more flexibility. Satisfied with the results, you proceed to the next joint and the next one and toward the spine. Each time, you made a meticulous effort to thoroughly coat each joint with slime. The more difficult part of the work is the wing joints; they are far larger than the rest of the joints. It took you three times more efforts to finally get them nice and working smoothly. At last, you coated the last of the joints near the tail and reported to Ho-oh on the completion of your assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you. Now let me check all of the joints before I make my decision on your effort.\", Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw all the joints around you moving in synchronization. There is virtually no sounds now and the Ho-oh seems to take a lot less effort to move them. After a minute of checking, Ho-oh rendered the verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My.....For the first time in centuries, my body finally feels right!\", Ho-oh said, \"My wings and backside felt new again. You definitely learned from all those shocks and punishments I gave you, human. As you have exceeded my expectation. I'm giving you 5 tokens for your work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm. Thanks.\", you said, taken aback by the rarely-surfacing good mood of Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what are you waiting for, human? If you want to keep me in this uplift mood, you better get on with your next work. You might earn yourself a day off tomorrow.\", Ho-oh said, returning to his usual reserved demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop: the Message Relay System, you thought. <i>(though Ho-oh didn't know that you know this)</i></span></div></div>",

What was the organ...?\"- you ask, feigning ignorance. \"Oh wait, there must be a map or something here...\" you shuffle the maps around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be that hard to find in the maps! Just get to my head, and find a path to the room that is just over the Eye Chamber.\" -Ho-oh growls. You really don't want to exasperate him, so you mutter something about doing it, and start walking. You crawl back until you realize that you're near the eyes. You search for the location of the Message Relay System. A sudden thought reaches you: could you be able to send Lugia a message without Ho-oh noting it? You doubt it. Maybe you could take advantage of Ho-oh's more or less relaxed mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter a very cramped room. It is much smaller than you thought, and you have little space to work. The organ you need to check is basically one big blob, almost filling the room. When you timidly touch it, the flesh starts to move and reveals the inside. There is an unbelievable number of connections, and what seems like wires. There are spots in the walls, that seems to classify the arriving messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, but I don't know how can I get in to see better. At first glance there doesn't seem to be anything wrong.\" -you notify Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I turned down the wires. You should be able to enter and touch anything without the risk of being harmed. Do it quick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the wires that are closer to you, and place them out of your way. You enter the blob. There are more wires inside, and a small screen detailing where they go. The problem doesn't seem to be in the wires themselves nor in their connections, so you look around for something else, maybe the part that is receiving the messages is the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a lot of wires here, but neither of them seems to be the problem. I don't see what else could be wrong.\" - you comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then use the screen! That controls the whole thing. I'll grant you access for a few minutes, as it will mean that I won't be able to watch over you. You better not abuse of my trust, human!\" -he barks, almost returning to his normal attitude towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch the screen. It activates new functions, and you are able to find the configuration of the place. You find the problem, and can't believe what you're seeing. It looks like somebody modified the configuration, turning off most of the options. You chuckle and turn all of them on, and save the configuration. The problem is fixed instantly, a notification appers saying that Ho-oh has many messages unread. With the wires off, they are on the screen. You glance to the first one's subject, which is by Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You better be treating the human well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done here!\" -you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get out of there! I'll check these.\" -Ho-oh says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the place, without looking back. You had forgotten about Lugia! You focus and try to form communication with her, to tell her about your progress on escaping. You start your way towards your last task, but Ho-oh stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't eaten today. Go.\"- he says dryly. You have the feeling that this is a reaction towards Lugia's message. You can't imagine what its content was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive to the place where you eat, ready to go through the forced feeding routine. While the tube is coming at you, you hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally can talk with you, friend. How is it going?\" -Lugia asks you telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one can discover me here. But that device is still embedded in me, so flying isn't an option. What is your current situation, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After enduring some of the most grueling days, I have manage to find the control room in Ho-oh's brain. Beside that, I have found some pretty secrets that he keeps to himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to describe what you saw in the private library to Lugia. Even her seemed shocked and slightly uncomfortable when she heard that Ho-oh also has photos, whether real or not, of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Ho-oh is really weirding me out now. But why didn't enter his control room and take on some sweet revenge?\", Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is that now, he seems to have an electric force field set up around it. I may have to disable his orientation-generator organ before I could go any further.\", you said, \"Well. If all goes well, I............\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could continue, the feeding tube stuck itself into your mouth. It started pumping food to you mouth once again and it's better tasting than that bitter bile you were served last time. Lugia repeatedly tried to contact you in your head but you only managed let out a mental muffle to her. After ten minutes worth of food washing down into your stomach, the tube finally detached itself and retracted into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened, I heard you muffling and all?\", Lugia asked in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh just serve me his so-called breakfast, namely by force-feeding me who-knows-what.\", you replied sardonically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why that......, he hasn't gotten my message, huh? Is there some thing wrong with his brain or something?\", Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. Ho-oh just ordered me to fixed his Message-Relay Organ, I guess he just got the memo now. Anyway, I'll be assuming control of Ho-oh tonight.\", you said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I better break of connection before he picks up the signal. See you, tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you connection with Lugia broke off. You only had a minute to think about your plan before Ho-oh's voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

You follow paths you had memorized before, until you arrive to a wide tube that extends to both sides. There are strong currents of air, and you have to grab the ridges of the place in order to not to fall down. Luckily the tube isn't vertical, so you can crawl all the way upwards until you reach what you identify as the throat. It was curious, you had gone through this exact same place at least three times and you hadn't been able to take a good look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that Ho-oh is likely to get impatient, you focus on your task. You localize the vocal cord behind you. It doesn't look bad, at least at the first glance. When you touch it, you can feel that it is much more stiff that you had supposed it would be. You thought Ho-oh's vocal chord would be flaccid and soft, but it is hard and slightly swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" -Ho-oh says, clearly not caring that you're directly in front of the source of his voice. You see the parts in front of you moving, and can see that they aren't moving enough. At the same time, the intensity of the screech leaves you stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please could you be quiet?! I'll be deaf if you keep talking when I'm here!\" you yell, without watching your tone. There is an uncomfortable feeling in your pocket, you suppose it is the locator trying to shock you. You let a convincing (you hope) yelp of pain, but Ho-oh seems to reluctantly obey your words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that it is overuse. Letting it rest for a while would be good. It is also stiff, I'll see what I can do.\" -you notify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start massaging the wide strands. You press carefully until you feel it creak and be softer. You rub until you're sure that it is much softer now. Seeing that you have done a very small part, you tell Ho-oh that it is likely to take you long. Luckily you have time, it is just a bit later than noon, sunset is still far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a boring and repetitive task, and soon you start doing it mechanically while you think about how you can sabotage the organ needed to deactivate the force blocking the control room. You guess that throwing something on the disk would be the most obvious choice. Maybe both of your shoes could do the trick. You don't note that you're done with your task until you realize you have been pressing on a soft part for more than five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done here! That is all I have to do?\" you yell, once you're far enough to not to be harmed by the intensity of Ho-oh's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you already forget what I said this morning?\" -he growls. -\"There is one last thing for you to do before you can rest. Come to the eye chamber for the details.\" Ho-oh stops talking and when you're almost in your destination you hear him again. \"You did a good job today. I hadn't felt this good for a long time. You'll have a free day at the end of the week.\" You laugh softly. It isn't like you'll be inside him by the end of the week, but it is still nice to hear appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive to the eye chamber, and enter.</span></div></div>",

The brightness within the chamber dimmed significantly when the Pokemon went below the tall canopies of the trees; all you're seeing now is the dark green foliage above and the barren ground beneath. Ho-oh landed with a little thud which you felt under your feet. There are new information on the table for you to see. You went over and flipped through the pages that Ho-oh intend for you to read. The membranes seem to be showing some diagrams of body parts you haven't visited yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, human. This will be the last assignment for the day.\", Ho-oh announced, \"Listen well! This assignment requires more delicate actions on your part.This is also a more private matter between you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what will my last work be about?\", you asked, expecting something to do with Ho-oh's private part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take a look at my reproductive organ.\", Ho-oh said straightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Ho-oh's eye windows changed view toward the lower part of the Pokemon's own body. The shaft is hidden within a hole below the anus. You saw it comes out as Ho-oh wills it to. At full length, it's almost a third of Ho-oh wingspan. It appeared dark purple underneath the dim light. It is also covered in shiny yellow bristle-like hair. Unbelievable....., you thought. This is the first time you saw that part of a Pokemon and a Legendary at that. Although it is not discernible at first, you can see faint pulses going through the thin red veins on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, this is my reproductive organ and how I reproduce every several centuries or so. For the last decades, I've been noticing that my penis isn't as active as it once was.\", Ho-oh said, \"I want you to get down there and check to see what the problem is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh used his wing to motion toward his private part to make his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is highly important and I don't want you to screw this up.\", the Pokemon said firmly, \"The entire lineage of Legendaries depends entirely on my thing, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, still stunned, by the directness of Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now. Get over there and call it a day.\", the Legendary said, \"If you find any problems, report to me immediately. And while you're at it, you might just enjoy the place as much I use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hint of suggestiveness in the last sentence makes you shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy, what could Ho-oh possibly do to me there, you thought.</span></div></div>",

But strangely enough, you kind if sympathize with Ho-oh's concern for descendants, although you believe that he exaggerated. You also don't like the tone of Ho-oh's words, and propose yourself to find something to not to deserve any actions coming from your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path to the reproductive organs seems to be more convoluted than the rest, possibly because it is a more private area of Ho-oh's body. It takes you longer to arrive there, so you feel relieved when you finally get near. You are about to enter a direct path towards the penis, but Ho-oh closes it first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to enter, human. It is a sensible part of my body, and if you do anything wrong, don't complain if you are shocked with the locator. This is your only warning!\"-he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say that you know, and Ho-oh lets you enter. You can't pinpoint your exact location, but you guess you are closer to testicles than to the rest of the system. You think about what Ho-oh's problem can be. You walk towards your right, which is the way you suppose goes to the penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are walking, you realize what the problem is. With every step you take, <i>everything</i> around you moves excessively. It seems like convulsions. You know that this place is supposed to be sensible, but you have the feeling that this isn't normal behavior. The problem is that you don't know what to do to help. You decide to notify Ho-oh about your suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what is wrong, but I need to ask you: are you being turned on right now\" you ask, to confirm. Ho-oh tells you that there isn't any <i>pleasant</i> sensations. You gather your very limited knowledge and form a theory about nerves, over-sensibility and how the convulsions kills any possibility of the place 'being as active as it once was'. To you it sounds like a very far-fetched theory, but it should be enough to make Ho-oh think that you know what you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh seems to meditate on what you said. You turn around to walk back to the point you used to enter, as you had done your task of finding what is (possibly) wrong. You are stopped in your tracks, when Ho-oh says: \"Where do you think you are going, human? You found the problem, but aren't you going to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to do it! If you give me an idea, then maybe I could\" you reply, with half of your mind hoping that your captor can't think a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it was oversensibility! The nerves! Go take a closer look at them!\" -he says, annoyed \"For this it is required that you go further in my thing. You should see some nerves near the end, and if they aren't the problem, then there are some nerves outside. I'll make sure you are able to examine them if necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, and decide to finish this quickly. It is already sunset, and you hope that just after this Ho-oh will go to sleep. Maybe he'll do it faster if he is satisfied with your work.</span></div></div>",

You can't beleive it, you are about to enter the private part of Ho-oh. After reaching the end of the tunnel, you arrived in a round room with a large transparent vat with glittering golden substance. The stuff looks like liquid gold with glitters added to it.  It randomly swirls and sloshes about within the container. You can also see that the liquids originated from two large, orange testicles suspended from the ceiling, transferred by a long tube. Although everything looks normal at first, you noticed that the level of the liquid in the vat is below normal, indicated by a small display screen near the container. The reason for the anomaly, it explains, seems to be a production setting error and the lack of exciting environments on Ho-oh's part. The screen also said that the last time Ho-oh has pleasured himself was about 5 years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-oh, I think I found the source of your reproductive problem. Your system display indicates a setting error and a lack of exciting stimulants in the environment.\", you said, \"What do you think I should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't it obvious?!\", Ho-oh scold, \"Try to fix it and make my thing strong again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged at Ho-oh loud demand and began to look through the data on the display. There are lots of information here, you started by looking into the liquid level over the past few years. About a decade ago, the levels were extremely high and a gradual decline is recorded and has remained flat for two years already. Moving on to the next info, Ho-oh's cock also recorded the Pokemon in each his 'encounter'. All of them are female Ho-ohs that spreads out over the millennia on the timetable. Finally after minutes of going through the data, you found the setting for sperm production, which is reading an extremely low level. You tapped the setting to the highest number possible for Ho-oh. When you saved the setting, you felt the entire area rumbles as the testicles began to churn out more of the golden liquid. It only took a mere 5 minutes for the entire vat to be filled up. You turned your head up and announced your progress to Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, human. I feel my cock all invigorated and ready. Before you leave, I want you to go to one final place here. We still have to fix the excitement problem, don't we?\", Ho-oh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense a bit of seductive tone in his voice and cringed a bit. Ho-oh isn't thinking about doing that, is he?, you thought. Nevertheless, you went to the location the Pokemon instructed you to go. You took a catwalk that descends below the now-full vat into another chamber below. This second room is a large tube that occupies the entirety of the space below. The whole thing is translucent so you could make out some forms of structures inside. There is an access hole in the tube for you to enter. You entered the area and discovered the area lined with smooth cloths and a floor covered with thick carpets. In the center, there is an area that is left uncovered; containing the flesh or most sensitive part of the cock.  You gulped as you get the implication from Ho-oh. Before you can think any further, a holographic representation of Ho-oh appeared and looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are truly afraid of what he's going to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see that you have gone this far in maintaining me.\", the Ho-oh said, \"Now, let's see if you can do the Pleasure Game with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......what is.....that?\", you managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a set of games between you and me. Just try to get my actual body to the pleasure point. Although everything here now is virtualized, it can still get very real sometimes.\", Ho-oh replied.</span></div></div>",

The memories of the last hour are still playing in your head, and if you ever find out how to erase them, you would take it without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...how far will this go?\" -you ask, very afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I say, human! How useless can you be? You had said a thing and the problem was something else. At least show you're good for something!\" -Ho-oh says, with obvious enjoyment. \"Go, get started! Show me your skills! Arouse me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow your pride and stumble towards the uncovered patch on the floor. \"I...am going to start...\" Ho-oh hits you with his wing. \"No! Why do you think I'm here? One reason is so you track your progress, but you can also work with this hologram! Think of something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resign with obvious disgust. You try to aisle yourself from your environment, but you still have an idea of what you're doing. Before you know it, you're rubbing Ho-oh's back underneath the feathers, and when you notice that is he making you direct your hands towards his more private areas, you try to position your eyes so at least your surroundings are blurry and unfocused. You don't know if it is good for you, but at the moment Ho-oh's cock is mercifully hidden. You don't have any other option, so you start rubbing around the anus and the hole where you had seen the penis before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from Ho-oh's moans, he is enjoying this much more than you. You open your eyes and note that your torturer has gotten aroused enough to have an erection. You take the moment as your indication to finally get to the patch of uncovered flesh on the floor. You rub your hands and yourself on the area, and try to ignore the hologram (you don't want to see a thing) and the sounds of the real reproductive system, which seems to be responding to your activities. You don't realize when the vat empties its contents, but much to your despair, you see the liquid taking a road that goes just in front of you, and towards the exit. It means that you're successful, and you hope that it also means it is over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand and look towards Ho-oh's hologram, still panting. He takes a look at the screen above him and smiles at you. \"Well, that is a surprise! A 90%. It could be much better. You should try more, human! It still isn't 100%, and you still can do things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he approaches at you. You notice that his cock is now gone, and that everything seems to be normal. \"I may be satisfied enough not to need more stimulation on my thing, but there are other ways to help.\" -he says maliciously. \"I want 100%! And seeing how your brittle body won't be able to endure a private lovemaking session, I guess that isn't an option!\". At this point he positions his body with his back turned towards you and pins you on the ground. He is almost sitting on you, but luckily for you, he is careful enough not to crush you under his hologram's weight. You have full sight of his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go, do something.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the resting room, you still tremble from the second half of the ordeal you endured with the virtual Ho-oh. Your mind refuse to recall the details. All that you could remember is that Ho-oh somehow got pleased with your effort and let you off. That is a good thing. Now you could focus on waiting for the Pokemon to fall asleep ,sabotage his orientation-generator, and assumed direct control of his body. This Pokemon is about to get the receiving end of cruel treatment. Now, Ho-oh seem to be readying himself for sleep. You heard him giving a loud audible yawn as he found a grove in the forest to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now the time to make your move. As previously done, you left your locator in the resting area as slowly made your way to the orientation-generator chamber. Once you got there, the gyroscope-like structure is still spinning like usual. First you took off your shoe and threw it directly at the disk, but the shoe got deflected and shot right back at you. Luckily, you dodged in time to prevent a face on collision. You tried various methods to stop the generator but you can't seem to find anyway to do it. I guess I will have to look around here to see what I else I can find, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked the perimeter of the chamber, searching for anything that remotely has the possibility of disabling the electric force field. After a couple of times of walking around the generator, you found a peculiar spot on the wall. It is a panel box with various dials and a screen displaying that electric distribution in Ho-oh's body. The voltage generated is currently mostly focused on the brain security system. Another significant portion is dedicated to the captor locator and shocker (which you assume refers to your wristband device). You tried to change the setting of the generator by diverting electricity to other parts in the body. You smirked as you direct half of the electricity toward the testicles and another half to the rectum. You kept the setting for the locator unchanged for fear of arousing the suspicion of the Pokemon. You silently laugh to yourself, you couldn't wait to see the look on Ho-oh face when he decides to shock you; he'll have one unforgettable and painful experience. Perhaps it will even change his mind about humans in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the job done to the generator, you made your way to the brain and went to the entrance to the control chamber. The force field is now gone and you entered it unhindered. The control chamber is only slightly larger than your resting chamber, but the things in here looks far more advanced. That are several screens around you that shows that status of Ho-oh's heartbeats, the temperature, and the general condition in his body. There are also several displays that show live footage of the various body parts you were made to visit. This slightly concerns you. You hope Ho-oh hasn't been recording you the entire time you're in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you even found one that allows direct two-way communication between Ho-oh and you; although his status is marked as asleep currently. The control apparatus looks like a cross between a airplane cockpit and a small theater. You found a chair that directly face that main screen and made yourself comfortable in it. There are two joysticks-like protrusions on both armrests. There is a panel in the front of you that contains several buttons and a keyboard. You located a large one that you assume is the startup button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere goes nothing, you thought as you pressed the button.</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, everything seems to be back to normal, but there are many more things than before, and options. The screen in front of you now showed the outside, as seen through Ho-oh's eyes. You could see the foliage of the trees, and nobody near. There was also one important change: the screen that showed Ho-oh's status has changed. Looks like you taking the control didn't go unnoticed to him, and the screen now showed Ho-oh's confused ramblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to type in that screen 'Calm down and enjoy. It won't take long before I leave forever, and you turn off the volume of the communication'. Then you focus on your task at hand, ignoring Ho-oh's furious responses. You laugh happily, and look around for a way to contact Lugia. Even if you took control of Ho-oh, you won't be able to leave without her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to find a screen that controls the organ you fixed earlier, the Message Relay System. You open a new message and tell Lugia that you're now in control of Ho-oh's body, and ask for her location. It doesn't take long before she answers with admiration for your accomplishment! She also gives you the coordinates of the cave she is in. Now the next thing to figure out is how to control the body itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play for a while with the joysticks, and you make Ho-oh flop around his wings and stumble against the trees. It isn't intentional, as it is hard for you to find out how to drive the body, and Ho-oh isn't going to tell you. The communication screen is producing more objections from Ho-oh, and you can't avoid feeling amusement towards your captor's words. 'You get what you deserve' you wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get used to the controls, you start walking towards the cave. The last thing you want to do is flying, as you're sure that you'll end crashing against the ground and breaking Ho-oh's neck, leaving you stranded. After walking for half an hour or so, you localize Lugia's cave. She is waiting at the entrance, and as soon as she sees you she turns around. You wonder what this means, until you realize that she still has the chip on her back. Using Ho-oh's claws, you manage to grab the chip and tear it off, not before accidentally scratching Lugia's back, causing deep wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry for that, Lugia. I'm not used to this\"- you say through a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is okay, I'll heal before you know it. Now that the chip is off I have my powers back. You should turn off Ho-oh's powers. He surely will try to reactivate them as soon as you leave the control room, you should try to find a way to keep them off for as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the levers that give Ho-oh energy for using his strength, and quickly decide to use the remains of your shirt. You turn off the levers, and use the shirt to tie them together to the corner of the controls. You try to pull the levers back, and are glad to see that you aren't capable. You feel everything around you moving. What is going on outside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm done, it should be easy to get out of here.\"-you write back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm holding Ho-oh down with my own body. Listen, as soon as you get out of the control room Ho-oh will obtain the control of his body. If you disabled his powers then we should have all the time of the world. Go find an exit of his body, I'll know when you're out.\"-Lugia tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, ready to finally be free. You cross the entrance of the control room, and see how the screens turn off again. -\"Human, I'll make you pay for this!\" Then a really pained scream echoed through the chamber. Your guess is that he tried to shock you, and received the payback for everything he has done for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in the throat, and going towards his beak. -\"No, I won't allow it!\" -you hear your captor say. The tongue in front of you blocks the beak. You try your best to contact Lugia mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Could you pull the tongue back outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't! My wings are too big for that. Listen, there are more ways out from Ho-oh's body, and I don't see how he could block them. And don't worry, I'm sure there are many ways that don't involve exiting through Ho-oh's back door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment to remember any other possibilities. You smile, knowing exactly what you'll do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were running swiftly through the tunnels leading to the chamber. Along the way you heard Ho-oh yelping from the continuous shock on his cock and rear end. That really served him well, you thought. Once you arrived at the eye chamber, you immediately rushed from nostrils hole and squirm your way out. The moment you truly exited from Ho-oh is a moment of pure happiness. You saw Lugia towering over the Legendary, pinning him down to the ground of the cave. When she realized that you made it out, Lugia used her wings and gave Ho-oh a heavy blow to his head which knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lugia rushed over to embrace you and almost squeezed the air out of you both from her size and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness, you've made it.It so good to see you alive and well. You must've been through a lot the last few days.\", she said panicking, \"Are you okay? Are you hurt in anyway? What else had that monster done to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay now, Lugia.\", you said comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia caught sight of your lack of cloths and how dirty you are and the several cuts on your arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all my fault. If I hadn't flew through Ho-oh's domain, this wouldn't have happened. If I had travel underwater, he would've never knew about you.\", Lugia said in a depressed tone, \"And he......made you do all those repulsive tasks in his body. Most of all, he tortured you. I couldn't forgive myself for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Lugia. I am safe and sound now.  I'm standing here. Ho-oh won't be laying his talons on me again. Despite my lack of cloths and a few bruises that Ho-oh did to me, I'll be fine.....Thank you for caring so much about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Lugia blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as long as you're fine, I'm glad about that.\", Lugia said, hugging you tighter. For a few instance, you thought you saw tears in Lugia's eyes. She really cared about you. You embraced Lugia tighter in an emotional moment in the cave. Only when both of you hear a groan coming from the ruffled body of Ho-oh did you two finally let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........Let's get out of here before Ho-oh wakes up again.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. He's going to be out cold for an hour. Come on let's get out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered Lugia through her mouth and returned to the personal bedroom you love so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking a further risks of encountering Ho-oh or any other Legendaries now. We'll be traveling underwater as soon as we reached the ocean.\", Lugia announced.</span></div></div>",

She really wants you to forgive her, and you did in the moment she picked you up after coming out of Ho-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of being treated like a king, you decide to return the favor. Lugia is so nice to you, and you just spend time inside her! You decide to do some of the tasks you had done inside Ho-oh, and after some days you have done them. Lugia feels better than ever, and you're happy to see that it worked. Besides, your host had reached the ocean, and the environment is beautiful. You spend countless hours in the observation deck, just watching Lugia swim. It is a while world you never thought you would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, you mark the end of your second month as a tiny human inside legendaries. They have been the most fun you had, excluding the four hellish days you spent inside Ho-oh. You knew it couldn't last forever (well, technically it could, but you didn't think it was appropriate), but you still felt surprised when Lugia informed you that in a few days she would finally arrive to the shrine, so she could return you to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her talk about the future. She says that she'll watch over you, and maybe visit you every month, to keep the friendship going. She doesn't want to be caught, but she still wants to see you. You agree with her, and tell her about your team. You had told her about your adventures, but hadn't said a thing about your own Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're the best, Lugia. I'm so proud of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can see that you love your Pok\u00e9mon, and shares your happiness. But the longer you talk about them, the more nostalgic you get. You miss your team, and you're sure that they must be very worried. It has been two months since they saw you. You know that they wouldn't forget you easily, but felt that they at least deserved to know what is happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia senses your actual state of mind, and tries to think a way to cheer you up. She isn't too keen with the only idea she has, but she would do anything to see you happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, would you like to bring one of your Pok\u00e9mon here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to bring you one of your Pok\u00e9mon so whoever you choose stays with you for the rest of your time inside me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed with the idea. It would actually be great! You already chose which one, but what worries you is how it will react to meeting a Legendary...from the inside. That, and the possibility of staying a few days inside Lugia. Could your friend cause trouble, or get lost or anything? Would you take the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a tiny organ in my brain, which will infiltrate into the human PC systems and bring you only one, already shrunken Pok\u00e9mon.

With this in mind, you took the appropriate route over to Lugia's brain. Come to think of it, you haven't actually visited Lugia's brain before. This could be your chance to further understand this Legendary Pokemon. You eventually found her brain which is considerably larger than that of Ho-oh. You laughed as you privately wonder whether or not that has to do with physical traits or intellectual quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the same with Ho-oh, the brain is divided into different chambers through a hub. You found one with a sign labeled the \"Human PC Access\". This must be the one that Lugia talked about. You entered it and found a Pokemon PC embedded into the fleshy wall and another one that acts as a desktop computer complete with a keyboard. You went over to the PC and typed in your name and access code for your Storage account. First, you check your remaining money in the account and the items you still have. Then you made the move to withdraw Vaporeon on the screen. The PC hummed and beeped for a few second, then a Pokeball came out from a hole to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the Pokeball and opened it by throwing it against the floor. A Vaporeon pops out of the ball. Seeing the Vaporeon, you immediately went over to hug it. It has been too long since you last felt its soft, scaly coat and hear her call. Judging from Vaporeon's reaction, she also seems to miss you greatly. You thought you even saw some tears in Vaporeon's eyes. Now that you two are together, you finally have another Pokemon to interact with besides Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you played for a while in the PC room. Rubbing her in her favorite spot, brushing her head, and playing games that she likes. Before you noticed, an hour has passed. You returned Vaporeon back to her Pokeball and stow it in your pocket. You'll find some times to play with her later. You now turned your attention to the desktop computer beside the Pokemon PC. You pressed a key on the keyboard to turn it on. The screen instantly refreshes and display a wide array of function for you to use. There is a Message Relay System that resembles the one in Ho-oh, some fun-looking mini-games that you can play with Lugia, a private chat, a web browser, and much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you clicked on the Message Relay System and found that numerous other Pokemons are on the system. There is a list with the name of the Pokemon and a status icon to indicate whether they're on the system or not. You moved through the list discovered at least 15 Pokemons are on the system, some of them written in a text that you can't understand. This looks much like that messaging system you used to talk with your friends back at home. You even saw, much to your dismay, Ho-oh's name on the relay system. Since you and Lugia are now deep within the ocean and Ho-oh catching you again is an impossible feat, it wouldn't hurt to \"chat up\" with your old captor. Before you click on his name to engage the conversation, you asked Lugia whether it would be safe to do so. She told you that you don't have to worry about it since Ho-oh cannot track her location and that she could drop in on the conversation by typing at anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsider it a second payback, you thought. You smirk to yourself as you and Lugia figure how to rile up the Pokemon and get the most fun out of it. </span></div></div>",

Want to see? If you don't think I'm capable of doing that, then come here. The descriptions the human has done are very detailed, I'm sure everybody will get a laugh from your hidden side.</u>\" Lugia types, condescending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh seems to think for a while before replying. \"Fine. I'll leave it here. Just...keep it silent, okay? And I don't want to hear again the word human. Nor from you nor anybody. I already got too much pain from it. Please, tell your...buddy to behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"Fine with me, but you did deserve it.\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-oh seems to have blocked incoming messages from you or Lugia. You are still rereading the stuff you had written before, and manage to laugh again. You're confident you won't see Ho-oh in person, but it would be fun to tell Lugia to send messages from you to your former captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter memorizing with Lugia the best moments of your taunting you exit the brain.

There is the Observation Chamber in Lugia's head, your personal room, food chamber and storage, and so on. Vaporeon seems to be very excited to see all these amenities within a Pokemon. You specifically instructed her not to take one of the holes that leads outside of Lugia; despite Lugia having an exterior gravity on her body, you don't want to take the risk for your Pokemon. Another region you wouldn't want Vaporeon to find out about is Lugia's reproductive organ. You fear that the place would be too much to her and who knows what will happen when she gets the 'idea' whens she's there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The tour within Lugia went on smoothly for both of you and you haven't been this happy in a long time. Perhaps it was the long isolation from your friends and Pokemons, you thought. Although you have become close to Lugia, she still isn't a close friend that you're so used to. Judging from her recent interaction with you, there is some hint that the Legendary may be having some form of affection for you. You laughed slightly at the notion, an inter species romance is certainly unheard of, but still, it cannot be ruled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Before you know it, it was late noon already. Vaporeon seems especially tired from walking around with you. You let her return to her Pokeball while make your way back to your personal bedroom for a quick rest. When you got to the bedroom you placed your belongings on the desk and made your way toward the bed. On the bed, you found a piece of folded paper. It used the same material as those you found in Ho-oh. You unfurled the piece and read it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear trainer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeet me at the observation chamber tonight at 9. I have a surprise for you <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n,Lugia</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised by the letter.

You spend the rest of the afternoon walking idly through Lugia's body, sometimes alone, sometimes with Vaporeon. You can't wait for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it is only one hour more before it is time to go to the observation chamber. You leave Vaporeon in your room on a bed you made earlier, and start walking towards the meeting point. It is still early, but you're so excited you don't mind waiting outside the observation chamber. When it is finally time to enter you walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are nicely surprised with the first thing you see, outside. Lugia seems to be in some kind of shrine, much different than any other place you have visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi, trainer!\"-you hear behind you. You aren't surprised when you see Lugia behind you, you got used to see your hosts inside their own bodies. Lugia approaches you and gives you a hug, you do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thank you for coming. I wanted to spend time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is this place?\"-you ask, pointing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is the place where you can return to normal. But....I thought that you may not want to do it yet. I think that we should spend a few days more in this situation. When it is time you can go outside. This place is another home, and nobody else has been here besides us two. I have never brought anybody else here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and Lugia takes you to the center of the room. She uses her powers to contort the flesh of the floor, and soon it turns into a table. Your favorite stuff appears on the table, and you start eating. A bit later Lugia joins you until both of you are finished with this.Then Lugia starts talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I wanted you here because I felt the need to...tell you that you're the best thing that has happened in my life. And you know that I have lived for pretty long.\" You nod again, unsure of what this means, but you can't avoid thinking the same. She continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know that we can't be together forever, and I doubt a serious relationship between us will work. But I want to give you the best days of your life. Even after you return to normal I want to show you places and things nobody else has seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I like that idea\"-you reply, still unsure of what is going on, but you like that she thinks so high of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Would you...like to give me a chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's continue.

The nearer she came to you, the more nervous you become. Looks like the Pokemon wants to take things a little further now, you thought. Being together for such a long time has definitely brought you two closer together.\u00a0Without you noticing, Lugia has now gotten so close to you that you can feel the heat emanating from her body. She wrapped her large wings around you and brought you closer to her chest. You felt yourself enveloped between her incredibly soft feathers, enjoying the warmth her body gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, you felt Lugia planting her soft beak on you cheek and started nuzzling you. The sensation is something that you've never experienced before. The feeling of fur brushing against your cheek sends shivers down your body.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a large bed materializing out of the floor along with ambient lightings within the Observation Chamber. The elliptical \u00a0bed contained several large plush cushions and seats on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Lugia has positioned her actual body to face the entrance to her palatial shrine; the view you have now is that of a seashore lit by dim moonlight. You remembered that you have seen this scene all the way back when you first entered Lugia's subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon slowly pressed you down toward the bed which you obliged. Once you lie on the bed, which feels soft and warm, Lugia wrapped her wings around you and brought her head right beside yours. She looked at you with her deep, azure eye, drawing you closer to it. You are mesmerized by its size and the details within it. You wonder what thoughts lie in them that Lugia wants to share with you. Then, as if the Pokemon could read your thoughts, words and images project themselves onto the eye. Sounds began to play within your head. Just, when you are about to ask Lugia, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a something intimate I created for our personal viewing.\", said Lugia with a very prominent blush her face, \"I hope you'll enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon fell quiet again as you watch the movie playing before you, still held snugly in her wing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watch the eye, mesmerized. You would never get tired of those lovely pair of ocean blue pools if you had to stare at them for eternity. Your awestruck reflection slowly faded as images comes into focus. The words \"The Journey\" formed within her pupil and gentle music started playing. Lugia's blushing was a big warning sign of what you would be about to see, so you got ready for the movie. You decided to wait first what was it before making any comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie seems to be about Lugia's deepest imagination, and you. The content isn't as hardcore as you thought it would be, but it does have some hints of intimacy you never expected to reach when you first reentered Lugia's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your own amazement, you watch Lugia imagining you exploring her body, but in a more intimate tone, specially focusing on her reproductive system. You see yourself reaching the uterus, and Lugia appearing there. Then you and your host engage on activities that hadn't ever crossed your mind, despite your mild attraction towards Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a big surprise to you to see your friend's imagination, and wonder if what you're seeing is how she feels. In the movie you see yourself and her almost mating. If anybody on the movie gets more cheeky, then you could as well end watching yourself entering in the realm of hard pornography. Much to your relief, the movie doesn't seem to go that far. Lugia seems to understand that you aren't sure about that, so the movie keeps being about touching and caressing each other's bodies. Lugia seems like a creative lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a short movie, like half an hour, but its was so impressive and realistic it seemed longer. When it ends, it looks like Lugia wants an opinion. You try to gather words to express yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that was...impressive...\"you say. Lugia smiles, and replies \"I'm sorry of this seems creepy. Maybe I'm confused with everything that has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and Lugia lets you go. \"It is getting late. Why don't you go to sleep? And...maybe tomorrow you could come here at the same hour. You could...try to imitate things you saw in the movie.\" she says, blushing again. You are dry for words again, and nod, unsure if you're wanting to do it. The mere thought of touching Lugia's body as freely as the body, including her private parts, is amazing, but you don't know if you do want to do it. You decide to stop thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room, hoping to sleep. You notice that Vaporeon isn't there nor in her Pok\u00e9ball, but you decide she is wandering around. You fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up and still notice that Vaporeon isn't on her bed. Still leaving that aside, you have breakfast, but you are reminded of this when Lugia sends food for your Pokemon. Then you tell her about Vaporeon's dissapearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia reacts quickly. \"I'm going to stop all body process now, except the heart and breathing. There are others I can't stop, but I won't finish them until you find your Vaporeon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she is in trouble or in some part she shouldn't be?\" you ask, afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't feel her, but I'm sure she is inside me. She isn't on my brain nor in my reproductive system, I know that. You'll have to find her by yourself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thinking where Vaporeon could be. She has always been the curious type, and could be anywhere inside Lugia, maybe even in parts you don't want to see. You swallow your pride and start searching. Vaporeon isn't in the Observatio Chamber, nor in the storage nor in other similar places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if Vaporeon would disobey you. She is quite fast, and could be in the least expected place, on the other side of Lugia's body. </span></div></div>",

You started your search by looking in the Food Container, going through the freezer, the wine chamber, and the dining area without much luck. Looks like Vaporeon wasn't hungry in the last few hours. She didn't even came here for the fish meats, which are her favorite foods. Where could she be?, you thought as you returned to your personal bedroom to perform one last check before making any further decisions. Still.......there was no sign of her. You remembered that Lugia told you that your Pokemon isn't in any of the chambers you previously visited, you guessed that Vaporeon probably wandered off into some unexplored areas.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can't detect her location within me, Vaporeon most likely went into the part of my body that is off my locating range. The original intention of such systems is to insure the total privacy of a person like you within me; those are places you go to when you just need to be alone for a while.\u00a0If you were to be in one of those organs, I wouldn't be able to tell if you are there unless you tell me.\u00a0Oh, why does my own body has to work against me in such time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Don't panic yet, Lugia. Do you know where can she possibly be?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are several like the personal bedroom, and the private chamber in my uterus, but I think the one Vaporeon most likely will be in is the Store Complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the little chamber where stuffs appear when you step onto a platform? The Store Complex is where all of that stuffs come from. Think of it as a hybrid of a factory and a shopping center put together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds kinda dangerous for Vaporeon\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, I already shut down the production line, so risks are small.\", Lugia assured, \"Let's go on your search now. We don't wanna take too long. You can ask me anytime you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are going to find Vaporeon no matter what happens. You started by walking through tunnels that you haven't previously taken, intent on finding your beloved Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hour worth of walk later, you reached a large chamber with an imposing, tall structure that look like a 10 story version of a mall and made from translucent membranes. If memory serves you right, this complex could possibly be a contender with the world's most immense mall. You saw a sign that tells you this is the Store Complex and the various amenities offered within. You entered through a sphincter near the first floor and began your search through what could be the largest shopping complex you've ever been to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a long day.\", you thought as you wondered if Lugia had the much-feared cologne department in here.</span></div></div>",

Something this huge inside Lugia, with all these divisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explore the first floor, seeing many compartments resembling stores. When you look inside each one, you can see an specific class of products. You see stuff you had never dreamt about, and stuff you never would wish to have, but after seeing many of the things Lugia can give you, you can't avoid adding a lot of new stuff to your wishlist, and can't wait to pick them up before the day ends. But you still pick up a few stuff you think could be useful to catch Vaporeon again. A few toys, a small bag of nuts, and others. You look around searching for more useful stuff, but you often notice you space out looking at the incredible variety of products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing into each compartment, you notice that you have been checking around for one hour. You walk until you find two passageways, one going towards the second floor, and one that goes to what could be a basement. You go upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many more compartments, and while searching for Vaporeon is your highest priority, you still spend time looking around. The second floor seems to be mostly for technological stuff, while the first one was for more common stuff. In the compartments of the second floor you encounter portable TV, laptops, and a lot other stuff you can't take with you, but when you enter into another one, you find something you never thought would ever see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the object from the floor of the store and read the description attached to it. It is a translator, made like a collar. You are ecstatic. This can strengthen your friendship with your Pok\u00e9mon, if you find enough translators. Luckily you do, but you have to leave some of the toys you had picked up before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the second floor, after checking every compartment. Vaporeon isn't in any of them, so there is only one part left. Lugia had said that this place had a factory somewhere, and you suppose it is down there. You find the path towards the basement, and enter. It is darker than the rest of the mall, so you use a flashlight you picked up before. The light is good enough, but it doesn't illuminate everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the main area of the factory, and find a sign. To your left there is the factory itself, while the right path leads to where the defective and discarded products are. You instinctively start through the right side, as you think it could be dangerous, depending of how the bad products are disposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia, if Vaporeon where over there, what dangers could she encounter?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. It is mainly an storage, but it doesn't mean that there aren't paths she couldn't take, as all of them are completely open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a few paths coming from there. One leads towards a part where I repair the products, where she could be hurt by what I use. I also dispose of the products by crushing them and dumping the rest into my bowels. The other option is where the products are made, and she can get lost easily. Nothing is active, but she could still enter them. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to imagine what could happen if Vaporeon stumbled upon any of those options while it was active. You enter the storage, and look around. On a corner you find a lot of cotton and other stuff used on plushes, and on top of them, sleeping, there is Vaporeon. You are happy, and run towards her, with Pok\u00e9ball on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice how loud your steps sound. The noise wakes up Vaporeon, and she gets startled by the light of the flashlight. She runs scared, and you throw the Pok\u00e9ball. You miss, and it hits the ball while Vaporeon runs towards one of the entrances. After you pick the Pok\u00e9ball, you run towards the path and illuminate the sign. You read what it says and enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite Lugia telling you that all mom-essential body functions are stopped, you are still worried for her. The dark tunnel eventually gave way to a brightly lit chamber with large transparent bins on either side. A closer look at these bins revealed that the items are sorted according to the materials they are made from: glass, fiber, metal, etc. The discarded items include laptop with cracked screens, some shirts with off marks print patterns, Lugia plushies in the wrong colors, and even a broken crystal model of the Legendary Pokemon. In the rear of each bin is a large vent that leads downward. A warning sign posted beside reminds you that the vent will lead to the bowel where the junks will be compressed and recycled when possible. The implication slightly unsettled you. You hope that Vaporeon hadn't went down on of these vents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, out of the corner of your eye, you spotted Vaporeon dashing from her hiding spot deeper into the chamber. You followed her until she went under a long table filled with various items. This is definitely the repair area as there are countless electronics parts strewn across the table surface. You can see screws and bolts scattered across the table with what looks like the chassis of a T console. Lugia explained that she fixes thing whenever it is possible. If an item is\u00a0unrepairable, it will be disposed into the ocean. But as the Guardian of the Sea, she rarely did this, believing that the ocean should remain clean for both Pokemons and humans to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around the stuffs on the table some more, you focused your attention back onto your Vaporeon beneath. Kneeling down, you can see her huddled in one of the corner trembling in fear. Based on your experience, the only time that Vaporeon will act like this is when she encounters an unfamiliar surrounding. Lugia's body definitely fit that description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best effort to coax the Pokemon out of her hiding place. You bend yourself lower and gently signal with your hand for her to come out. On the first three tries, Vaporeon didn't even more an inch, remaining in the corner of the table. You used one of the food you got at the mall to slowly lure her out. The food worked, the Pokemon slowly crawled out and made her way toward the dried food in your hand. After finishing the food, Vaporeon curled around your leg and fell asleep. You retrieved your Pokeball and returned her inside. Vaporeon deserved some rest after her misadventure in Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and made the announcement to Lugia that Vaporeon has been found and that she is now with you. Upon hearing the good news, Lugia applauded greatly you and went on to restart her body function including the factory you're in. You returned to the ground floor to continue your shopping, you still got several floors to go and explore.</span></div></div>",

This time you looked around to find some stairs you may not have seen before. You did, almost in the corner of the place. You eagerly run upstairs until you reach your destination. This floor seems to contain food products related to food. Seeing how it was almost time, you tried many things, and there was many you liked. The fourth floor seems to be related to technology too, but the stuff was bigger and more complicated. There are many things you can't imagine the possible functions, but Lugia gladly explains to you everything about every piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are another two floor left.

It seems like a personal theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, I have heard many stories. Here you can see a selection of recent anecdotes I have heard from other Pok\u00e9mon, and myself, when available. Unluckily it has been rather scarce for some time! Mainly because I have been away from the other legendaries since I found you. Sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply saying it is okay, but you can't avoid feeling a bit disappointed. Seeing how there is only one floor left, you decide to see what is the last part of Lugia's mall. You enter the elevator again and press the top button. It doesn't take long before you reach the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open, and much to your surprise, you see a large room, with many different things on pedestals. You look around, trying to define the exact function of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is where I keep a showcase of what is and has been the most important things of my life. As you can see, many things I have talked you about before are here. Including a small representation of you\" she says happily. And effectively, you see a portrait of you along with a short description of your situation. You are flattered, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides me, what is the most important thing to you?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the center of the room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the center of the room you see a beautiful pearl, just bigger than you, but it is still the most beautiful thing you have seen. Mesmerized, you try to touch it, but your hand goes through it. Lugia chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is just a hologram. I have the real pearl here, on the shrine. It is tiny, but I'll use it to return you to normal, as it can strengthen my psychic powers. Want to see it? Come to the Observation Chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't take long before reaching the place. Once Lugia feels you there, starts walking deeper into the shrine, talking to you how she obtained it. But her happy conversation stops when she gets to the farthest part of the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?! Where is the pearl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to calm Lugia down, but she remarks that without it you won't be able to return to normal. She frantically looks around, until she finds prints on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Surely he must have entered here and taken it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be Ho-oh?\" you ask, fearing a retaliation from your former captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible, these are too small to be him, these aren't even from a bird. Wait, I'll try to channel my pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passes, while you wait for Lugia's results. Then she talks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it, and I don't like it. It is...inside another Pok\u00e9mon. And there is only one who could have it.\" she says, before exiting the shrine and starting to fly. After some time, you see she is heading towards a small cave near a beach. She lands on the entrance, and you feel the ground under you dissappearing. Soon you are in Lugia's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there is a Floatzel here. And we aren't in...very good terms. It must be some sort of revenge. I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infiltrate his body. Once you're in, search the pearl. I can't define in which part of his body it is. But remember, it is very important that he doesn't notice your presence. If he knows you're inside his body, this could very well be a repeat of what happened with Ho-oh. I'll take care of your Pok\u00e9mon while you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words makes you be afraid of your mission, but you nod and tell Lugia you'll do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Go\" she says, opening her mouth and extending her tongue on the rocky floor. On the distance you can see the Floatzel, asleep. It is much smaller than Lugia, but is huge compared to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quietly pondered for a few minutes. The pearl that can very well return you to normal now sits within another Pokemon. The thought of entering yet another Pokemon really does not go well with you, especially those that are on the enemy's side. With your experience in Ho-oh still fresh in mind, you don't want to know what it's like to end up in Floatzel's large intestine or anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to do this again?\", you asked Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but we have little choice but for you to head into Floatzel to retrieve the pearl. We just don't get along well. The last time we met each other, we destroyed several forests on this island by our blasts alone. If I were to confront him directly now about my stolen treasure, he might even destroy the pearl and flee. Could you think of consequences like that?\", Lugia said in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dreaded the potential result. Remaining shrunk forever. Definitely not something you would like to live through. After giving the mission a deep thought, you agreed with Lugia to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going on the mission, Lugia gave you a portable earpiece radio that you can use to communicate with her when you encounter a problem. She also told you the possibility that your search for the pearl may last for a few days to a week. You placed the device into your left ear and tested it with Lugia; it works perfectly. You and Lugia are confident that there is no chance for your communication to be intercepted since Floatzel isn't a psychic-type Pokemon. Now with everything ready, slowly and steadily, you made your way toward the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon's lair is just a few feet away from the sandy beach. The cave also contains a small fresh water hole from which Floatzel can drink. Man, Pokemons sure know how to choose the best spots to live at, you mused briefly. The moment you entered the shallow cave, you felt extremely chilly, as the warm sun gets blocked by the solid rocks towering over you like a canopy. Floatzel is sleeping peacefully upon a rock just steps away from you. With your small size, the Pokemon is easily at least 500 feet long. He is also lying in such a position that you can easily enter into his gaping, cavernous mouth. You went up to the rock that the huge Pokemon is on and tried climbing into his mouth which higher up that you thought it would be. From this location, the Pokemon's snoring has grown to unbearable decibels that you have to constantly shield your ears from the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are planning your next move, Floatzel suddenly stirred in his sleep, bringing one of his paws next to his gaping maw, just inches away from you. The abrupt movement startled you and you almost screamed in fright. But you quickly reminded yourself of the situation and only a muffled gasp escaped your mouth. Using the opportunity, you climbed onto the paw and prepared to make your way into the mouth. Getting to the top of the paw, you got a good view of Floatzel's mouth. The tongue is surrounded by a set of sharp fangs and teeth. With a long jump, you landed on Floatzel's tongue which caused you to bounce up and down several times. When everything finally settles down, you righted yourself up and crawled toward the Pokemon's throat and down into what could be another vast labyrinth of organs and chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling through an impossibly long esophagus, you landed in Floatzel's stomach with a plop. When your eyes adjusted to the dimness, you started to make out the general features in the stomach. You are now lying in a round pool of water and light acid in the center of the chamber. Fragments of seashells and clams from the last meal that the Pokemon had float on the surface of the liquid. Slightly disgusted by the concoction, you pulled yourself out of it and focus on the task at hand. Floatzel's stomach is remarkably different from both Lugia and Ho-oh's; first, there are several floors in it, at least nine. Each floor contains at least 10 openings that leads to other parts of Floatzel. You almost fainted at the vastness and complexity; if Ho-oh's body was difficult, this was beyond that. This could a grand palace if it weren't for the organic interior. Another difference is the fact that you felt little heat from the flesh surrounding you. This adds to the mysterious feel to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is little choice but to start at the first floor with one of the openings.</span></div></div>",

Maybe if Floatzel just ate the pearl it is at the bottom of it, and it is somewhat shallow, so you maybe you could retrieve it. \"Lugia, I know I just entered, but I may as well ask: if the pearl fell in a liquid, would it sink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would sink. It depends of the liquid\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say thank you, and focus again. The pearl isn't on the pool, and if Floatzel ate it, then it may as well be deeper in the digestive tract, through one of the sphincters of the first floor. You push the thought aside, and wish it wasn't the case, so you start by examining the entrances on the first floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look for any indications of what lies behind every possibility, trying to find out a way so you don't run in nasty surprises. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any, obviously Floatzel doesn't had plans to have a guest in his body, so it is mostly up to luck. You pick one randomly and hope you made the right decision, but doubted you would find the pearl behind the first choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you go through the sphincter and walk through the narrow tunnel, you try to imagine where Floatzel would hide the pearl. He wouldn't put protections, right? He didn't expect a human to enter and search it, so it is matter of finding it. When you try to focus on possible places, you get to the end of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in a chamber as high as the stomach. It is also divided by floors, you count three. But the most important fact about the chamber is that there is a huge column of water. It falls into a deep pool on the bottom, and from there it gets channeled through glass-like pipes to parts you don't know. The curious part is that the water is even going upwards in a vertical manner, so there is pressure. You comment the situation to Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a water type Pok\u00e9mon. His body is likely to work with water in most places. You know to swim, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't a very good swimmer, but you think you can hold your breath for a long time, and know to float, but the amount of water inside the body may be an obstacle. You examine the deep pool. The water is clear, so you see the bottom, but there isn't a sign of the pearl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I need to move. Maybe it'll be faster if I let the water carry me somewhere\" you think before plunging to the pool. You position yourself so you float, and approach one of the pipes. There is something that catches you off-guard. The whole organ moves, and you suppose this means Floatzel is awake and moving. You remind yourself to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath, and let the water carry you. You can see through the glass, but you can't define what is outside. Luckily the water is fast, and you are thrown into an organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in a big dome.There is a wide lagoon, and many whirlpools. It seems to be some sort of one-way station, but the best thing is that there is a dry place on a corner. You claim that corner as your resting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you leave some stuff there, you focus on where to go next. You need some sort of way to access the higher floors of the stomach, relying on the content of it, but you are worried about acids, so you need something to help you. But where to find one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Floatzel keeps discarded shells or something somewhere in his body. You doubt they get digested, so you set to search for one, and plunge into one of the whirlpools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strangely enough, you are not choking in the water. In fact, you are able to freely breath the water into your nose without any discomfort. Your best guess is that Floatzel probably use water in his body to store oxygen for the many deep dives that it takes daily. After spiraling for a minute or so, you reached the bottom of the lagoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor unknown reasons, you are able to stand in the water without needing to swim. You see various impeller-like protrusions that constantly churn the water while releasing air bubbles. As the bubbles got smaller and smaller from the force of the impellers, they eventually became indistinguishable from the water surrounding you. That must be how the Pokemon blend air with the water, you thought, and what enables me to breath here. Walking on the soft bottom of the lagoon, you see the remains of several clams and mollusks from Floatzel's previous meal, lying discarded in various locations. The remnants are so numerous that in some parts of the lagoon, the floor is completely covered. When you look even more carefully among the things, you even spotted some bone fragments from fishes. You know that some Pokemons are carnivorous but never thought that Floatzel is one of them. The last time you looked at your Pokedex, you remembered that Floatzels only eat seaweeds and plankton. Well.....the Pokedex registry will need some updating now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of strolling on the bottom, you saw nothing of interest other than random seashells and other debris on the bottom so you swam back up to the surface of the lagoon. When you surfaced from the water, you took a quick break at the dry corner you found a while ago. Then, by taking another glass tube on the other side of the lagoon, you found yourself back at the chamber with the massive waterfall. This time, you tried to find a way to get to the second floor of the chamber. You carefully eyed each of the glass tubes in the deep pool, locating on that seems to lead to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped into the pool and head for the tube. After another dizzying trip, you reached the second floor, emerging on the water surface from a circular opening in the floor. Climbing out of the water and standing up to take in the view around you. There is only one tunnel on this floor for you to take. You entered the passage and let it take you to whatever place it will lead you now. Soon, the tunnel ends at another sphincter. The strange thing is, there is an eye-like symbol formed by pulsing veins on it. Bright lights are emanating from the other side through a pin-prick hole in the center. As this isn't Lugia or Ho-oh, there are no signs indicating your location. You only shrugged as you touched the sphincter and opened it to the next chamber.</span></div></div>",

You spend a while just looking at the images in front of you, before snapping out of your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the chamber, you seem to be in the equivalent of Lugia's Observation Chamber and Ho-oh's Eye Chamber, as you can see the outside world. Floatzel seems to be swimming somewhere, but you're too scared to process information. If you're here, does that mean that Floatzel can see you? While you're paralyzed by fear you can see Floatzel hunting fishes. It isn't a nice scene, and soon pieces of fishes are everywhere you can see. The Pok\u00e9mon also seems to be reuniting small spheres, biting into shells of clams and extracting pearls from them. You see the pearl disappearing, and you suppose it got eaten. Looks like Floatzel collects pearls! Maybe Lugia's pearl is along with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully get out of the chamber, crawling slowly until you reach the sphincter that marked the entrance to the room. Once you're outside, you contact Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accidentally stumbled upon Floatzel's eyes and stayed there for fifteen minutes. Could he have seen me?\" you ask, hoping everything will be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he doesn't know you're inside him, it is likely he isn't paying attention to his eyes. You must be safe, but be more careful next time\" she replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Floatzel ate a pearl, so he collects them! Yours can be where the rest are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, he does collect pearls, but is quite selective. It is likely that he is testing the pearl by eating it. He once told me that if a pearl can withstand his stomach for a time, he sends it to where he stores his pearls. If the pearl has signs of being affected by the acids then it gets through the intestines and discarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could yours be with the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is possible, but it is a special pearl, and he knows it. He could have it in a completely different place, far from the other pearls. But maybe I'm wrong. You should go check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the stomach and observe the pearl. You'll have to wait some time, but after that, follow the pearl until it gets to the rest of the collection. But if you notice that the pearl and you are going down the intestine, turn back immediately and get back to the stomach so you search the correct path by yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that is a good plan. I'll do it\" you say, while taking a last glance through the tiny hole in the sphincter. Floatzel is getting out of the water and returning to his home. Without a second thought, you start walking towards the stomach. It takes you some time, but you finally open a sphincter and can see the stomach. You're on the floor just under the highest one, so there is no danger of being reached by the stomach contents. You can't see the pearl, but from time to time something shines at the bottom of the stomach, the pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you'll have to wait for a while.</span></div></div>",

You saw several pearls rolling around on the bottom of the stomach. Sloshing around in the clear water seems to make them shine even brighter than before. Then, with a light gurgling sound, you saw violet liquids began to drip down from the ceiling of the stomach. Initially mere trickles, the liquids eventually widened into torrential pillars that turned the pool of water into the same color. The pearls are beginning to be affected by the liquid; giving off a distinctive fizzling sound. It struck you that Floatzel was directing acids to the chamber to check on the quality of the pearls.  Some of them rapidly dissolved into a powdery white clouds under the effect of stomach acids while a few remained undamaged. The undamaged pearls are collected by another glass tube under the acid and transported to some unknown chambers with the Pokemon. You believe that Lugia's Pearl probably went through the same process and survived the 'test'. All you got to do now is find the organ in question, which proved to be a more difficult job than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it is unsafe to directly dive down to the acids to access the glass tube for now, you have to take an alternative route in Floatzel's body. You checked the floor you're on to see whether there are any other openings. There are two more tunnels on your floor. You chose between one of them and take the passage to wherever to leads. The way was just as slippery and twisting as the first one. Occasionally, the safest way for you is to slide on the slime-covered floor. Eventually, you reached another sphincter for you to open. A different symbol is marked on the entrance. This one seems to depict a sun and a moon arranged on top of one another.

The main object in the room are two round objects, on the walls, one on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach and examine one. It is a flat round structure, with many pushable pieces. After observing, you find out that this seems almost like a clock, there are no numbers, but you guess this is based on that. The clock is composed by many symbols and abstract graphics, one on each piece. It seems that each piece represents a different function, signaled to be done at one time of the day. You look around to identify the meaning of the symbols. There are the most basic processes, eating, sleeping and similar, but others are very abstract and you have no idea what they mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this clock only marks half of the day, so the one at the other side of the room must mark the other! It seems that the one on the left is related to the night and the one on the right is related to the day. Just to test the resistance of the pieces, you try to push around one of them, which seems to indicate hunger. It doesn't move more than a few inches, you seem to need strength to modify Floatzel's internal clock. You decide to take the time to memorize everything you can, so you aren't in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Floatzel spends a lot of time awake. Just a few hours in the night, and a nap of one hour in the day, around the time you entered his body. Looks like you only have an hour where you can walk freely without worrying about he noticing you, supposing you don't stay awake during the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done memorizing, you notice that some of the pieces have a strange bundle of flexible nerves connected to them. All those bundles go behind the clock and along the wall until they get inserted in a tiny hole on the wall, near the only other sphincter in the room. Both clocks have them. Looking more closely, you notice that all the nerves are connected to functions that are related to water and other liquids, all kinds of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the sphincter, and get ready to enter.

Many of them are transporting liquids of different colors and unknown uses. They are so numerous that they create a dazzling spectrum of glowing color that you thought only exists in paintings. The room is circular and about the same size as the body clock chamber behind you. The nerve from the previous room ran through the ceiling and are connected to various points on the tubes. A closer look reveals a near-transparent valve switch that regulates the flow of each liquids. There are no obvious ways for you to take control of the tubes in the chamber so you surveyed the area before making any further moves. Based on you observation, this chamber is probably near the center Floatzel's body, where regulating the flow of various liquids would be easier and more efficient. You surmised that some of the tubes might be for stomach acids, some for water, and others for unknown purposes yet to be discovered. It is also highly probable that the body clock in the previous chamber controlled the valves in this room too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking on the tubes again, you first tried twisting the valves on the glass tubes but found them to be stuck tight. You tried other ways of altering the flows of the liquids but no obvious effects are seen. After an hour of fruitless effort, you gave up. You told Lugia your current dilemma and she was quick to tell you that Floatzel's has a very predictable body schedule based on her experience. She told you that the Pokemon will probably drain his stomach within two hours after a meal or a pearl collecting session. As Floatzel probably does not have a manual way for a human to override his body function, Lugia suggested that you continue to look around his body further for more clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a sigh and slowly made you way back to the multi-floor stomach. The water at the bottom is gradually diluting back into its original state as evidenced by the light purple color. You found another glass tube that you hopped into, transporting you to the fourth floor in the stomach. Once again you are face with several openings to enter. You randomly picked one as always and entered it. This time, the passageway seems to be leading downward into the Pokemon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside. Floatzel is having a funny tickling feeling in his body. It started in his stomach and gradually made its way downward into his lower body. Although he was initially suspicious about it. Was that nefarious Lugia up to something again? But he later dismissed it as probably as some stomach upset caused by a bad pearl or clam he ate. He reassured himself that nothing could invade his body.</i></span></div></div>",

The trek is tiring, and you consider many times giving up and returning to search for another possibility, but you keep telling yourself that if it is so hard to get to your destination, then it must be something good. Maybe it is the organ you're looking for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach flat ground. You seem to be laying on bone, and judging for the steepness and the direction of the path, you must be standing on the pelvis right now. You are on a wide space, and you can see some organs around you. On each one of them there is a single entrance. You look carefully each one before deciding which one to take. You don't want to take any wrong turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose a round small organ on the other side, apparently on the other side of the body. You hastily open the entrance, to find that the organ is as small as you expected. There isn't much to look at. Just a single screen, and a tiny panel. You step in front of the screen. If you messed around this, would this mean that Floatzel could note it? The location of the organ seems to point that it isn't likely. Something like this was expected to be in the brain, so whatever you can do here may not be important for Floatzel, or maybe the water Pok\u00e9mon was careless, thinking he was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press one of the two buttons. The screen turns on, and there is a dial on the side. It seems to be a present recording of the outside, directly from the eyes, but it has a lot of static. You can't see what is happening outside. Floatzel is out of his cave, looking at the sky, and then something crosses the screen, something white and huge. You almost jump when you realize it may as well be Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the only other button there is. It seems that this is outdated technology or whatever this can be labeled as. A very simple interface appears, with only four options, without names. The outside seems to be the first one, and it doesn't even work right. The other two allows you to see inside the main room of the brain (this reminds you that you need to be careful to go unnoticed), and another one is locked. you have no idea what is there. The fourth one ended being different, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the image doesn't work, but you can clearly see a lot of pearls. Whatever is recording seems to be on a far side of the room, so you see most of the pearls. You look around, trying to see the one you're looking for. And there it is, in middle of the room. And for your amazement, it has no protection. You guess that the hard part is getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off the screen again, and leave. This surveillance room seems to be here because it simply doesn't work anymore, but maybe Floatzel has replaced it with something better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are again in the space on the pelvis. You're starting to get hungry, and you realize you didn't make a lot of plans about that. You have a few packages of dried food for you, but you didn't bring more. You need to find a way to obtain food, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Outside, Floatzel sees Lugia crossing the sky. For a moment he had thought Lugia could enter his body using psychic powers, so now he was relieved. He decided to take be careful.

Some of the organs are familiar like the stomach (which you visited) and the liver but others have unusual shapes and brightly colored that caught your attention. A good look at the organs around you doesn't reveal much about what they do other than the muscle strands that connects to their entrance. \u00a0Another quick jog through your memory of surfing through your Pokedex, a food storage area within Floatzel doesn't seem likely. The echoing sound of the large beating heart way above had the effect of making you even more desperate unlike the soothing effects of Lugia's. You are very hungry at this point and willing to do anything to find food, even if it means making you presence known to Floatzel.<br>\r\nForced to make a choice, you walk up toward one that is blue in color and has a elliptical saucer shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you passed through the entrance, you encountered a circular chamber with an intricate series of web-like structure that forms a conical structure overhead. The web is an intricate design that consists of small white disks interconnected by blue wire like objects.\u00a0The ground feels solid and smooth.You placed your hand on the floor which felt like concrete. The chamber's only other prominent feature is a tall pillar like structure that supports the entire web structure toward the ceiling. The spire is topped with an dome that has a transparent shell. A blue glow seems to emanate from within. You noticed that a\u00a0small elevator like ride is located in the center pillar. Once you walked into the device, the thing closes itself in a membrane and made its way up to the dome.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the membrane opened in the lift, you couldn't believe what you're seeing. You are in a chamber that looks like a bar.\u00a0But there is only a counter that can fit a single person. The walls are decorated with seashells and nets. Sounds of ocean crushing and soft winds are played from undetermined location. Several large light globes cast an azure glow into the chamber. Strangely, the lights also creates a water ripple effect. You immediately felt an ambient effect by being in this chamber. The rest of the space is occupied by screens, more panels,\u00a0and other gadgets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over to the bar table and made yourself comfortable. A menu is placed on the counter, you started reading it to see what is offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Outside, Floatzel stared blankly at the sky, wondering about how to face Lugia should she come looking for trouble. Just to make sure, he even rewinded parts of his memory to the part whete he is hunting for food and to Lugia's brief\u00a0appearance in his sight to check for signs of anomaly. Floatzel failed to notice a small dark speck that appeared at the lower corner of his eyes during his hunting, thinking that it's sea debris.</i></span></div></div>",

You aren't surprised to see that there are many drinks that seem to have alcohol as an ingredient, but there are a few dishes that seem okay. But how to order it? You can't say it aloud, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, trying to see other clues. There is a strange device on the far side of the counter. It has a single slot, maybe to insert the menu. You place the menu on the slot, and wait. Nothing seems to happen, until a hole opens in the ceiling and food falls directly on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems a rather colorful mix of fishes, not what you wanted to pick from the menu, but you aren't going to complain. You taste it, and while it could be better, it is edible, so you carefully eat it. You encounter bones and other parts of the fish, obviously the food didn't go through the complete cooking process, so it has a few bad surprises. You won't be getting any better for now. Investigating a bit more, you find small containers you can carry, enough for many portions. Knowing that maybe it couldn't be possible to return here later, you take the chance to reintroduce the menu on the slot, many other types of food falling on the counter. You gather what you can on the containers and place ice on them, just in case. You hope that the containers have something that doesn't let food rot. You also gather a few drinks, and plan to be careful with them. They certainly will last much longer than the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're set to resist at least three days without having to come back here, you return to the ground. Things seems to look better than before! You have food, and you have a place to sleep! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for some way out. You want to return to the upper body, at least to be closer to the spot you had chosen to sleep. It is almost night. You find a small sphincter hidden by some of the tissue of the walls. You crawl through the sphincter, wondering why it is so small. But it seems to be going to where you want, as it goes upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep crawling until you fall down on some liquid. Much to your surprise, it isn't water. It is much thicker than any liquid, but doesn't seem nasty either. Looking around, you're on a thin tunnel, extending to both sides. You start tumbling through the syrup-like mix, wondering where you are, but wherever you're going, it is starting to get colder. The liquid around you is starting to freeze too. It is true that a Water type is likely to be able to produce ice somewhere, but Floatzel doesn't seem like one of them. Could this icy liquid have any other use? Still, you need to get out of it soon or you may risk hypothermia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The frigid air caused your breath to condense into visible white smokes. You started wondering if Floatzel knows how to use 'Ice-type' moves (which you know isn't really possible), then what else could he do that you didn't know. Not wanting to stay in tunnel any longer you began the arduous journey of trying to make it out of this freezing labyrinth alive. You began at one end of the tunnel that seems to lead upward but you have no idea whether or not it'll take you to the intended destination. As a precaution against slipping on the increasingly ice-filled tunnel, you planted your hands and legs into the \"snow\" for firmer grips. During your ascent, you discovered that the freezing wind came from small holes located along the diameter of the tunnel. Floatzel must've used some form of reverse dynamic to produce temperature this low, you thought. After minutes of climbing, your hands are trembling uncontrollably from the cold and you couldn't feel your feet anymore. The slush has become nearly unbearable for you as it 'burns' your hand. Despite the challenge, you still got to move forward; the scary thought of losing your life in Floatzel's body provided you with the incentive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw the end of the tunnel ahead, you couldn't be more overjoyed. You scrambled toward the exit and made it into the open space. The warmer air was a very welcomed amenity for your nearly frostbitten body. You lay on the ground for an uncertain amount of time, allowing the blood in your body to warm up again. After about an hour or so, you felt well enough to stand up again, you realized that you are in another chamber entirely now. You are in some kind of large atrium-like interior. Bone like materials covered the walls and floor around you. Much to your surprise and fear, you saw a large than life models of Floatzel and Lugia that is situated at the dead center of the room. The statue is situated on a pedestal several feet high. The two are posed in a dramatic battle in which Floatzel seems to have the upper hand. Upon closer look at the thing, there are several things that you can think about. The materials of the Pokemons felt very life-like, especially those deep penetrating brown/blue eyes that seem to be watching you. You touched the furs and tail which are soft and comfy. You notice that a sign fixed to the pedestal near you: <i>The Dramatic Victory Envisioned: An artwork that depicts the eventual <b>triumph</b> of Floatzel over Lugia. Materials and subjects are made as realistic as possible by using actual samples as basis.</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the short description, you look at the statue for a few more minutes before you notice that there is another hole right behind the statue. You went toward the hole and continue onward to the next location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in Floatzel's complex body system, a screen panel flashes <i>\"Guest Detected.....Determine if subject is hostile.....Utilize silent observation with no interference with subject.\" </i></span></div></div>",

Not as comfy as the ones you're used too, but it is okay. There aren't other things in the room. It is possible that this is a provisional guest room, and if Floatzel for some reason had to have somebody inside him, the room would have other things.

You had left some in who knows what part of the body, you don't remember, but it isn't necessary to get them back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the bed, trying to think.

Are you still awake?\" you ask using the device Lugia had given you for your ear. Yes, Lugia is awake. You ask her about Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...his mentor. Many years ago. I taught him everything he knows, and helped him to have more powers than any other of his species. He is close to being as strong as most legendaries, I taught him well. It is a shame that he started to hate me for some reason. We have fought many times, and in the last one I barely triumphed.

Be ready to lie if you are caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a while. Floatzel seems to have a rancorous personality, so maybe...as long as you don't do anything wrong...it'll be okay. It is still better to prevent, so you decide to keep being as stealthy as possible. Soon you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Floatzel notes the alarm inside him. Nothing like this had happened before! How can it be possible? He does a quick scan of the body before finding the guest in the room. \"A human?\" Maybe it would be good to let the human do whatever it wants for now. Doesn't seem like a threat, but Floatzel closed any path towards his most prized possessions, at least for now. He also opened any path that could be used as an exit.

Usually, you would just press the reset button on the watch and go back to your sleep. But being inside an enemy Pokemon made you more vigilant about your surroundings. You picked up one of the containers carrying food and opened it. In the next 15 \u00a0minutes, you treated yourself to some of the foods you ate yesterday; \u00a0you're enjoying one of the grilled fishes and some delicious \u00a0egg roes \u00a0and some kind of sweet infusion tea. With your breakfast finished, you gather what little personal belongings you have brought and head for the exit, beginning another day of searching for the pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the hotel room behind you, you returned to the statue room and found another hole for you to walk in. The path took you further upward to the mid-section of Floatzel. Based on your experience the last day and from what Lugia had said, you realized that both Pokemons have many organs in common; which you think is the fact that Lugia is Floatzel's mentor. You thought about what could have caused the relation between them to become frozen. Was it the zealous quest for more power? A traumatizing incident? Or is there a deeper story to this?, you thought. Although you are only in here to retrieve the pearl, you couldn't resist the desire to learn more about the background between Lugia and Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reached another sphincter in the tunnel. You entered it and discovered a room with a bunch of wires interconnecting in a grid pattern to various computer terminals on the edge of the chamber, a lot of the computers are flashing random letters and symbols with a low hum. Attempts to decipher the symbols on the displays are useless, as you cannot read untranslated \"Pokemonese\". And asking for help would almost certainly broke your cover and defeat the whole point of being here. You walked around a bit more a found a computer with a larger screen to use. Something about it tells you that this one is responsible for everything that goes on in this chamber. You found a button layout beneath you and began pressing keys to see what they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Floatzel woke up to the sound of the notification system in his brain. Although initially confused by the sound, the Pokemon eventually remembered that he detected a human within his body. Focussing himself, Floatzel performed another scan and found the human playing with his self-termed PokeConnect computers near the middle part of his body. The Pokemon activate an active surveillance signal to keep track of everything.

It is possible, but you have no way to know, at least for now. You decide to pay attention carefully to the signs and letters on all the screens, to try to find out the reason for these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Floatzel is getting tired of watching the human. The guest doesn't seem to be doing anything besides trying to figure out the function of the computers. It is basically a way to be linked to other Pok\u00e9mon, in any part of the world. But it looks like the human can't understand the language, how disappointing. Floatzel had left a couple messages to try to define the human's reasons to be inside him, but it is going to be worthless if one can't communicate properly. If the human proves to not to be a menace then maybe it would be okay to traduce the language to something the guest can understand. Meanwhile Floatzel decides to change tactics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly forms a new path to the Pearl Storage. If the human is going for them, then it is expected that the human will go straight to that point. Then he lays a trap in middle of the path, to get rid of the unexpected habitant of his body. Floatzel connects the path to the Pok\u00e9Connect computers room, but doesn't open it yet. First he creates a new road, that leads to the organs that direct air to the lungs, the large floater and other parts that needs air. Then connects it to the room the human is in.

Finally, the part you're looking for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you step towards the left entrance, a sudden thought comes to your mind. Can it be this easy? Maybe...maybe it would be good to wait and enter there later. You doubt that Floatzel would make this easy. But if this is a test, then you are caught!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to play safe, now you remember the place and can return later if at the end this isn't a test. You enter the path leading to the...Air Pumps. Whatever that is.</span></div></div>",

But again, the notion that the Pokemon realizes that you're in his body isn't going well with you. If Floatzel knows that I'm looking for the pearl, wouldn't he already had me expelled from the body....or worse imprisoning me and making me do things that makes Ho-oh looks benevolent in comparison. You shrugged off those thoughts and decide to focus at the task at hand: going down the tunnel to the Air Pumps. You can feel the waves of wind blowing in your direction as you scaled the passage. You eventually reached a split path that diverge in a V shape. A small sign contains the simple outline of a pair of lungs. The sign contains an interesting addition, a floatation-like organ in a U-shape that is connected to the lungs. Seeing no point in choosing, you took the one to your left. When you reached the lung, you are greeted by the rush of even more warm air. The tunnel you entered from is situated at the base of the organ which you estimated is 50 feet high. You observed how air entered through another hole all the way on the top. As the air passes into the lung you're in, they go through some kind of bristles that resemble large trees that is suspended from the ceiling. Although you know anatomy and the respiratory process quite well, it is another thing to actually see it in process. After the lung is entirely filled with air, the bristles began there work by sucking the oxygen into interconnecting tubes which then transport them into yellow veins in the middle for delivery to other parts of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing enough of the huge lung you decide to see what the U-shaped organ you saw on the sign was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unknown to the trainer, Floatzel has been monitoring his action the entire time. The Pokemon preferred the trainer to remain ignorant about his surveillance. The human seems uninterested in the pearls, the Pokemon thought, maybe he is just curious about the functioning about my body. If that's the case, maybe I'll just play him around my body for some much needed entertainment. Floatzel grinned as he thinks of all the things he can do with the human as he sensed him approaching the floater organ. I'll leave a surprise for him later.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There isn't a single clue about Floatzel's purposes. You wonder...if there could be a way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before you reach your destination. You know that the organ you're in is the species' most outstanding physical trait. And well, while you hadn't expected it to be the most amazing thing ever, you can't avoid feeling strangely relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're enveloped by the yellow hue casted by the walls. Your surroundings move constantly, ad you have trouble, you fall down frequently. The floor and the walls are rubbery, as you had expected, and the air around you is moving constantly. Everything ends being relaxing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk, breathing deeply. Although the floater is somewhat deflated, it still has a lot of air and space, and it seems pure. While you walk, you think about the recent event. There isn't still contact from your host. You're starting to wonder if he even cares about your presence. It is better than being abused and treated like a speck of dust, but you can't avoid feeling a bit...disappointed. At least this could mean you have enough freedom to walk around his body, free to retrieve the pearl, but if he found out your presence, how would he react to you entering his Pearl Storage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of somehow obtaining a false pearl to fool Floatzel crosses your mind. It is an awesome idea! You try to contact Lugia to tell her about it, but then you slip. You was so focused on your thoughts that you didn't notice you had approached to the end of the road. In front on you there was a big hole, you remember that the floater goes along the body until it end around the chest. And you slipped, you're now falling down the floater. It is very high, and if it weren't for the soft tissue, this could very well be your death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall for many seconds, sometimes hitting the side. When the floater gets thinner, you hit both sides until you finally fall to the bottom, to a point that isn't much bigger than you. You take a moment to recover from the fall, and look around. The thought of climbing back isn't possible. You can't get a grip on the tissue. Luckily for you, there is a single sphincter, although it is small, you think you can fit through it. But the worse thing about the place you're in, is that the air around you isn't pure. Later you would deduce that the used air and dioxide would gather where you was. Instinct kicks in, you know you shouldn't stay long in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch the opening and crawl through it, instantly falling. The tube you entered is wider in the inside, but you don't have time to look at your surroundings. The air currents takes your light body, and you don't know what will happen now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Floatzel was thinking about what he could do with the human when he feels something funny and slightly painful. It doesn't take long for him to realize that the human entered another part of his respiratory system. If one didn't do anything soon, the human could be expelled from his body with the rest of the stale air. As a precaution Floatzel covered his nose so nothing would come out of it. He didn't want the human to be out yet, not now that he just found out the unexpected guest can be harmless. Floatzel hopes that things will be okay.</i></span></div></div>",

For some reason, you find the air very stale and difficult to breath, but that not your concern for now as you are more interested in finding a way to stop your fall. The winds in the tunnels grew stronger and stronger the deeper you went in. Soon, you bumped up against a wall of flesh that stopped your fall. You felt as if your head was about to split apart from the force of the fall. Cringing and holding your head in pain, you remained dizzy and disoriented for a good minute or two before you regained enough consciousness to survey your new surrounding. It looks like the end of the air tunnel but something seems odd about the floor you're on. There is a thick layer of orange fur on the ground; without doubt, those fur certainly helped reduced the impact. The air has fallen completely still....not a wisp of wind can be felt. Confused about this, you bent down to touch the fur. It resembles a thick carpet and it extends all the way to the circular edge of the tunnel. It feels as if the 'carpet' was blocking the path. You attempt to pry open the edge as if it were a sphincter. The floor refused to budge an inch. It left you scratching your head as to what could this mean? Did Floatzel discovered that I'm in him? Am I now imprisoned or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Outside, Floatzel sensed that the human has come to a stop at the entrance to his nose. He makes a quick scan of the human's body to make sure he isn't hurt. The Pokemon only detected a few minor bruising but the human will be fine.  He guessed that the human is probably very confused now about what just happened. Although Floatzel is unable to read minds, he is really amused by the human's curiosity of his body. Floatzel didn't know how the small human came to be in his body, but he'll take the opportunity to play him to his liking without the human realizing that he is aware of him. Floatzel took a deep sniff in his nose to take the human back in to depths of his body thinking of where he should be dropped next.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are dreading the prospect that Floatzel has discovered and trapped you, there was suddenly a strong suction force coming from above the tunnel, lifting you off your feet. A loud scream escaped from your mouth as you are being carried in the tunnel. The furry floor where you previously stood open up below, allowing you to briefly see bright lights before being sent deeper into Floatzel's body. The air in the tunnel feels much fresher now. What was that?, you thought. Did I just see outside a while ago? If you did, you wouldn't really be surprised about it since you are, after all, in the Pokemon's respiratory system. But that still doesn't explain the floor. You are left to conclude that is most likely a Pokemon's equivalent of nose hair. The strong winds send you tumbling in a head turning spin. What you didn't is a new path opening up ahead, transporting you to the next destination. All you can feel is that you are traveling higher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Floatzel silently laughed as he hear the human scream as he was sucked back in. He sure can be interesting, he thought. The good thing is that the human seems uninterested in his treasure. He calculated that the human just been through roughly less than a quarter of his body part if he exclude the Pearl Chamber. While still entertaining himself to the idea of the human, Floatzel felt his stomach rumbling from hunger and realized that he hasn't eaten yet. He walked toward the sea and took a plunge into the deep water to hunt for some food. As he swam in the cold seawater, Floatzel opened his mouth to swallow whatever prey he saw in front of him. Within a quarter of an hour, Floatzel managed to gather fishes, shellfishes, and various other edible things; enough for him to fill him and plenty more to send to the storage stomach. As he finished the last of the seaweed in his mouth, an idea suddenly crossed Floatzel's mind. As a good host, maybe it's time that I treat him to some fine foods and a nice, luxury room with good views from my eyes, Floatzel thought as he began to rearrange and modify his body interior. He recalled the things that he saw humans used and created an inner environment that the human will love. When the he sees what I've prepared for him, he'll want to stay in me forever and I'll get to have a new 'pet' to play with.......</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gather enough energy to stand up and look around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan when you realize you're once again in front of the eyes. You had already visited this place, coming back seems useless, but you notice that there is something different. There is furniture, made of the materials you had expected. You approach slowly to it, now knowing for sure that you have been found. But it isn't as bad as you expected, as you sit on the chair and see the food on the table. It has better quality than the one you had collected before, and you're thankful for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you eat, you're wondering if this also means that he'll be able to listen to you. Talking to Lugia can be risky now, unless you find a way to use your thoughts. You try to configure the device on your ear, without Floatzel noticing. You find what you're looking for, and test it. It works, so you aren't worried anymore, you enjoy the rest of the lunch. You have to admit that maybe getting caught wasn't a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done, you walk around the chamber, watching the scenes outside. It is the normal life of your actual host, nothing special. When you are considering leaving the place and continue your mission, a hole opens on the floor. You approach and try to find out where it leads. Despite the seemingly good intentions, you have doubts. \"Go.\" you hear, a voice you hadn't heard before. It doesn't take you long to find out who it is, and seeing that maybe it would be good not to upset him, you obey. You jump into the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall on your bed, on the same bedroom you had slept in last night, but this place has changed too. Now it has more stuff in it, and on a corner you see the stuff you had left somewhere in his body. You look around, trying to see if there is anything special. Everything seems normal. You consider that maybe it is time to try to...finally ask what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hello?\" you say loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human.

You are pushed through the tight tubing and brought to another chamber. There is a table and a chair for you to sit on. You promptly took a seat. A screen turns on in front of you and a set of keyboard materialized on the table. The screen now shows the cavern which the Pokemon lives in. You can see something moving off-screen from the right side. Suddenly, Floatzel walks into the camera and faces you on the display. You are shocked by how casually the Pokemon seems about humans, especially one that is in his body right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again, human.\", the Floatzel said politely, \"I'm Floatzel, as you probably know, it is so good to see you here in my one-on-one meeting room. Within this room, you will be able to do private conversations with me. You can speak directly to me as I can hear you in there. If you don't feel like talking, you are welcomed to use the keyboard in front of you to type your response.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement with the Pokemon. Floatzel doesn't seem so bad after all, you thought. But still, I better try to keep on his good side if I were to live. Absolutely no mention of Lugia, you reminded yourself. The Pokemon seem to notice your silence and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may wonder, why are you seeing me if you are in me. Short explanation, I can temporarily create a second invisible conscious that can be used as a scouting device or a camera as I am doing now. Well, back to the point of me getting you here. I'm curious, as a human, how did you end up being so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent. Floatzel gave you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to be afraid, human. The room you're in is impervious to any sorts of psychic interception, even from that cursed Lugia. You can safely talk to me here.\", Floatzel said with an emphatic scorn on Lugia's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became a little worried about the situation; You will not be able to communicate with Lugia during this meeting. Looks like I'm by myself now, you thought. After much thinking, you began to explain how you got to be shrunken mysteriously without any apparent form of psychic power. You specifically left out Lugia and told Floatzel that you encountered a lot of Pokemons along the way that are keen on eating you up and how you had to travel long, challenging ways to finally get to this island to find the solution to your predicament. You made up stories of how you are trapped in countless stomachs and endure constant torment at the claws of your captor (which is a half-truth) in unmentionable ways. At last you finished your story by saying a Peliper dropped you here and you entered him unknowingly while seeking shelter during dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a lot to endure in such short time.\", Floatzel said, \"You don't have to worry much, I'm not one of those mean Pokemons. And by the way, since you're new in here, why don't I show you around a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....I would love to\", you said, doing your best to look polite and happy.</span></div></div>",

You can hear Floatzel, but he comments that it feels odd talking alone, so he resorts to giving you a small device so you read his words. You're being guided around, and much to your dismay, you are shown many places you had visited in your short stay inside Floatzel. You suppose that he wanted to show you the most important places for you, and you hope that the next ones are new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't pay attention to what Floatzel says, it is stuff you had already supposed or knew for sure. Maybe Floatzel has noted your disinterest, as he seems to be more frustrated at the lack of enthusiasm. He finally decides to ask you what is going on. While you're returning once again to the stomach to explore the higher levels of the organ, you receive a message from your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I expected a better reaction.

It is empty, just enter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey. You enter the sphincter, and are greeted by a tiny and empty room. Once Floatzel feels you're in, five spheres appears in front of you, each one of them differently colored. They are made of a material you have never seen, but they still remind you of the pearl you're supposed to be looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's play a game. I'll place each one of these balls around my body, in different places. You won't have a time limit to find then, but when you do I'll show you my personal treasure.

What are the rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll hide each one in a different type of organ. Once you step out of this room, you'll receive five clues describing the type of organ it is in. That is it.</i> After you read this, you see the balls sinking into the floor and to who knows what parts.

Still, there is nothing to lose by going to where you think it is. You check the entrances around you, looking for one that goes upwards. You finally find one, and start the trek to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're walking, you decide to spend time thinking about the answers to the other clues. You meditate about your past experiences inside the bodies of other Pok\u00e9mon, well, the only two you have been in. You can think of a few places that can fit the clues, and at the end you are sure of the answers for clues number #2, #3 and #5, but you can't figure out the 4th one. When that is out of the way, you focus on the clue you're trying to solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still think that the location is up there, either close to the nose or the mouth. And judging by the clue, you shouldn't look towards the exits, but the opposite direction. You have also heard that the eyes are windows to the soul. Can it be? Could the first ball be in the eyes? You are doubting that the ball is in one of the first places you have visited in your temporal stay inside Floatzel, but everything points towards that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the mouth. When you see the long tongue and the teeth, you decide that maybe you should check for entrances, in case you aren't right. You know that there must be a way to the eyes somewhere, but how to reach? If that isn't the answer, then you should look around for other possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time to walk around the mouth. Much to your surprise, nothing is moving. It feels that Floatzel is asleep, which is a point in your favor, so you can explore without him doing something. You look carefully to the roof of the mouth, for any possible paths. You also sneak under the tongue, but only manage to soak yourself in saliva. You think that it was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your examination, you deduce that definitely the mouth hasn't the new entrance to the eyes. You return to the back of the mouth, and look at the other side of the throat. There are small paths where you can stand, but there isn't a way there. The only way is to ascend more. You look around until you find ridges on a side, you use it to climb until you reach another floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you guess that you're now in the nose airway. Now that you think it, didn't you somehow reach a way higher by getting sucked with air? You doubt that it'll be possible to reach it again. You guess that the only option would be to trek along the nose until you find a way. Would you need to get outside to find it? You doubt it, but one never knows with this hose.</span></div></div>",

The wind in here is particularly strong, and you got to have a rough idea of the timing of Floatzel's inhaling and exhaling. Otherwise, you might lose your balance and get blown out of the nose like a cannonball. When the wind gets too strong for you to go on, you resort to grasping on the thick nose hairs that lines the entire length of the tunnel. Some of the hairs felt moist and firm, many of them have dusts, mucus, and other foreign particles trapped in their intricate web. After another steep climb, you reached the opening at the nostrils. You can see the outside again, but that's not your top priority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a narrow ledge to stand on the dark surface of the nose. You carefully sidled your way up the groove that eventually lead to the top of the nose. Once on top, you see that both eyes are shut and some distance away from you. Making sure that Floatzel is still, you slowly moved across the snout and closer to one of the eyes. You chose the one to your right, figuring that the wording of the clue probably has multiple meanings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you arrived at the front of the eye, it suddenly shot open, creating a large gust that almost blew you away. The intricate patterns in Floatzel's brown eye are like the random strokes of a pencil underneath a microscope. You noticed the reflection within the eye which provides you with a good panorama. Due to the concave shape, the image is enlarged and distorted. You can see the cave entrance and the sun shining through a set of trees. The reflection is so crystal clear that you could make out the shape of the clouds in the sky and   Floatzel's paws in the foreground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out toward the eye and touched your own reflection. The instance your hand is on the surface of the pupil, you felt yourself being sucked inward. The force is tremendous and you put up no resistance as you are dragged through the window.</span></div></div>",

You thought that at the other side there would be the eye chamber, but looks like it isn't a thin membrane, it is a whole space, filled with who knows what. You aren't surprised you can breath, but the feeling of the sticky substance is annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe environment is pitch black, but after a while of moving randomly everything around you changes. Images of landscapes, stuff under the sea, other Pok\u00e9mon and even Floatzel himself are around you. The images are distorted and oddly skewed, so it is obvious it isn't real. Maybe they are reflections of the outside, maybe from the past or something, remains of stuff that has been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep moving, almost swimming, almost walking, observing around you. The images may be a distraction for you not to find the ball you're looking for, but everything is surrealistic and does distract you. You don't even know the color of the ball. You wonder if you could accidentally leave the eye before finding what you're looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are moving upwards, until you crash against the top of the eye. Once you notice that there is no more space up there, you glance under you. There is something that doesn't belong to the images, something solid and round. You are happy when you recognize it is one of the balls you're looking for. You try to swim as fast as you can, but the sticky environment hinders your progress. The ball is moving too, so you waste a lot of time chasing the ball through the slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally grasp the ball. Once you have it stored, you start to look around for a way out. The images must be coming from somewhere, so you go towards the opposite direction. If they are stuff Floatzel is seeing right now, then maybe going towards the opposite side will make you be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble upon a firm membrane at the back. Despite how solid it is, you can pass through it without leaving any marks. You hurry to leave the eye, and fall towards the floor of the chamber you're in. Looking around, you see that you're once again inside the eye chamber you had visited before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found one!\" you yell. Floatzel doesn't reply, but you know that he is awake. Outside you can see what he is doing, he seems to be in his cave, continuing with his everyday life. You turn your back towards the outside world and leave the eye. It is already dark, you spent a lot of time inside the eye, but you think you can find the second one before you decide to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Honored as the worthy captain.</i> You assumed that by captain, the Pokemon meant something to do with being a leader, being in control of the situation. Does it have something to do with the control room?, you thought. The last time you were in Ho-oh's control room, you could control his body but not his conscious. It makes complete sense if you take into consideration that the control room is the only part of the body that can allow you to be a 'captain'. On the other hand, the Pokemon's mind still exists instead of being overridden by your control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this conclusion in mind, you try to find your way to Floatzel's brain by taking a passage that leads upward. Once you entered the tunnel, the surrounding began to change. The floor and walls became more rubbery and overhead clearance became higher. The size of the tunnel now rivals that of a cavern. You are left to wonder if Floatzel would let you in his brain so easily since this is literally his center. Shouldn't he be safeguarding all the information stored in there? But if he placed one of the balls in there, it means that I'm gaining his trust, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a 5 minute walk to finally see the end of the tunnel. Here you are greeted with a large pink mass of brain flesh. The fold and wrinkles on the brain are large enough to be valleys and mountains from your perspective. Flashing strobes of lights are scattered here and there, dotting the nerves surrounding the mass. If memory serves you right (pun unintended), Floatzel's brain is larger than Ho-oh's. There is a single spiral stairway near the brain stem that goes into the bottom of a lobe. You climbed the stairs into the brain and find a lobby-like chamber with  two sets of chairs and tables placed on either side. The brain interior looks more like an actual building complete with an ornate floor, stairs, and framed pictures of Floatzel himself in heroic pose. There is a large sign that overhangs the ceiling displaying directions:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nData Center*<br>\r\nControl Room<br>\r\nInstinct Management*<br>\r\nSpecial Bedroom<br>\r\nMemory Bank*<br>\r\nLugia Archives*<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n* Access to these areas will require permission from Floatzel. Please ask your host for more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reviewed the signboard again; look like Floatzel has restrictions after all. Only the Control Room and Bedroom can be visited. But one of the restricted  places caught your eyes. What does the \"Lugia Archives\" contain? Will you get to see the contents? Hopefully if the Pokemon grants you access later on, you can better understand the relationship between those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the direction toward the control room, intent on finding the ball and ending the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is much more limited, maybe because Floatzel doesn't want you to have complete control of his body, but it still has the most basic stuff for you to control it. You look around, looking for the ball itself. After inspecting every place in the control room, you haven't found the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message displays on the screen, and you hear a sound coming from it. Once Floatzel got your attention and you're in front of the controls, the image changes to the outside. \"Looking for this?\" he says while holding a ball. It is obvious that it was outside. \"Go for it\" he says while throwing the ball into the sea. Then the controls in front of you light up, you take that as a sign that you have to pilot Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking is easy, and you have no problem with that, but after you get in the water you start to have trouble. Floatzel's body floats around when you don't want too, other times it sinks, and you can hear Floatzel taunting you for your bad maneuvers. You know that he is doing this on purpose to make it frustratingly hard for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!...please\" you yell. It doesn't stop the Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you think you know how to swim on one direction. It is night, but you can see clearly. You patrol the area, trying to find any round object on the bottom of the sea. You often grab something because you think it is what you're looking, but normally it is just debris and stones, and one pearl which you proceeded to eat. Floatzel comments that it is the worst pearl he had encountered, didn't even need to test it to know it is of bad quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig around the sand, until you finally find something that sticks out. You manage to grab it and are relieved to see that it is one of the balls. You eat it too, and then start to pilot Floatzel's body to return to the cave. You manage to crash him a few times against the floor of the beach when you try to stand up, until he decides that it is over and that he should take control before you hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a much worse Floatzel than me. This room is officially out of your limits without my supervision\" you hear him say, laughing about your efforts. You spent too much time with this, just as he says at least twice before you exit his brain. \"I wasn't wrong, seeing you bumbling around is the most fun I had in months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're somewhat annoyed at his behavior, but you guess that he is somewhat right. When you enter your bedroom, you remember what you wanted to ask him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had seen something called \"Lugia Archives\". I was wondering, what is that? I noticed there is a statue down there that shows you two fighting and you winning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some records about she. Lugia is a good for nothing legendary, after you read my archives you'll see why. Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow\" Floatzel replies, and doesn't say anything else for the rest of the night.</span></div></div>",

Checking your watch, it reads 8:13am. As a person who is used to get up early, you are surprised that you have overslept by an hour. Okay now, time to get something to eat for breakfast, a shower, and back to the searching for the remaining balls, you thought. Before you can make another move to leave the brain, the ground beneath you opened up and caused you to rumble downward. When the fall finally stopped, you find yourself back in the eye chamber you visited so many times already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different about this place this morning. There is a large meshed drain hole in the center of the hole. Platforms are arranged in a cut circular ring around the drain. You tried asking Floatzel about the function of the setup but he didn't reply. The Pokemon continue walking  along the beach as if trying to survey the sea for any sorts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, hot water started raining down from the ceiling of the eye chamber. It started out as a light drizzle but became a full power waterfall in mere seconds. You tried avoiding the water but you eventually became wet. The jet stream of water covered the chamber in a warm curtain of mist and steam, obscuring your view of the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooood morning, human!\", Floatzel chimed, \"How are you liking the complimentary shower I'm providing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what? This is a shower? At least you could have told me about this.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Sorry. I thought you would like it better if it were a surprise. Plus, you get to have a scenic view here.\", Floatzel said apologetically while stopping the flow of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!\", you muttered, \"Now that my cloths are completely drenched, how am I supposed to walk around your body today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....you are always welcomed walk in my body naked. There's no need for cloths anyway; it's not anyone's gonna see you like this in here and I'm perfectly fine with you without apparels.\", Floatzel chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much\", you said sarcastically, \"But I would very much prefer something to wear. My cloths aren't going to be dried for hours, what am I supposed to wear now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....I'll make something for you to wear now. Let's see if I can get that done.\", Floatzel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, a soft fabric like substance engulfed your body. The silkiness of the veil-like membrane gave you a strange feeling as it drives itself into the crannies on your body. The fabric slowly shaped themselves into a shirt, an underwear, and a pant for you. When the process is completed, you take a look at the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel has made you an orange T-shirt emblazoned with a large head of the Pokemon himself giving the viewer a smirk. The words \"Enter Me for Fun\" is printed below the image. For your pant, Floatzel made a nice-fitting jean with stylized markings based on those he has. You inspected it again and find the result satisfactory but a little bit funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel seems to sense your satisfaction and smiled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a little apology for what I've done, I'm disclosing the location of the third ball. The third ball is also in the brain, it is somewhere within the archives.  I've opened up the Lugia Archives for your private viewing. Search there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt another tube carried you back to the brain. The third ball is just ahead.....</span></div></div>",

It almost makes you forget that the main target would be finding the ball, but you plan to take enough time to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube carries you to the storage. It has a lot of flat tablets, organized in a single shelf. It isn't a big room, so you guess it won't take long to find the ball. You start by removing the tablets from the shelf. After a while you have removed all of them and found the ball in a corner of the shelf, you take it, completing the third clue. You however don't want to leave yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast\" you think. Why would it be this easy? You guess that it means that Floatzel may want you to check the information he has about Lugia. Not that you'll object. You carefully start placing the tablets back into the shelf, which seems to form a timeline going to the present. You read each tablet, looking for anything that may be interesting. You aren't surprised to see a lot of \"I'm superior to Lugia in every sense\" and other similar egoistical stuff, but you thought there would be more. You however do find some information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first tablet it tells how Floatzel, many years ago, asked Lugia to teach him. It seems that he wanted to go further and be stronger than anybody else in his species, and use it to demonstrate his superiority over his peers. The longer you read other tablets, you see it turn into the desire of being stronger than his master, turning him into a force to be feared not only in his home but in the rest of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the tablets describe how Lugia trained him, and the stories makes Lugia look like a ruthless tyrant who had no consideration towards him or anybody else. You think that it may be possible that Floatzel has modified these memories to match his actual image of Lugia, and some contradictions between tablets seems to prove it. You can't imagine Lugia being as bad as described. But what made Floatzel loathe the legendary Pok\u00e9mon this much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere after the middle of the timeline you find a possible answer. \"I asked her to help me to be even better. She said that there was nothing else she could teach me to enhance my abilities. She is lying! I know that! I can be much better, but she refuses to do it. It is obvious Lugia thinks I'm a threat for her. I'll show her that I can outmatch her, sooner or later. I don't care how long it'll take\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess that Floatzel has always been somewhat narcissistic, but that his increasing strength made it worse. He seems to be okay with everybody else as long as it doesn't bother him, so maybe as long as you don't upset him a lot you should be okay. Lugia refused to help him so he vowed to defeat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you have organized all the tablets back onto the shelf, you leave the room. \"Did you read anything interesting, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think carefully before replying. \"Yes, that was a big surprise. I...didn't know you were so powerful, it is impressive!\" Floatzel seems to be happy with your words, so you aren't in danger right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would see that. You aren't that bad, for a human. Okay, you have three of five. Will you be able to find the fourth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a while, trying to solve the fourth clue. After discarding many possibilities, you set onto one, and start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What does it mean for the ocean to flush out loud? The beating of drums? Where would I find that in Floatzel?, you thought. After half an hour of pondering, you're still without an answer. You tried to ask the Pokemon for an answer, but he just merely gave you a mischievous grin, saying that it will be more fun if you found the answer to this one yourself. Look like Floatzel will be tight-lipped about this one, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with no other choice, you decide you should go back to randomly wandering around in the body. Perhaps with some luck, you'll stumble upon the right location. You left the brain and took a passage that leads downward.

As was the case in Lugia, they are all marked with pictograms representing the part they lead to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway down the route, you spotted a tunnel with a sign reading Mystery Organ on it.

You hesitantly walk forward, but much to your surprise you find out that you can walk on the surface of the water. You keep walking, soon reaching the center of the huge lake. You're almost blinded by the brightness and the colors of the water, and you stop. The moment you stop, you start sinking. You start to panic, and sink faster, until you're covered by the water. You can't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can breath, but you're getting dizzy. Despite being able to breath, the water has enough oxygen to let you live, but you can feel effects of lack of an adequate amount of oxygen. You try to relax, and once you do you note that there are currents under the water. You let yourself be carried by the currents, disorientated. Before you know it, you're back where you started, the entrance. The currents leaves you on the edge, and you gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?!\" you yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A labyrinth.

What is at the end of the labyrinth is a very abstract concept, and you can't imagine it.\"I don't even know what my essence is and what it is for. It could be dangerous, maybe you shouldn't go there\" Floatzel says, with a strange note of concern you hadn't heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take that as an indication that you should leave. You backtrack, and return to wandering aimlessly around the body. You can't guess that is the fourth location, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it is odd you hadn't thought of it before, but the heart does seem like a drum. Maybe because you hadn't thought of it like gentle. Could it be that the blood represents the ocean?

Traveling back to the long hallway, you began looking for any signs that indicates that it will take you to the Pokemon's center. One of the tunnels has a heart-shaped pictogram engraved on the wall. You took the path with any hesitation. The farther into the tunnel, the warmer your surrounding felt. It gradually feels as if a blazing sun was shining down upon you. You can hear the unmistakable beating of Floatzel's heart getting louder with each step you take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, after finally reaching the end of the tunnel, you entered a large room filled with veins and tubings. Looking downward onto the floor, you notices that the floor you're standing on is no more than a narrow bridge of muscle. On the other end, there is a large cylinder suspended midair by wires of muscles. You immediately felt fear creeping up your legs as you realize how high up you are. If estimates are correct, the bridge is about 70 feet high in the heart chamber. There are large vats of what you assumed to be blood beneath you. A large pump-like valve draws the blood from the large vats through several thick pipe and pumps them into the veins around you. The heartbeats generated a rhythmic rumble on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the details of this  place, you conclude that this must be the location of the next ball. All you have to do now is find it. You crossed the entire length of the bridge and entered the cylindrical thing . When you entered it, you immediately felt weak electrical power coursing through you. You panicked at first, thinking that you might have headed for the wrong place and upset Floatzel. You closed your eyes and crouch down, expecting the worst of pain to descend upon you. But a few seconds later, you  managed to open your eyes and take a good look of the chamber. The place has a lot of electrical charges running through the walls and floor. A closer look at the floor reveals a thick gel that resemble jello in consistency. The blue glow that the electricity gave off created an intricate web that reminds you of some fancy scientific equipments. When you tried to touch the gel, you felt a little jolt going through you finger, briefly paralyzing your arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the device in your pocket rumble. You took it out to see that Floatzel has left you a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are now in the Electrical Capacitor of my heart.

You can find some strange threads near, with more small sparks at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab them carefully, trying to figure out their purpose. After a short thought, you apply one to the glass dome. Some of it disappears, not the point you was touching. You're happy, and drop them, but the moment you do the dome reappears. You experiment around, trying to find out how this works. It seems that you need to place the threads at two points to make the whole dome disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time to find out the exact positions of the threads, but after half an hour of unsuccessful efforts you haven't been able to turn the dome into nothing. You're growing more frustrated every time, until you decide that you aren't going to stay here the whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place one of the threads on top of the dome, and see a small space on the bottom. you try to sneak your hand, while you drop the thread carefully so it stays on the dome.

You silently hoped that Floatzel was right and that you are going to survive the fall. Striking the surface of the liquid, you're immediately plunged into the warmness of the blood. The translucent nature of the blood makes seeing next to impossible. You try to find your way upward midst the redness around you. It was a while before you managed to surface from the liquid, gasping for much needed air. There is a faint taste of iron on your tongue. You look at the large tank as you float idly. There seems to be a current carrying you in a slow swirl in the large pool. You saw one of the thick tube you saw earlier and tried swimming toward it. You were instantly sucked up by it and taken toward the pump. You felt yourself being squeezed through tiny passages and launch into a blood vessel at startling speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you are in a blood vessel, you ate essentially taking an expressway through the entirety of Floatzel's body. You discovered that you can move around by simply stroking your arms and change direction by tilting your body. Despite being completely engulfed by blood, you felt air circulating in you body though you are holding your breath. You can see numerous other veins that split off from the main one like river tributaries. At current estimate, you are being carried around Floatzel once every 15 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast speed coupled with the turbulence around makes you uncertain of which tunnel to swim into. After much deliberation and several laps in the vessel, you randomly swam into a tunnel. You reached the surface of the blood at the end of the passage and find yourself in another room. This one contains a large structure that looks like a large cube. There are no signs about its function anywhere. The only clue you can tell is the bright glow that comes from the entry way into the structure. Left with few choices, you ventured on into the thing.</span></div></div>",

When asked, Floatzel only told you to continue down the bloodstream to find out. <br>\r\nHearing that, you entered the blood stream again to be carried around the body in search of the store. The search proved to be a challenge; you constantly used the wrong vessels and end up in empty rooms and other places you've been to before. After an hour of exhaustive search, you narrowed down to one tunnel. This has to be it, you thought. Let's hope that Floatzel would make finding the last ball easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swam into the passage and reached a vast cavern with a wide single-story building in it. In contrast with the organic surrounding, it appears that the building is made of steel and concrete. There are even glass on the building, something that Lugia has not yet acquired. You thought that maybe Floatzel's claim of being more powerful than Lugia wasn't all bluffing. A \"Floatzel Department Store\" sign hangs above the top of the entrance. When you entered the door, you are greeted with a vast shopping arcade lined with different stores. There are shops for clothing, toys, computers, and entertainments. You counted at least 60 stores here. They offered everything except pointing you to the direction for the ball. Another, noted difference from Lugia's store is that Floatzel's is staffed with copies of himself. You saw several Floatzels tending to their area, each with a badge that denotes his duties. One of the things that you find funny about them is that they all have name tags identifying themselves as 'Floatzel'. Wow, how am I ever going to tell them apart when I need something. Just as you are taking in the sight of the stores, a Floatzel approached you and greeted you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi and welcome to Floatzel's Department Store and how can I help you?\", the Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Nothing really. Just having a look around here.\", you replied, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let me know if you need any help, human.\", the Floatzel said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way he winked and his subtle emphasis on the word 'help', you took that to mean that the actual Floatzel is watching you with these 'clones' and that they're not going to be of much help to finding the last ball; the Floatzels are going to be playing as your-typical-store-staffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched around in the countless stores around you, visiting a clothing store, a toy shop, electronic shop just to name a few. While searching for the ball, you also picked up several bags of items you like. You got some cute Floatzel plushies, a new set of clothing for yourself, and trading in the Floatzel managing device for an even better one. At one particular store, a Floatzel staff tried to persuade you into getting a subscription for Floatzel TV. That Pokemon said that the service allows you unlimited access to Floatzel's memory, access the Pokenet, live view from the outside, and even first-person intimate shows. You kindly declined the offer and went to a bench to get a rest. With your hands full of bags, you arms are getting weak from the weight of all the merchandise. You still wonder where would the ball be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, one of the store signs caught your eyes: The World of Psychic Telling. You are surprised that such things are available inside the Pokemon. Normally, such stored are located in obscure corners but the one before you is prominent and it even looks like the main store here. You walked closer to the store and read the sign at the entrance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nAre you having any conundrums? Are you wondering about the mysterious power of Floatzel? Come in and let me solve your problem?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the place without much thinking, hoping you'll get some answers inside.</span></div></div>",

You take a deep breath and start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will...uh...the big Floatzel know about what I ask and you answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Floatzel doubts before answering. \"Well, I'm him...but he wouldn't know. I'm a projection with his knowledge and nothing more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where is the last ball?\" you ask, expecting a straight answer, but it wasn't what you expected \"You have it with you!\" You rummage through your pockets but you don't find anything.

You finally find the ball inside one of the plush toys. \"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll see my treasures!\" the Floatzel says \"But tomorrow. I'm so sleepy right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this as an indication that you should leave, but first you have one thing more to ask \"Tell me, what is Floatzel's biggest treasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pearl he stole from Lugia! It is among the rest of pearls in the storage, but it is easily recognizable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have any protection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel seems embarrassed. \"Well, the only protection is that one can't enter the storage unless Floatzel shows you the path. Besides that, there isn't any\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face brightens with this new information. \"Good! And how can get it out of Floatzel's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can only do it while he is asleep. Otherwise he'll feel the pearl while you roll it through his body. Other than that I don't know. Floatzel hasn't thought about that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you wouldn't obtain more valuable information. Before you leave, Floatzel talks to you again. \"Floatzel wants you to stay because he wants a pet. Maybe after some years he'll think of you as a friend\". It seems like a random thing to say, but it opens your eyes. You don't like how that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room, keeping the balls with you. Before you fall asleep, you notify Lugia that you're about to finish the mission. \"Excellent! I'll start thinking ways to get the pearl and you out\" that is the last thing you hear before you fall asleep. The first thing you plan to do is tell Floatzel that you caught all the balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If all goes according to plan, you'll be out by late night today. You went over to the bar to grab a quick meal and a drink. The fish you ate are still slightly raw but this will probably be the last time you ate this kind of stuff. Then, you slowly made your way to the eye chamber to meet with Floatzel. The chamber was still dark because of the closed eyes. You can tell that something looks different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a faint grayish glow on the two windows despite no light sources. Confused, you approached the glass for a closer look. Suddenly the windows flashed white, momentarily blinding you. You initially thought that Floatzel has woken up but you still hear snoring. You opened your eyes and find that the windows became displays. There is a keyboard lying around on the floor. You picked it up and began using it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you read the content, you can see that it is some of web blog with several topics. The title page lists it as \"Floatzel's Private Blog\". You grinned widely realizing that Floatzel must have forgotten to log out of the Pokenet system and there are stuffs to discover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkimming through the lists, you came across topics like daily activity logs, secret moves, and hunting records. A section of the blog is devoted entirely to hating on Lugia. The specific page has been visited by many Pokemons who also posted sympathetic messages and some even include pictures of Lugia in extremely explicit details. You quickly returned to the main page wanting to avoid a repeat of the scenario in Ho-oh's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more scrolls downward you reached a topic that almost caused your heart to stop. It reads \"I Found A Tiny Human. Anyone can help?\" Judging from the date of the post, you instantly realized that Floatzel has been trying to find more about you since he realized you're in his body. You clicked on the topic and find that the post has already garner several dozens of response. The replies are mostly deriding of the fact that human can be in fact shrunk. Most of them are just emoticons and random jumble of letters that basically add up to telling Floatzel to get his priorities right. An Alakazam even suggests Floatzel to visit him for a brain reboot to set him straight. Wow, you thought, Pokemons on the net are just as chaotic as humans, if not worse. You smiled as you know that no one is really taking the Pokemon seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are reveling, a window popped up with a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHi, Floats. Are you having problems with a microscopic human inside you? I can help you with that. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to impersonate Floatzel and talk with this Pok\u00e9mon, maybe you'll learn from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well hi and yes. I do have a problem with that. Who is this by the way?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nName's Ho-oh and I got LOADS to share with you about a small human.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, shi......., you thought, not him again.</span></div></div>",

He is portraying himself as the victim, who only wanted to be the human's friend, and it is making you look like a jerk who made disasters around his body. You feel rage escalating with every word you read, but manage to control yourself. Soon Ho-oh finishes and says <i>now what will you do with the human?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think carefully before typing. \"I'm not sure. Should I do something about it? What do you recommend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You should get rid of the human, but before that, make sure you humiliate it. You have a tiny scum inside you. Nobody will miss it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had enough. You have to say something so Ho-oh thinks Floatzel is done with you, so Ho-oh never contacts Floatzel again. You also need to erase all traces of Ho-oh's conversation. Even if it is false, how will you demonstrate it to Floatzel? After all you sneaked inside his body and tried to stay hidden. That could make him turn hostile to you. After a careful thought you type \"Okay I think I know how to deal with this. Thank you for your advice. I'll be grateful if you don't mention this again. I want to leave this as the past. The human didn't seem that bad but I won't go through your same experience\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wise decision. If you need ideas to how to make it pay, contact me</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I know how to do this. Please, let's not talk more about this. But thank you for saving me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you close the window, and search around for a way to block Ho-oh. You find a tiny link that seems to do it, and you click it. You hope that if Ho-oh ever talks with Floatzel again it'll be when you're gone and very, very far from these Pok\u00e9mon. You go around for a while until you have erased every line of the conversation you had with Ho-oh, and considered erasing the post about the tiny human, but you decided to leave it. Maybe Floatzel would notice it and would know you're doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the keyboard on the floor and leave the web blog as if you had never entered, then slowly walk out of the chamber. When you think you're far, you run back to your room, deciding to wait for half an hour or so before trying to enter to the eye chamber again. Maybe Floatzel is awake now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As was usual, Floatzel was looking out of his cavern, eyeing the distance for anything of interest. He seems to pay special attention on anything in the sky, likely looking out for Lugia. On the table, Floatzel has prepared a generous breakfast consisting of fruits and poorly-sliced fishes. You dig in on the food as the Pokemon greeted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, there. How are we doing today?\", Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good. What are you doing now?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, it's nothing. Just watching out for that loathsome Lugia. We don't want her to barge in on our time together, do we?\", Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou somehow wish that could happen and make things easier. Lugia gliding in to save the day is preferable but not likely. It a wonder that Floatzel hasn't realized your true intention here. You're doing all this for the pearl that could finally get you back to normal, something you missed for months since you met Lugia. You'll just slip out during night and problem solved. But still, there is still the danger that Floatzel may want to fight Lugia again very soon. You suspect if the two ever fight, you'll surely have a front row seat to witness it. The battle will be one of a kind, a duel that will see was right about their power. Seeing no use in hoping for Lugia's arrival, you decided it's time to tell Floatzel about the balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Floatzel.....I got some great news for you. I managed to collect all five balls around your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's superb! I thought it would take you longer and the last one was the most difficult, yet you still made it. You really exceeded my expectation, human. As a reward, I will show you my treasure chamber, where I kept all my precious artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly finished your breakfast and is taken by a tube to another part of the body. During the trip, you frequently encounter free falls and bumps, making it less smooth than your typical passageway. It continued for ten minutes before you end up in the treasure chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's chamber is far larger than Lugia's and looks more like a museum than a room. The ceiling are dotted with glowing crystals that illuminates the chamber with a soft turquoise light. The floors consists of tiles with carvings of ancient writing systems. Mountains of pearls are stacked in neat rows like building blocks and are categorized based on color and size. The smallest are the size of grains while the largest is the size of a beach ball. Virtually every visible color is available for you to see. Besides pearls, there are also golden amulets, a six-colored gemstone, coins made of diamonds, and many more. Floatzel is giving you a tour of his treasure chamber, explaining how he got each artifact and what does it do. He used only his voice to guide you through this palatial place. As you listened carefully to the Pokemon, you wondered if Floatzel's power has to do with all these things he has. It definitely has something to do with his treasures, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you reached a door that is made from solid bone and there seem to be no way to go through it. A sign above says \"Restricted Area/ Entry only by Floatzel's Permission\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Floatzel that you reached the door and wait for him to open it to his most priced collections.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This place will be always open for you, whenever you want to see my treasures again you can come back\" Floatzel says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the place, ready to be shown the collection. To this point you are amazed that so many valuable things are inside a Pok\u00e9mon. It wasn't so strange inside Lugia or Ho-oh, after all they are huge and have a lot of power, but this is a common species that you have seen many times. You wonder if your own team has treasures inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on the collection. The first one is something you have given to some of your own Pok\u00e9mon, a Mystic Water. It isn't something beautiful, but maybe Floatzel knew it would increase his strength, why else would he have this in this site of honor? Seeing it was nothing special, you walked towards the second treasure, so Floatzel didn't note your main interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was much more interesting, a small statue of crystal of your host. This time Floatzel talks to you about how he obtained this when he \"entered a village full of humans and managed to steal it from the hands of the most powerful opponents he had encountered\". You suspect it was a lie, but it was an entertaining story. Then you finally see what you wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia's Pearl is at the other side of the room. It is much more beautiful than the hologram inside Lugia. You understand that most would want to have this pearl. \"This isn't any pearl. This one belonged to a legendary Pok\u00e9mon whose name I don't want to say. This was one of the sources of her power, now that I have it with me I can defeat her. Since I have this pearl inside me I'm much more powerful than before. Awesome, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say a lot of compliments towards Floatzel. A while later, you exit the place, noticing that the door is still open. Looks like Floatzel fully trusts you. You contact Lugia and tell her you found her pearl. \"I'm still thinking about what to do. We should avoid a confrontation. Without it...I can lose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the hard news stoically. Lugia tells you that she'll contact you soon. Meanwhile...there is something you would like to talk with Floatzel. When you return to your room you ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floatzel, if I ever were going to leave your body...would you let me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to return to being a trainer on an adventure, to meet new Pokemons, and to battle new trainers.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the Pokemon took some time to formulate his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your feeling perfectly. But leaving my body so suddenly isn't going to resolve your size problem at all. I have no idea how to restore despite my training under 'her'.\", Floatzel said calmly, \"Plus, don't you think my body has a lot to offer you? Isn't it safe in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree with you about that and I have to thank you for letting me stay in your body the last few days. I never actually knew that Pokemons have such interesting interior until I came across you.\", you said, \"And your body sure does provide a lot of stuffs I didn't really expect in an Pokemon at all. But I feel that something is still missing here. I think it's a lack of interaction with people in general. Talking with them, sharing your thoughts, and knowing each other better. To me, that's what allows happiness to exist and friendship to blossom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Floatzel listened intently to the human. He knows that feeling well, the one he has kept to himself for such a long time. One he was unwilling to revisit. As he listened to the human continue on how he missed his friends and his other Pokemons. Floatzel felt a something that he hasn't experienced since that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feeling perfectly.\", Floatzel said with some tone of sadness, \"A much as I hate to admit it, I haven't talked much to anyone since I left Lugia after she trained me. In a somewhat similar situation to you, I used to be good friends with Lugia and she really liked me in return. We used to talk with each other and laugh together. As a Legendary, she saw my potential during a wild battle some years ago. I was a young Buizel back then. Lugia sensed that I was different from other Pokemons and took me under her wings taught me about all the things she know about Pokemon powers. The room and all the things you see in me are the result of those trainings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's your turn to listen to Floatzel's story. This is a rare opportunity to hear from Floatzel's point of view. You have a feeling that there is more to the story than Lugia was telling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We trained hard everyday and I constantly endured long lessons and difficult moves that required numerous level of concentration. But in the end, I always managed to surprise Lugia with my performance. In return, I earned her recognition as a special Pokemon and she treated me more and more like a close friend than a student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you started feeling bad about Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything was fine until....that day...\" Floatzel said with melancholy, \"Lugia said that I had finally attained the highest level that a regular Pokemon could achieve and that anything beyond that would overwhelm any Pokemon other than a Legendary. I tried to convince her to teach me more of those things, but she refused, saying that it would endanger my life. I got mad at her and fought with her with the very moves she taught me. I defeated her, yelled things at her that hurt her deeply and left. Looking back at it, I kind of regret breaking off contact with her and losing my only friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you listened to Floatzel's story, the more you are convinced that you need to stay a little longer in Floatzel. There is no doubt that the event was traumatic for the Pokemon. You couldn't imagine the feeling of being alone for years at a time. Leaving him now would probably make the problem worse, and possibly even endangering Lugia if Floatzel reverts to rampage from anger and loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me....you won't leave my body.\", Floatzel said with pleadingly, \"I'd hate to re-experience that isolation again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........Alright, compared to my problems, I think staying longer wouldn't do much harm.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.....\", Floatzel said emotionally, \"Let's get some rest, shall we?.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said good night to Floatzel and lie down on your bed. You contacted Lugia and told her about what you heard and your decision to stay a bit longer with Floatzel. You signed off and let those thing sink in for her. Maybe.....there are still ways of resolving the split......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't only return to your normal size, you also would make the two Pok\u00e9mon friends again. Of course if there was so many negative feelings then it won't be easy. You wonder how long it'll take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had changed your opinion about Floatzel, and it was so fast you didn't even notice. You felt that he was deeper than you thought at first. Floatzel showed concern for the first time, asking you several times what was going on, as you stayed in your room for the rest of the day, thinking. You knew it was out of fear of you leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is funny. I have gone from entering without Floatzel knowing, to try to find a way to get the pearl out, to now try to find a way to solve this. My life sure is convoluted\" you think before you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you are awoken by a sudden contact from Lugia. She had tried to call you before, but you had refused to say more about your intentions. She had expressed her support, but also said it would be very hard to convince Floatzel to give Lugia a chance. This indeed seemed the hardest thing to do. And after they regained contact, what would they say? They wouldn't be friends again just because they talk to each other. There must be a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Lugia, what now?\" you say, annoyed at the rude wake-up call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to make sure you knew what you are dealing with. Despite your efforts and actions, it is possible Floatzel won't trust you if he finds out you are inside him because of me. I thought it would be good to remind you. You're a good person, but don't let that get you carried away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say thank you and decide to set the base of your plan. You're not sure of the path to take but you think you know what not to say. After breakfast and the usual morning routine you request an audience with Floatzel. He reluctantly accepts. Knowing the importance of the conversation you're going to have, you enter the private conversation room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I'm here Floatzel is because I think there is a way to solve this whole fight and make you feel good again. I'm willing to find a way, and I'm trying to do it, but I have to ask you: would you be willing to try to reconsider being Lugia's friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel seems to think for a while. You patiently wait, knowing that if there is a negative answer you'll have to work harder to convince him that this is worth his time. Finally Floatzel replies \"I'll try\". You smile and talk before your host has a chance to backpedal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then it is settled, I'll try to get you peace, in all senses\" you say \"First than all I'll need a way to communicate with Lugia myself. Can you find a way? Preferably without leaving your body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that. What will you tell her? I doubt she'll want to talk to a random human, specially if it is...inside me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You don't know her like I do</i>\" you think. Then aloud: \"Trust me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I think it'll be ready tonight, it'll need a lot of special things. What will you do while it is finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there some way I can help? I know it isn't easy for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are a few problems but I can solve them by myself. If I need you I'll contact you. For now feel free to explore around\" he says, but before you leave the room you hear something more \"Wait! Would you like to come out? Maybe it can be tiring to be inside somebody for so long. Maybe you could spend the rest of the day outside my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. This reminds you of an experience you had with Lugia, a long time ago. The details are hazy, but you remember Lugia had gravity or something. You doubted Floatzel had that ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...come out...then stay outside. For your safety you shouldn't be outside my cave so you'll stay inside my den. You're free to explore my home, or explore the outside of my body, whatever you want. After all, I'm as fun on the outside as I am in the inside!\" he says cheerfully. Then in a more serious tone \"I'll be careful with you if you want to be on me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that you would need something to do while you wait for a way to supposedly communicate with Lugia. Floatzel can't know you already have a way. \"Sure, why not?\" you say while going towards the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you're fully out of the Pokemon, he asked you whether you would like to stay in his cave or stay on the outside of his body. You gave yourself some time to think about it. While staying at Floatzel's cave could be a relaxing experience, for now, you prefer to stick with Floatzel  both for safety and more exploration. You told him about your decision. Once he heard it, Floatzel picked you up with his cream-colored paw and brought you up to his face. The features of his face looks like massive hills and valleys. It is now that you realized how imposing Floatzel look when he is standing at his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'd like to be with me, right?\", Floatzel said, \"Although my exterior isn't as interesting as my inside, you'll still find it worth exploring. And don't worry about falling, my furs will cling to you wherever you walk on my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Floatzel brought you downward to his midsection and showed you the orange marking on his belly. He placed you onto the marking and you adhere to it like velcro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now you're free to explore the outside of my body. No matter which direction you decide to travel, you will always remain secured to my body. Have fun!\", Floatzel chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking around the body of Floatzel. The first part you can across is the belly button which looks more like a crater from your perspective. Looking down into the hole reveals a tangled mess of fur and other debris. You enter the crater and explore the environment. The scene looks like something out of a science fiction movie; organic ground, tufts of fur here and there, and patches of dirts. Some of the patches even look alive with organisms. This isn't surprising considering the fact that microbes do exists in every part of the body. Although reviling, you find the belly button interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary in the crater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way out of the belly button and continue with your exploration. Walking further downward, you discovered......</span></div></div>",

The ground is also covered in fur different than the rest of the body, it is thinner and shorter. It doesn't take you long to realize what you have stumbled upon. You look around, like hoping for a confirmation. The position of the ground of the cavern (which you barely can see) and the snout, very high in the opposite direction, are enough hints for you. You have walked right into Floatzel's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect you to get there so fast!\" you hear Floatzel's voice \"Curiosity got the best of you, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say, it is an awkward situation and you're not sure of how you should react. You also hope that Floatzel doesn't get any unfortunate ideas, at least while you're there. \"I...was just walking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a destination! Keep exploring if you want to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider the situation. You got here, you may as well leave. Turning back is a boring option, though, and you want to avoid it. So your only other option is to go through this area until you're out. You start walking to go around the cock, noticing that this is another reminder that your actual size is insignificant. It'll take some time to leave this area behind. You're stopped right in your tracks by Floatzel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would be more fun than this! How are you expected to enjoy my outside when you don't even take a chance to explore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is that...okay, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exercise yourself while you have fun exploring. You have the possibility to climb my penis to its top and you're choosing to walk around. That is no fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan at Floatzel's attitude. This is starting to seem like nothing happened yesterday. Maybe you can get something from this...\"Okay, if I do it what do I win? I better get some kind of prize or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving Lugia a chance. One would think that is enough prize. But if that isn't enough then I guess I can give you another incentive. Just...do it and tonight you'll find something in your room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. You may as well get over this as fast as possible. While you return to the base of the cock you think about what you'll do after this. Maybe you can try to reach the ground of the cavern, descending via the legs. It is a possibility. You reach the start point, and look towards your goal. It won't be something that will be done in a few minutes.</span></div></div>",

The skin on the penis was rough enough for you to hold on with your hand. With it extended to full length, you can feel the pulsing thumps of the veins beneath the skin. The climb was slow and steep. Occasionally, you caught glimpse of Floatzel's head looking down and smiling at you. Why is he making me climb his privates?, you thought, Did he really think such prank task amuses me or is all those stories he told me last night feigned? You continue to scale the penis with significant efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you at last reached the peak of the cock. The 'crown' you're on has a light orange color and feels firm underneath your feet. Despite its location, the penis only has the very faint smell of heat and urine lingering in the air. You couldn't believe it, you climbed a Pokemon's cock and managed to avoid any body fluids that you could get on yourself; luckily, Floatzel knows better than to cross the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel tilted his head downward and found the human standing on the top of his cock. He is amused by how fast it took the human to scale his entire length. Though the human might be slightly disgusted about this mission, Floatzel only meant this as a little diversion from the whole reconciling with Lugia situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, human!\", Floatzel exclaimed, \"You made it to the top and earned yourself a reward that I sent to your bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to smile for the first time since the task started. Feeling better, you explored the area of the crown a bit more and found yourself looking into the hole that leads to the depth of the cock. Suddenly, the ground trembled and you lost your balance.....oh no no no no no, you thought, please don't fall......But it was too late as you felt yourself falling down into the dark confines of the tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the human, Floatzel has observed everything that happened. He only gave a smirk as the human will eventually stumble upon the most secretive location in his body. Floatzel promised himself that this will be the last prank for the day on the human. Then, the Pokemon return to searching the right frequency signal to communicate with Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ride was rough, so you need some time to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally have enough energy, you stand and look around you. It was unexpected. You know where you slid, but the place you're in isn't one you expected. How many things are connected in this area? You're in a small round chamber, full of boxes. You approach one of the boxes and open it. You can't believe the content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many sexual devices inside the box, and all of them with Floatzel's trademark colors. You don't remember the last time you felt this uncomfortable. \"What is this place!?\" you yell, staying as far as you can from the rest of the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel laughs at your reaction. \"Surprise! I bet you didn't think you would see a place like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't want to! What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A place in case you in some moment express an attraction towards me that goes beyond being mere friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astonished. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could have seen your face? I think there is a camera in one of the boxes, why don't you point it towards your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you catch that Floatzel is messing with you. You restrain your reactions so he doesn't get any fun from you. Soon he stops messing with you, and he finally says in a more serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know stuff about you so I created many things in case you turned out to be, well, somebody who would seek a deeper relationship with me. I thought it would be a good prank to make you fall here, that is why I made you climb all the way up there. And what a nice result!\" Floatzel laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit calmer, you explore the boxes more. Some of the content makes you blush against your will, since some of the objects you find are of such nature you can't avoid feeling awkward just by seeing them. But it is still interesting that Floatzel felt the need to create all these things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're done checking around, you look for the exit. The only way out is the same tube that brought you here, and luckily for you, it has some ridges you can use to climb. You start climbing through the narrow tunnel, until you reach the main one where you can stand up. Behind you there are paths towards the bladder and the testicles, but you don't feel like daring to go to any of those places. You start walking towards the exit, wanting to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the prank?\" you decide to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel doubts a moment before responding. \"I feel that I told you too many things yesterday. I have to correct my behavior in some way! In the next days you can expect to be a victim of some pranks, and I'm sure you won't like all of them. But I promise you this is the last one for today. By the way, I'm still working on the communication for you. It'll be ready soon. Meanwhile feel free to keep going wherever you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the end of the path in the distance. You think about what you can do. Maybe you could ask Floatzel to show you around his cave, or maybe you could do an U-turn and start climbing his body to his head. You hope you won't encounter other surprises until the day ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You started to walk back up toward the body while thinking about what to do next with the Pokemon. Going back into the mouth doesn't seem like an interesting option nor is exploring the body from the outside. So, you decided to remain outside a little longer and tell Floatzel that you wanted to explore his cavern a little more. Upon hearing that, the Pokemon used his paw and picked you up. He placed you upon his snout and began returning to his large cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't really showed you the full size of my home, so hold on tight. You will be amazed by how beautiful it looks on the inside.\", Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Floatzel walked deeper into the cavern until the surrounding became too dark for you too see. You held on tight to the fur on the snout as it trembles with each step the Pokemon takes. You told Floatzel that you can't see anything in here but he tells you that he would eventually reach the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking in the dark for five minutes, light began to appear in the distance of the cave. When Floatzel arrived at the source of the light, your mouth was completely agape. Before you was a cavern entirely made of blue crystals and gems. The walls and ceiling are giving off a ambient glow that you find strangely comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my secret spot.\", Floatzel said, \"While I don't normally show this place to others, I'll make it an exception for you. Whenever I have things to think about this will be the first place I visit; I find the crystals to be soothing and serene. I hope you find it the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible....\", you blurted out, \"how did you manage to find this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was Lugia who created this place as a training ground for me. This cave is located near the center of this island, which was used to indicate its importance.\", Floatzel answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two really trained in here?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we did. Back then, we spent days in here, focused on nothing but improving our powers. Sometimes, when we discovered new moves, we always test it on the walls here as they are designed to absorb energies.\", Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Looks like both of you had great times together.\", you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure was......\", Floatzel replied sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned back to look at Floatzel, you noticed some traces of tears in his eyes. The glow of the crystals gave his eyes an ethereal feel as he focused his gaze on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Lugia would be willing to talk to me after what I did?\", Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Lugia would understand if you apologize and make amends with her. It's never too late to do that.\", you said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Thanks for the support, human\", Floatzel responded, \"Ummm, would you like to renter my body to explore it? I still got places to take you. And I know just the location to treat you for lunch.\"</span></div></div>",

Due to your size you don't even touch the walls of the esophagus, but you enjoy the free fall. The end of the fall wasn't as good though. You fell into the familiar pool of acid-free stomach content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resurface, still disgusted by the concoction. You ask for Floatzel for the path towards the place he had talked about. He instantly opens one of the sphincters in one of the lower floors, and directs you towards it. You walk and enter, it doesn't take you long to arrive towards the place. When you arrive you recognize it. It is the same bar you had visited in the first day of your invasion of Floatzel's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember this place. I have been here, before you knew I was inside you. I was looking for food and found this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It doesn't matter. You can still have lunch here. I don't know how you got food from here without me noticing but it won't be as good as what I'm going to cook for you. Sit near the counter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey and wait for the food. Sure, before you know, you see in front of you the best dish you have seen during your stay inside Floatzel, and it does taste better than the rest. You take your time to enjoy every bite, while talking about trivial stuff with Floatzel. You are thankful for his food, although tired of the seafood. You like it, but not everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that this is out the way human, let's start with your plan. I have everything ready for you to contact Lugia. I'll be listening every word too and she knows it. Say what you want and good luck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but from where will I do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay where you are\" A strange machine appears in front of you. It has a microphone, and while you're looking at it a bulb turns on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. Start talking, we'll listen to you. Say who you are as she doesn't know a thing about you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and think for a moment. When you organize your thought, you start to deal with the feud.</span></div></div>",

Once it is out, he says everything he didn't tell to Lugia, you're glad that nothing Floatzel is yelling now will be heard by Lugia. That would ruin everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room, ready for anything. But when you enter, you see something new. You remember it was the surprise you had won before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing you noticed about the bedroom is that it has become a lot more opulent than it previously was. When you first entered this room, it was an extremely simple and rudimentary in function. But now, the walls are decorated with pictures of Floatzels and the flooring was changed into thick fur carpets that resemble those shaggy rugs you saw so often in actual hotel rooms. What was previously a small single bed is now a large, ornate bed covered with satin sheets. The colors match those of Floatzel's fur. Four bedposts with carvings of the Pokemon now overlooks the bed you're on with a gentle smile. On the other side of the room was a bookshelf with several books neatly stacked with each other. When you take a look at the titles of the book, you blushed when you realized some of them are from the store in Floatzel's cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the room, you can still hear faint snippets of the Pokemon's cursing about Lugia. It's probably best that you leave the Pokemon to his own device for the time being. You continue to walk around, checking out the new features of the room. It seems that you even have your private restroom and shower now, eliminating the need to visit the eye chamber. The ceiling now contains an all encompassing screen that can simulate certain environments. You tried several options which include star-filled view of distant galaxies, upwards views of forest canopies, underwater, and many more. At last, you settled on the galaxy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepared to lie down on the bed when you noticed a large box placed near the center of the bed. The container itself is not marked in anyway; there's no indicator of what's in the box except that it feels heavy. You didn't hesitate to open the box and discovered a beautifully-crafted Floatzel plush. Everything about the figure looks realistic and that you can easily mistake it for the real Pokemon if it weren't a miniature model. You found the gift to be really interesting to say the least. But sometimes these sort of gifts makes you wonder if Pokemons ever exchange presents with each other as a form of courtship. If they do, are there any rituals or customs they observed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook off the thoughts of those questions, before you ever had the chance to fill in the details about 'rituals'. You started wondering whether Floatzel and Lugia can truly reconcile with each other. Although it was irrelevant to returning you to normal size, you just can't allow such conflict to go uncorrected. Occasionally, you felt that the Pokemon is self-centered and really a prankster. But you also got to see Floatzel's soft side the other night, which he seems to hide from Lugia very often. If only he had shown this side during the conversation, things could've gone much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a shadow towering over you and turn to find Floatzel at his regular size looking at you from the room entrance. There is an indescribable expression on his face as he made his way toward you, finally sitting down beside you on the bed and started speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you like your new room and little gift pretty well.....Sorry about that outburst with Lugia. Some things she said just make me lose my rationality rather quickly.\", Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", you asked the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, every time I met Lugia, it feels like my thoughts and feeling 'have a brain of its own'......in other words, I lack control over myself.\", Floatzel said with a frustrated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......it's alright. I also have some problems you encountered so far so I pretty much understand your feelings.\", you said, \"I could even help you if you needed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks....\", Floatzel said quietly, \"Besides an apology, there is another reason that I came here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon looked at you, awaiting your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry......\", you asked perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this time, I find you to be the kind of friend I always long for. You are one of the rare kind who I could related to despite differences. And since we still got some times before we meet up with Lugia, don't you think we gotta use our time a little more wisely?\", Floatzel asked with a hint of suggestiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.....you know.... I'm not into that...kind of stuff.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? We aren't doing anything close to that! What were you thinking? It's just a little experiment I wanna try out\", Floatzel exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon leans in closer to your face until your nose touches his soft snout and you can only see the mesmerizing pair of large, brown eyes. You tried to look away from them, but something is grasping your mind, allowing you to focus on nothing but his eyes. A series of color flashed from them and gradually changed into images. You can see yourself and Floatzel walking in a forest, talking and smiling. This reminds you of the movie Lugia showed you days ago (maybe she also taught Floatzel this strange trick).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a little virtual game with me? It's something that Lugia and me used to play together. It something we called 'Interactive Vision. Think of it like a \"chain-story\"; I add my story and you add yours. Wanna start now?\"</span></div></div>",

The images in Floatzel's eyes turn into pure white blotches, until soon they form new scenes. One has the beach you had seen for a few seconds before entering Floatzel, while the other one has a forest, similar to the one you was exploring before you shrunk. An image of Floatzel appears on the beach, while you see one like you in the forest. You take some moments to learn how to give commands mentally to the image of the human, while Floatzel explores the beach, clearly waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have learned the basics, Floatzel starts talking. He starts narrating a story, in first person. \"I walk around, waiting for the human to approach the beach\". Then he stops, while the image of the Pok\u00e9mon obeys his command. You follow his example. \"I manage to find my way out of the forest and into the beach\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, you can see that you are doing this correctly. You reunite with Floatzel on the beach. \"I ask: \"What are we going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say \"I'm going to show you the underwater world!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can breath underwater. I approach the edge of the water\" you say, while Floatzel at the same time narrates his action, which matches yours. The images now are standing at the edge of the ocean, ready to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel and you spend an hour or so taking turns to narrate the wonders of your underwater journey. You had the brilliant idea of creating a sunken ship, and Floatzel narrates a whole story based on that. Soon your eyes to get tired, and request Floatzel to stop. He interrupts the story, which was close to ending. \"We can finish the story here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compliment Floatzel for the experience and the success of the experiment. He is boasting at the awesome story they created. \"Maybe we can do this again, whenever you want\" You smile, unsure of what to say. You doubt you'll do this again with Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow\" he says and leaves the room. You wait until you're sure Floatzel won't interrupt you. There is something you want to talk with Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia...what are we going to do tomorrow? In the afternoon you'll meet with Floatzel.

The 'kick-off' meeting has already left a sour note between the two; what was supposed to be the first step turns out to be a major stepping stone. Lugia tried to come up with a clever script and speech. She scoured every file in all the corners of her brain. But, no matter how hard she thinks, the search for answer within her mind always comes back as blank. Heaving a deep sigh, Lugia began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, I can't think of a preferable method to handle the meeting.\", Lugia said with a fainted tone of defeat, \"It's just that we haven't really gotten along well in the last meeting, as you probably witnessed yourself. Partly, I overdid my acting and started saying things based on raw emotions. I guess you're right. I did acted in a childish manner toward Floatzel. Now, I made things worse than it was. I don't know if Floatzel is willing to talk to me or whether I could ever muster enough courage to hear what he has to say about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia's reply took you completely by surprise. After being with her for such long time, this is the first time you've seen her so vulnerable and defeated. You wanted to assure her everything will be fine and that the actual meeting tomorrow will proceed smoothly. But even you began to have questions whether or not the earlier meeting made things worse. If yes, how are you supposed to correct it? How is it going to affect your journey to normalcy? You did your best to talk Lugia about the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia, you know, Floatzel also told me something similar about him having poor control of his emotion. It's just my guess but I'm not sure, I think that both of you had just assumed the worst in each other, instinctively blaming others instead of tackling the issue. Floatzel is probably going through similar struggles right now. This is going to take some time but things will definitely turn for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you be so sure?\", asked Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because.....I believe in your ability. I know this is difficult to believe but after exploring the worlds in your and Floatzel's body, I discovered that Pokemon are far more advanced and  feeling than I realize. There are treasures and ideas within that demonstrates your uniqueness, much like how character can define a human.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that some deep stuff you're saying.\", Lugia exclaimed, \"You don't need to give such a long winding reason for me to inderstand your intention, that is, you really love me this whole time. There is no need to hide your feeling now, I know that you are genuine about your feelings and I felt more than happy about that. Really. Your words gave me the slightest boost that tomorrow might just work......Well....looks like it's a bit late right now. Get some good rest 'cause tomorrow's the big day. I certainly hope that things will go as you said it would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said good night to Lugia and ended the transmission with her. You prepared yourself for sleep and found a folded piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reads: let's meet at the helm (control room) first thing in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You placed the paper on a night stand and lie down in your bed and dimmed the lights, falling asleep quickly.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take long before Floatzel tells you why he wanted you to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe control room isn't any different than the last time you had visited it. Floatzel was already moving. He greets you, and then tells you why you're here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need help, human. I'll need you to control my body for a while. I'll teach you some stuff\" a small microphone appears on the controls, in front of you. \"Test it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move closer to the microphone, ready to do what Floatzel says. -\"Testing, testing, what is this for?\"-After a second, you can hear what you said, but with Floatzel's voice. You are surprised with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done human! Now please take a look at what is going to appear at the side\" A pile of the membranes you know are used as the equivalent of paper inside Pok\u00e9mon appear at a side of the room. Taking the first one, you see that it is a brief summary of the rocky relationship Floatzel had with Lugia during all this time. The rest is a detailed description of Floatzel's side of the whole feud, and much to your surprise, it has less rancor towards Lugia than the story you had heard some days ago. He even included a profile about Lugia, and although it has clear indications that Floatzel still thinks he is right and Lugia is wrong, this version is more fair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read it all, please. I'll need your help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start reading, page by page. You had already known most of the story, but now there are some details you didn't know. You are sure that Floatzel hid them because he thought it wasn't going to make him look good, as most details that are now in the summary talks about his feelings and loneliness. Looks like he was trying really hard to keep a facade towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're reading, a thought crosses your mind. Why would Floatzel tell you to do these things? There is a possibility...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floatzel...are you wanting me to talk to Lugia, instead of you doing it by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel stays silent for a moment before replying. \"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the membrane on the floor. \"I won't do it. You need to rebuild your friendship with Lugia by yourself. She won't trust you if she ever knows that it was me who talked with her, and not you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'll screw up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. Just think before talking, try your best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel stays silent for a while. \"Okay. You're right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're about to leave, Floatzel speaks again. \"Something...I feel that I shouldn't have shown you about my feelings if you weren't going to help me as I wanted. I feel like...I revealed too much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like how this sounds. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't erase your memory so I'll be satisfied if you have a bad experience! I hope there will be no rough feelings after this\" Floatzel says naughtily. Then the floor opens under your feet. You fall through a slide, a very long one, at least from your perspective. Soon the ground evens out, and you are thrown through the end of the slide. After you fall to the floor, the slide seals behind you. You turn around and try to open it, but you are unable to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something hits you: there is an unpleasant smell in the air. You turn to your right, and see a large closed sphincter, something huge. Light filters through the center. The environment seems oily, and the smell is everywhere. You are suddenly afraid of turning around, as you know you won't like where you are.</span></div></div>",

It is clear to you that wherever Floatzel has sent you, the Pokemon is playing an awful prank on you. Judging from what he said before he transported you to this foul-smelling place, Floatzel seems a bit upset that you refused to talk on his behalf. But if you we're to help him, it defeats the entire point of the meeting. Unamused by the Pokemon's antic, you try to call him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Floatzel.\", you said loudly, \"What is the big idea with this? If this is one of your pranks again, I telling you that it isn't funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think this is a way of getting me to do the entire meeting for you, you are seriously mistaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon still didn't say a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat!, you thought, either he didn't hear me or he was deliberately ignoring me. Without any choice, you looked around your new environment to get an idea of where you are. On the opposite side of the sphincter is a long passage way that extends deeper into Floatzel's body. The bad smell seems to be emanating from the tunnel from occasion warm breezes blowing toward you. You took the tunnel and went further into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell got stronger and stronger until it became virtually unbearable. A few more minutes later, you found yourself in a small chamber that is featuress and oily like the tunnel. There are a series of unreachable openings on the ceiling that are dripping with more oily substance. Just as you covered you nose in disgust, you noticed several dark lumps of solids that clings to the walls and ceiling. A closer inspection reveals them as the source of the smell and are soft, slimy, and slippery. Hold on........The revelation dawned on you like a lightning strike; you are in Floatzel's rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are usually tolerating of Floatzel's prank but, this time, he really crossed a line. Just as you are about to complain, a large groan vibrates throughout the entire chamber. Mushy liquids began pouring through the openings. Solid wastes plop down like hail, striking you like wet earth. The chamber quickly got filled, leaving you with little room to move around. The walls suddenly contract squeezing you back into the tunnel at astonishing speed. With each contraction of the tunnel, you move closer to the sphincter you've seen earlier. At this point, you are hoping that Floatzel relief himself on soft grounds otherwise you'll be injured badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final push, you passed through the sphincter with the rest of the wastes behind you. You felt yourself land on soft sands with a loud thunk. When you looked up, you saw more wastes coming out Floatzel's anus, burying you up to your head in his feces. You pried yourself out of the warm mess and found Floatzel looking down on you with a satisfied grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like the trip down there?\", the Pokemon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot a glare at Floatzel and look as sternly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why the stare? I just need to give you a reminder about how not to hurt Floatzel's feeling.\", he said with a faked sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have told me back there at the control center.\", you exclaimed, \"There's really no need for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look. I probably let my prankster side got the better of me again. Is there any way we could talk this over?\", Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Are. In. Major. Trouble.\", you said slowly, \"Now, open up your mouth, I would like to return to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What are you going to do now..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....nothing\", you answered as you entered the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon was left speechless on the beach. Floatzel thought to himself that his prank might have gone too far for the trainer to take. The Pokemon remained where he was, staring aimlessly into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know the human is about to take on a sweet revenge on him.</span></div></div>",

While you do that, you mull for the way to get your own revenge on Floatzel. The prank had gone too far, mainly because it was unexpected and really nasty. After a goof half hour of scrubbing, checking again and muttering your own anger at Floatzel, you step out of the shower, with a plan in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking towards the control room once again.Once you enter, you stand in front of the controls, and Floatzel has noticed your presence. \"I thought that you couldn't come here without my permission\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you owe me something after what you made me go through?!\" you almost lose your control once again, just thinking about that. Floatzel stays silent, noting that you do have a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're sure that you won't have any other objections, you put your plan into motion. You grab the controls, and moments later you have full control of Floatzel's body. You plan to place Floatzel in peril, you don't know how, then save him at the last moment after he has panicked and tried to take the control back. You're sure it fits what he did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou command Floatzel's body to walk around, trying not to make Floatzel suspect your intentions. It is too bad that you overreacted when he asked you that when you entered the control room. You find a trail that goes deeper into the forest. At this point, your host decides to ask: \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to relax. Don't worry about it\" you say, trying to appear calmed. You finally find what you was looking for. There is a cliff. Based on what you see, it is about two stories high. If something goes wrong, this will at most give Floatzel some bruises, no more, but you're sure you can handle this. You start running towards the cliff. Once you can see the edge, you are ready to move the controls so Floatzel suddenly does some kind of backflip, so he doesn't fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Floatzel's body runs, you can hear him telling you to stop, or he would take the controls back. Then you do it. You pull the controls back. Floatzel jumps back, and you lose your footing and fall. At the same time, Floatzel regains control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stand up, you realize that you did it perfectly. Floatzel isn't falling, and he is visibly shaked by the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" you hear your host ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Payback. I made you feel something similar to what I felt. Now we're even\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel stays silent, clearly not knowing what to say. He knew that a confrontation would turn this into worse, so he decided to not to say a thing and try to end this peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. We both went too far in our actions. I'm sorry\" After a moment, you say the same thing, realizing that you as well went too far. \"I started this, so I should give you something...here. Come through this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hole opens in the floor, in front of you. You jump in it, promising yourself that if this takes you to the rectum again, hell will break loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in middle of a sticky liquid. The chamber you're in is dimly illuminated, and you can't see the walls. You feel yourself slowly sink in it, until it reaches your chest. A borderline sickeningly sweet smell fills the air, which you deduce is coming from the substance. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me you aren't going to freak out. This place is for you to relax. To let yourself go and forget what you just went through\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what is this place?\" you ask, feeling yourself more relaxed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may know that some Pok\u00e9mon and animals have glands with a fluid that identifies them to other members of their species, these glands being connected to parts you may not want to visit again. Well, you're inside one of those glands\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're oddly indifferent to that. Maybe it is the effect of the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't made for guests, but I think you needed it. After you calm down, follow the tube down there. Once you're inside it, I'll redirect it so you don't end back in...well, down there. It is empty now but I doubt you'll want to see my rectum again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. In about an hour, the meeting should take place. Maybe you should stay here until it is time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes, you felt that you are calm enough to begin moving around a little. With the substance covering you up to your hip, you find moving around to be slightly difficult. You began thinking about how the meeting might go. You wonder what will Lugia do to deal with Floatzel. Will she ask him to do her a favor to prove that he's genuine? Will Floatzel willingly accept her terms? What worries you the most is that the meeting will somehow go wrong; you can't even imagine the results. You can only hope that things will go as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you got bored of being in the gland and requested Floatzel to direct his path to the control room. The Pokemon obeyed and opened up a path for you to take. You walked the the tunnel, reaching the control room in just ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is now slightly different. More decors are included in the room to make it look more accommodating. The brain walls are replaced with blue colored membrane while corners are rounded out. The control panel for Floatzel is still intact, but now contain more interactive screens and buttons. The stacks of paper are no longer present. You take that as meaning that Floatzel mustered the courage to do thing himself. The screen in front of you depicts the meeting spot with Lugia along with a countdown that shows 15 minutes remaining. You can tell that Floatzel is nervous based on the heart rate and emotion graph on one of the panels. Before you could say something, Floatzel spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the control room, human. I wanted to apologize for my abrupt request that you do the meeting in my place.\", the Pokemin said politely, \"However, I have a new assignment for you. I need you to help me monitor all the status screens during my meeting. When I get too tensed, you press a few buttons to redirect the blood flow. In certain instance when I'm too nervous to speak, you can use the microphone to temporarily speak for me. Don't worry about that part, I have a word prompter handy for you to read my thoughts with. If I got agitated for whatever reason there is, just set my voice to mute and press the tranquilizer gland button. Is the plan fine with you, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...That definitely sounds a lot better than your old plan. But you still have to do the majority of the meeting yourself. Got it?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\", Floatzel said as matter of factly, \"Okay, the meeting will start very soon; in about 8 minutes. Do you want to familiarize yourself with the controls again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Always be prepared for a meeting.\", you told the Pokemon playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Floatzel spent the last few minutes practicing and rehearsing the controls and key points of the meeting. When the time finally came, you saw a figure in the sky flying toward you two. The shape was unmistakably Lugia in her fully extended form. You marveled at the graceful way she flew toward your spot, landing just a few feet way from Floatzel. With her blue eyes fixed on the Water Pokemon, you can feel authority beaming from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it\", you told Floatzel, \"Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore you heard a faint gulp from somewhere behind you as you sat down at the controls and watch the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is supposed to be a harsh expression, but you can see something more, and you feel that it is directed towards you, maybe because she knows you'll be watching all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stare at each other, before Lugia started the conversation. \"Okay. Are you really willing to forget all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand that this can't just be left behind. Your actions has caused many problems, Floatzel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is all sounding like a scolding from a mentor towards its mentee. With each line, you can note that Floatzel is getting progressively more nervous and frustrated at the same time. You know that if this keeps going, Floatzel could start saying things he'll regret later. You remember what Floatzel had asked you to do. You press the buttons he had indicated would calm him down, while Lugia is still talking. You look at the screens around you, and effectively, it seems that you did redirect the blood flow and made Floatzel be calmer overall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you about most of the things you have said\" Floatzel says in a civil way. You sigh in relief. \"I realize that I have done the wrong thing by trying to be more powerful than I should be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia smiles. She seems pleased to hear that. Then she adds: \"Nice. I reckon that I have acted in a way I shouldn't have. You deserved more respect from me, and I'm sorry for my own wrongdoings\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the content of the screens, Floatzel is more relaxed now, but he tenses when Lugia continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have something that belongs to me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you press 'mute' and talk for him, in case he screws up. \"Yes. I took it in a lapse of bad judgment. I'll return it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you give Floatzel his voice back, he apologizes for taking the pearl. \"Excellent! What happened to that human that was inside you? Is it still somewhere in your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is around. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you give me my pearl back maybe I could do something for him. He was pushing for this meeting. I think it should get a reward\" You have a good feeling what your reward will be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was all its recommendation. I agree\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. I would like to talk to him, meet him for a day or something. I'll give you some privacy, so you can get the human and the pearl out of your body\" she says before flying to a few meters away. When she is gone, Floatzel talks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help, human. I'm sure that I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. It will be...hard to let you go but I can do it. Come to my mouth, I'll get the pearl out of my body by myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the control room, ready to leave Floatzel's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt proud about resolving the dispute between Floatzel and Lugia. Turning back, you see Floatzel standing up to his full height and hear an audible rumbling sound coming from the Pokemon's belly. Then you see the pearl coming out of Floatzel's mouth, landing securely onto his paw. The Pokemon bent down again and handed you the pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, human.\", Floatzel said, \"This thing will probably help you with getting back to normal. Again, I really want to thank you for resolving our problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see genuine emotion written on Floatzel's face. You also felt a pang of sadness when you looked deep into those watery brown eyes. This is it! You finally got the pearl to return you to your real size. You felt happiness, real happiness for the first time in months. The past several days you spent in Floatzel sure took a turn for the better. Originally a quick mission to retrieve the pearl had evolved into amending the tie between two old friends. You felt proud of your contribution and Lugia definitely has kind words for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing, Floatzel. You should thank yourself because you did most of the meeting yourself. I just gave you that little push and it's enough to get the momentum rolling.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You''re right.......I did it and now, Lugia and I can finally return to being close friends again. You should bring this stuff back to Lugia, you shouldn't really keep her waiting. I'll be standing right here to see how stuffs turn out.\", Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at Floatzel and told him that you will talk with Lugia about how to reward him for his honest apology. Then you slowly carried the pearl to Lugia, who is waiting behind a large boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lugia sees you, a bright smile spread onto her face. It's a smile of pride and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that you can get Floatzel to change so dramatically in such a short time. And more importantly, you got my pearl back. I couldn't think of a better thing to say now.\", Lugia beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was simple, I just convinced him to share his thoughts with me. After listening to his stories, I realize that his relation with you can still be salvaged. So I planned this whole thing and you played along so well.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we have everything we need now, what do you plan to do now?\", Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should also give Floatzel a reward. Although I have to admit I assisted him in some parts of the meeting, he did most of it himself. I believe that we could do something for him. Also, returning me to normal size can wait a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you can enter your personal room for the time being. I still got some questions to ask Floatzel.\", Lugia said while opening her mouth, \"I still have some curious questions to ask him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got some rather personal question to ask me. If you wanna listen to it, drop by my brain chamber. As a little bonus game, wanna do some of the questions for me? I always love to see Floatzel say something silly. Call that a good old-fashion Lugia prank.\", Lugia chuckled.</span></div></div>",

Or at least for some time, maybe someday you can return to this place with your normal size and see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the brain chamber, wanting to listen what Lugia will say to Floatzel. Much to your surprise, you find that the few days you spent outside Lugia made you kinda forget the path. When you finally get to the correct place, Lugia had already started teasing Floatzel. Obviously the newly created friendship has made Lugia all cheery, and it shows in her tone. When you enter the room, she stops talking. \"There is somebody who wants to ask you a few questions as well, Floatzel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, a contraption similar to a microphone forms in front of you. You take your chance with the first line you can think. \"Already forgot about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel stays silent for a moment before replying. \"Of course not! What are you doing inside Lugia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to meet me a bit more. But let's not talk about me. So tell me, are you going to be the host for another humans?\" you say with the best tezasing tone you can make. While Floatzel stammers to reply, you quickly add \"But nobody would be as fun and nice as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Sure, I guess so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember all the good times we had! Okay, changing, is there something you hadn't told me about a certain somebody who may or not be listening to us right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, it is Lugia of course! I wonder if there is something beyond admiration and respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you could hear Floatzel gasping in horror and Lugia chuckling softly. \"Of course not! It is just...ah...uh...why do you have to ask that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you have such a nice color when you are blushing, that is why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never see me like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can imagine it. It is a great mental image, don't deny it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the next half hour, Lugia and you take turns asking the most awkward questions you two can think. Floatzel manages to insert a few jabs towards you and the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, and soon the conversation ends. You return to your known bedroom, deep inside Lugia. You find a Pok\u00e9mon you recognize on the bed, sleeping. You had forgotten about Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a few adventures inside me too, as I lead her through the same steps you had taken inside me. She is a nice Pok\u00e9mon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to wake up Vaporeon, so you carefully lay on the bed near, and soon you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is very few time to spend inside Lugia now. You decide that the first thing you'll do tomorrow is to plan what you will do before returning to your normal size at the very end of the day. You fall asleep</span></div></div>",

You thought for a moment about the time where you first met Lugia, the countless adventures in her body, the ordeal with Ho-oh, and finally finding a new side to Floatzel. You decided that it is best for you to make this day as normal as possible because you also don't want Lugia to feel too sad. You got out of your bed and traveled to the eye chamber to eat your breakfast and see what Lugia want to do today. Much to you delight, the Pokemon has your favorite food placed on the table with inviting decors. You ate all the food without hesitation, feeling happy for the Lugia and yesterday's resolution. As you sipped the last of the berry juice, Lugia began to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Well, it looks like today will be the last day for you at this size.\", the Pokemon said sadly, \"Once I use the pearl on you, you will return to your normal size. While that's good for you, it also means that you won't be able to enter my body anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that....but I can't stay like this forever.\", you explained, \"I still got gym leaders to battle, new friends to meet, and new Pokemons to catch. But even if that's the case, I will still find ways to visit you or enter you if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are concerned about the pearl being a one-way spell, there is no need to worry about that. \", Lugia whispered,  \"Let me tell you a little secret. The pearl I possess allows the bearer to enlarge and shrink a living being at discretion. The original reason that I created it is for me to be able to stow treasures and other stuffs in my body without putting on too heavy a load. And you might be wondering why I am sharing this information with you: the reason I guess you were shrunk in the first place is because of Floatzel who happened to steal that pearl days before I met you. He must've been playing around with it and unknowingly aimed it's power at you. I should've figured that out earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean.......\", you tried to produce a sentence, \"You mean that this entire journey over the past few months is all thanks to Floatzel?!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That probably is the most likely case.\", Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My........so he's the one who enabled me to meet you!\", you said with realization, \"I never thought I would say this but I gotta find a way to payback that fellow for allowing me to meet such a beautiful Pokemon like you, Lugia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, oh, you!\", Lugia blushed, \"You're just too sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment.\", you said boastfully, \"Well, we better get the day started if we want to get anything done. So any idea what we can do, my dear Lugia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about this for a long time. You once said that you love me no matter the species I am. Back in that personal bedroom when you're with me, it felt that as if we are somehow destined to meet each other, to love as equal. You told me how you yearn to fly, to experience the freedom that a Legendary Pokemon has to herself. I want to make this the most memorable one of your life. Here's what I want you to do and it will be the first time I ever allowed a human to try. My dear trainer, I would like to give you the honor of flying me. And if that's isn't enough, I'll show you something more than that 'eye movie' back then. Now, just find my control chamber and let me be under. your. complete. control.\"</span></div></div>",

You're about to go, but then you remember that you have no idea where it is. The head? Possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guide you...\" Lugia says. You're guided by her words, up to her head. Your hunches were right. Soon you're in front of the opening that leads to the inside of the room. When Lugia opens it dramatically, you're amazed with what you see. Lugia's controls are far more complex than the ones you had seen so far. Maybe Lugia's psychic traits are the cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in front of the main controls. \"You're free to do whatever you want\" You take the controls, with only one thing in mind: flying. With Lugia's size, this must be a different experience. You make Lugia start flying, and you're amazed to see how smooth this goes. It is a surreal experience, being able to see how Lugia's body moves in one of the screens, knowing you're the one who controls it. You fly all over the land and over the sea, going miles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're flying, Lugia talks to you affectionately. \"You'll miss me, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will\" you say, while making Lugia dive into the ocean. \"I was thinking...how often will I be able to see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not often...but twice a year would be good.

You continue flying, while Lugia is...almost flirting with you. The flight is very calm, and you are enjoying it immensely. Lugia's talk makes it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, you make Lugia's body land in the small expanse in front of her home. Then the legendary Pok\u00e9mon regains control. \"This was awesome\" you say sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed the first activity of your last day inside me. Want to go to the next point? The movie. I assure you it'll be nothing you have seen before. Be ready to be impressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She promised that the experience will be something new and original. You follow her directions and arrived at a large room somewhere in Lugia's back. As expected the large room contains a tall screen that takes up the  entire space at one side of the wall. Large trumpet-like fixtures adorn the walls and ceilings which you assume are speakers. A lone seat is found situated on a inclined slope that faces the screen. A closer inspection of your seat reveal that it has numerous holes where you can insert your arms and leg into. Strangely enough, the shape and styling gives you the impression that you will be sitting on Lugia's belly. You wasted no time in making yourself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seat I made for you will allow you to feel and smell stuffs from the movie.\", Lugia explains, \"The film I directed will be presented with ultra high clarity and immersive sounds. It is also an  interactive so you can make choices in the movie that I have preset for you. If you feel hungry in the middle of the film, you can pause the film by pressing the blue button on the armrest and grab some foods from the snack bar  I set up in the corner of the theater. If you have no more questions, just sit back, relax, and enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights in the room darkened as the screen before you comes alive. The title of the film is called \"Blue Flights\" and by the look of it, it will be a romance story. The movie begins with Lugia flying alone in the night sky. There are tears in her blue eyes that shows profoundly in moonlight. In that instance, you can feel wind blowing past you hands and legs and the faint scent of salt sifting into your nose. Lugia sang a sad song about how she wanted a companion, someone to love her. The way her snow white wings flap, her tail flutters, and the look on her face really gives you an idea how hopeless the Lugia felt. Her voice was extremely beautiful and you felt touched by it. There is a unexplainable charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flying for some more shots, the Lugia landed within a thick forest and gaze longingly toward the full moon. Unexpectedly, the Lugia on the screen turns around and looks at you.</span></div></div>",

Could it really be a metaphorical representation of you? Who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is an inoffensive being like you doing here in the forest at night?\" she says with a sweet tone.

She went on to say that the ordeal she faced made her reconsider the true role of a Legendary Pokemon: that is, protection of not only the sea you live in, but also love. After sitting together for some times on the island, the two Lugias took off toward the evening sky and flew against the backdrop of a colorful twilight. You see them glide gracefully in a crisscross fashion not unlike synchronized dancing. The intimacy of the flight indicates that this is some form of Pokemon rituals, perhaps for mating. You blushed slightly at the unlikely possibility of Lugia actually doing it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to watch the two Lugias fly until the sky fades to dark and stars begin to appear. By this time, the female Lugia leads the male one back toward her cavern on the island. Once both of them are in the cavern,  the female casts a forcefield on the entrance and focused her attention on the male Lugia. She moves toward him in a rather suggestive manner and held him tightly in her wings. Blushes began to form on both of their cheeks as they caress within an embrace. The female Lugia whispered to her mate: 'I wanted you the entire time but I was never sure about it. Meeting you back in that forest surely provided me with the opportunity to better know you, to realize what is important for a Legendary. Now, it is time for me to confide with you how much I needed you, wanted you.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the line is directed at the Lugia, you feel that the Pokemon is actually talking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene involves passionate exchanges, preening, and gentle pecking between the Lugias. The exchange has caused you so much blushing that you are wet from the sweat. After much action, the film ends with the Lugias staying on the island, guarding over the seas with their newly forged bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got off your seat and look at the time. It is now late afternoon. Wow, you never realized that the movie would be this long. You tried to talk to Lugia but she didn't reply to you. Initially, you thought that she must have fell asleep somehow but a message left the the screen tells you to go and take a rest in your room. Secondly, she wants you to go to the Store and get yourself something nice to wear and meet her at the food storage chamber where she will assume appropriate form. Lugia also adds that she has a surprise for you when you meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and started walking back to your room. Could this be? She's asking me out?</span></div></div>",

But you are sure that there will be a grand ending to your adventure. Meanwhile you decide to do what Lugia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room, and start gathering your stuff. You take the stuff you obtained from the store, and put them in a large backpack you had obtained in your first days. You take your time, until you make sure that everything is well crammed in it. Once you're done packing, you lie in your bed idly. You want to give Lugia some time before the date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you consider you have spent enough time doing nothing, you decide to go to the second point in your list: getting a suit. You go back to the old platform that you found during the firsts days you spent inside Lugia, and stand on it. Soon you receive what you wanted, a dark blue suit, which fits you perfectly. Good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are dressed accordingly, you go towards your destination. Your own clock says it is around 10:00 PM. There re two hours before night ends. What will happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the food storage chamber, which is much dimmer than you remember. There is some sort of tissue on the floor, almost like a blanket. On the blanket there is a bottle and a basket. Upon closer examination, the bottle has some of Lugia's wine. You remember the incident when you got drunk and went swimming in your host's bladder. It was very embarrassing when it happened, but now you laugh when you remember. Looks like today everything is making you remember details of your adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're about to examine the contents of the basket, you hear a faint sound, the sphincter of the chamber opening.

The way Lugia looks completely has your attention now. Stunned, it took you a few second or so to realize that she has assumed the form of a human. She dressed herself in a long white gown with blue sequin details. On her hands, there are white gloves that have designs made to resemble her wings. As you eyes fall upon her face, you met with a pair of ocean blue eyes with a soft face framed by long, light brown hair. Lugia's human form looks about the same age as you and with a similar height. Around her neck, there is a sapphire necklace with the outline of her Pokemon form. As you studied her new form, you could say that she is the personification of beauty itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you never expected me to assume human form, right? I figured that since this is an actual date, I need to do something a little more special for you. Plus, it helps remove the awkwardness about dating with a Pokemon. So, how's my dress?\", Lugia beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...look...absolutely fabulous.\", you replied, trying hard to hide your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia walked slowly toward you and stretched out her hand. You took the cue and bent down to give it a light kiss. You heard Lugia stifled a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all these times I looked over humans, I still couldn't figure out the courtship rituals you have.\", Lugia said, a light blush also evident on her face, \"I guess I still have a lot to learn about humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lugia.\", you told her with a comforting smile, \"You'll have them figured out pretty quickly soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", Lugia smiled, \"I'll see where this goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully assisted her in settling down on the blanket and grabbed two wine glasses that are set up at the side. You uncorked one of the bottles containing Lugia's wine and carefully pour it into the glasses. You passed one to her and raised yours. At that moment, the ceiling transformed and show stars, galaxies, and the moon from the outside while soft music composed by Lugia started playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Legendary Love\", you said as you gave a toast to Lugia.</span></div></div>",

There are very few moments in somebody's life where one feels in peace with everything and everybody, and this is one of yours. And Lugia, with her human form, is simply mesmerizing. You would be content with looking at her the whole night, but you have the fortune to talk and be close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you two are talking about any theme. Traveling, friends, questions you have about the world. Lugia seems to know all the answers, surely because of her legendary life. You then try to impress it by telling interesting or funny anecdotes from your trainer life. You seem to be successful in that regard. She laughs, and is genuinely happy. You are proud of your clever anecdotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you two run out of food, but there is still plenty wine. You two lay down in the floor, and contemplate the stars and constellations over your heads. You know it is an illusion, but it is still beautiful to just see that. You hold Lugia's hand, and feel that there is no place where you would rather be right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to bring this again, but I suppose you know you're leaving\" says Lugia, with a sad tone. You just nod, looking at the stars. \"I know we'll see each other again. But I want to give you something so you will remember me while we're apart\" Then she takes her necklace. \"Take this. For our love...if you feel the same for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" you say, taking the necklace. You don't imagine yourself wearing it, but you know you'll take it everywhere you go. It'll be like a lucky charm. You approach closer to Lugia, and you two cuddle while the music keeps sounding. You're in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lugia stands up. The music stops, and you feel that it is time. \"It is midnight. It is...time for your departure\" You nod, and stand too. The constellations over your head disappear. \"I'll be waiting for you to come out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, you can take any route you want, out of my body. Just thought it would be good to remind you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll consider it\" you say. Then Lugia's human form leaves the room. You're left alone, and drink the remains of the wine. You feel that you aren't ready to leave Lugia's body, but it is now or never. Your life is waiting for you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although she promised that you would be seeing her regularly from time to time, you still feel saddened that you have to leave Lugia. From the time you first met her, the countless days you shared your stories with her, the ordeal with Ho-oh and Floatzel up until now. A lot has happened in such short time. In some ways, it kind of happened too fast for you; as much as you find it weird, you realized that you really love Lugia. You look at her as something far more than a Pokemon. You seriously thought of her as someone who you could develop a relationship with if you look past the differences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered to  head to your bedroom to get your things along with Vaporeon which you returned to a Pokeball. After packing up everything you have, you continue on your way to the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes later, you eventually see Lugia's mouth and slowly stepped out. The cold air immediately caused you to shiver. You are back in the cave of Lugia. Turning over to Lugia, you saw her preparing the pearl on the ground. Floatzel sat at one side of the cave curiously looking at what Lugia is doing. He has a gentle smile on his face when his eyes fall upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did the date between you and Lugia turned out?\", he asked with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...who told you about that?\", you stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. It's just that I'm curious about the courting behaviors of humans. So I kinda asked Lugia to show me the whole thing using the eye trick. And it sure looks like a good movie.\", Floatzel said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply and shot a glare at Lugia who is also trying to hide her blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\", Floatzel said, \"She showed me under the condition I tell no one else. You can count on me. By the way, could you tell me what next after the dating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough Floatzel.\", Lugia exclaimed, \"First, I showed you that because you promised me that you wouldn't tell anyone. Secondly, you also promised to clean up the cave after I showed you that. Better start before I decide to  blast you to the other side of the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, alright. Hey, human. Be sure to explore more of Lugia the next time you're in her.\", Floatzel said with a inplying tone as he begin cleaning the cave starting at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a tiny ball of energy from Lugia struck him on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the sight in slight amusement. Looks like the two is really getting along well now, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it..... The moment you regain your normal size.\", Lugia said, a hint of sadness in her voice, \"Please stand in front of the pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as you're told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\", Lugia said as she began using her power to activate the pearl. Her eyes glowed bright white and the symbols began appearing on the pearl. Suddenly, it glows blindingly and you're enveloped in a bright blue ray.</span></div></div>",

She knows you're grateful for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also feel a tug on your clothes. You look at the source, and see Floatzel. It is surreal, now that you think about it. Less than three days ago, you were so small you had a series of adventures inside him. But now you're back to normal, and despite his size being much bigger than most of his species, you're taller than him. Barely, but you're taller. In a way, you're grateful to him too. After all, he may have been the cause of your shrunken state. You want to give him a reward, but seeing how you got nothing in that moment, you limit it to helping him clean the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a huge cave, and it took one hour to leave it clean enough, mainly because Floatzel couldn't resist playing a prank or two on you. Lugia watched the whole time, amused. \"We're finally done\" you say, approaching Lugia. You already said farewell to Floatzel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time for you to continue your life. I can use my psychic powers to move you wherever you want. Where do you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment before replying. \"It would be appropriate to continue where I stopped. Can you take me to the forest you had found me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia smiles and nods. \"See you soon...never forget this adventure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't even be possible to forget\" you reply, while the environment around you warps and turns blurry. Seconds later, you're back to the forest you had been shrunk in. It is still night, but you know how to get out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plan to somehow contact Lugia (you have the feeling that the bond between you two will make it easy) again in some months, and spend some days shrunk. Who knows, maybe you can be inside Floatzel again, or maybe experiment and see if there are any other Pok\u00e9mon that could serve as a host for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt you'll ever tell anybody what you went through (and who would believe you?), but you know it will be something that will be present for the rest of your life. </span></div></div>",

You take the necklace she gave you wherever you go as a good luck charm and a souvenir from your beloved Lugia. Each time you stepped into a gym, you easily take down all the trainers inside along with their leader. Each time you're battling a Pokemon, you couldn't help but wonder if they also have interiors like Lugia or have fascinations about devouring their trainers. With your flawless victory, almost all of the gym leaders are surprised as to how you knew about the innermost weakness of each type of Pokemon. You always tell them that it's years of training. In actuality, Lugia shared those information with you. Before you know it, you've won all the gym badges for your region and you planned on continuing on to Kanto for the next eight badges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night when you returned to your apartment after another day of training. Traveling through all those towns have really taken a toll on you. Every day in the past months, you couldn't get your mind off Lugia. You could imagine her feeling similar emotions while she glides the skies, back to her duty as guardian of the ocean. You took a quick shower and checked your computer for any news today. But most of the articles today don't interest you. The few that do talked about the mythology of Legendary Pokemons. When you read their conjectures, you couldn't but smile at how wrong their guesses are, as the only human who had firsthand experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are about to lie down in your bed, you see a soft glow emanating from Lugia's necklace on your desk. Puzzled by the sudden phenomenon, you picked up and examined it. You can see the sapphire symbol flashing in a slow rhythmic pattern. Before you could examine it any further, the pendant levitates on its own and started tugging at your hand. It seems as if it wants to lead you somewhere. Curious, you let the necklace lead the way out your apartment and on the way out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you find yourself at the forest again. Tonight, it seems particularly quiet; nothing but the rustling of the leaves and occasional chirping sound of bug Pokemons. The necklace continues to lead you deeper into the woods until you came upon a rarely visited clearing. When you looked up from the necklace, you find yourself looking at none other than Lugia. Her soft fur glows as if they were struck by moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, you are overwhelmed with emotions as you raced over to embraced her with tearful eyes. Lugia craned her neck around you in a similar display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia, I missed you so much.\", you said as you felt her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\", Lugia said, \"After you left, I thought about you all the time. So much that it had somehow affected my power. It sure feels good to be reunited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia lowered her beak to your mouth a gave you a passionate kiss. Without prompting yourself, you kissed back in a comparable way. The two of you kissing for several minutes before Lugia's voice speaks in a somewhat different tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Can you two cut the kissing already? It feels  like I'm watching a boring dating lesson here. I'm giving a 4 out of 10. And Lugia, you really need to switch off the waterworks here; all those tears could fill your ocean several times over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....huh.\", you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\", Lugia apologized, \"It's just Floatzel messing with my controls again.

It sunk in, she moaned in pleasure. You then pressed the other into her. You sunk deeper into her as her sex twitched and flexed around you. You were up to your waist in a few minutes.<br>\r\n\"You are enjoying this.\"<br>\r\n'Oh yes I am. I love it, I should have asked for this after you were full sized.' She moaned to you. Another flex of her sex and you sunk deeper. It was comforting and soft... Silky soft, You knew that it was soft because of your previous adventures in her. But this was different as you were a guest in her body, and now you are a guest again but this time you are not small... Another twitch and you had to shove your arms in so that it wouldn't become awkward. Her sex then slurped up the rest of you a minute later. You found yourself inside of her... You of course couldn't see anything more than the glowing ceiling of her womb. which after she got to her feet she started walking around... You moan softly as you feel her around you. She was so soft, and warm.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You recognize the pink body, the kind eyes, the long tail. You also notice it is hovering around, confirming your thoughts. Remembering what you had read in a book about legendary Pokemons, this one was a Mew. You also remember the book said it was an small pokemon, but to you it was humongous! You try to measure it. -\"It must be at least 180 ft tall, not including tail!\"-you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also feel happy to see Mew. After all, he is a legendary psychic Pokemon. Maybe he could help you to be normal-sized again. Although the Mew already had seen you, you was afraid he, she or whatever it was, would think you was just a bug and wouldn't pay attention to you, so you try to get his attention. You yell a few times and jump as high as you could, which was less than a centimeter. Luckily, it seemed to have noticed you, since it hovered lower and finally landed softly near you. The Mew tried to look at you, its big face to a few centimeters of you. You jump a bit more, until you're sure Mew won't stop looking at you. After some seconds of silence, you hear a voice saying, most likely Mew's:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Amazing, a tiny human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to be recognized as a human and not as a common insect, you wonder how Mew could talk, then forgetting about it, supposing it was some sort of phychic power, telepathy or something like that. You yell as loud as you could:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Help! I shrunk!\"<br>\r\n-\"I noticed that, but how did it happen?\"-Mew replied.<br>\r\n-\"I don't know. I was just walking around, almost passed out and then I found I was tiny\"-You answered-\"Couldn't you help me to get back to normal size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly wait for Mew's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry, I can't. My powers aren't that good right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at your feet, sad. Then you hear Mew saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't leave you here. There are too many dangers and predators in the forest. Would you like to live with me until we find how this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. After all, what Mew said was true, you alone wouldn't survive for too long. Besides, the idea of living with Mew for a time didn't sound bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, I won't mind it. But where would I live?\"<br>\r\n-\"I only can think of one option, due to your size. You could live inside me. You would be safe, warm, and well-fed. And there would be nothing to worry about, too.\"<br>\r\n-\"I...what?\"-you reply, surprised of Mew's option-\"but...what about acids, and the air, and\"<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry. You won't be digested and you will be safe of anything. You will even be able to see inside me. I promise you'll be okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. After some seconds, you realize that living inside Mew is your only option right now, since you see nothing better. You could get lost, or fall and break your bones or drown in a puddle or many other possibilities easily. Living inside Mew would be a good enough shelter, warm and comfy. And if Mew says you will be okay, you see no reason to not to believe that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, I accept.\"<br>\r\n-\"Excellent. Would you like to get in now?\"-Mew said, pointing at his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The throat muscles massaged you as they pushed you deeper into Mew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou landed in her stomach with a plop.  To your surprise, Mew was right, there were no stomach acids, there was plenty of air and there was even a dim light in the stomach just like Mew said.  \"I should probably tell you, I am no ordinary Mew.\"  Mew said.  You looked around and to your astonishment, her stomach was impossibly huge!  You could barely see the other side of the stomach.  You took a closer look and saw some kind of screen showing a moving picture of a forest setting.  \"That let's you see outside of me.\"  Mew said.  You looked in udder shock as you realized that Mew was not and ordinary, Mew.  You looked behind you and saw two openings.  One had a sign that said \"Bowels\"  and the other had a sign the said \"Inner world\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What does that mean?\"  You asked.

You followed her directions and soon enough, you did find something that interests you.  It was a house!  A house made from parts of the walls of the interior.

A bed, kitchen a bathroom and other bits and pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tMew kept talking as you explored your new \"home.\"  \"Do you like it?\"  She asked.  \"I built it especially for you.\"  You looked around again, and you noticed, she wasn't kidding.  Every thing was built based on your interests and tastes.  \"Yes, I love it!\"  You replied.  \"Excellent, do you want to explore more?\"  She asked.  After taking a short breath, you said yes and she showed you something on the TV screen in your home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Poke-net</b><br>\r\nA huge room full of computers!

It light pink in color with several prominent folds and wrinkles on its surface. Its size, you estimate, is about 100 feet wide and 50 feet tall.

All mew did is to give you a nod while telling you to enjoy the sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside of her body, a male manaphy gets the nod and he immediately thrusts his erect penis inside Mew's actual vagina. While the sea faring pokemon gives the feline kitty the sex treatment she seeks, you get to watch the outgoing action happening between her vagina and the male pokemon's penis rubbing, bumping, and spilling liquid substances on the other. All the while you enjoy fucking the legendary pokemon, you have your gaze on her cervix opening with the manaphy's penis becoming visible beyond the tv screen. As the marathon goes on, mew in her ecstatic drive loses focus as her virtual body slowly lifts you towards one of her egg chambers. \"Oh fuck me like a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware that your body is sticking on one of get DNA chromosomes, Manaphy already starts to pound on the back wall of mew's womb. Moments later, the water type pokemon releases a big flood of light blue cum all around her womb. Just before you could ask mew as to what's going on, the chromosomes injects your body with sleeping fluids that cover your entire body. With the egg shell covering you, the huge flood of cum from the manaphy floods all of the egg chamber as the small holes of the egg collect more chromosomes from the many sperms bombarding the eggs. As mew regains control, she immediately reaches a state of shock that her innocent human friend has bee absorbed by one of her eggs. Though this is not part of her plan at all, a good part of it gives her something to look forward to.</span></div></div>",

What is oh no?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I-I g-got t-to...s-sneeze\" the mew did her best to hold it but was raising her head slightly about to sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Quick hold it i-\" she didn't hold it in enough and a huge gust of wind blasted the tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mew rubbed her nose breathing in from it as she looked in front of her, her psychic powers aren't able to detect the human, normally she could but he had some weird protective aura around him, if it protected him from psychic what else would it protect him from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you you felt everything swirl together as your body did circles in the air before getting sucked into the nose of Mew the legendary psychic pokemon, you were so scared you forgot to scream. The whole place darkened as she wiped her nose outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You rolled along the inside until you stopped, it was too dark to see anything but then you noticed something, mew was glowing inside of herself. Maybe this is her psychic energy, that would explain it, you began to follow the energy until you ran into a fleshy wall, you stop and look up to see you have run into her brain. You look around and see some weird area with windows, you quickly run over and see windows, no, her eyes, they were massive, of course they are you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then look at the brain again and you see some weird area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b></b>'WHERE DID THAT HUMAN GO, I WAS JUST TALKING TO HIM, COULD A SNEEZE HAVE LAUNCHED HIM THAT FAR!!!'<b></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'She was looking for me, how do I get her attention? I'm in her brain, how else?' You head on over to the brain and look around, then you see a glowing chord of energy, you guessed it was made out of psychic so you held it and as you did, you felt everything change, you felt your mind going into Mew's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To get her attention, you need to just force her to do something she doesn't want to, how about transforming? You make her turn into a caterpie before turning back, then you release the psychic chord disconnecting your minds. 'That shoulda worked now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b></b>'HM, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I DID THAT, BUT THAT WAS FUN'<b></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n What have you done, you are encouraging her to be random. You see the windows consistently change repeatedly, she thinks what you did was what she decided to do herself. She changes through the spectrum of pokemon and flies around while doing so. She dances many times and finally she finishes and stands upright. She checks her feet to make sure she didn't step on something or someone particularly. She soghs relieved and continues searching.

You just wait in the area you are in seeing through the eyes of the mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mew was looking through the forest watching the ground, a bit too carefully in fact. She was so focused that she did not notice the humans surrounding her, but you did because you were paying attention tonthe surroundings, you weren't the one looking for a little missing human. You quickly took control and made Mew leap at the last second, you hear a launching sequence and see nets nab the spot you once were. Then you run up a tree and climb it quite nimbly using your tail, you don't know how to use pokemon moves so you used the skills you know of as a human. Then you hide behind a branch as a claw shoots forward and grabs the branch you hid behind before they pull the branch off of the tree, you release control hoping Mew can get out of this, Mew is the master at staying hidden after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"These humans are making it quite hard for me to find that good human from earlier.\" She looks at all the humans before raising her arms and throwing them down, \"Earthquake\" the whole ground shakes and they all fall over with their machines tilting sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Water sport,\" water releases from the Mew who stood above them all the tree now tilting over them directly, \"Thunder,\" everything the humans had or the humans even near the area, not one of them didn't fall unconscious or escape injury, they all wouldn't wake up for a little bit. \"Now to look for that little guy,\" Mew began to float above the ground looking around until a metal hook shot in front of Mew surprising her before it pulled her in and into the arms of a human with a bloody arm, next to him was a vileplume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now Vileplume, use sleep powder,\" and with that, the Mew was captured just for looking for you. As this happened you saw energy form around the room you were in, and a window appeared, you didn't want to walk up to it but you managed to as you headed on over. There, you saw her dream, and in this dream was a doll version of you tied by string and wire. Mew tried to run over and grab you but you were pulled, this repeated quite a lot until Mew bumped into a leg. Looking up she saw death itself as time rewinded and she found herself back at the beginning, and there, was a doll version of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Scared she turned away and tried to run away from the doll, but the wire and string that held the doll, wrapped around Mew and she felt herself turn into a doll until she was dragged around by the human that captured her. It was terrible experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This continued on for hours until you felt her wake up, you ran away from the window of dreams which started to disappear before you ran all the way back to her eyes which wasn't that far. You saw scientists leaving the room, as they left they hit a keypad, you listened to the sound of the keypad and the motion of their hands, you need to know how to get out if you want to rescue Mew. The only other person in the room was some person with a cast on his arm, the one who caught Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bounty hunter walked up to the cage, \"I finally got you, I am obviously the best hunter now that I caught the uncatchable Mew, my name will be glorious, although I felt you let yourself be caught, I don't care either way, you are mine and you can't change that. That collar drains your psychic energy and energy so you can't do anything but watch, as we sell you for a profit, although we'll also have to keep something to get you back so we can sell you again, the scientists are working on it right now as we speak!\" He smiles creepily and I shake my head. Pokemon moves use power points, or energy to operate so basically Mew can't do anything, what I need to do is fix it. I run over to the brain and look around, according to what I know, the brain controls most functions but works on autopilot most of the time. This means I should be able to cut off the flow of energy being circulated through the neck, Mew will get drowsy but she should be able to stay awake for at least a few hours I hope. Then I will need to head down south and manually activate her abilities inside of her body, although each ability would be hard to activate manually and from different places so I have to think of the place with the most amount of abilities and think of the abilities I want to use first and foremost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I finally cut off energy for the neck causing energy to flow in to Mew but none of it enters into her head. I quickly begin to run down until I reach the hole I entered in from, and jump straight down, I came from the nose, I just need to go further down, but if I think about it, I can activate minimize, Mew will sneak through the cage while I travel down and reach her arm, then I can activate moves like mega punch to knockout people in the room. Next I have to activate wing attack to move Mew into the air before typing in the combination I memorised by sound alone, I probably cannot do it but I have to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I feel myself land and I look around, I see myself in the stomach area, I went a little too far down. To activate minimize I would want to be in the chest area or above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I look around and after seeing the preferred path I enter one of the many paths that run through Mew's body as it turns into an incline. The path twists and turns until I see an opening, without a doubt I run through it and find myself in the chest, I was jot exactly sure where but considering I saw special psychic energy nerves running through a special area labeled Minimize, I could guess the middle of Mew's body. I run over to the psychic energy and I try to turn it on, after a few moments I found out that I needed to pour energy into it, I added some pressure to the build up of energy and I felt everything change around me, but it was barely even a change, it was like the ceiling got a milimeter closer, to me Mew's size didn't change noticeably but to her she became much much smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I trust that she is okay outside so I begin to run forward seeing an arm in front of me, I run in and see many paths, but how do I found out which one? This may be harder than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I feel everything shake as Mew moves, she was probably moving through the cage, and as she did I felt myself fall backward, I gasp for breath by pure chance and luckily I managed to snag a breath of air before I feel myself tossed into Mew's bloodstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I feel everything change around me but most of all I couldn't tell which way I was going, I flailed my arms around like mad, how did I even fall into her bloodstream, is this some sort of network in her body so that I can travel around her body quickly? I land onto solid ground and I take many deep breaths I was about to drown in her bloodstream, how sad for me to die in such a way. I am not done yet though, I have to save this pokemon, I look around, the closest pokemon move that I saw was something completely unexpected, hi jump kick, you ran past it and the next move you found was mega kick. You now have to improvise, as you were about to plan what to do next, everything moved and you fell forward and towards the mega kick, as you did it began to activate, and in the process everything spun and you ended up holding onto the mega kick as everything glowed. You heard human voices outside and the sound of destruction as everything began to break outside. Eventually it all calmed down and all you heard was silence, \"IS IT OVER?\" I smile, it was all over at least here it was, apparently the collar slipped off when you minimized. You ran over to hi jump kick as you activated it you heard yourself leap up and using it to hit the keypad you heard sounds activate, after using three hi jump kicks you found out what combination you needed. It took you seven minutes to finally get it, and with it the door opened. Looking around you saw many paths and turns to take, but the only path you considered taking was the bloodstream, you are already soaked and you can only take one way to get to her head quickly, you are far enough as it is. Although it seems like her body is bigger on the inside then the outside so it was probably even farther than that. This time you have to direct your course and aim straight up. Taking a deep breath you leaped into the blood stream as you felt everything begin shaking, as it all began to move, you began to open your eyes, everything is red but you can see, barely. You move your arms to swim up and despite the currents of the bloodstream you prevailed knowing Mew was a kind pokemon that deserves freedom, and these humans were the worst of many humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt youself squeezed as you reached the heart, it was like being hugged by Mew herself but then you were launched fast upwards. Everything went blurry from there as you found yourself...</span></div></div>",

Looking up you saw her skull, more or less you made it to her brain! Congratulations pokemon trainer, you saved a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You slide through a small gap before falling down a little distance and landing in her brain. Then you adjust yourself so that you were secure in her brain and not ready to move your body around, you immediately resumed the flow of energy through Mew's body and she felt her energy skyrocket as it returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> 'I FEEL WIDE AWAKE NOW?!'</b> Mew was definitely surprised as her thoughts echoed through your mind and hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled to yourself before you continued, you have to escape still, you decided to let Mew take control since she is on high alert but if you ever need to take control you were ready. You felt the squishiness and soft gentle thoughts of Mew in your hands as she turned invisible and began flying through the corridor. Sometimes she had to quick wipe out a pokemon or sneak into an elevator silently as others used it to get around but overall it was a nice ride. You almost began to feel sleepy without the constant battles or close calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mew was unfazed though as she didn't have a rapid heartbeat, these close calls would thrill certain types of people. You then see the exit, and at the exit is many people dressed in all sorts of weird clothes and such, they were scanning people who entered and exited and they had scanners in the air. Mew began to float over to the exit to sneak through but I immediately took control, I stopped myself mid-air and almost fell out of the air as I didn't know how to fly, but Mew's instincts guided me step by step once again. It helped me to control aerial flight until I got used to it. It is like holding a cat in the air, Mew is that cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You fly around the edge of the room looking carefully at the machinery until you saw something, someone sneaked into the building through a crack in the wall, it looked like someone dressed futuristic like, almost like team galactic, but what would they be doing in a place like this, it isn't something a team like them would do, it is not high level enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I then guide Mew through the secret entrance until getting through before leaving control to Mew as she flies forward and towards the distance getting far away from the building, I don't even remember what building it was as we had no care for who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Upon arriving to the forest we were previously, Mew searches around and sighs, <b>'I REALLY CAN'T FIND HIM!'</b> Mew sighs to herself and I just sigh as I get off her brain and onto the flesh, I was exhausted from the built up tension I had. Mew, I hope you enjoy your freedom. Although what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Mew is now going home, meanwhile you are bored, what could happen in a single flight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

The Mewtwo says through ESP \"Do not fear, I don't want to hurt you, some other Pokemon might want to though, and I wish to protect you.\" You look at the Mewtwo, you're less scared now since the Mewtwo says he is going to protect you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After trying to choose which road to pick, you decide to start your exploration. You walk towards the right one, looking around to see everything in Mewtwo's stomach. Besides the second hole and the one that is connected to the esophagus and was your entrance to the stomach, there are no more possibilities, so you plan to not to return to the stomach for a while. Then you start opening the entrance to Mewtwo's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tight, but after a while you was able to enter, and got ready to get deeper in Mewtwo's body. All you see at first is a tunnel that, at your actual location, is still pretty big -maybe the roof is a bit lower that in the stomach- and you could see it was going to the left. You start walking, remembering that the small intestine may be pretty long, especially at your current size. The walls moved quite often, and you almost fall once or twice during the first minutes. Then you get used to it and you use the natural movements of the intestines to move faster. You also notice that the while you walk away of the stomach, the roof seems to be lowering and the walls seems to move towards you, but it stops, and you deduce you must have left the duodenum and got into the small intestine, and started walking. There still was enough space to walk, and the roof the of the intestine was still high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls are covered by a strange texture, which reminds you of your location. At first you didn't want to touch it, but after walking several feet in the long tube, you gather enough courage to touch it. The walls feel soft, and you could see every detail of the villi surrounding you, meaning you're quite smaller than you expected. You walk for a long time with your hand on the wall, enjoying how the villi tickled your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes or maybe more, you calculate that you must have seen more than half of the small intestine. While thinking about it, you trip and your hand goes through the wall and you feel some sort of strong current, like a river. You stop and suspect that your hand seems to be in an artery or something similar, and when you remove your hand and see it has a strong red color  you confirm your suspicions. Although you knew that there would be veins and arteries at the other side of the walls of the intestines, you didn't think it would be possible to find a way of getting in Mewtwo's circulatory system. The more you think about it, you realize you could use it as a way to move faster through Mewtwo's body, without having to walk long distances to other places. The only thought of having to walk all the way back to the stomach -something you would have to do sooner or later- makes you feel tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand on the wall to find the artery- or whatever it was- carefully, trying to find in which direction the blood was going. The flow of the blood in the artery seemed to follow the walls of the small intestine back to the stomach, and logically then it would go to other places far from where you are now, always going up until it got to its highest point. In the way you could surely find many places to visit, or even rooms you didn't know could exist inside a Pokemon. Then you go to the opposite wall and try to find a vein or something. You find one and try to feel it. In this one the blood seems to follow the intestine for a bit and then you deduce that it would be the opposite of the flow of the artery, meaning this one would lead even deeper in Mewtwo's body, but far from the intestines, which would help you to find new places too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try to get your hand in the vein, and it slips through the wall easily. Then you remove it and note it didn't leave any mark or hurt the small intestine in any way. You think that just walking into the walls would get you in the artery or the vein and you would be ready to let it carry you to other parts of Mewtwo's body. Then you remember where you are and you look as far as you can in the rest of Mewtwo's small intestine. It seems to continue straight for a few feet and then it goes down. You calculate the end of the small intestine is near and that in a few minutes you will be able to finish walking it, and although you know where it is going, you don't seem to care very much about it. After all, there are surprises and new roads everywhere, and you think that the large intestine wouldn't be an exception<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where would you go?</span></div></div>",

After thinking it carefully for some minutes, you decide to let luck to guide you. So you spin around with your eyes closed until you fall to the floor. In front of you there is one of the walls of the intestine, and after checking again where the small intestine continued, you deduce that you're in front of the wall with the artery. You walk towards it and touch it, feeling its texture again. After some hesittation, you slip your hand through it, and you feel the blood. Moving your hand around you can't feel anything, just the blood splashing agaisnt your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was about to enter the artery, when you remembered that surely it would full of blood, and there wouldn't be any air to breathe. Worried, you decide to ask Mewtwo if there is any way of not to drown in his circulatory system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mewtwo, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n-\"I'll be able to hear you from any part of my body. You are pretty deep inside me, and you will be able to get even deeper if you find the way\"-he says. You stop for a moment to notice he is using telepathy, and then you ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, I'm planning to get into an artery to be able to travel faster through your body, but I'm worried I might drown in there. Is there some way to...\"<br>\r\n-\"You don't have anything to worry about. You're very small. There is more then enough oxygen in my blood for you to survive. And it is pretty thick too, so you don't have to even think about my blood getting in your lungs or something similar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there, surprised. You didn't even think the possibility of getting some of Mewtwo's blood into your body, but you're relieved that you'll be able to use the circulatory system safely. -\"Eh...thanks\"- you manage to say before taking some steps back. You plan to run and jump through the wall of the small intestine and into the artery. You suppose it is big enough for you to not to miss and fall to who knows where. Although you knew there will be enough oxygen, you take a deep breath and start running. You jump, close your eyes and get ready to crash agaisnt the wall. Instead you feel your body going through the wall easily, and then you feel you're moving, although you're perfectly still. You open your eyes slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale, and then you find you're unable to breath, but you don't feel like you're drowning. You suppose you're getting the oxygen through the skin or something, and then you look around. Everything is red, and there was very small spots around you, which you suppose are the cells in Mewtwo's blood. You try to move and find that you can swim, but it is hard to do, the blood is very viscous. It takes you a while to get near the wall of the artery. It is semi-transparent, so you can see what is directly outside. The blood isn't going very fast, so you will also be able to exit the artery whenever you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the wall of the artery just in time to see the stomach, and then you feel everything going up. Most of times the only thing you see is flesh and muscles, but sometimes there are rooms and chambers, unknown to you. Then you hear Mewtwo using telepathy to contact you, even if you can't talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are many places you'll be able to enter through this artery. The closest ones to you right now are your food area (a place just a bit higher than the stomach where you could find food and eat), and my lungs (which is self-explanatory). You can also continue further, where you will be able to access different places and organs. I'll be able to feel you going through my artery, so I'll know your decision\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't hungry right now, but knowing where you would find food may be a good idea, since you wouldn't find it in any other part of Mewtwo's body, unless you like semi-digested mush from Mewtwo's stomach. On the other side, the lungs could be interesting, and you may find something to do in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What lies ahead of the chamber is a complete mystery to you but being in the warmth of another living things interior is something you always fantasize about. The hole is fleshy and soft to the touch which makes it slightly difficult to navigate your way through the hole. After an undetermined time, you realized that the tunnel's pathway began to ascend upward in Mewtwo's body; this facts confirms that the hole definitely leads not to the Psychic Pokemon's intestines but....somewhere else. Where could it lead to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farther you go in the passage, the more uptight it seems to get until it got to the point that it is completely vertical. You could no longer walk up the tunnel, but to your amazement, there are some sort of hidden recesses in the fleshy walls that allows you to climb up much like you would do with a ladder. You started to make your way up to the tunnel to your yet unknown destination. Occasionally, the sliminess of the tunnel caused you to slip a few steps down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling what seems like hours, you finally reached the mystery chamber in Mewtwo, but it's obviously at a far higher place within his body. The chamber looks similar to the stomach except it is dome-shaped and something large is surrounded by a purplish aura in the center. You take a closer look at the object, it seems to be somewhat brain-like and you assume that the aura is Mewtwo Psychic force-field to protect it against unwanted 'physical' and 'mental' intrusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also realize that the room is brightly-lit unlike the stomach. On the other end of the chamber, there are two large, oval screens that are showing the forest you just got shrunk in. You also saw hands coming into view on the \"screen\", but those hands are Mewtwo's and he seem to be walking somewhere deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you have taken the tunnel that leads into my head, human.\", said Mewtwo, \"You will find this place rather amazing because you can see stuffs through my eyes and most interesting, I can allow you to enter my brain for some \"psychic\" surprises. Currently, I've placed a protective layer around it and I can remove it at your request for you to take a look inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Pokemon slowly focus his attention on the 'creature' he had discovered with his stern-looking eyes, lowering his head toward you. The Absol's sharp, red eyes focus on you with a piercing precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".Hmm...strange sight these days. The first time I saw a creature looking sort of like a human but yet so tiny. Interesting.\", Absol commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Absol! I <u>am</u> a human and you're probably here to cause......wait, you could talk....goodness, first I got shrunk and now, talking Pokemons!! What the hell is happening now?!\", you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol looked equally surprised, seemingly not expecting the bug-like thing before him to talk and identify itself as a human. From the look of his face, you can see that the Absol is in disbelief, perhaps shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....that's new.\", the Absol stuttered, \"I never knew...that people could be this small in this forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, Absol, I was shrunk by unknown forces.\", you said, \"I have absolutely no idea what happened or how to get back to normal..........Hey, since you're a Pokemon from around here, do you know what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....No....I haven't. This is the first time that I see this happens.\", the Absol said frankly, \"It may be some strange combination of psychic and bizarre forces that caused you to shrink so dramatically. Well, I think that there is a way for us to find a way to solve your current problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....You're.... helping me?\", you asked, \"I thought that encountering an Absol will bring bad luck upon you and more so when I'm in such small shape. At least that's what I heard the other trainers said in the cities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol slightly frowned and explained: \"I'm no such thing.....It's one of those awful superstitions that you humans love to talk about. Those gossips about me are not true at all. It just that whenever I showed up at a place, there's always something bad going on.....Don't you think spreading rumors about someone else is kind of....strange and hurtful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way the Absol talked, you realized that you've hurt its feeling. Although the Pokemon's expression still look intimidating, you could tell from his eyes that you've said something very wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly apologize: \"I'm sorry, Absol.... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. It just that things happened so abruptly and my thoughts and composure just got a little rash from the shock. You know, being in a completely new environment makes you all panicky and ,in extreme cases, can make you lose your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. I understand your problem.\", the Absol replied, \"But for you to remain out here in this forest is quite dangerous. The terrains here aren't very welcoming and easy for creatures your size. Besides, you would make a good prey for the wild Pokemons around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\", you tell Absol, \"But how are you going to help me and why should I trust you, because you're technically also a wild Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot bear to see a human in such trouble. I always feel like helping a human to shake off that stereotype about me being a harbinger of disasters.\", the Absol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. If I were to believe you, how do you plan on helping me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal, since it is too risky for you to be out here, I'll let you enter my body and make it your temporary home. You don't have to worry the food and water, those will be provided to you. And you don't have to worry about digestion in the stomach, my body cannot process humans.\", the Absol tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still a bit skeptical about Absol's claim. But the way the Pokemon talked to you and the signs of genuine intention on his face partially erased your doubt. It also occurred to you that if Absol was bent on eating you, he would have already done so without hesitation. So you gathered your courage and replied.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".mmmm........That sounds good enough.\", you said, remembering about a fantasy you've held a long time ago about being eaten by Pokemons and living inside them; that dream is about to become your new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's ready right now and you're good to go at any time.\", the Absol said enthusiastically, \"Come on... go in, there's no need to be afraid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As if in a trance, you slowly walked toward Absol, closer to its dark face. After arriving at the front of its face, the Absol gave you a affectionate glance with its beautiful red eyes before opening its wide mouth. From your vantage point., you can see the rows of sharp teeth still dripping with drool. You slowly crawl you way onto Absol's tongue, being careful not to touch any of the razor-sharp fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels good to have you on my tongue and you sorta taste good. I might as well have you for food\", the Absol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face instantly paled from the Pokemon's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha.ha..ha... Got you! How would I ever want to hurt a newly-made friend and even more so, in this lonely forest.\", the Absol laughed, \"I feel that you needed a little joke to defuse some of the nervousness I sense in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a faint smile at Absol's little prank as you make your way toward the gullet. You looked down into the fleshy, pulsating cavern, imagining what kind of secrets you may encounter down there. Will there be endless passages? Will Absol give you a \"tour\" of his body? What kind of living space awaits you? These are the questions that are flying around in your head at the moment. Finally, you jumped into the gullet and let Absol's body move you toward your new destination: the stomach. The esophagus moves you downward in a slow and rhythmic fashion as if your lying down on an escalator within an organic tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 5 minute's time, you landed in Absol's stomach. The stomach appeared larger in here than on the outside, especially when considering the fact that you're now insect-sized. You sit yourself against the stomach wall to relax for a while. As Absol has promised you, no acids have emerged...just the sounds of his body working around you. Absol's heartbeat have a strangely comforting effect on you, eliminating the anxiety that has occupied you during the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour in the empty stomach, you gradually got bored and you want to explore the secrets that the Absol has told you about hidden within his <u>vast</u> body. Apparently, the Absol seemed content and happy to have you as a 'guest'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should ask Absol before I proceed anywhere else in his body.\", you thought, \"It's always better to ask the \"<b>host</b>\" to familiarize yourself with a new environment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

One of those ability is my capability of sustaining a living thing within me, like I'm doing for you. Once you entered my body, there is no way out of my body unless you wanted to end up at my \"backdoor\" with all the disgusting gunks.

Somewhat confusing to you, the tunnel itself look like it is luminated by itself; apparently, Absol flesh are capable of glowing. Though strange, come to think of it, Absol had told you about how he is a special type of \"rare\" Pokemon. So, seeing stuffs out of the ordinary will probably be common during your stay in his body. The way to the 'living area' is long and winding, resembling stone caves you've been to in Sinnoh. But the most obvoius difference now is that instead of catching Pokemons and training them on your journey, you have ended being within one and rendered powerless by your mysterious shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is totally filled with thoughts and unexplained feelings about what Absol could do for you and how will your relation with him progress in the future. Your thinking is suddenly interrupted by the fact you bumped into a doorway of some sort. The doorway is clearly made of both bones and flesh. You move yourself through the membrane-like doorway and into the living area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight before you is as equally amazing as the \"Hub.\" The room before you is as large as Absol's stomach. There seems to be a circular bed of some sorts made of soft, white fur in the center of the room. To your surprise, there is a cute-looking Absol Pokedoll on the bed. It's probably a gift from Absol. The chamber also seem to have other \"amenities.\" The room seems to be seperated into sections, each with its own unique use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to check out some of the other features in this \"room\" or do you want to return to the \"Hub?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The area also included a interface on the wall behind your bed that was set in a environment that looked like a forest setting.  \"That, is one of many screens in my body that lets you see what I'm seeing.\"  Apsol said.  You looked at the screen and really there wasn't anything interesting just yet.  You kept exploring the \"Human trainer living area\"  and noticed the computer.  It was very strange to find a working computer, let alone one made out of a bony fleshy membrane.  \"That allows you to browse the real-world website as well as my  \"Personal website\"  My website not only teaches you about my body but can also give you a map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...what do you do.....?</span></div></div>",

It turns on and you take a look to the desktop. It is almost empty, the only software seems to be an internet browser. You click on it, and remember about what Absol said about a personal website. You're about to ask how to get in it when the home page finally loads<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you needed, the home page seemed to be Absol's Personal Website. It had a background that looked like flesh, and everything looked like it had been carved in the flesh. It was almost like seeing it directly on the walls of your bedroom. You look around for a keyboard, a mouse or something simiolar and, being unable to find one, you just touch the screen again with a finger, while moving it down. The page scrolls, and you find a guestbook. You was the first visitor of the website, according to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to the top of the page, and notice some options at the left side of the page, leading to other parts of the website. There are nine options, and only a few interested you for now. You clicked on the \"Organ List\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long list appears. You scroll down to see how many organs was in your new home. At the bottom some sort of disclaimer answered your question. \"All the 340 organs are fully functional and can be visited at any time\" You just stood there, not being able to understand how so many organs could fit in Absol's body. The list seems to be ordered alphabetically, and every organ had its own page, so you scroll up until you find \"Human-trainer Living Area\". You clicked on the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Human-Trainer Living Area is an organ where a guest will find features resembling a bedroom, a study and a bathroom. It was made for a human guest specifically, but any kind of guest can live in there\" - you read. After it there was a silhouette of Absol, with the outline of the organ, the nearest organs and where it was localized. It seemed to be in the chest, just behind the esophagus. It was almost at the center of it, so it was protected by layers of flesh and other organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more information about it, but you're too excited to read more about it, wanting to explore more of the website. You try to get back to the list and accidentally you get back to the main page. Just before you click again in \"Organ List\" you notice a button directly below it that said \"Maps\". Knowing how useful a map would be when you decide to explore around, you click there. A 3-D Absol silhouette appears, this time it was bigger and was divided in many areas. There was also a link to a map of <i>everything</i> in Absol's body. You clicked in the belly area, and the silhouette of the section you pressed appeared. The belly was divided in even smaller sections, too. You quickly press in a random section, and a map appears. You count 15 organs in this section. You have no clue of what will you find in most of the organs you're seeing now, just recognizing something that you suppose is a kidney, part of the small intestine and lots of veins and arteries. Then you realize an option: \"Turn names on\". You click on it and now you can see the names of every organ. You was right about the kidney and the intestine, and you read the other names, which included a part of the Hub and two or three of the names you had read in the Hub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back and this time you press in the link to that was below the 3-D silhouette. A big map appeared, and the only thing you could see was lots of rounded things, everything was so crowded you couldn't see most of the organs. Looking around, you find that there are rooms even in the feet, the blades and in Absol's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the big map, you decide to focus on one section of Absol's body, so you can start exploring. You mentally divide Absol in two parts, each one including recognizable parts of Absol's body. After a while, you decide to take a map of...</span></div></div>",

Overwhelmed by the sheer number of places in Absol and wanting to kick-start your little journey sooner, you tried to choose some of the most prominent choices you can see on the 'flesh computer; but to no avail, there is far too many good places to start at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you're about to open your mouth to ask Absol, a message suddenly appears on the \"display.\" It is displayed on some sort of chat system on the screen with the User ID <b>Absol</b>.

You place your finger on your actual location near the neck and then follow the shortest road to the paw. You calculate it would take you from twenty to forty-five minutes to get to the paw, and although it gets to explore new places, you was already starting to feel a bit tired and didn't feel like walking all the way to the paw. Luckily, the Absol Transit seemed like a faster way to get to the paw, and you would still have energy to do whatever you wanted to do in the paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around the Human Trainer Living Area, trying to find the station. You find a tunnel near the study, and you go through it. You quickly get to a place with low roof, that reminded you of a subway. You walk forward and then you feel the floor under you to contract when you step on it. Almost instantly, some sort of fleshy train appears. You notice what seemed like a door, so you approach to the train. You walk through it and enter the train. It is small and there are a few seats made of some sort of spongy tissue. There is also a few thin membranes covering some big holes in the walls of the train, almost like windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the back of the train, and find a screen. You're still impressed to find something resembling to technology inside a living being. There is only one line, waiting for you to write something. You touch the screen and a keyboard appears, along with a message welcoming you to the Absol Transit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, passenger! Using Absol Transit is easy and fast. Just type the name of the location, and let the body to carry you to your destination. If you have no idea of where to go, let the Absol Transit to pick a random destination by writing -random-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou type \"Paw-pad\" on the screen, and another message appears \"Thanks for using Absol Transit. It will take ten minutes to reach the destination. Sit down and enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train starts to move, and you sit near of one of the windows. You see the train leaving the station and after a while it goes through a wall. Outside, it looks like the train's rails or whatever it is using to move are outside the organs, and you see many huge rounded objects, which you suppose are other organs you'll soon visit. The train goes to the right and you see a bone, and after looking to the map again you see is one of the ribs. You get past it and see lots of flesh and nothing interesting outside, besides other organs. You look back to the map and try to deduce the route of the train. Besides the rib, you don't see anything else that could indicate you your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and relax, occasionally looking outside of the window. Soon you see the train os moving on a long bone, and you watch outside for a while, yet the bone seems to be pretty long. You think it is the bone of the leg, and get ready to get down soon. The train soon stops and you stand up, going outside of the train. It stays there, so you walk outside the station and find yourself on a relatively soft place. You're not inside the Paw-pad yet, but you're close. You walk and you find the entrance. There is also one more road, which seems to go up on the leg. Ignoring it, you enter to the Paw-pad</span></div></div>",

The entrance opens before you into a huge, irregularly-shaped room. In this room, the ceiling is slightly lower than in the hub; about 25ft based on your estimate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is completely surrounded by muscles and parts of the flooring is dark blue. When you stepped onto it, it extremely soft and it feels leathery. Above you, you saw four, jointed bones spread out from where you're standing, ending in four separate 'wings' in the chamber. Each 'wing' has a smaller dark-blue surface like the one you're standing on. You conclude that you've finally made it to your first destination after much confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly feeling your presence his paw, the Absol talks to you again: \"It looks like you reached my paw-pad. Here you can get to play on my extremely spongy pads and do whatever you want in this room. Despite the fact I'm currently walking about, you will not get disorientated because you are constantly keep in a straight-up position by my body's psychic power. Additionally, the four 'wings' you're seeing in there are my 'fore-toes\" each of which contains a long claw. Another thing is the 'sweat gland' which I mentioned previously. That's all, just relax and enjoy your time in there as I continue my walk to my home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Absol finishes his statement, you decided to explore the \"claws\" first. You walk toward one of the 'wings' in the chamber. The claws are currently retracted and secured in their place. The blue claws are huge and they look sharp enough to slice through anything. You stare in awe at the gleaming claws, turning your head to look at all four in amazement. Then out of the corner of your eye, you notice that there some sort of bumps on the floor. You take a closer to look and find out that there are two bumps that resembles buttons, one dark green and the other red. There are labels on them: Retract (Green) and Arm (Red). The green one is currently depressed, leaving you to wonder what is the function of the red \"Arm\" bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your decision to step one the red one. As you did so, muscles around you sprang to life and you saw the claws fully extend out of Absol paw through openings in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, Absol notice the claws on his left paw are extending and retracting without him doing so. Then he knows that the human in the Paw-pad must be playing around with the buttons in his paws. Absol sees it as a good sign that the human is really into him. He gave a wide smile as he continued walking deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within the \"Paw-pad\" chamber, after much playing with Absol's claw control-buttons, you want to try something else. Remembered that Absol said something about the 'sweat gland' inside this chamber. You decided to look for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted a screen on the wall near you. You went over and take a look at it. The screen is displaying a rough layout of the chamber you're in. You touched the screen. The display instantly refreshes and it asks you whether or not you want to activate Absol's sweat gland in the left paw. The 'screen' further explains that the sweat are harmless and will further enhance your experience in the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the 'sweat gland' option is activated, this chamber will start precipitating sweat from the ceiling. Do you want to try it?\", the screen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is obvious that you aren't in the forest anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky above you is covered on what looks like purple clouds. And, looking around you, you seem to be standing on some sort of stone platform. There seems to be no living being besides you, and there are several odd stuff scattered around. From your position, you can't look beyond a few meters, then you notice you're standing. You look around, and focus on the objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what you're seeing. You see fruits, what looks like a huge piece of meat, and various trinkets around, all of them much bigger than you. For you, this either means that, or those things are naturally huge, or you have shrunk. You lean towards the first one, at least until you hear a growl or something similar, behind you. You turn around, and much to your grief, you notice that it was the second option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a dark blue dragon, with several protruding gray spines over its body. There is also some kind of metallic element on its chest, and in the center, a blue gem. The creature is inspecting and eating the food stuff that fell over there. You have the feeling you have seen it before, and you finally remember. You had seen a drawing in a book, a long time ago. If you're not mistaken, you're near the Temporal Pok\u00e9mon, Dialga!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're also shrunk. This doesn't seem like a good combination. Dialga is naturally an huge Pok\u00e9mon, but now \"humongous\" would be a better word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start looking around for a place to be safe. You're not sure if you want to be seen, but before you can move, Dialga turns its head towards you. \"...This is new.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost faint again. \"Eh...eh...hey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seems to be frustrated. \"This is unacceptable. Humans aren't supposed to enter my realm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it on purpose! I fainted and then I woke up here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga growls again \"I know that! It isn't your fault. Palkia is supposed to bring stuff to me with space powers. That dork must have done a mistake. I'll send you back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa...wait a moment! You can't send me in this state! I'm shrunk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't all humans this small? Um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least give me my normal size first, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that\" Dialga says \" If Palkia was the one to do this to you, then Palkia is the only one who can revert it. Space bending powers and what not. Meanwhile...\" Dialga seems to be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you contact Palkia?\" you ask, hoping the answer is positive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Who knows what dimension Palkia is visiting right now. I have no way to know. You'll have to be here for who knows how long. If you stay around, you may be in danger of me crushing you by accident\" At this point you look at Dialga's huge cylindrical feet. There is no doubt that if it stepped on you, it would be hard to scrape your remains off the floor. You want to avoid death as much as possible-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only see one solution. I'll have to eat you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't go into your survival plans. \"No! Please don't! I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about dying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you even know what happens to what one eats?\" you yell, furious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga looks at you closer, obviously annoyed by your words. \"I know perfectly well what is the digestive process. It won't happen to you. I'm offering you to stay inside my body. This way I'll be able to know where you are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...ah...\" Your fear is suddenly gone \"Does that mean...no death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No death. But just a word of warning: My body isn't an amusement park. You better not cause a mess\". At this point, Dialga lowers its head to the ground. Its fang-like horns make it hard for Dialga to rest it on the floor, but it somehow manages to do it. It opens its huge mouth, signaling you to enter. You're not sure you feel comfortable to go through the same place you had seen go some food less than ten minutes ago, but what other option do you have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although he had reassured you that there won't be any problem, you still feel hesitant about entering Dialga. The Pokemon looked at you with an amused expression, seemingly taking pleasure in your indecision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps later, you managed to arrive at the edge of Dialga's mouth. From here, the Pokemon looks even more of a behemoth. Sandwiched between the two metallic fang structures, you could only marvel at the very existence of such a Pokemon. Although you didn't see it, you can feel Dialga's crimson eyes following your every move. Eventually, you picked up your courage and stepped onto the tongue. Strangely, it feels solid to your touch despite Dialga being able to move it with ease. You can't help but admired the tall cavernous structure of the mouth. Pearly white molars the size of houses flanked you on both sides as you ventured deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, you reached the throat of the Pokemon. When you looked down, you saw a long tunnel containing glowing rune-like symbols extending all the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to worry, human.\", Dialga spoke, \"Just jump down. You'll land safely in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to you being in close proximity of the throat, Dialga's voice was deafening and low. You felt your ears ringing from the loudness as your brain readjust itself after you were knocked off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he said, you leaped and began your plunge downward. The feeling of free-falling isn't a good one. It feels as if your entire body is being twisted inside our multiple times and spun randomly. A little over 10 seconds into the jump, you feel yourself slowly decelerate in defiance of gravity. You opened you eyes and find the tunnel opening into a larger space below. When you tried to move your hands up, they didn't immediately move to the front of your face. Instead, it looks as if someone had played a video in slow motion. You don't know why this happens but you are thankful that you aren't falling at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute or so and you find yourself safely landing on the floor of the stomach with a metallic clink. You could once again move your hands at normal speed. The stomach of Dialga is gargantuan. Judging by length alone, there's little doubt that a Pokemon stadium could comfortably fit in this place with many more spaces to spare. The stomach walls are covered in rune symbols and circular drawings that glows neon blue. The sight made you momentarily forget about your immediate problems; all you want to do is admire the sheer beauty of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you have safely arrived at my stomach, human.\", Dialga's voice echoed from above, \"I believe you're wondering about the phenomenon you encountered on your way down and an explanation is necessary. My special ability is time manipulation; I can move forward and backward in time and speed it up or slow it down at my order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely surprised by the revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....wow, a Pokemon that could control time itself.\", you said in admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If everything is fine, then I would like to explain some simple rules.\", Dialga said, \"Since you are in my body, I would request that you treat it with utmost respect. Like I said before, my body is not an amusement park. You are not allowed to explore places without my permission. Do you understand this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, absolutely.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now please enter the glowing hole beside you. We have some things to work out first.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without a second thought, you grab onto the edges of the hole, and let yourself be suspended on it. Then you let go the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall for a second before you hit some kind of slide. The passage impulses you at a nice speed, until you see more light at the end. The slide stops gradually until you're able to stand up and enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in a completely empty room, but the walls are almost pitch black, while the floor is more of a metallic gray color, despite it being as squishy as always. The room is small and featureless, and you wonder why you were sent here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga starts talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the situation: you're going to be a guest inside me for some time. I don't know for how long. It could take a few days, or a few weeks, or a few months. That depends on how fast I localize Palkia. In this moment I'm starting to rearrange some of my organs to provide you some places so you feel like you were at home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have very limited space-like powers, those are the type of powers that allow one to manipulate matter or create stuff. I can only do it with my body, no more. Palkia has very limited time powers. It is the burden of being...almost related in blood\" Dialga stops, maybe thinking about what he just said. \"Leaving that aside, I'll give you safety and comfort, with the only rule that you abide to my simple requests: Don't go to places without my authorization\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where can I be?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your room, and some places I'm creating for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is way too limited. This seemed like a lifetime chance! Being inside a Pok\u00e9mon, and one that is very powerful! But you find out that you will be confined to only a handful of places. Picking your words carefully, you talk: \"Maybe...I could be an asset for you. As a way of saying \"thank you\" for your hospitality. But I wouldn't be able to help if I'm restricted to my home. Don't you think it is something that should be corrected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga doesn't reply to your words. Instead, a wide circle lights up in a side of the room. \"I have to gather some information about you, if I'm going to let wander around my body freely. Step inside that circle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey. As soon as you stand on the center of it, you feel some kind of energy coursing through you. It feels as if you touched something electric. You stand in the circle for a few minutes, until it turns off. Seeing nothing else around, you walk away from where the circle was. You suppose that it was Dialga's way to know more about you, much quicker than you telling what he wanted to know. You just hope he gave you some privacy and didn't look at your secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for Dialga's verdict. \"You seem like a responsible person. I have watched your past, I see how you behave. However, I see some flaws. I'll give you more liberty, but there will still be a few restricted places for you. Meanwhile, go to your room\" A door appears on one of the black walls. You enter, excited to see how your room is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you would still have needed to have your past checked, even if you didn't say that\" Dialga comments while you observe around what is your bedroom. It is like you were standing in a cubist painting. The walls are with a cobalt blue and gray, and it looks like somebody sticked a lot of those plates Dialga has on his body. Definitely the Pok\u00e9mon isn't the best at decorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least there are some stuff that are good. There is a bed, and it is soft. It is a relief. You also seem to have something that looks like a huge clock on the wall. There are a lot of blank spaces. Dialga explains that you have to fill the spaces with preferences of what you would like to do at some times. You only write sleeping times and food times, leaving the rest blank for later days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast is what looks like a railway in middle of your room. Attached to it is a capsule. Dialga explains that this will be your way out of the room, that it'll take you to whatever place you want, but that it only works from your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Dialga is what one could call \"logical\". Doing only the most necessary things. You wonder if, after some time inside him, a softer side will be revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're settled in your room and know its main elements, there is only one thing left before you're free to go. As I told you, there will be a few forbidden places for you\". On the wall a map of Dialga appears. It looks like it'll be always there, as a reminder of where you can't go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll highlight the places out of your reach. If I ever grant you permission, those highlights will be gone. If I ever find you inside one of these places, you'll receive a severe punishment. Understood?\" You nod. \"Now look carefully\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the information and world there is beyond your comprehension anyway. Second, the Temporal Region is a no go zone for you. Entering that area unguided could result in severe injuries, both physical and metaphysical. Third, when you travel around in my body, you will encounter various apparatuses or devices. Let me be clear, you are not to operate them without my expressed approval. If you are found attempting to violate any of the above, you will be confined to your room and subject to severe punishment at my discretion. Is that understood, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took time to study the map, carefully going over all the prohibited area. Once you have memorized the areas, you answered with a firm yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It seems that we are off to a good start.\", Dialga said, \"As long as you obey the rules, you'll find my body to be a welcoming place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked Dialga again for willing to provide you with accommodation. It was really nice of him to help you and all. In fact, you are surprised that he even adjust his own body for you. It challenged the idea that Legendary Pokemons aren't exactly known for their closeness to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If everything is fine with you,  I'll have to start looking for Palkia. I wonder where that doofus has gone to this time.\", Dialga muttered, \"Maybe I can start with your world first. In the mean time, you can use the capsule to visit other areas of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you headed for the capsule and entered it. The capsule has a black cylindrical shape with glowing lines running along its entire length. The thing seemingly sensed your presence and started up itself. A map of Dialga appeared on the interior wall. You checked the map, seeing several dozens of available places for you to go to excluding the brain and Temporal Region. A particular area is flashing green on the image. You pointed to the area and the words \"Asset Training Center\" appeared on top of it. Dialga explained that the Center will be your first stop before you move on to other places in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a destination is set, the capsule whirred up and started traveling through holes and glowing walls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This seems like it'll be something enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes pass before you arrive your destination. Looking at the map, the Asset Training Center is not far from your room, this says a lot of the sheer size of your host. You have the feeling that if you tried to walk from the head to the tip of the tail, a whole day wouldn't be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule opens, and you step out of it. You're now in what looks like a shiny white room. There is an huge platform at the center. You get closer to it, and finally step on top. Nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place for, Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga takes a while to reply. \"Eh? Oh, yes, I almost forgot. You said you wanted to help around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a way to say thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose helping me around can keep you entertained. I don't want you to get bored...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I have to do?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to propose something: would you like to work in the mornings, and spend the afternoons and nights doing what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. It doesn't sound bad, and could be a chance to know your host better, both in the ways of how his body works, and in a more personal way. Besides, it would be nice to have something to fill your time while you're inside him.  \"Yes, that sounds perfect Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I may not have something for you everyday, though, but if you really need something to do, then tell me. Is it fine if you start tomorrow?\" Dialga asks. You reply that it is okay. \"Then let's use this morning to give you a fast rundown of the very basic functions of my body. First things first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes appear in front of you. You pick them up. The clothes seem to be made of some kind of rough material. \"This is in case you don't want to ruin your actual clothes. Use this if you want to\". You try it on. It is almost perfect, maybe a bit long, but it won't bother you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where to start...uh. I know\" Something starts forcing you down the platform. Once you're out of it, something starts forming on it. You watch amazed how Dialga appears on top of the platform on its natural size. He is still huge, compared to you. Not even another you, standing on your shoulders, would be able to be higher than Dialga's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Dialga says, looking around. Then he sees you. \"Yes, it did work. Now human, come here\" You step on the platform again. \"Let's start with something simple, so you start knowing me better. You'll examine my outside carefully. My external body is a sure way for you to have a hint of what is under the skin. Every part will be important, so be sure not to skip anything. If you need help, tell me and I'll re-position myself for your convenience. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply that it is clear, but Dialga's intimidating size makes you hesitate. \"Come on, don't be shy. I'm not going to hurt you\" he says, and it is the first time you see Dialga in a more or less friendly tone. A bit reassured, you step forward to start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With permission from Dialga, you moved closer and examined his body in detail. This could possibly be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to understand more about such a mysterious Legendary. You noticed that his metallic exterior gives off a lustrous sheen and has light blue details that runs along his legs. Although he made his size into what you would see at your normal height, Dialga still looks imposing; standing at least 30 feet tall. Out of curiosity, you placed your hand onto his body. It's soft like flesh but it felt as if you're touching cold metal. The Pokemon seemed intrigued at how you're exploring his body. Having a human physically lay his hand on a Legendary Pokemon, and a temporal one at that, was unthinkable. Such transgression once warrants Dialga to cast the human to torturous dimensions to suffer for eternity; that is, if a human ever finds his inter-dimensional abode. But Dialga currently seem not to care much. Instead, he observes how the human looks at and touch every part of his body at his reach. <i>Humans are such interesting creatures, he thought. Sure worthy of conducting observation myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to walk around the Pokemon, examining every part of the body. The claws on his legs are made of metallic materials like his fangs. A light tap on them gave off a loud clink that reverberate through the chamber. Spikes similar to fins sprout out from the back. At first you believe that they are used as some form of weapon, but it seems to also has other functions as evidenced by pulsating glows that it gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are almost under his body when Dialga interrupted you by speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let me give you a quick rundown of my body here.\", the Pokemon asked, \"Since you're are new here, I probably wouldn't be going into too much details about my body or abilities. If you're going to help me in here, these are some of the basics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a Temporal Pokemon, I have to ability to control the flow of time, whether it's backward or forward, fast or slow. To accomplish that, I use the spikes and horns you on my head and body to distort time-space and manipulate it at my will. If you want to know about the details of how that's done, it's far beyond your understandings. All I can tell you is that it has much to do with cosmic, dimensions, and energy forces. And that's something for you humans to figure out.\", Dialga explained, \"Another part is my body itself. What it basically does is protecting me from the effects of inter-dimensional distortion.

Now that I have nothing more to say, run along and explore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dialga in the chamber disappeared into thin air. you made your way back to the capsule, replaying what the Pokemon had just said. Mysterious as he is, he has gotten you interested.</span></div></div>",

You notice you're near that strange jewel embedded on the plates on the chest, but you have a feeling that there won't be a way for you to take a peek in there. Not that you planned to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule starts stopping slowly, until you're able to step down. You look at your new surroundings. You're in another small chamber, and the capsule itself appeared in the middle of the room, as if it ascended from a space underneath your actual location. You see a handful of screens, almost covering the space between the ceiling and the ground, but there is only one panel with buttons. You approach it. You notify Dialga you arrived, as you feel that this place will be very important for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This chamber will be one of the tools you'll use during your work. Every screen has a different function. If you look in front of you, you'll see the controls\" Effectively, there are many buttons and a single stick, which looks like you'll be able to move. \"Press the big button to turn on the computers. You'll only be able to see the one that is in front of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the button, and instantly see how the screen acquires an image in the screen, a tridimensional image of Dialga. \"If it is too confusing for you, you can change it into a map\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons that are the closest to you allow to see specific portions of my body, whether it is based on systems, areas or the importance of the organs\". Change screens with the only dial around\" You move the dial, and the screen in front of you moves to a side, another one taking its place. It turns on, and you see a bunch of numbers, along with some words explaining what they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This screen shows data like temperature, strength and other similar tidbits. I'm not sure if you'll know the average amount that this should have, so you may not use this screen\" You move the dial again, and another screen takes the center. It is different stuff. You see the most basic functions of Dialga, summarized in bars. \"This screen shows if I need to sleep, eat or similar. I can do it by myself, but it is included if you want to know. The main screen you'll use if the first one\" You put it back. Dialga explains how you use the controls, and you follow each step. When it is all done, he decides to do a practice to end the day. It is starting to get late, at least in your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you retire to your room, let's pretend you just arrived here. Now examine my body for any anomalies. If there is a problem, you should see the organ or area with a color. Minor problems will be green, and the worse the problem, the redder the color will be. I doubt you'll see life-threatening issues while you're inside me, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start switching maps, looking for any color. It isn't a bad job. There are about ten maps, and you take a look at all of them before deciding that there aren't any problems. \"Everything is fine, Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because I already corrected those issues by myself, before you arrived\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I find a problem, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You notify me, first. Then you go to the area, and examine carefully to find the root of the problem. Then we'll apply the best course of action to fix the problem\" You nod, understanding this \"For practice purposes, I'll strain one of my muscles. After you're done fixing that, you may retire to your room to sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, you start coursing through the maps again. This time, there is an alert in one of them. In the one with Dialga's muscles, you see a small area in the back, filled with a green color. \"I found it\" you say, before going to your capsule. You highlight the area, and wait to be taken there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This concrete human seems to have the ability to understand instructions easily.

The map display indicates that the strain is located in the upper part of the Pokemon's right hind leg. The problem looks minor and is a perfect opportunity to prove your usefulness to Dialga. A good few minutes later, the capsule came to a gradual stop at your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the capsule, you found yourself looking at a massive structure constructed from indescribable materials. The thing has a dark grey hue that reminds you of carbon metal. It looks like an extremely thick pillar about 9 feet that goes from the floor to the ceiling where it is joined with an even thicker horizontal beam. You can see the pillar occasionally twisting and turning on it axis. Running along the gargantuan structures are glowing stripes the run in a helix shape along its entire length. Based on the sight, you conclude that the thing before you is a part of Dialga's bone structure. If so, where are the muscles? There are no strands or fleshed in sight. You are about to asked Dialga about it when the Pokemon starts speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you've arrived at the location of my strain, there are probably a lot of questions lingering on your mind.\", Dialga said, \"As you probably already noticed, my definition of muscle is a bit different than those of humans. If you can take a closer look at my bone, you will see that it consists of tiny metallic strands bounded together by my body's natural energy force: the glowing lines. The strands are made from the same thing as my fangs and body spikes; they are far more stronger than steel but also flexible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you take a close up look at the bone, indeed, thin spaghetti-like strands made up its structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I lift my leg, My brain automatically reduce or increase the strength of the energy lines accordingly and allow the strands to bend or twist into the desired shape. It's similar to how a bundle of what you humans call drinking straws would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\", you said, \"But how could you even strain such body structure if you made it so flexible and sturdy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are times that I will over apply the force needed to move and accidentally burn out or break the energy lines. When that happens, it would weaken my 'muscles' significantly in the affected parts. If severe enough, I will be immobilized and forced to rest for several days before I could move my body again. Basically, your job here is to look out for those problems and repair them. If you intervened, my muscles will heal far faster than on its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do that? Sounds like it takes more than just first aid to fix.\", you asked Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing hard.\", the Pokemon chuckled, \"The injured part of the line will be dimmer than the rest. You just have to give the strained part a nice massage and stretching to get it back to working order...Well, <br>\r\nenough chat for now, better start working on those strains. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Dialga fall silent again. You started circling the bone to find where you need to work on. Soon enough, you came across a region where the energy lines are dim and struggling. You gave the lines a thorough rub. Every time you touched the lines you felt some arcane energy channel itself through your body. It similar to an electric shock but without the pains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you managed to fix all of the lines on the bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work!\", Dialga exclaimed, \"Not bad on a first try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing.\", you said, \"Just doing my best to be of help to you, Dialga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as I promised you, you are now free to return to your room for some well-deserved sleep. I wish you good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished the same for Dialga and entered the capsule to return to your room. A short trip later, you entered your bedroom and plopped down on the bed, drifting to sleep almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This human is far more capable than I expected. He's respectable and quick but some flaws still linger. I should definitely observe him more closely now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Watching humans sleep wasn't his way to spend the night. Dialga had retrieved practically a copy of everything in the human's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure that the Pok\u00e9mon would know if the human woke up, Dialga started examining the information. He noticed that indeed, humans aren't as small as his guest is. He also noticed that the human was one of those trainers he had heard about. Dialga frowned, but calmed down when he saw that the Pok\u00e9mon in his team were all healthy and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life of the human was boring and generall generic, but to Dialga it was like a new whole world. <i>Humans seems to be in a close partnership with Pok\u00e9mon.</i> Dialga noted <i>Could we be in the same partnership?</i> Dialga doubted that the human would be more than a guest, but eh...he wasn't opposing the idea of actually turning into friends. Not that it would be instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dialga started looking for flaws, or something that indicated the human could be a bad person. Everything seemed to be rather inoffensive. Nothing seemed to hint the human could harbor bad intentions towards Dialga. But he also noticed that the human showed recklessness at some situation. Impulsive actions led to trouble. <i>Maybe I'll have to keep an eye on him, just in case</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga doubted if he should check anything about the human's deepest secrets. He finally decided not to do it...at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Dialga checked was if the human had any knowledge that could be useful during his stay inside the body. Looks like the guest has a respectable amount of knowledge about Pok\u00e9mon biology and anatomy, so at least the basics were covered. The only thing left was to see how the human would help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the rest of the data for later, Dialga once again looked at the sleeping human. It should be worth it to watch over this human. Could be a potential aid in the future...but what would the other Legendaries think? He doubted that other Legendaries ever had humans inside them. Dialga sent a message to Palkia, asking his whereabouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...wouldn't it be worth it to, well...keep the human inside him for a while? Just to study it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Dialga went to sleep. The morning surely would bring the human something to do.</span></div></div>",

Being a trainer meant that you are well-adjusted to rising up early for more practices. You slowly got out of the bed. When you reached for the nightstand to retrieve your Pokeballs, you felt thin air. You frantically looked around the room: a bed, a time clock scheduler, and a simple desk. All of them set in a room with metallic walls...Gradually, you remembered what happened yesterday and the fact that you currently live in Dialga. You called out for Dialga but there wasn't a reply. You tried several times to get the Pokemon's attention but you efforts were fruitless. He's probably still sleeping at this time. Guess Pokemons don't have a rigid living schedule like humans do, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the next few minutes to perform a few simple stretches to get your body into active mode and explored your room a little more thoroughly. There are a little more items in the room than yesterday. First, there is a newly formed couch  and coffee table opposite your bed. Supposedly fitting with the 'theme' you've seen so far, the new furnitures look like something out of a cubist or abstract painting; all boxy and futuristic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd part of the previously featureless, cold steel walls opposite the couch now contains a glass screen blinking with random symbols. Moving in front of the screen caused it to refresh. An interface now appears detailing functions like 'live views', games, word editors, personal finance, problem reports and several more. With some fidgeting around, you learned that the screen tracks your movement and that you can used your hand to control the options. Some of the features made you curious. What does personal finance have to do with Dialga? Is there some form of banking system in here? Just when you are about to explore that option, you felt your stomach growl loudly. You realized that you haven't eaten since yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou boarded the capsule and looked at the map, searching for any place that may provide food. Out of all the choice, only the \"Replenishment Galley\" looks remotely related to food. You pressed the location on the map and allowed the capsule to take you to whatever is ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're now in a room that is full of strange pipes, odd machine-like things strewn all over the walls, and a few chutes on the ceiling. Everything seems to be made of chrome and other similar materials, remarking even further the fact that your host is a Steel-type. It is almost as if you stumbled upon some kind of engine room inside Dialga. What is this chamber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou request Dialga for more information about this room, but you don't receive a reply. Maybe he is still asleep. How long did he stay awake last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around, trying to figure out what these things are. During your investigation of your surroundings, you encounter some kind of safe, with a handle on the door. You open the safe, and are instantly received by cool air. You see many food items, which you almost recognize as some of the stuff that were strewn around that platform yesterday, when you arrived to whatever dimension Dialga lives in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a fruit you recognize. It is so big that you have to use both hands to take it from the fridge. You place it on one of the metallic flat surfaces. Focusing on one of the odd contraptions on the wall, you twist a small button. A small fire appears, as if it were a stove. Somewhere in the room you find a pan. You use your hands to rip off a piece of the fruit,and place it on the pan, which you place on the stove. Soon it starts sizzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, and a few other experiments with some of the stuff in the room, you sit on the floor to eat your piece of fruit. The result...wasn't good. \"Bleh\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your meal, and soon the rest of the fruit goes back into the fridge. \"Are you done?\" you hear. It must be Dialga. \"This Replenishment Galley...is just a kitchen, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. I have to remember to teach you how to make your own food in here, but it seems that you managed to do something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been better\" you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're done with breakfast, then you can start your duties\" You nod, entering the capsule. You'll have to admit that you're very excited. Does this mean that there is work for you? What could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the capsule reaches the central room, and you turn on the screens<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Today is your first day on the job and you do not want to disappoint Dialga with any mishaps. Any mistakes on your part could damage your relation with the Pokemon and at worst, jeopardize your chance of returning to normal. I gotta keep it together, you thought, Dialga is the key to finding Palkia. Once we find him, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind about shrinking random humans. After making yourself comfortable in a steel seat that Dialga had created, you turned the dials on the control to check on the status of all body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour into your work, you found nothing problematic. All the bloodstreams are at acceptable flow rate, the body heat is normal, and the protective magnetic field surrounding the Pokemon while dimension traveling works just fine.  <br>\r\nOne thing perplexed you while inspecting the screens: why is Dialga so trusting of you? From the time you first met him, the Pokemon seemed very believing about your statements. Is there anything that he knows that you don't? Considering the fact that Dialga controls time, there is little doubt that he could see the future of anyone. If he could that, does this mean Dialga knew about what lies ahead for you? Judging by how he treated you so far, he probably saw something important regarding you otherwise, Dialga wouldn't have given you such freedom in his body let alone allowed you to enter it. You kept the intriguing thoughts to yourself and continued your duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, there isn't much to look around about. The same stats, the same normalcy.  Eventually you got bored of the silence, so you decided to start a conversation with Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dialga. Your body is working as smooth as a machine right now. There isn't much that I could do now. Do you mind if I ask you something?\", you asked the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, human\", Dialga answered calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering about how you and Palkia get along since you two seemed to be from the same dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I'm not quite sure how to answer that question, human.\", Dialga replied, \"Our relations are, in the simplest term,  complicated. A lot of events has happened, both good and bad, that brought us together or caused us to fight. There are incidents that brought harmony and those that sowed disunity. The last time we fought each other, we caused several dimensions to collapse. It's a gaping  quandary that you should stay away from.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sounds awful if you ask me.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is merely the surface of our problems.\", Dialga sighed, \"If you ever attempt to find out  more, you will find yourself in a cosmic conflict that has been going on since the beginning of time. But for now, we maintained a state of peace with each other. It is uneasy but much-needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took some time to allow the information to sink in. So Dialga and Palkia aren't really at terms with each other but still maintained some level of understandings, you thought. Hope that won't affect our search for him. You returned to the monitoring the screens and wondered which dimension Palkia would be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The human seemed interested about my history with Palkia. It seems that it's their characteristics to find out about the past. Looks like this human is more than he appears to be, even if unknowingly</i></span></div></div>",

You imagined everything from the mundane like the stomach to places that goes beyond metaphysical experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule reached it's stop with a screech. You stepped out into a large metallic chamber with tall ceilings. As your feet touch the ground, a glowing blue line starts following wherever you walked. They seem to be coming through the solid floor and will constantly reform itself if you walked in circles for too long. You guess that is one way for Dialga to track your movement, both to keep you safe and to prevent you from entering restricted areas. Taking a closer look at the new room, there is what looks like a running track that goes around the entire perimeter  of the room complete with obstacles and barriers. In the center, there are steel bars that are shaped to resemble various exercise equipments like dumbbells, stretchers and bike simulators. On the side of each of the equipment, there is a little display that record the activities you perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you have arrived at your first stop, human.\", Dialga's voice echoed in the room, \"This place is the Exercise Room. I know that humans constantly engage in activities to keep their body in good health, so I figured that I could provide you with something you could do in your free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I could really use these things here since I'm not really moving much in here.\", you told Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Besides maintaing your body, your movement with this chamber can be used to generate energy for my body; by stepping on the floor or using the exercise equipments, you are actually creating an electro-magnetic force that could be absorbed into the walls and floor to be used by my body. So simply put, both of us will benefit from your exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice. Glad I could be useful while I stay in you.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. You're already helping a lot by monitoring my body activities. So, if we're all done here, we can head to our next location by taking the hallway on your left. There's something that I always wanted to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head at Dialga's cryptic comment but took the passage anyway to your next stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tissues around you are also getting more rigid, and you notice they're covered by some kind of substance. In the distance, a hole can be seen. You speed up, wanting to see what is beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the biggest room you have seen yet, once again leaving the stomach aside, but the one you're in now looks much more interesting, as it is something you thought you would never see inside a Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in a room that anybody would have thought to be a foundry. There are several chains, suspended platforms, and huge drums that, while you can't see inside them, you suppose they're full of molten metal. The heat around you increases as you walk on the platforms, but for some odd reason, everything looks like it hasn't been used for a long time, maybe never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my metalworks. Here I would use my metal resources to repair any damage my steel-like body parts may receive. But since I'm not somebody who battles often, this hasn't been used yet. Now this is yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you now have a foundry. Nice! \"How do I operate this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see many controls on the rails. Each one of them should have instructions. You can use this room to create stuff for yourself. You'll have to create your own molds, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and once again look at the huge containers. You would hate to fall inside one of those. A random thought crosses your mind in that moment, you remember you wanted to ask Dialga a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, I had seen something about financial management or something like that, on that screen taht is now in my room. What is that for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the next planned stop, human. Now continue, there should be an entrance at the other side of the Metalworks. Enter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross the platforms until you reach the wall, and locate the entrance. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quickly filed through the passageway toward what could be the weirdest location yet in Dialga. The revelation of a body part capable of being used for finance and banking came as a surprise to you. You wonder what kind of function will it do as there is no apparent purpose to have such location in a body. Ever since you entered Dialga, all the body parts you've encountered so far are made for your convenience; much of them seemed to be Dialga's attempt at making things as normal as possible for your stay. The banking system is likely an extension of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the hallway opens up into another room. From the looking of things, this location is as large as the stomach. Like previous places you've visited, the chamber is fashioned out of featureless and sterile steel; functional but minimalist. There are circles of kiosks throughout the floor each with a distinctive color. Multiple glass screens hang down from the ceiling, displaying information in runes. Entering one of the kiosks, you found a set of slots and buttons. You let Dialga know that you arrived and asked him for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place allows me to conduct all forms of transactions across the dimensions. That means, I can adapt to the financial systems of the known worlds.\", Dialga explained, \"If you're wondering, Pokemons also have a financial system much like you humans do. We trade everything from basic foodstuffs to precious energy stones and all categories in between. Every type of Pokemon has their unique way of doing business. In your case, I have created a unique monetary system that could be used in my body. You can obtain those money by exchanging your world's currency or performing various tasks throughout my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what exactly are these kiosks for?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each one of them correspond to a specific dimension used by Pokemons. By using each station, you can purchase or sell things to those on the other end. Personally, I think that the Steel-types have the best things while Psychics are gonna rip you off with their pricing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astonished to learn that Pokemons have such complex systems in place, unbeknownst to humans. In some ways, they overlap with your world's society. That leaves you to speculate what else could Pokemons be capable of. Do they include the ability to hide a human in their bodies? Or are there abilities far above human grasp?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this place doubles as a bank and as a trading center.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\", Dialga answered, \"If there are no further questions, let's move on to the next stop: The Communication Venue.</span></div></div>",

Obviously they were adjacent organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was more of a wide tube, instead of a chamber. It wasn't excessively long, but there was still quite a walk. It extended towards the distance, nothing being near you. You could see several things you recognized. If the place weren't made by flesh, you would have thought you were in some kind of museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach one of the closest machines. You're underwhelmed to see that it was...a typewriter. You can't say you have ever used one, they stopped being made a lot of time ago. There is a piece of paper. You started typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is a text that is supposed to work as a test but I have no idea if the test will work or if my text will show</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear the paper off. \"Now what, Dialga? I just arrived here, and found several things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Communication Venue. This is basically your center for any communication you may want to have with the outside world. As you can see, there are many possibilities. There is that typewriter for letters, a computer for Internet, a phone for calling, and...well, many other things that vary from dimension to dimension, but I don't think you'll use them often. You don't know anybody that isn't in your home dimension\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to make sense. \"So you mean that I can communicate with anyone back at home?\" you ask. Dialga replies affirmatively, and adds that it all works thanks to the several steel-like shapes his body has. The scientific explanation is long and you aren't sure you understood everything, but it seems to be related to waves and signals being picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one last question you had: \"How did you get these stuff inside you? Did you create them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seems to hesitate. \"Yes...I created them a while ago. That is it\" he replies. You are almost sure that your host isn't telling the truth, but you dismiss those thoughts for the moment. Your legs are starting to ache from the walk, so you ask how many places are there left before the route ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more place, and it'll be perfect for you to relax. Go to the end of the tube\" You walk to the end, contemplating all the machines and features of the tube. It seems something very practical. You enter the entrance, ready to see the last part of the route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A peculiar thing this time around is that the hallway leads upward in a series of stairs. The change took you by surprise. Until now, you haven't encountered a path that leads upward, leaving you more curious as to where Dialga will ultimately lead you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you reached the last flight of stair and entered another chamber. You are currently at the top floor of an atrium that consists of several decks. On each of the decks there are what looks like pools of water, each with a different color. The pools are perfect squares arrange in such fashion that would make a neat freak proud.  From afar, the pools resembles a colorful mosaic. The largest of all the pool is in the center of the bottom floor. It features a glowing pattern underwater that seems like a recurring theme throughout Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for the last part of this tour, we have arrived at the Pool Room.\", Dialga announced, \"I consider this to be one of the more interesting parts if my body. Many of the waters you see here are from different dimensions with a wide variety of effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waters from different dimensions, right?\", you said, \"Do you know any effects that these pools might have on my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure about that, human. I haven't tried some of these myself yet, so you might want to avoid pools marked by a red border.\", Dialga said, \"From the pools that I did test, some of them increases your stamina, while others can temporarily give you psychic powers or enhance your memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the large one down there?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that one........I think you're not ready for that pool yet. The power....it's too hard to explain everything in detail to you. You will..... understand it the longer you stay with me\", Dialga stuttered, \"Anyway, do you want to check out the newly created Mall Corner? I got a lot of things you might like there. Let's head back down and take the capsule to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as the Pokemon told and head for your new location but something kinda feels off about Dialga. Since you visited the Communication Venue, you have a feeling that there are a lot of things that Dialga isn't exactly forthcoming about. It leaves you to wonder what the Pokemon is up to. Sometimes, it even feels like he is monitoring your every move in his body. You can understand that he's probably doing at least some form of monitoring on you as a safeguard but hopefully Dialga isn't doing anything too intrusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was close. The human almost used my Power Sharing pool which would no doubt expose my observation/surveillance of him. Definitely need to be more cautious the next time around.  I can't let him become suspicious of me and leave me. This human contains so much valuable information that I could learn from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In addition to finding that idiot Palkia for what he had done, I have found the perfect human to observe and keep me company.</i></span></div></div>",

There must be something good in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule takes you directly to your newlyfound destination. You look around when you arrive. The room you're in is as big as the trading room. You see the same odd structures that were used to trade, and if it weren't for the color scheme, you would have thought you were back there. You approach one of those, and examine it. You find some kind of catalog. You browse it. You don't recognize most of the things that are in the catalog. The language is unknown to you, so the only reference you have are the images themselves. You leave the catalog and go to another structure, just to find another. It is the same thing over again, an unknown catalog to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, what is up with this? I don't understand a thing here!\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the mall, but not only for the inside of my body. This mall will work in more than a dimension too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like that financial system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but instead of being focused on money, this is for you to buy stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" you say, excited, and grab a catalog again. You look at the prices. \"This looks very expensive...\" You don't need to look at your actual amount of money to know that you don't have enough to buy most of these things. You remember that you need to cash the money you got saved in the bank. Maybe then you'll be able to buy anything. That reminds you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Dialga, when would you get paid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every night you'll receive a certain amount of money, and when you complete a task successfully, you'll receive more\" Dialga replies. You nod. You select some of the stuff in the catalogs, planning to buy them when you got money. In a few days you should be able to buy them. You spend some time more inside the Mall, and when you have enough stuff in your wishlist, you choose to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're about to enter the capsule, you catch a glimpse of something in a lateral entrance to the Mall. It shines, and your curiosity gets the better of you. When you approach to the entrance, you see an odd contraption. You remember what Dialga had said earlier. \"When you travel around in my body, you will encounter various apparatuses or devices\". Maybe this is one of those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promise yourself that you won't enter it, but you're too curious. \"Dialga, I think I found one of those devices you had talked about. I won't try to operate it, but I can't avoid to ask...what is this for?\" you ask, while approaching the apparatus</span></div></div>",

It's a massive monolith that glows a florescent silver which is something you haven't seen until now. An alcove containing a bed surrounded by glass  walls. To the left of the bed, a large disc-shaped dial is embedded on the control panel with multiple settings written in an unknown language on the dial. Numerous wires and tubes goes from the side of the device to the ceiling where it leads to somewhere yet explored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing before you is a Healing Chamber.\", Dialga explained, \"It can be used to perform body check ups and give out medications should you ever get hurt in my body. Everything from minor cuts to life threatening injuries can be managed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....are you sure you know about human stuffs?\", you asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you're worried, there's really no need to. I know all there is to know about medical stuffs. You see, you'll learn tons of stuffs if you ever travel  dimensions and space. And since you just got here, why don't I run a quick scan to see if you're fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice...... I haven't actually visited a doctor in months since training Pokemons take away a lot of my time. But you better don't do anything weird with my body. If you ever did, let's just say that I can a major debacle in your body\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga mentally gulped and promised you that he won't do anything out of line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga instructed you to enter the glass chamber and lie down on the bed. He told you to relax and look up at the ceiling. A beam of blue light appeared from a hole on the ceiling and focusing itself on you body. You watch the ray scan your legs,  arms, chest, and even your privates. Wherever the beam fell, you felt a tickling sensation of electricity. The beam slowly made its way up to your head where it shone into your eyes, and temporarily blind you. The whole process took about ten minutes to complete. Fortunately, Dialga told you that everything is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you really appreciate Dialga for preparing what is basically a hospital for your use. But a question almost immediately arise in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...I have a question: why would you make such a device when you previously told me that you wouldn't allow me to travel to parts that are too dangerous for me? If I wouldn't be injured, what's the need for it?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seemed to pause for a few seconds as if to collect his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I just made it just to be on the safe side. You never know what gonna happen. Even as a Pokemon who could see ahead of time, there are still certain things that I couldn't predict.\", Dialga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Sounds reasonable, you thought, An unexpected fall could strain my leg and an accidental cut will need bandaging. But Dialga seems really nervous since this morning. Is there anything he haven't told me yet? Better return to the bedroom for some rest.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>whew! Almost got caught again. Looks like I'm really poor at making things up. But it seems that the human is starting to have doubts about my intentions. But never mind that: I've finally installed a Mind Reader software into the humans brain. Their brains don't come with a firewall and coding are relatively simple to crack. Although the human trainer doesn't realize it, I can perfectly pick up every stray thoughts he's having. I can also see through his eyes, hear, and taste like he does. That means more research data for me and more things to probe. More \"customized\" things to come for the human. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was obvious the human felt Dialga had been hiding something, and it is true! <i>I definitely have to be more careful in the future</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the human followed the tour, Dialga had asked his fellow Legendary partners for some information about humans. Most only had tidbits of information, but other Legendaries, who interacted more often with humans, sent him a lot of stuff to process. The information showed the whole species in a new light, but Dialga was more interested on the shrunken human. After all, Mew had sent Dialga one odd thing...something about a human that would earn powers beyond the species. A very interesting legend. But the human of the legend had some physical traits that the shrunken human lacked, so they couldn't be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...Dialga wondered if he could turn this human in something else, somebody that deserved the recognition of the legendaries. But of course, Dialga first wanted to determine if it was worth it. <i>Maybe I should make this human go through some tests...or something. But how would I make it go through them?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga started making plans while he observed the human. Tomorrow the guest would have an active day after work.</span></div></div>",

You woke up early in the morning to have breakfast then head for the Central Chamber for your work routine. You expected Dialga to assign you a lot of maintenance work today but it quickly turns into a very boring day; there isn't even minor anomaly for you to fix. Much to your surprise, Dialga was also unusually silent today, only greeting you when you had breakfast. Hours was spent blankly staring at screens and graphs. No warnings, no alerts, no flashing lights....... On one hand, you are relieved that you won't be making long trips through Dialga's body, but on the other, you have absolutely nothing to do for work. It left you feel disengaged as you fixed your eyes once again on the status screen......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Come on...come on....can time go any faster? I really hate it when things are slow. It's a good thing that everything is normal in here, but this is no fun for me! Hey....maybe I can ask Dialga to fast-forward my time.

Oh we'll, guess I have to sit this though then...\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nDialga couldn't help but smile when he felt the boredom that the human was feeling. He had deliberately silenced the alarms in the Central Chamber as a little experiment to see how the trainer would respond. Dialga could see the trainer eyeing the screens through half shut eyes and see his hands randomly fidgeting about in the front. The Pokemon was more than amused at what the human was thinking. Dialga can, in fact, quicken the state of time within the confines of his body, meaning the time in his body could be distinct from that on the outside. This human is indeed very interesting and smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later when your work is finally over, you let out an excited squeal in celebration of the end of boredom. You ran out of the Central Chamber toward the capsule with a sudden burst of energy. You seated yourself and was about to set your destination when Dialga finally broke his morning long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty slow day, huh?\", said Dialga, \"Sorry about boring you, I'm having very few problems today. Must be quite a morning for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I still got to explore your body anyway. So what tour are we going to have today?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say I'll keep it a secret until you get there. I have a lot of surprises to show you.\", Dialga answered enigmatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....playing up the mysteries today, huh?\", you asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that.\", Dialga said, \"I'll handle driving the capsule this time. You just sit back and relax for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule started moving upward on its rail taking you to your new destination for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in for some awesome stuffs, human, thought Dialga.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have stopped. Come out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the capsule to find yourself in a very small room, with nothing inside. It seems like it exists only to receive the capsule. \"So, why am I here?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seems to hesitate a little before replying. \"I have decided to watch over your well-being while you're inside me, and I want to make you even better\" <i>That should be good enough</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask how Dialga plans to do that. \"It is easy.

Haven't tried one of those in a very long time\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\", Dialga exclaimed, \"I'll have the place ready by the time you get there. But I have to warn you, it isn't as easy as it seems. The things I've set up is designed to push you to your limits, to strengthen your stamina, and to improve your intuition. So you better be prepared for what's coming up, human. If you think you are up to the challenge, you can proceed to your first test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on it. A trainer does not refuse a challenge when offered one.\", you said confidently. You take the tunnel to your left and head for the obstacle course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see that determination you got there, human.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage is a featureless steel corridor with glowing stripes running horizontally on the wall. Along the way, a question suddenly struck you. It's has been lingering for some times already, but it's just slowly coming into realization now:  Dialga seems to be preparing you for something. You decided to investigate this a little further, careful not to directly state your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you suddenly so concerned about improving my wellbeing, Dialga?\", you asked curiously, \"Are you sensing that I'm going out of shape or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....I figured that it must be really boring for you to be stuck in the metallic confine of my body with nothing stimulating to do. So I decided that such activities might be the thing that'll keep you upbeat while the search for Palkia continues.\", Dialga said in a hesitant and awkward manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But didn't you just showed me an exercise room yesterday?\", you pointed out, \"That looks good enough to keep me busy. Are there any other purposes for these tests that you aren't telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Dialga's heart skipped several beats. Sweats formed on his steel body as he felt himself heat up. The Pokemon sensed every warning siren in the Central Chamber started blaring and every screen started displaying jumbled error messages. He started feeling light headed. This human is a scrutinizer, Dialga thought, far sharper than I imagine he would be. I have to make up a convincing explanation.... and quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\", Dialga quickly denied, \"It's just some random thoughts I had. I thought that you might be interested in some form of tests. By the way, you're almost at your destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Something tells me that Dialga is only telling me half truths. The Pokemon is definitely up to something. But what is it? There isn't anything that the Pokemon could gain from me. Unless the Pokemon wants to keep me as some sort of pet, nothing seems out of the ordinary so far. Dialga didn't seem to have any malicious intent, so you decide to just leave it aside for the time being. Until then, I guess I should be a little more careful next time.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Dialga had finished his sentence, you've entered a large room that is several hundred feet long that is filled with all sort of imaginable obstacles. It looks like a track field, only 20 times bigger. The chrome steel chamber contains rocky terrains, steep slopes, deep waterway, fire-infested rooms, sharp meshes, narrow crawl ways, spinning platforms and many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Obstacle Course.\", Dialga said, \"Ready to hear my instructions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThis human has a very keen sense. A cery curious one. He's already on the brink of picking up on my intentions now. Although the human seems satisfied with my answer at the moment, I can still feel his suspicion beneath that veil of calmness and smile.  I have to find some distractions, something to mislead and quell his suspicions. And I know exactly what to do. Initiating Human POV.....<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

You feel lightheaded, but you suppose it is due to the nervousness. On a side you can see a high platform, which must be the starting point. You start to ascend to it, getting ready to take the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Done, Human POV is working\". Dialga now can see what the human sees, hear what the human hears, etc, along with a few functions that may be useful. \"This won't be playing clean, but it should distract him\" Dialga has very limited controlling of the human now, along with an outline of the human's actual thoughts. As he feared, a lot of them were suspicion of the Pok\u00e9mon not telling the truth. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood on the platform, and waited. After a few minutes of nothing happening, you inquire what is going on \"I thought you were going to tell me when to start!\" Dialga apologizes, then gives you the signal to start. You quickly jump to the catwalk in front of you, and try to maintain your balance while you walk through it. At the end there is some sort of rocky slope, you feel like it'll be hard to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the slope, suddenly you feel assaulted by a random thought of food. You push that aside, but more random thoughts come in quick succession during the obstacle course. Your life, your bed, the pain you're feeling from the fall you just had on that spinning platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dialga keeps inserting thoughts, in a hope of making the human forget its suspicions. It seems to be working, as he seems them disappear. When they're completely gone, Dialga turns off the POV, satisfied with his actions</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're swimming through a deep pool, you feel your mind getting lighter. You're finally able to focus on the obstacle course itself. You're in about half of it, and you spent it wondering why you were thinking about the color of the sky. After you focus on the challenge, you feel everything is easier. You crawl under thick wooden planks, run through a shaking platform, and jump over countless pits, until you reach the goal. You're exhausted. \"How...How did I do, Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeh...fifteen minutes. Average. Not a good start, in my opinion\" <i>He would have done better if I hadn't meddled with his mind, so I'll concede some points.</i> \"Now rest, human. You have fifteen minutes to rest before the next one. Now you'll see several bottles of the best water there is. Enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick one of the bottles and drink its content, while you look at the pathways to the other three tests. You're tired, so you consider taking one that doesn't require getting too tired. After some consideration, you think the endurance test will be good enough. You don't know if it was the right choice. You notify Dialga about your decision. \"You should take some water bottles with you. You'll need them\" your host tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some, and after you feel with enough energy, you walk through the entrance. The path keeps going down, like stairs, until you reach a thick muscle blocking your way. You touch it, and enter a wide tunnel. The environment is hot and humid, and in just minutes, you feel you're starting to sweat. The air feels somewhat stale too, but you don't mind. \"There is certainly a lot of space in here. Now, what do I have to do in the endurance test, Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, it is time to see how much stamina you have against harsh conditions. You're now in the start of my large intestine. Behind you you should see the entrance to my small intestine, just so you know it is the truth\". And yes, behind you, you can see a huge closed sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you'll trek through the large intestine. Obviously the further you walk, the harder it'll be for you to continue, due to many factors you'll discover in the test. As this is to measure endurance, you're free to stop anytime, just notify me and I'll get you out of there. The endurance test only ends when you decide to stop, or if you reach the end of the path. Do you understand all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply that everything is clear \"After you're done with this test, you can rest for an hour. Now, go!\" you hear him. After your average performance in the obstacle test, you really want to impress Dialga now. You just hope you're able to at least be better at this than the obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a mere hundred feet, your shirt is completely drenched in sweat. The walls are dripping with condensations of water; their occasional echoes breaking the silence in this lonely part of Dialga.  Unknown  remains of food sticks to the walls, slowly being absorbed into  them without leaving anything behind. Puddles are strewn throughout the bumpy iron floor, either making you slip or getting your pants wet knee deep. Dialga isn't bluffing about how difficult the ordeal will be. And since you accepted his test, there is no giving up now. I have to impress him this time, you thought, I'm not going to let some of my weaknesses jeopardize Dialga's opinion of me, especially an experienced Pokemon trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk deeper into the intestine, the humid environment coupled with the familiar yet foreign odor of antiseptic creates a nauseating sensation that threatens to get you off course. And the stale air isn't helping at all. Despite these problems, you continued through the large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> So far, the human seems to be holding up quite well. I kinda admire him for that. I have to create more challenges up ahead. At this rate, it is increasingly likely for the human to be the one from our legends. If he's really holds up to this one, I'll have to reward him somehow. But for now, things are gonna get a little extreme down there....<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp to this point, the conditions in the intestines is still bearable for you; although twisting and twirling a lot, you managed to walk half it without much incident. Suddenly, a rumbling sound emanates throughout the entire structure of the intestines. That's strange, you thought, this doesn't You turned your head back just in time to see a large torrent of liquid heading your way. Before you even sprinted, you are swept off your feet by the sheer strength of the current. Your body spins and churned in the liquid which tastes of metal from the accidental gulps you took. In an attempt to surface, you frantically swam in whatever direction you think is the way up. On the first try, you hit the floor with a large bump and slammed into a wall on the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third try, you finally surfaced almost out of breath. You panted loudly for several minutes while allowing the flow to carry you. That was a close one, you thought.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drifting for some times, you called out to Dialga about how you performed on this test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say that it's impressive on the first attempt, human. Your endurance are up to my expectation. But there is still room for improvements. That last part overwhelmed you rather quickly and in regard to that, I will test you harder on that aspect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have mixed feeling about Dialga's assessment. Dialga is impressed with your ability but he still sees some flaws that require more training. Though you're happy with the results, it isn't enough yet. You make mental notes that you will focus on the next challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will arrive at the end of my intestine in a minute or two. And you may take a one hour break and get yourself freshen up.\", Dialga said, \"From there, you can choose the third test you want to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThe human has completely devoted his thoughts toward the tests. It's good in two ways: first, the human had forgotten about his suspicion about my intentions. Second, I'm one step closer to making him into the Wielder of the Legendaries from the myth. And of course, he'll always be my human....<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't notice that the amount of liquid has decreased by the second, surely due to the natural function of the place you're in. By the time you notice it, you're starting to touch the ground with you feet. You just hope that the end is close, as you seriously don't feel like walking more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, much to your relief, the wave had carried you far enough to arrive by foot in less than a minute. After one turn, you feel the environment feels fresher and cooler. In the distance, you see what only can be the large anus of your host. You chalk the change of temperature to how close the rectum is to the outside world or some other similar explanation, and quickly forget about it. You approach the most you can, and sit against one of the walls. Taking one of the water bottles you took with you, you decide to take a short nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you feel energetic again. You stretch, look at your clock, and notice you have around twenty minutes left before you continue. Without not much to do, you decide to try to start a conversation with Dialga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo...how is the search for Palkia going, Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so well. But I'm kinda sure that I'm in the same dimension he is. Only time will tell\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost laugh at those words. You're sure Dialga said the last four as a joke. \"And when you find him, what will you tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides one very needed speech about being careful with his powers? Not much. I expect him to apologize for all the trouble he caused to you, though. Not that there is a big chance of it, but it would be good to ask him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this other dragon...what was its name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giratina? We don't talk to Giratina often...normally we only do it when there is a serious emergency. Last time I talked with that Legendary was around thirty years ago. If Palkia refuses to do something to help you then I'll contact Giratina to force Palkia to do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you're curious about Dialga's past. You wonder what this Legendary did before encountering you. You place a reminder to yourself to ask him in other moment. Meanwhile you talk about various other stuff, until you realize that the twenty minutes are gone. You stand up, and you tell Dialga that you're ready for the third test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the third one...uh...\" Strength isn't your best quality, so you want to delay that test. \"The Speed test will be good. It was a race, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a time trial. Who would you race against? I'll set an amount of time for you to complete the track, the amount of time I think it would take me to complete it if I were in your situation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Sounds like another chance to impress Dialga. \"Let's do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you need to get to the start point. This'll be a surprise for you: You'll be racing on my back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly takes you by surprise. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that you'll come outside, and take your position on my lower back. Then you'll start running until you arrive to my neck. I had made it long as I thought it would be a good ending for the day, but looks like you decided to do it as your third test\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words don't help to make you feel like you picked the best option, but it is too late to change your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're ready, come out. You're right near the closest exit available\" You don't like very much the idea of coming out of your host through the least dignified path possible, but you feel that asking for an easier option would not make you look strong. You sigh and walk towards the anus.</span></div></div>",

It is currently tightly sealed without any distinctive mechanism to open it. The idea of going through this part of the body is repulsive and completely beyond what is acceptable. Although the metallic liquid was disgusting, you're quietly thankful that you didn't encounter any solid wastes. Maybe Dialga did this as the last part of my endurance test. If that's the case, he really knows how to test my limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unwillingly touched the wall next to the hole and saw the anus loosens.  The opening is large enough for you to crawl through and you quickly did so without hesitation. Once you made it outside, you are greeted by Dialga's tail. At the side of the exit, you located a series of recesses with which you can climb onto Dialga's back.  Once you got on the back, you encountered the wall of spikes that sits on the Pokemon's back. You also noticed that you are no longer in the same place where Dialga found you. The world around you is distorted  and colorful with seemingly contradictory landforms; a mountain  that's made from water, a sky that is a bright pink, rivers that seems to flow skyward, and a night sky filled with stars that acts as the ground. The wind constantly blows against you, causing a sparkling blue aura to trail behind you. When you attempt to grab at the aura, it immediately dissipate. Not even 'surreal' is enough to convey the full meaning of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now somewhere between the 11th and 12th dimension of existence.\", Dialga explained, \"This place may seem foreign to you but it's kind of like home to me. While you most likely only been to the 3rd and to a very limited extent, the 4th, I have travel through hundreds of such universe. Each of them is unique with self-contained laws of physics. If we ever had the chance, you really need to see the 22th dimension; that place is beyond beautiful. Delving into further details would likely overwhelm your mind, so I'll just leave it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are already confused even by Dialga's \"simplistic\" explanation. It might be a little less confusing if you had some knowledge of time-space stuffs; you have the feeling that if Dialga were to fully explain that dynamic, he would be speaking another language beyond human scope. But you couldn't help but wonder what kind of places you'll visit with Dialga that no one else would ever had the chance to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the place you're standing on would be the starting point of the race. First, you'll have to scale the spikes on my back, then you'll run all the way to the finish line which is halfway up my neck. The time limit would be 15 minutes; once you step out of the start line, the counter will start. Are you ready?\", Dialga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Bring on the challenge, Dialga.\", you answered confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get set.......Start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly run toward the spikes, scaling them with your hands. The surface  is hard and sharp which causes a few minor scratches here and there. In the distance, you can see Dialga's head looking in your direction, enjoying the race from high above. A total of 8 minutes is spent on ascending and descending the mountains the spikes along. You pretty much used up half of your energy doing that. But, nevertheless, you keep on running toward the neck. The run along Dialga's back isn't any easier; it's a path filled with bumps and pockmarks which caused you to trip once or twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrived at the finish line on the neck. You almost collapse from the rapid beating of your heart. If you were to go any further, you are sure that your body will disintegrate. You spent several minutes on you back panting and staring blankly at the pink sky above you. You haven't done something the intense before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! You made to the finish line with 5 seconds to spare.\", Dialga said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great......how....did I.....perform?...\", you said, still trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Better than I expected. You deserve a well-earned rest. Come now, I'll take you to a new place within my body. Head for the opening in my ear.....there is something I want you to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> I can't believe it. He really ran all the way.

Pushing those thoughts aside, you look for Dialga's ear canal. You have a difficult time finding it, as they're small and almost hidden, but soon you manage to find a crevice that can only be it. You manage to get inside the narrow tunnel, and start going. You wonder what exactly is here that Dialga wants to show you. Can you interpret it as a reward for your performance in the Speed test? Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you unwittingly bump into a silky object. After stepping back, you realize that it isn't anything other than Diagla's eardrum. After examining the membrane for some minutes, you wonder if this is what Dialga wanted to show you. Doesn't look like something worth the whole trip up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see an opening on a side of the tunnel. Take it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you do see one pathway. Leaving the auditory canal, you start going upwards. It keeps going up, and soon you start to think that Dialga is guiding you up to his brain. He had said you weren't allowed to go, but he was the one to tell you to come. You reach the end of the passageway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in a dome-like room, with one wide screen at the front. In the screen you can see more of that dimension Dialga is visiting. You approach it, and soon notice one tiny control board, along with a chair. This reminds you a lot of your control room, the one that every morning you have to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I call \"The Cockpit\". Basically a feature that would allow somebody inside me to have temporary control of my body. Why don't you try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the main control. \"I didn't know this could even be possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost all Pok\u00e9mon have some sort of control terminal inside them. But it is very uncommon to be used. After all, it isn't like all Pok\u00e9mon will find a shrunken creature. Now, have fun. You have half an hour to lead me around. Who knows, maybe you'll find Palkia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start moving the control, and find out you're making Dialga turn in different directions. Soon you manage to move the body forwards, towards one of the rivers. You don't think Dialga knows to swim, so you change directions. Soon you find ways to make Dialga run and explore faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dimension is certainly something you never thought you would see. Something tells you that you may be the only human ever to see it. You even forget about Palkia, and instead focus on exploring around. You don't want to waste the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dialga tells you that time is up, you feel that you spent hours exploring around. If this is one dimension, you really hope to see others! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dialga, this was amazing\" you say. You feel your host would appreciate your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make your mornings more pleasant, I have installed a screen so you can see the dimensions I explore. Maybe it can help you to be less bored\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly sounds like a great decision. You once again thank Dialga, and remind him there is one test left. Dialga directs you out of the cockpit, but tells you to stop to one nearby room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Strength test is fairly simple. I'll provide you with different objects, substances and other stuff, and you'll be lifting them. We'll start with the lightest I have and/or produce, and if you manage to lift it, we'll continue with the next. This'll only stop when you can't lift what I provide you. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"After this, you can go rest to your room. Tomorrow I'll tell you my opinion about your overall performance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words, Dialga stops talking, and several things materialize in front of you. </span></div></div>",

The only indications that they were made by Dialga are the cubist design and the navy blue coloration of the weight. In addition to those, there are also several large blocks of steel neatly stacked on one corner of the chamber. The objective was simply to lift and carry those blocks across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere goes nothing, you thought. You immediately start your final test, eager to finish the test and take a much needed sleep. The day had been very active and you're completely exhausted by all the tasks. Dialga can be very demanding at times. By the way he pushes you, the Pokemon better give you a good assessment report tomorrow. But still, what are all these tests about? Dialga seems to be dodging that question since this morning. All this time you're in his body Dialga is preparing you for something, but what is it? You can't quite place it; every time you try to think carefully about that question, your mind just simply goes blank. It is as if something is blocking your mind and redirecting it somewhere else. You suddenly spaced out again and forget about everything you thought. When your conscious returned, you only remember that you have to complete the task Dialga gave you. You shrugged and started the Strength Test, which hopefully will be simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first several dumbbells are the easiest; you lifted them without straining any of your muscles. The dumbbells got progressively heavier until you reached 120kg which you are barely able to get off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to the metal blocks and began moving them across the room at a fast speed. Each of them weigh at least 60kg. Halfway through, you felt the pain in your arms began to intensify. At that moment, you are about to give up and call it a day. But then, you don't want to let Dialga down or create a poor impression of human strengths which can affect future relationship with Legendary Pokemons. Ignoring the pain throughout your body, you put up your best effort and moved the blocks at a faster rate and finished the assignment in 2 minutes. You lie down and groaned so loud that the voice echoed throughout Dialga's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, human. You finished all the test I've set for you. I think that it's courageous of you to accept each of the test without question. And for that, I will give you a fair assessment first thing tomorrow  morning.\", Dialga said, \"Now, return to your room and enjoy your sleep. By the way, you might wanna lower the volume next time you're near my brain; migraines in Pokemon aren't exactly light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you completed the Strength Test, you returned to the capsule and rode back to your room without much thoughts. You entered your room and fell on your bed fall asleep within minutes. Dialga better give you a day off for this, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHis suspicion kept coming back. No matter what I do, he'll eventually start thinking about my motive again.  It's getting really difficult to defend this. I was left with little choice but to alter that part of his memory. It's for his own good; he can't know too much about my abilities. He won't be able to handle that information. Now, I have to ask Mew and the others again on how I can further observe this human. Despite his shortcomings, he is one with great potentials. Perhaps, when he's stronger, he'll be able to handle the facts about my full power a little better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, he looks adorable when he's asleep.....<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

The third or fourth day of your temporal residence inside Dialga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got ready, did your newlyfound morning routine, and got to work. You saw a new screen, which later you found out would let you see what Dialga sees. Surely an attempt to keep you more entertained, if there is nothing else for you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will you stay in this dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think Palkia is around, but I don't think I'll find him...this dimension is huge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what about the results from yesterday's tests? You said you would tell me today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga felt proud of giving you the scores. \"You did excellently, human. There is room for improvement, but you could be destined for great things, even greater than you think. But you had a performance that went beyond my expectations\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved to hear that. At first you had thought that you could have disappointed Dialga, but you were sure his words were sincere. But despite that, you still were a shrunken human inside a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, and it didn't look like it would change soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind very much, as long as you could at least watch something that no other human would ever see. The wonders of the other dimensions were one of the best things you had seen. You doubted there would be something more amazing than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until what you wanted the most happened, and what Dialga wanted the least happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who is here! What a coincidence to see you around, Dialga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga turned around, and felt shocked to see Palkia. He really hadn't expected to actually find Palkia so fast. \"Aren't you going to at least greet me?\" Palkia said. Dialga was at loss of words, but you were ecstatic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found him! Thank you Dialga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Dialga grow uneasy. \"Why aren't you saying anything. Is there something wrong?\" Palkia asked with clear concern. Meanwhile, you waited for Dialga to give you a passage out or something, or at least to tell Palkia about you. Minutes passed, and Dialga started to sweat a lot, the alarms in your control room started to sound, it seemed that Dialga was overheating. You ignored those alarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you started growing...frustrated. Why wasn't Dialga saying a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, please, it is the chance for me to grow back to normal!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what is wrong with you? I'm not leaving nor letting you leave until you tell me what is going on\" Palkia said, making sure to hint it was very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\"Dialga stammered. He really didn't expect to be in such situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should...should I tell the truth to both? Should I really say what is all of this? I really want to turn this human into something bigger, but how...how can I lie to both and get away with it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he were to tell the truth to the human, it could very well end their friendship and the possibility of improving him would he gone. But if he didn't say something, how can Palkia know what he had done?  Dialga made a hard decision that would be unpopular on the human's end. Before the Pokemon spoke again, he caused time within his body to stop, freezing the human trainer in his track; making anything happening outside unknown to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Palkia.....there is something that I need to talk to you about.\", Dialga finally said, \"....Remember few days ago when you are randomly showing off your power to me, telling me how you finally master the technique of transporting foods and stuffs to me in larger quantities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia silently nodded in recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just transported a human to our dimension.\", Dialga straightforwardly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what? A human? Wait, have I made a mistake again?\", Palikia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you teleported a human here, a Pokemon trainer to be exact.\", Dialga bluntly replied, \"Humans reside in the 3rd dimension and are an advanced civilization with some knowledge about time and space. That is if you ever paid attention to all those trips we've had. We've been there numerous times in the past, remember? Anyway, I found the human shrunken at the stone pedestal and he has no idea as to how he got here. He only described a bright flash in the forest he's exploring before finding himself here. And I have reasons to believe that you may have inadvertently caused this......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga looked at Palkia sternly, causing the Pokemon to flinch slightly at the glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've constantly warned you against using you own powers excessively for your own purpose; treating it as some kind of plaything, but you just wouldn't listen. Last time, I have to help you fix up the debacle you caused when you moved the entirety of Dandelion Island to your personal dimension because you wanted to explore it all on your own. It took me nearly all of my power to set things straight again. Reversing time, making sure that all of the rifts are fixed, and creating more myths to explain the phenomenon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to talk about that again. I thought we resolved that already. If I accidentally got the human here, I'll just enlarge him and send him back.\", Palkia defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no longer that simple now, Palkia. He is something far greater than a mere human and I could see it in him.\", Dialga said deliberately being ambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......so how's the human right now?\", Palkia asked awkwardly, \"Did you do anything with it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human is currently living in me. I stopped the floow of time in there so he can't hear our conversations.\", <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You allowed the human to live in you?\", Palkia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what else could I do? I can't leave him to drift in the dimensions.\", Dialga answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I restart time for the trainer, I'll let him outside for you to see. You just have to talk as if you saw him for the first time. Then we'll decide our next steps. Hopefully, we won't get Giratina involved in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Now I really want to see the human I teleported.\", Palkia said, his voice filled with curiosity.</span></div></div>",

At first you could notice that Palkia had shifted his position, but you didn't pay attention to it. \"Human, could you please come to my mouth? You'll have to talk with Palkia directly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied saying you would, and got off your chair. Dialga opened a direct passageway, and you entered it, excited. This happened much quicker than you had thought it would be! This must be your lucky day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrived to Dialga's throat, and while you walked over the Pok\u00e9mon's tongue, you saw it was opening, letting you see what was outside. Effectively, outside another colossal dragon stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia, despite being smaller than Dialga, was still an imposing creature. You couldn't avoid feeling intimidated by him. If you didn't know that this dragon could return you to normal, and didn't have Dialga protecting you, you would be very afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human? What is a human doing inside you?\" Palkia asked. Dialga, unable to talk with you on his tongue, stood in silence. You took this as your cue to start explaining your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia listened carefully, while you expressed what you wanted, and how Dialga had given you a safe place inside his body. You purposefully didn't mention the stuff about the tests, as you didn't think it was needed. At the end of your tale, Palkia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is how it all happened. Yeah, it is my fault. Sorry about that, human\" Palkia says, looking at you as close as possible. \"No big deal, but could you please return me to normal?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice Dialga's begging expression, but Palkia did see it. After thinking for a few seconds, Palkia said as inexpressively as possible. \"I'm afraid I'm not sure how to do it, human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're aghast at those words. \"What?! But...the same way you shrunk me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it on purpose. It was a collateral effect of the misuse of my powers\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour disappointment must have been obvious, because Palkia stammered and added \"But I'll find a way to do it! I'll hone my abilities and come back when I'm sure to do it right. Meanwhile, you should live inside Dialga, if he doesn't mind\" Dialga made some odd sounds that you interpreted as agreeing with Palkia's words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you Palkia\" you said. Dialga closed his mouth, and you stayed on his tongue, disappointed. Looks like you'll be in there for longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Dialga stopped time once again inside him. \"Thank you Palkia...I really am thankful\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia was unsure of what to say, but finally gathered some words. \"I'm not sure what you see in the human, but I trust your judgment. What have you done to test him?\" Dialga tells Palkia all about the tests. \"I think the next step is to check other qualities\" Palkia said \"Physically, he seems okay. But does he have the qualities of what you're looking for? Courage is the first one that comes to my mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" Dialga asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that today you should create some sort of...danger. Make the human think it is in danger. Or even better! Make him think that<i> you are in danger</i>. Then see if he reacts. If he is brave and actually cares for other beings, then he should help you, even if it means doing something that it won't like, or something that can be bad for it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga nodded, already thinking what he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Dialga. If you need help with the human, or just want me to return him to normal, just notify me. I'll find a way to keep us in contact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Palkia left. Dialga thought for a while, trying to think of a danger situation the human could \"avoid\" to save him. <i>I could make a red alert inside me. Something that looks life-threatening, either for him or for me. But what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Pok\u00e9mon thought about it, he once again made time be normal inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and looked at the back of the mouth. It was time once again to return to the depths inside Dialga. \"Dialga, can I stop working early today? I would like to...be by myself, for a while\" you said. Dialga replied that it was okay.

The job just become a lot duller; not only is there a serious lack of problems, the enthusiasm you had for the work was gone. The screens now felt more like a featureless wall, the metallic controls felt a lot colder. A numbness spreads in your body as long-restrained emotions started surfacing from the confines of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your optimism fell down several notches;  Palkia is unable to fix your problem right away. Though he promised to have it fixed as soon as possible, the news was a hit to your personal morale.

The television screen still shows the colorful dimension outside. Dialga has resumed his traveling. The scene just reminded you further about how your life used to be. You quickly locked the door,shut down all forms of communications in the room, and fell down on your bed. Tears formed on your eyes as you cried for the first time in a while. As interesting as Dialga's body may be, you really missed life outside the Pokemon. You missed the training with your Pokemons, the endless traveling around the world, the challenges, and most of all....interaction. Dialga can speak and talk with you like any human.....but something is still amiss.The longer you think about it, you realized: the Pokemon's labyrinthine insides just turned into the loneliest place you've ever been to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your plight hasn't gone unnoticed to Dialga; he has been watching and feeling your emotions the whole time. Dialga looked on as he feel his brain being assaulted by mountains of thoughts and memories from the human. The Pokemon viewed everything from the people that the human had met, the various ups and downs of his life so far, the hardships that he had endured to reach the Pokemon League, and his unwavering love for Pokemons. The more he viewed them, the sadder Dialga become. He didn't realize how much of an impact the shrinking had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, the human had cries himself to sleep and Dialga deeply pondering about his actions and plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> I never expected things to end up like this. It wasn't supposed to head in this direction. I wanted to return  you to your normal life as soon as possible, but there are forces out there that are preventing it.

Out of curiosity, and kinda hoping to see something that could indicate more about the human's emotional state, Dialga opened his Human POV again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was black, since the human was asleep, but after a few changes in the configuration of the mind reader hack Dialga had installed, the Pok\u00e9mon managed to see the images of the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human was walking along with its team. The place was the dimension he had seen today, but nor the human nor the Pok\u00e9mon seemed to pay attention to the surroundings. It was like they all were familiar with it. The human seemed optimist, and the team had a healthy aura of happiness and trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost heartwarming to see the dream look so peaceful, but Dialga knew that, sooner or later, the subconscious would start distorting the dream to show the human's inner struggles. After a while, one of the Pok\u00e9mon in the team disappeared. Nobody looked where the Pok\u00e9mon had been, all of them continued forward, but the human seemed to be less cheerful, and the team less united. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while, more Pok\u00e9mon would be gone, and the human would look gloomier every time. The surroundings of the dream had started changing too. The surreal dimension started turning more stone-like, and the sky darker, until it all started resembling Dialga's own dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human soon was walking alone, through Dialga's dimension. Sometimes, the silhouette of one of the Pok\u00e9mon would appear momentarily, but the human didn't seem to notice. Soon, it stopped. In front of the human, there was a huge shadow. Dialga was looking at a strange image of himself, the Dialga in the dream seemd corrupted and almost gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human and the dream legendary Pok\u00e9mon seemed to talk, but no sound was made. After that, the Dialga in the dream welcomed the human into his body. The last image the real Dialga saw in the dream was the human, looking resigned, as if he had been sentenced to life in some sort of jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to watch more, Dialga stopped. This was enough for him. It was obvious that the recent happenings really had dampened his guest's attitude. If he wanted to turn the human into something greater, then he needed to help the human first. It was very likely that a depressed human wouldn't even want to cooperate, whether he knew or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll postpone the courage test. First...first I need to cheer him up. Tomorrow I'll show him that, despite being shrunk, he can have a good time.</i></span></div></div>",

It took a full minute for you to realize that you're back in your room. You haven't slept well. That dream is just too vivid; the disappearing Pokemon, that dark Dialga, you thought that you were gone for good. The feeling of loneliness, gloominess, and despair  revealed itself in full force in your nightmare. Though you are back in the real world, you remained shaken by the dream......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dialga from the dream appeared as a gray and sinister version of the one you're familiar with. He told you that he intended to capture you from the very beginning. Everything from the shrinking to the whole search for Palkia was just a ruse to lower your guard. The gray Dialga went on to tell you how he would like you to be in him forever as his personal servant. The most horrifying detail that he said to you was that he will keep you alive for eternity and make you watch the world change before your eyes. Nothing will ever spare you from this prison. If he thinks that you're dissenting, you will be subject to punishments that goes beyond the cosmic and dimensions.Then the evil Dialga gave a very chilling speech that still haunts your thought: <i>'Now, we can be together, foreeeeverrr. Aren't you happy about it, my human? You are the first to ever have the honor of serving me. You will get to maintain me, work for me, and pleasure me for as long as time exists. I'll make sure you get the most out of it and if you dislike it, too bad because I'm. your. Eternal. Master...... and an insignificant human like you will OBEY!!!!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt tears rolling down your face again. It's just too real.... Did.... did Dialga really want to keep me in here forever? Will I be forced to serve him like in the dream? Will I ever return to normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook off the last of your sleepiness and got off your bed. You are much calmer than you are yesterday but you still have no intention of talking with either Dialga or Palkia, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited from your room, ate your breakfast and just wandered randomly around Dialga's body in an attempt to just get away from all your problems for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts haven't gone undetected. Dialga was also on the verge of tears when he saw how the human recalled his dream. He is in no way like that nor has he ever thought about enslaving the trainer. It hurts Dialga to see himself twisted into something that bears more resemblance to chaotic entity than a righteous keeper of time. But getting the human happy will take some times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThis is my chance to make the human happy again. I'll just have to do it in a more discreet manner. No announcement or explanation. Just surprises. But how can I possibly do it? Creating things that reminds him of his life isn't the brightest choice now. There must be something original that I could do. I cannot allow the human to feel sad again....not after that horrible nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, there is a friend I need to cheer up.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga started rearranging the routes within his body to lead the human to his destination. 'I have an idea: if the human can't talk with his old friends, why don't I introduce him to some of mine?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, looks like your luck has dictated that you won't be able to be alone. You stumble upon a small room, with only one computer terminal. \"Another one? How many does Dialga have?\" you think, approaching it. You aren't in the mood to use it, but you're too curious to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're in front of it, the screen turns on. You only see a list of Legendary Pok\u00e9mon. Other than that, there doesn't seem to be a reason for this to exist. Sighing, you absent-mindedly click on a random one. A window opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>You have started a conversation with Mew</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blank at the screen. Maybe you shouldn't have done that. However, looks like your attempt at clicking around didn't go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hello?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew has messaged you. After some doubts, you reply back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Hi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hi. Who are you? I can't see your species</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: I'm just somebody passing around.

I had no idea there were two!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you seem to realize that Mew may be easily deceived. You take this as a chance to mess around, harmlessly, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Yes, there are two, maybe three! Or four!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Oh, wait until I tell my Dialga friend about this! He'll be excited!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fun seems to have taken a detour. Before you're able to type anything, a notification appears, telling you that Mew is busy. After a few minutes, you receive another message from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I think I now see what's going on. You're a human inside Dialga' aren't you? That explains why you have the same species name than him</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way she could have known that if it weren't because Dialga told her. You make a mental note to talk with Dialga about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Yeah, that is true. I think I'll leave now. Bye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>No, wait! I would like to talk with you. This seems interesting. I have always wished to have something inside me, and well, now I hear a friend has a human inside him. I'm jealous. Why don't you tell me about how it is, how it feels?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to humor Mew, at least to keep yourself busy. Much to your surprise, after a few minutes of conversation, you find that you're enjoying it. Mew seems to have genuine curiosity about you, and what you have done inside Dialga. From time to tie she remarks how she wishes she could experiment having somebody inside her, and how Dialga is a good friend, among other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I have to go now. If you want to talk again, just message me, Dee-al-ga. I'll keep that name for you!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're somewhat happier now. Still, you remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, why did you tell Mew about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga hesitates before answering. \"Mew might not be...the brightest Legendary, but she is by far the most trustable. She won't tell anybody. Besides, she'll be willing to be your friend, no matter what is happening to you nor who you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to talk to any other Legendary?\"</span></div></div>",

You never knew that Pokemons are capable of communicating in this way; it really reminds you of all the time you spent on your computer at home. Looks like the Legendaries are a lot more advanced than previously known. When you're chatting with Mew, something about her just felt so familiar, so relatable. The way she talks and interacts with you feels...., human, allowing you to temporarily forget about your shrunken problem. That's probably one of the reasons why you're feeling happier. Mew seems like a really friendly girl to talk to, you thought, I wonder how the rest of Dialga's friends would react if the learn that a human lives inside a Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could speak to a few more of your friends. It's not like you can communicate with Legendary Pokemons everyday. Plus, if Mew seems interesting enough, why don't I give the rest a try.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's great!\", Dialga chimed, \"My friends will be more than happy to talk to you. They definitely would wanna learn more about humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who else can I message with right now?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see.......I currently have Moltres, Articuno, Suicune, and Kyogre on the system......<i>Wow, I can't believe that she's online now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm..did you say something?\", you asked with a concern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Okay, you can choose whoever you like to speak with and I'll let you know when the others get online.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the Pokenet and saw that Dialga had quite a long list of friends. Only a few of them are currently active. You chose Suicune and a new window popped up telling you that a connection has been established.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man....Why did he have to choose her....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hello. Who is this chatting with me?\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi there, Suicune. I'm a human trainer and I want to have a few chats with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Huh? Humans aren't supposed to be able to use the Pokenet. Could you please identify yourself?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, this may sound like crazy but I'm a human currently talking to you through Dialga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>ummmm. I don't follow.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a human using the Pokenet to talk with you. I just want to talk with you. I was shrunken by Palkia when he used his powers. Dialga was kind enough to let me live in his body while we search for a solution.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Dialga?!!!! Alright, that's enough. Quit it with your silly jokes. You aren't even trying to make it convincing. A human? Shrunken? I've never heard of something that absurd before. Is this some kind of new thing you thought up to make me come to you? If you think that I'm going to be gullible enough to believe you after you tricked me into that weird dimension trip of yours with the false alert about my forest being attacked, you are seriously mistaken.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you talking about? Please! I'm telling the truth. This is all Palkia's fault. He got me into this situation. You have to believe me, Suicune.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>One more time and I'm blocking you permanently. Palkia wouldn't do that. He can be a little silly and clumsy at times but he'd never do things that's harmful. Spill it, Dialga! Why are messaging me all of a sudden? Don't tell me you're gonna beg me to forgive you for what you've done.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned by Suicune sudden brash response. The ways she talks strongly contrast with her rumored elegant appearance. And Dialga....what kind of relationship did he have with Suicune; she seemed abruptly hostile when she heard his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hey, I'm talking to you, you know!!! Answer me!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga?\", you said, \"What's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Suicune and I are really good friends with each other. We've known each other for decades.\", Dialga said, \"But I've done too much pranks on her in the past. She's somewhat distrusting of me now. But don't worry, she actually pretty nice......if you stay on her good side. You wouldn't want to get her mad. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds to me that you had this coming. Also, what happens if she's mad?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that she is capable of harnessing the worst force of nature; terror far worse than a thunderstorm.......Please, just let me handle this in a calm and civil manner.\", Dialga said, his voice slightly trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold on there, Suicune. I'm getting Dialga on the line.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>&gt;: -(!!!!!!!! Arghh! You're in for a world of pain, Dialga!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back and watch Dialga startup his own chat window with Suicune. I sure can learn a lot about Dialga from his friends, you thought, Things are gonna get interesting fast. Or worse....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have no idea what she may be thinking, but you wish she believes Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after Dialga is done, she says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>You know I won't believe you until I see proof, don't you?</u> She seems calmer now, you interpret it as a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What proof could I give that it is true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>What about...oh, I don't know!

You said something about he begging you for forgiveness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Agh, you had to ask that. Okay, no harm on telling you. One of his pranks went really far.

I don't want to go into details, but it coincidentally had to do something with a supposed creature that supposedly was my fault. His story was more or less what he said about you.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're appalled at that. Did Dialga really do that? As if Suicide knew what you were thinking, she hastily added:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>But Dialga is a good guy, just that he really can't see the consequences of his acts. Let's leave it at that.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you plan to get a revenge or something? A prank like that can't go unpunished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hah, clever human! Of course I have a plan. I'll make sure he doesn't do something like that again. It should happen sooner or later. I have planned it carefully, and it shouldn't do harm to anybody else than Dialga</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>No telling. You're a shrunken human who knows Dialga, after all. Surely you're in cahoots with him, if you really exist. I should stop talking, before I slip and say too much. Nice to know you, human!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as a farewell message: <u>Dialga, we'll meet someday. And you better show me proof that this whole thing is true, or else I'll kick your scaly metallic ass. Message me if you want to apologize for you-know-what. I feel like accepting it apologies.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicide logged off after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is really something special\" you comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit I do like her...a bit...don't tell her\" you hear Dialga say. You can't avoid snickering, as you really can't imagine Dialga and Suicune together, in any way. \"What did she say to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. Judging by Suicune's words, he does deserve some payback from her. You hope that you see it when it happens. \"Nothing, we just talked about her life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more legendaries. You stop for a moment, to think if you feel like talking to others. You're more cheered up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be a day that you wouldn't want to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting that aside, you continue to browse the list of Legendaries that you could chat with. You're unable to decide who to chat with; too many good candidates to choose from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your chat with Suicune, several more Legendaries have signed on.

You certainly must have improved his week, maybe month, or even year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes, Raikou asks you questions about your past life, your actual situation, and your possible future.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chatting up with Dialga's friends has been one of the best things to happen so far. Mew, Suicune, and Raikou have interesting characters; they're someone you would love to meet in person. Hey, maybe this is my chance to expand my friend circle beyond humans only, you thought. Pokemons are a lot more likable and courteous than some of the people I've encountered. Speaking of that, my 'pre-shrinking' friends haven't really been talking a lot with me lately, even before this whole thing kicked in. Perhaps they're busy with their training....or are we growing a bit distant in such a short time? If it's the latter, it's good to know that Pokemons care more about me. We'll find out soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversations with the Pokemons have tired you significantly. You were way too absorbed to realize how much time you've spent. A quick check of your watch indicates that a little less than four hours have gone by since you started chatting. Your hands ache from all the typing and your eyes feel bleary from fixing them on the monitor for so long. But your curiosity continuously made you stay longer; every stray thoughts of stopping were instantly repelled by your desire to know more about your Pokemon friends. Just one more.... and I'm off for a quick rest, you promised yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched the list for some other Pokemons to talk to. Most of them have gone offline except for a few. One of the names stood out: Keldeo. It's a name you've never heard before. A quick search on your Pokedex yields nothing in return. Well that's strange, you thought. My Pokedex is constantly updated with the newest species of each region I've been to. Is it a previously undiscovered species? It's not entirely impossible to come across one as only 64% of Pokemons were documented as of now. You asked Dialga who this mysterious Pokemon is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo is a friend I made a few months ago. He's a tiny fellow compared with the rest of us on the chat list. He's also a Legendary.\", Dialga said, \"You may be wondering about the unfamiliarity of his name. That because he lives and travels in places uninhabited by humans so your records probably won't include him. To make himself even more obscure, he isn't much of a talker and always tried to stay out of sight, even from other Pokemons. I only happened to come across him by chance and it took me several days to finally get him to trust me. I even managed to photograph him after chasing him around for an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure have gone great lengths just to be friends with this Keldeo guy.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did.\", Dialga sighed, \"It was exhausting but totally worth it! Here, let me show you his first picture. He's really cute but don't tell him that or he'll start denying and cry about joining something called the Swords of Justice. It's some kind of organization or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture popped up on your monitor. The photo showed the Pokemon from Dialga's perspective. You studied every feature of the mysterious Pokemon. Keldeo resembles a Rapidash but far smaller with a elongated snout. He also has a long red mane with blue details on his chest, hooves, and tail. There is a curved horn-like structure on Keldeo's forehead you assume is his main weapon. In the picture, Keldeo is looking up to what is presumbly Dialga. He has a shy and introvert type of expression on his face. The large innocent eyes only intensified the effects. He looks like he didn't really enjoy having that picture taken. If you look carefully, you can even see faint tear marks running down its cheek. Keldeo looks sort of adorable like this. The Pokemon isn't taller than your hip based on your estimation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed about the revelation of a new Pokemon and potentially a new friend. This is an incredible discovery! You're the first human to ever meet a new Pokemon and talk with it. You were about to click on his name before being stopped by Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on there, human.\", Dialga cautioned, \"As much as I know you want to talk with Keldeo, he is very sensitive and shy when it comes to meeting with new people. If you were to talk to him like this, he wouldn't reply and will promptly sign off for days at a time. The guy is still getting used to the chat system. I think it would be better if you talk with him using my name; he'll be a lot more comfortable with it. I'll help you out should you hit a snag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for Dialga to make some adjustments to the chat system before you started typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dialga: Hi there, Keldeo.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>.\u2026........</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dialga: Are you there?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>.........uh..........h...hi.....Dialga...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga quietly chuckled..<br>\r\n<i>Still being that cute little introvert...</i></span></div></div>",

Dialga laughs. \"I knew this would happen! He won't say anything else until you mention something interesting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething interesting. You're not sure what you could propose. You suppose that maybe asking him about his travels can get you a nice reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What have you seen recently?

It is worth trying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I have a new friend, would you like to meet him? You can talk to him.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>No...no...I don't think it would be good...right now. Maybe someday...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. Looks like you won't talk to Keldeo directly, at least for now. You say farewell to Keldeo, and step away from the terminal. It was fun to meet some of the Legendaries. They're quite an eccentric group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like meeting my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I did! Thanks, Dialga\" you say, grateful. Earlier that day you would have never thought that you would be cheered up. It had seemed like something impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go to your room, please. There is something I need to do, and it is a private thing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and start walking to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good, he seems to be in a much lighter mood than before. I hope it lasts. Now that it is done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm still stuck on the whole bravery test. I should start making the arrangements.

If he holds up, this will be the most important news ever for all of us. Not only is a myth proven to be true, it\u2018ll also mean that humans and Pokemons are a lot closer than we imagined. It\u2018s the lost bond between the two species. The implication will be massive and the dynamics of our relationships will be alrered.

I need your immediate attention. Something has happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly checked the time on your watch: 5:40am, far earlier than usual. This is the first time that you have heard Dialga spoke in such urgent and alarming manner. What problem could possibly caused Dialga to wake you at such an early time?, you thought, Has he found a way to get me normal? Has something happened to his friend? Or is he playing some cruel jokes on me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2018s the matter?\u201d, you said groggily and slightly annoyed, \u201cIt\u2019s 5:40 in the morning. Let me sleep for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. This can\u2018t wait!!!\u201d, Dialga hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up on your bed, very irritated. \u201cIt better be important.\u201d, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is an emergency. I\u2019m still having a hard time believing this: there is something very wrong with my body. This is an unprecedented breach of my system which is normally secure. I cannot confirm what caused this other than it\u2018s from an external source and is deliberate.\u201d, Dialga said at a rapid fire speed, \u201cThe anomaly cannot be resolved no matter what method I tried. Thr<br>\r\nE repercussions are serious and could jeopardize both of our lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of your weariness was instantly gone, replaced with full on panic. There\u2018s something that Dialga cannot resolve on his own? That\u2018s a pretty big problem if a Legendary Pokemon is unable to solve it? What could cause such distress from Dialga? This. Is. Bad!!! You are increasingly getting concerned for the Pokemon when you remembered when you\u2019re monitoring his body he told you that you won\u2018t have to face any major problems during your stay. But now that something out of your expectation has happened, you don\u2018t know what to do next. You tried your best to remain calm and rational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDialga, please calm down. What exactly happened?\u201d, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon took several deep breathes and spoke in a calmer and slower voice: \u201cI was performing a routine check of my body as I normally do everyday. When I started the scanning program, several alert messages popped up indicating that my body security has been compromised. This has never happened. How could I be so careless?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga did his best at being melodramatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs the problem severe and where can I find it?\u201d, you asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem has been located in my Temporal Region. I detected a deliberate alteration of key data and I suspect that Palkia is probably involved. If this is his idea of a prank, I\u2019ll.....grrrr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly does the Temporal Region do.\u201d, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt\u2018s an organ that deals with controlling the flow of time. If left unfixed, it could change the definition of time; a second could become a century and years could become a mere nanosecond. It\u2018ll be complete disorder....\u201d, Dialga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great! Thanks to Palkia again. All of our lives would be ruined by such chaotic time. I, for one, don\u2018t want a lifespan of 15 minutes.\u201d, you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd there still more to that.......we have about an hour to fix things; missing the opportunity would mean a 140 year wait before conditions are right again.\u201d, Dialga warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness...could things get any worse?\u201d, you stuttered, \u201cThis timey wimey thing sure isn\u2018t your typical rocket science. A simple error and it\u2018ll snowball into something so unpredictable. I remembered the scientists called it \u2018chaos theory\u2019 or something. *sigh* Okay, Is there anything I could do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a solution\", Dialga said in a serious tone, \u201cBecause I\u2018m unable to fix this issue by my efforts only, I\u2018m giving you the mission of heading to the Temporal Region to check things out. You might have heard about that area on your first day in me; it\u2018s one of the places where you were restricted from entering. Now, I would like to make an exception to that.You are hereby granted permission to enter the Temporal Region to resolve the issue. Take extra precaution once you\u2018re there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow wow wow...Hold on for a second.... Doesn\u2018t that sounds sorta dangerous to go there unprepared?.....\u201d, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUnfortunately, it is. There is no time to train you. We have to go there at once. And I must warn you that going in there entails a great risk. That region is the source of my time bending and dimension-crossing powers. A lot of things that goes on in there will affect spacetime and existence. A mistake could result in the rewriting of history or changing laws of physics at best.. at worst, you could annilhilate numerous galaxies and civilization, possibly even yours.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze completely at Dialga\u2018s implication. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBu....but it kinda.....abrupt to ask me to perform such....delicate assignment. I\u2018m just merely a Pokemon trainer, not some temporal superhero. I don\u2018t want to be the one who single-handedly destroy ruin the universe for everyone. I\u2018m so afraid that I might fail., you said, \u201cI don\u2018t know if I can do it.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Dialga gave a slow sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might think that this is a very heavy responsibility that was abruptly given to you, but you must remember that I have carried it since the beginning of time. And controlling my powers isn\u2018t an easy feat as it seems.\u201d, the Pokemon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2018s easy for you to put it that way because you have billions of years of experience. I\u2018m completely new to this. A few days ago, I don\u2019t even know what \u2018time space\u2019 is.\u201d, you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me ask you something.\u201d, Dialga calmly replied, \u201cYour world and the universe still exists; everything goes on as usual, right? And you know why? Because I took the risk and challenge during all those millenias. I made countless decisions, some of them right while others don\u2018t work out so well. If I were to be afraid of failure and stalled my resolve, your world might be a very different place and you might not even exists. Are you willing to let everything you\u2019ve ever known disappear just because you think you can\u2018t do it? From what I\u2018ve heard, humans love to stand up to the most difficult of challenges and always find a way to a quandary. Do you think you\u2018re up to the mission?..... Take some time to think about it. I know it\u2018s a difficult dillema.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered the Temporal Pokemon\u2019s words for some time. Dialga words have a little hint of chastisement in them and it made you feel bad about backing away.You attempt to balance the risks and the potential reward from the mission. If I somehow failed, I guess it means that I possibly will kiss my world goodbye and welcome my life as the only human still \u2018alive\u2019 in a metaphysical sense. If things go that way, you wonder what will happen if you spend eternity in Dialga in a featureless void. You stopped yourself from thinking further in that unfathomable direction. Conversely, you have the perfect opportunity to demonstrate your skills and worth to Dialga. I can beat his expectation and make him eat his words. If I can impress him, maybe he\u2018ll open up more to me. He can tell me more about himself while I can share some from myself. If we get to understand more about one another, it will put us closer to our goals, closer to normalcy. After half an hour of deliberation, you made you\u2018re decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShow me the way to the Temporal Region.\u201d, you said decisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dialga smile at the human\u2018s thought which is strangely similar to what he had in mind despite not interferring with the human\u2018s thinking.<i>My words are having effect on the human. I kind of overdid it but we\u2018re achieving the desired results anyway. He sure likes to think a lot when he\u2018s making decisions, especially that stuck in a void part. Even I wouldn\u2018t to be stuck there, Dialga thought. He\u2018s kinda cute when he does that. Especially when he goes in the absurd or silly direction of thinking. Strangely, I\u2018ve recently grown to like this human trainer more and more. I can\u2018t really pinpoint it. Is it his character? His occasional silliness? Or is it because he\u2018s what I could have been like if I didn\u2018t have to manage this whole time space thing? How I wish that we could do a body swap, human. I seriously need a break from everything. No one else knows how serious or frankly, boring and crappy, my job can be sometimes......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow,  be ready for some mind-blowing stuffs, human.</i> </span></div></div>",

This reinforces your supposition of the organ itself being very important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, Dialga, but what will I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around and try to find something that looks like it shouldn't happen. Then notify me. I'll tell you how to fix it. However, remember that there is a time limit before...\" Dialga stops talking, his silence says all you needed to hear. The vault in front of you opens, and you're soon entering the tunnel behind it. Everything is made of the same steel, and you feel cold. This place looks almost invulnerable, how could Palkia affect it? Maybe it is different in the outside, but you doubt it. You keep walking, until you reach a wide space. You notice you're standing on a stone platform very similar to the one that you had stood on when you had arrived to Dialga's dimension. Around you there is a purple fog, which blocks your sight. You can only see a few steps around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, this fog really will make all harder\" you say, hoping that the Pok\u00e9mon can do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is another of the protections I had in place. I'll remove it\" In matter of seconds, the fog is gone, although there is still a lot on the edges of the platform itself. You suppose there is a reason for that. Above you, there is a timer. \"When the timer above you reaches zero, then nothing you do will help. The changes has to be reversed before time is over\" The timer indicates there are around 45 minutes left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the platform, you see a blue spot on the distance. You start walking towards it, but Dialga stops you. \"Wait, human. I need you to do something. Please walk as fast as you can near the edges of the platform, and examine the fog. If you see something you suspect shouldn't be there, tell me\" You don't discuss Dialga's instructions, he knows of this much more than you do. Keeping in mind the timer, you run to the edge, and start going through the path indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick fog looks almost like a wall, purple forms moving over and over. It is almost hypnotizing, and you sometimes have a hard time focusing. When you have been walking for a while, you see something you suspect shouldn't be happening. There is a whirlpool or something on the fog, much bigger than you. Near it, there are also several, of different sizes. \"I think I found it, Dialga. There are some odd whirlpools here\" you say, while you keep walking. There are around thirty, in different points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...what I thought. Palkia really must have destabilized the structure of time. Listen human, go to the center. You'll see a blue sphere. You'll have further instructions once you get there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking to the center of the platform, without wasting any time. You reach a sphere, almost as big as you. It is blue, and keeps rippling, forming waves on it. It is like water condensed, but you have the feeling it is something much more surreal. Then you see whirlpools. There are thirty or so as well. It doesn't take you long to know that it is related to the ones you had seen on the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fog is literally the fabric of time. This sphere is what controls it. What I need you to do is...to fix it. I would do it by myself, but I'm fixing a lot of time stuff out here. Once you fix it, the problems outside should stop as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to glance to the timer above the entrance. There are like fifteen minutes left. \"How do I do it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick your arms, and try to grab some of the substance inside it, in the bottom. Then try to fill the whirlpools with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds easy enough\" you said, honestly expecting something harder. Dialga hadn't finished talking, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing, human, is that...you'll feel a lot of pain. And if you have are touching the sphere when the timer gets to zero...you have a very high risk of dying\" This lowers your confidence. Your own life...being risked in exchange of trying to prevent something huge. You think it for a minute or so, before replying you would do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seems to be rather touched by your courage. \"Okay. Start now\" he says, and you, after taking a deep breath, start touching the sphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As I expected. He is really doing it. Now to see if he is capable of doing it successfully. Of course, I'll be able to revert the changes after he is done and out. Now, if he can do it...then it'll be time to start his own training by giving him some of my own powers...a small part of them, of course. The pool I had stopped him from entering a few days ago should do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, human. Do it!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>I can feel it. That courage emanating from the human. It feels like a bright beacon within the gales of 'despair'. It\u2018s one of the defining characteristics of humans and many Pokemons. I find that to be one of the interesting similariies between us. We are willing to put aside fear and push our abilities to the maximum. It's a driving force behind every action, decision, and desire. How that courage is used depends greatly on who is using it. Some used it to achieve noble acts of justice, others used it to force their darkest thoughts upon the unsuspecting. In the case of this trainer, I feel a powerful sense of duty within him: to \"restore\" the stability of time and the universe. Even though this whole thing is fabricated, I could very well see the human do the same if it were to actually happen. The \u2018risks\u2019 of death is great but he still remains unfaltered. Speaking of that, I wish that Palkia could learn a thing or two from him. Let\u2018s see how well the trainer handle this.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain......That was the first thing you could think of the moment your finger came in contact with the sphere. You screamed loudly at the sudden jolt running down your nerves, spreading gradually like an expanding inferno crawling over every inch of your body. The blue sphere, apparently sensing your hand, started glowing brighter and swirled with a multitude of colors. It's a beautiful sight if not for the importance of your mission and the numbing pain. The sensation can be described as a cross between pins and needles and electric shock, only much more intense. The pain pushed you toward the brink of unconsciousness and overwhelmed your mind with random images and thoughts that you've never seen before. You didnt\u2018t pay enough attention to see what they are. You had expected something far less excruciating than Dialga had implied but the Pokemon didn't exactly elaborate on that. You quietly cussed at both the pain and Dialga and hoped that this will be over soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing the best to move your hand in the sphere, you grasped something solid within it. You quickly withdrew your hand from the sphere and the pain disappeared almost immediately. In your hand, you see something that resembles smoke but acts like a solid. It has a bluish aura with the consistency like that of a water balloon. Every time you squeezed the stuff, it dissipated into the surrounding but reforms itself in your hand once you loosened your grasp. Suddenly, you feel the surrounding distort a little. The Temporal Region fades around you replaced with the enviros of outer space.There was another series of images flashing before you. This time you see scenes of destruction of stars, planets and galaxies. You see them literally evaporating into nothingness. In it\u2018s place is a black void that expands and swallow everything in its path. There was a bright flash and you found yourself back in the chamber. The sight troubles you greatly. Is that what could happen in the imminent future?, you thought. How you handle the substance could very well affect what happens in those visions. Every minute passed will accelerate the effects of the distortion. There is no time to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly took the substance to the edge and threw it into one of the whirlpools. The thing splashed down into the fog and did nothing at first. Just when you\u2018re doubting the efficacy of the substance, a dim glow starts to form at the center of the whirlpool. Suddenly like an intense chemical reaction, you see sparks and fires flying in the whirlpool. Sounds of explosions and electricity filled the room. Some of the sparks managed to land on you and caused an ice cold sensation wherever it hits. You look on as the substance took effect and gradually shrinks the whirlpool until it is no longer there. The area of the fog has smoothen and settled. You see another vision of stars and planets returning to a small portion of the expanse. This is a sign that the particular region has stablized. You smiled at the effort but there is still work to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent an hour or two alternating between pain from grasping the sphere and the cold sparks of the whirlpools. The elimination of each additional whirpool lifts up your optimism and the prospect of earning praise from Dialga. It isn\u2018t exactly comfortable but you aren\u2018t gonna quit saving time just because you dislike the experience. But performing such daunting task has taken a toll on your energy. Halfway through, you felt sleepy and on the verge of collapsing. Each time, you recalled what Dialga has told you and mustered enough energy to carry on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing more of the substance over the last whirlpool and watched it disappear, you fell down upon your back and stared at the metallic lattice on the ceiling. The task has finally been complete and the impossible has become possible. You saved the universe, your world, and multiple dimensions. Every part of your body aches from the mission. I did it, Dialga......I did it......Before you can finish the sentence, you fell asleep from exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga looked on at the sleeping human in his Temporal Region. The Pokemon used his power to transport the human back to his bedrrom and made sure he\u2018s comfortable.  <i>You have proven yourself, human. You are the person I\u2018ve been looking for a long time: The Wielder of the Legendaries. A new destiny lies ahead of you. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, a Pokemon watches Dialga from afar....<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n<i>Found you, Dialga. After tracking you for days, I have a fix on your location. You got me through that weird dimension of yours and got me in countless misunderstandings. I don\u2018t know where I should start on you but I promise you, it\u2018ll be painful. And also, I gotta see whether you are telling the truth abouth the human living in your body. That guy seems interesting. It\u2018s time for payback. Heh heh heh</i> </span></span></div></div>",

You're back in your room. Suddenly the memories of what you went through comes back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga?! Did I do it right? Is there a catastrophe?!\" you shout to the top of your lungs, before noticing that everything was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it bravely, human. You fixed it correctly. You definitely have the traits everybody should have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you're relieved, then flattered to hear such words about you. You smile sheepishly before replying that it was nothing, just something you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, human, what you did goes beyond than what almost anybody would have done. It was on par to what the Legendaries would have done. Well, maybe not Palkia. He's a different case\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is\" you say. You try to stand, and find that you're pretty much okay. No pain at all. \"So, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga stays in silence while he seems to meditate the next thing he'll say. \"Listen, there is something special about you. Something that no other human has. Maybe it wasn't just Palkia what brought you to me, maybe fate helped as well. You're destined for great things, but you have the last word. You can't reach your destiny unless you fully embrace it\" your host says, talking very clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What destiny is it?\" you ask, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter, and I'll tell you what I mean\" the capsule once again stops in your room. You enter, and it once again starts moving without you doing a thing. While you're being carried to an unknown destination, Dialga starts talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between us Legendaries, there is lore as well, not only about us, but about the other beings in the universe. One of these stories talked about a human, one human who stood over the rest, and it pretty much worked as some sort of...pseudo-legendary, in close cooperation with Pok\u00e9mon like me and Palkia. The other Legendaries would consider him as part of the group, despite not being of the same origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I found you, I asked Mew information about your species, and remembered that myth. You don't fit all the traits the story has, but no story is perfect. I'm sure it is you, and I intend to take you through the path that would make you the human of the story. We called it \"The Wielder of the Legendaries\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait...are you saying...that I'm going to be that?\" you say softly, stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If you wish to. As I said, you would work with Palkia and me, mostly. As such, the Wielder of Legendaries has some Time and Space powers. Now I'll provide you with weak Time powers, which will gradually get stronger, if you truly wish to be the one. Let's go for steps, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time powers...what is it? And how would you give me powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll start with the easy stuff: stopping time for mere seconds. Then from there I'll train you to be able to do more complicated and important stuff, until you're at the peak of your powers. Then we'll see if Palkia will cooperate to provide the other half of your powers. As to how you'll receive them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe capsule opens, and you realize it had stopped. You step out of the capsule, and see that you're in the room with the pools. You don't understand why you're there, until you see the sparkly pool at the bottom of the room, which was out of your limits. Could it be that it was the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you enter that pool, you'll gain them. Tomorrow we'll start your training\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, after this, do I go to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is too early. If you wish to, you may go and explore more. Do what you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and stand on a side of the pool. The whole thing makes you nervous. You didn't seem like you were nervous, but you really were doubting if it was the right thing. What if you royally screwed up? You don't want to think of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here I go\" you say loudly, and start entering the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar, another Pok\u00e9mon was observing Dialga. She really needed a good revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a good amount of time, the Pok\u00e9mon had an idea. However, if she were to do it, she would need help. After all...it was something impossible for her. But with the right cooperation...with that in mind, she messaged a fellow Legendary Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Raikou? Raikou, I need your help. I plan a revenge on Dialga.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">He really had it coming, didn't he? I have been keeping track of all his antics.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Yeah...I have something in mind, but I can't do it. Maybe you know somebody who can!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">What do you need?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Somebody...small, or who can shrunk itself. Resistant. Also, whoever you choose, must be able to infiltrate that dragon's body, and inflict pain from the inside. Not enough to really hurt him, but enough to be a real bother and a pain in his ass. Just what he deserves</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Ah! You don't need anybody special. I can think of one...it is more of a common species, but it should be good enough. Small, and doubt he'll notice it entering. And will be very annoying, and there is almost no way for Dialga to get rid of it. Do you have a plan of how to send it to his body?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Dialga will eat anything. That should be the way</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\"><br>\r\nSounds good! However, there is something you should know...there is a human living inside. I'll add instructions so the human doesn't get hurt</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">I knew that. You do it. </span> So Raikou knew about it as well. That made the chances of it being true bigger, but she wanted a more reliable source of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Meet me in an hour or two. I'll have convinced it from doing it. It shares my elemental type, so it shouldn't be hard.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Wait, what do you plan? I want to know if it is what I need</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Keldeo was the one to tell me about them. I have now studied that species, and I know it is the best for this. Have you, by any chance, heard of the Joltik species?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune smiled. She knew very few things about them, but it did felt like the right help for the job. She left the place, ready to start her own side of the plan. Food to camouflage the little bug.</span></div></div>",

As your feet submerged within the bright blue water, the tingling feeling of electricity traveled up your body. In contrast with the shocks you endured in the Temporal Region, the energy here felt a lot more gentle and made you more vigorous as a portion of Dialga's power is transferred to you. It is hardly believable but a Legendary Pokemon has just shared his abilities with you. The fact that you're part of a Pokemon's legend still need some getting used to. What makes your current state truly incredible is that Dialga and his friends seem to believe that you are some kind of chosen one, a \"trainer\" to them perhaps, who'll lead them into a new era. This isn't some common occurrence. Under normal circumstances, asking a Legendary Pokemon to grant you his/her power is a surefire way to get yourself in trouble. In Dialga's case, he'll probably send you to some bizarre world to serve serve as a punishment for such intrusion and that's just taking it easy. You shook your head as your thoughts veered off topic again. The answer to my eventual role will soon unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good five minutes later, Dialga tells you that the process is complete and tells you to exit the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now bestowed with some Time power, human. .\", Dialga said, \"You can now stop time for about 5 seconds and make minuscule alteration to space. With such powers available, you can perform some more important duties for me. Some of which will include helping me locate any anomaly in time and learning more about the nature of your new-found powers through on-site experience. Once you're skilled enough, we can move on to the next level of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like some cool stuffs. I always wanted to see what it's like to be able to manipulate time.\", you commented, \"But...won't handing me such power cause any problems? You know, disrupting the balance of time and ending up like that close call induced by Palkia. Doesn't that worry you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to worry, human.\", the Pokemon replied, \"Several safeguards are in place and I won't let you do anything too risky. Besides, your powers are still too minuscule to affect space time in any significant ways. You have a tendency of overthinking any given problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear. I'm just a bit more careful when it comes to making decisions. So, what are we supposed to do now?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start our training tomorrow. For today, you can do whatever exploring you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Dialga. I'll do my best to fulfill my new role. Any area in particular you'd like to show me?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\nOn the other side, Suicune continues to observe Dialga and plan for the big revenge on him. It's been some time since she last messaged Raikou and he hasn't replied back when he told her he'll be looking for a Joltik. Suicune became a little desperate and messaged the Electric Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Raikou, any luck at finding a Joltik willing to perform this task? We've gotta hurry. Dialga could jump dimensions again and we'll lose track.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">So far, I haven't gotten any luck in that. Things aren't going as smoothly as planned, Suicune. The Joltiks are well-known to be elusive. The few I managed to find either outright refused to be \"eaten\" or make outlandish demands of giving them all the Rare Candy we can find so they could evolve. They are very insisting. I try to ask a few more of them. If none of the Joltiks are willing to help us, I guess you probably have to come up with a better plan or wait until next time to seek your revenge.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME, RAIKOU?!!! Are you really suggesting that we give up? Dialga is one of the most annoying idiot I've met and you have no idea of the full extent of the damage he's done to me. I don't care what it'll cost me, just find a freaking way to inflict harm on Dialga. I have this planned for so long and there is no way I'm GIVING UP! DO YOU HEAR ME, RAIKOU, I... WANT.. MY... REVENGE... NOW!!! Just think about something, okay.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, wow....wow...Easy there, Suicune. Calm down and think about it. If we move forward so brashly, we could harm the human inside. Don't you want to know more about the human? Isn't that one of the reasons you're here?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">.......You're right. I got a little too caught up in my personal grudge with Dialga. It's just that the many pranks he's down on me has affected my standing badly. It took me weeks to clear myself of that rumor that I have a crush on him.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">So he's the one spreading that message around. Dialga probably had fun at your expense. I'm curious, Suicune. How did you two first met? And do you really have feeling for him?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">You better stop asking those questions before I consider you my No.2 enemy. What options do we still have?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">You wouldn't believe it.....One of the Joltiks just offered to shrink us down. That way, we'll be able to enter Dialga and execute our plans. What did you think of that?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">O_0 Entering Dialga? I had enough of him when I'm out here. To think that I have to enter his body....urghh.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">It's the only choice we've got now. If we dither any further, Dialga will be traveling again. We got to make a decision quick, remember.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">It seems that destiny has a strange way of playing tricks on me, as that Pokemon used to say. Alright, let's get everything ready in half an hour. And please take Keldeo along with you, he's been hanging out with Dialga a lot lately and must know some info. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Got it. Let's meet at the lakeside 30 minutes from now. Should all things go as planned, we'll be in him within an hour.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clblue\">I'm about to enter the body of the Pokemon I hat the most. A truly bizarre turn of events.....I may have a slight miscalculation at Plan A, Dialga, but I got the perfect Plan B to deal you.........</span></i></span></div></div>",

After you asked him for a recommendation, he had commented that there was a place he thought you would like. You entered and encountered a room, with bright colors and steel decorations. A counter, several stools, and a TV on a corner. It reminded you of a bar, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on a stool, and waited to see what happened. In front of you, on the counter, a screen appeared, and turned on. It seemed like some sort of menu, listing a series of drinks and similar stuff. You decide to at least enjoy whatever the place had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen disappeared, sinking into the counter. Minutes later, the portion of the counter that was gone reappeared, this time with a large cup with what you had chosen. You calmly took it, and asked the question you had intended to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you want me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should relax. I thought you may need some time to just sit and let it go before you explore. After all, there is still time. You have a nice handful of hours left in your day\" Dialga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, accepting it. Maybe it is really for the best to actually just hang out, finish your drink, maybe talk a little. There was no hurry to get anywhere. Besides, with your training, your job (which you weren't sure if you wold continue doing) and the nights, you wouldn't have very much time left in the next days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly drank the contents of the cup, while watching the TV. Apparently it was a screen to see outside. Dialga was in a different dimension than the one you had seen when you were outside of him. It looked similar to your own, but it had several things that hinted it wasn't the dimension you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is amazing what those little bugs can do for one when it doesn't involve being eaten\" Raikou said, finally shrunken along with Suicune. There was also an huge fruit in front of them. Suicune had brought it, and one of the Joltiks was kind enough to create a small hole in it where the two legendary Pok\u00e9mon could hide while Dialga ate the fruit. Raikou was looking around, clearly amused by the change of size, while Suicune was already entering into the hole. \"Will you stop fooling around and get in? Dialga can get here in any moment. I told him to come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. Don't you think we would feel if he did?\" Raikou replied, with the tone he always used when somebody else didn't realize something obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't only for that. We also need to discuss what we'll do inside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you got me to do all this and you didn't even have a concrete plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune was clearly taken aback by those words, her attitude momentarily extinguished. Raikou continued \"If it weren't because this is a trip that will be great for my own knowledge about Dialga, I wouldn't be part of this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in here. Now\" Suicune said, starting to lose her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been watching the TV, from time to time exchanging words with Dialga. He had commented that Suicune had wanted to talk to him in person, and that he was walking towards the meeting point. You had warned him that it could involve one nasty payback from Suicune, but you yourself were curious as to what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga finally arrived to the place, but neither you or the dragon saw Suicune anywhere. You were about to comment that maybe she was hiding to unleash her water powers on your host, but then he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she had to leave on an emergency, but she left that fruit as some sort of apology\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" That really seemed suspicious. \"Be careful. Who knows what that fruit may be spiked with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being too paranoid, human. She may be disgruntled with me, but she wouldn't try\" You had a much different opinion of Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be ready, Raikou, he is here!\" Suicune whispered. Raikou seemed frightened, despite being calm earlier. Maybe he was just realizing the magnitude of what was about to happen. \"Remember what we discussed. Also, remember to not to touch anything. We want to cause him pain, but not to leave lasting wounds or something grave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be the one to say that\" Raikou muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Dialga leaned down to eat the fruit. Raikou and Suicune braced themselves for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune and Raikou felt the fruit being lifted by the Temporal Pokemon with tremendous speed, causing both Pokemons to brace themselves to the wall. But even that was useless against the sheer strength of the now-giant Dialga. The swishing action caused several more cracks and holes to form on the flesh of the hollow fruit. Both Suicune and Raikou became increasingly covered in fruit pulps and thick strands of Dialga's saliva. Even inside the fruit, they could still feel Dialga's powerful tongue rolling and playing with them. The Aurora Pokemon was soon hoping for an end to the dizzying spin within the fruit. Shrinking down was one thing that escaped Suicune's mind when she meticulously plotted her scheme. And it's currently one of the least desirable way she wanted to go. She dislikes Dialga with a fiery passion that's better suited to a Fire Pokemon in contrasts with her auroral exterior. But Suicune still wanted to get even with him and confirm for herself the existence of the shrunken human. This better be worth the effort of entering this jerk, she thought.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n Outside, Dialga tasted at the fruit in his mouth hungrily. <i>mmmm...This fruit really tastes good. So sweet and smooth, better than any I've eaten so fa r. Wonder where Suicune got this from; such a delicious apology gift. Seriously, I never expected Suicune to be so generous with me. Normally, she would've already frozen my groin before she would remotely even think of apologizing. Did she finally realize how mean she's been all these times? Maybe she decided to be nice to me for a change. It might even be a sign that she's having feelings for me. Those dimensional adventures are probably growing on her. Soon, she'll probably drop that hard exterior of hers and reveal the benevolent and kind Pokemon she is. Suicune, you are such a strange girl!</i> Dialga swallowed the entire fruit without giving it much thought. When he gave it one last lick before sending the food down his throat, the Pokemon tasted something warm and furry but he didn't give much thought as he send the fruit to his stomach.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nSuicune felt the fruit slowly descending as if some force is slowing the fall. She asked Raikou about it. The Electric Pokemon explains that Dialga can control the force of gravity within his body according to need. He often uses this to slow down the tons of food that he takes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know this?\", Suicune asked, \"You can't possibly have been in his body before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I secretly observed Dialga every chance I got when he visits our normal dimension. A lot of his behavior can be inferred by his activities throughout a single day and from what he told us and others.\",  Raikou answered, \"Trust me, he is one of the most 'unique' subject I've come across. Combine that with the info he confides to me as a friend and we have a database. Dialga's power consists of the ability to regulate time and existence. Much of the world we see now is an indirect result of the countless little fights between Dialga and Palkia. They used to fight over trivial stuffs like who gets to eat first or who should be guarding the world on a given day. It's during those fights that both of their power collided several times to form the land we walk on and perhaps, you and me. Things are a little better now, but they still fight on occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Strange yet intriguing\", Suicune whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not only that. What I find most interesting is his relation with Palkia. That Pokemon is a tad more irresponsible and petulant in using his abilities than Dialga. With much of the space time duty falling on Dialga, Palkia got bored quickly and started using his powers for random stuffs. He caused the destruction of mountain ranges, oceans, and other stuffs merely because he wanted to try out his powers. These two still don't get along really well as Dialga often have to clean up after him for every misuse and Palkia always has an innovative way of justifying his so-called pranks. The alleged shrunken human is most certainly another such incident. Observing Dialga is a difficult task and I've come close to being discovered numerous times. I know that it will endanger my friendship with him but as a Pokemon who's dream is to pursue knowledge,  it's a little risk worth taking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou, I think you're going into bookworm mode again.\", Suicune said flatly, \"Could you ever speak a complete sentence in Pokemon for once or even talk about something other than knowledge and science?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowledge controls everything, Suicune. Speaking of that, do you think we'll get to meet the human? I have tons of questions to ask him.\", Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on whether Dialga is telling the truth. Even if he does exists, we don't know where his loyalty lies.\", Suicune replied with a tone of doubt, \"We'll see if we can get him to our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 10-minute ride later, the fruit descended into Dialga's stomach with a splash into the water. Both Pokemon climbed out the hole and walked to the edge of the stomach where there are several holes. With glowing blue stripes and metallic linings. The stomach was more like a metallic tank than flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeee, what has Dialga been eating? All I can see are slimes, metals, and random colorful stuffs. His interior is sure worse than what's outside.\", Suicune cringed in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually. This is what digested food look like in the stomach, even yours.\", Raikou explain as matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being smartass with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune went ahead and took a closer look at one of the goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Okay, looks like we for many holes to choose from here. We aren't sure where they may take us to.\", Suicune said, \"So I think it is best if we split up and find our way through Dialga.\", Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....I don't think that is such a good idea. What if something happens to any one of us? You see, we aren't sure what sorts of protection system Dialga has set up in here. If we trip one of those, the consequences are unknown. It's best if we stick together. Plus, we need to safeguard the wellbeing if the shrunken human. I don't want anything bad to happen to him.\", Raikou commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Fine. Just let me handle this myself. You aren't known for your sense of adventure or bravery anyway . I really understand your concern, Raikou, but playing safe won't really get you anywhere. The more dangerous a situation, the more I want to risk it. And about that human, if he can endure and  survive in this excuse of a Legendary, there's no need for concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Suit yourself.\", Raikou said. He was slightly hurt by Suicune's implied jab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you say you are a bit familiar with Dialga, right? Any plans on where we should invade first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're looking to inflict the worst pain possible, there are two places we can start at: it's either the brain or the private. No living thing could could endure the feel when either one of those part is hurt.\", Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if we simultaneously attack both?\", Suicune smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I don't want to be the one to find out about that. It will be the most traumatizing technique ever devised. But if that's what you planned to do, I suggest that you can head to the brain to do the freezing while I head down to give the 'batteries' a good recharge. What do you think, Suicune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Let's get moving. Raikou, you head through the last hole while I take the first. I'll also look for the human for your research along the way.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suicune entered without a single doubt in her plans, while Raikou seemed like he would take his time to get to his destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was Suicune's impatience, but to her it seemed like the trek through Dialga's body was one of the largest in her life. Besides, she didn't really like the place, and it kinda bothered her that it was possible that, inside her, it was the same. She wanted to be done with what she came for, and get out of there as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, she received messages from Raikou. Apparently he was enjoying greatly the whole thing, and always informed Suicune about curious stuff he encountered or glimpsed on his path. The Aurora Pok\u00e9mon ignored those messages, frustrated that her partner wouldn't focus on the important point of their visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Suicune arrived to a dead end. In front of her she could see a much more illuminated hall, which could only take to the head. Suicune smirked, satisfied. However, there seemed to be some sort of invisible protection that didn't let her enter. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't find a way to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm stuck</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Stuck? How is that? Where are you?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm here at the brain, but I can't enter.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">I supposed this wouldn't be easy. We're talking about practically the most important part of this Pok\u00e9mon, leaving the time powers aside. I would be more surprised if you could just enter</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">There must be a way for me to sneak in!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">Maybe once I start with my part of this plan, the defense on the brain will diminish enough for you to make a quick entrance. The sudden shock of it happening should be enough. Heh, I said shock, because you know, I'm going to-</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">It could work. Are you where you're supposed to be?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. I'm ready. This isn't a place I'd like to spend a vacation in, but I can't complain. I'll start now. Be ready to enter the brain, if you can</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune got herself ready to sprint towards the barrier, then she realized she had no idea how she would know when Raikou started shocking the dragon's private parts. Suddenly, everything shook violently. At first she was startled, but then her instincts took over, and she ran forwards. She crashed against the barrier, but with some effort, she managed to slip in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm in.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Dialga definitely noticed what I did. I think he fell down.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">Continue every once in a while. I'll do my own part</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings definitely weren't looking good for Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking through one of the many passages inside Dialga, when you felt the violent convulsions his host had. After tumbling around, confused, you finally decided to call Dialga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did just happen? You could have warned me first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I-I-I just felt...agh, I don't know how to describe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I felt sudden pain in my...in my...eh...\" Dialga doubted for a moment. He clearly didn't expect to be telling the human about this kind of problems -\"In my reproductive system\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent for a moment, assimilating what your host said. -\"Want me to go check if there is a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dialga doesn't say a thing, you continue: -\"I'm supposed to be solving your problems here. If there is something I can do, then let me do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...go ahead\" Dialga seemed something touched by your words. You were taking this seriously. You start walking, when Dialga once again seems to stammer in pain. You grab a wall just in time to avoid falling again. -\"More pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have the worst migraine in seven dimensions now!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a headache, and from the looks of it, a very strong one. Could Dialga have a disease or something? -\"What feels more urgent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know which one is worse...both are equally painful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you got two places to check, each one in almost opposite sides, and with very different functions. You clearly had to decide which emergency you would clear first. Another cry of pain from Dialga made it clear it had to be quick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pain that Dialga is enduring is excruciating. At this point, the Temporal Pokemon has been reduced to cringing on the ground and shouting out what sounds like obscenities in his language. Although he repeatedly insist that he can't explain what caused his privates and head to start hurting so much, you suspect it had something to do with that fruit Dialga ate. I warned him that there is something funny about a fruit that's left on the forest ground, you thought. Random fruits left out in the open for no reason (despite Dialga's belief that it Suicune's apology gift) aren't a good sign. You suddenly began to worry if Dialga had eaten something poisonous or perhaps another perilous attempt by Palkia to \"amuse\" Dialga. Another groan of pain echoed throughout the body, snapping you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga, I think that your pains has something to do with that fruit you ate.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....the fruit?......\", Dialga barely acknowledged, \"But I tasted nothing wrong with it. Is it...... infested with some molds...ugh... or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious, Dialga.\", you warned, \"The fruit you ate is possibly poisonous. I'm not clear about what's toxic to Legendary Pokemons but it could be fatal if the poison is not promptly neutralized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poison does not affect my body. I'm mostly metal and temporal material, remember?\", Dialga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not poison, then I'm not sure what could cause the pains.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......SUICUNE!\", Dialga screeched, \"It has to be her. That sly...aghhh ....must've decided to play some nasty trickery....ahhhh. Come out. I know you're watching this somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....Why would Suicune do this? It's doesn't sound like something a Legendary Pokemon of her status would do. Even though you previously mentioned that she is distrusting of you and brash at times, I has no reason to believe that she would attempt something so dangerous.\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've...never..ughhh seen her......aghhh...true color. Suicune's a lot more calculating....than she seems. Why would...you do this to me, Suicune?\"\", Dialga moaned. <i>When.....I find her, that tomboy's going to...cosmic limbo. How I wished I had locked her in the 11th dimension for kicking my rear end that one time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Calculating...plan.....The grand plan for Dialga....Payback!!!...</i>, you suddenly had an epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the dots are connected and you realized that this is a part of Suicune's grand scheme; her ultimate big revenge against Dialga for ruining her reputation and his unsolicited advances. You remembered that Suicune told you to be prepared for something big. This got to be it. After all the troubles he had caused for the Aurora Pokemon, Dialga deserved every single moment of this. Recalling what Suicune instructed you to do, all you have to do now is feign ignorance and play along with her and intensify Dialga pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not throw wild accusations around first.\", you said as calmly as possible, \"Before we find any evidences that this is Suicune's doing, we'll assume that this is just a very bad case of headache and groin pain. Just think about it, maybe she genuinely left the fruit as an apology without knowing that it's tainted. Or she failed to take into account the differences of Pokemon physiology. That is, what is a delicacy for Suicune might actually cause a stomach upset for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You have a point.....ugahh.\", Dialga replied begrudgingly, \"As much as I hate it, you make sense sometimes. I'll just forget about Suicune for the moment and temporarily accept this \"apology\" she left me. So, where are you checking first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me go check out your privates first.\", you said, trying to sound concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But......it's kinda the place you wouldn't want to be. It's just my reproduction organ that also functions as a power source.\", Dialga said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The problem down there could be worse than in your brain; a migraine is a common occurrence everyone has once in a while. But if it hurts down there....things could be very bad. It could jeopardize your chance of finding a mate.\", you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp*....no....oh please no....\", Dialga whimpered, \"Not my reproductive system.... It's not even used once..........An eternal life without a mate and pleasure is the worst possible thing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe the best thing for the Pokemon race.</i> You have no idea why but Dialga's cry sounds like music to your ear. Maybe it's because you're just a bit sadistic or you find comfort in the fact that you are administering justice. You know that Suicune would love to see this play out and she'll be the happiest Pokemon right now if she's beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.....ugh....stop the pain....\", Dialga cried, \"I don't care if....... Suicune or some other random Pokemons is behind this. Just find......a freaking way... to make it stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll see if I can find out what's the problem down there. I'll do whatever I can to fix it.\", you said with a smirk while Dialga wailed at the next wave of pain. <i>Or maybe, I should add to it......</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started the walk down the path that leads to the lower half of Dialga's body.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<b>Down at the reproductive organ</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, Suicune. How's thing going up there?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Oh my....this is so priceless, Raikou. You just missed Dialga crying about losing his legendary balls. The most melodramatic yet.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Glad to hear are plans are having effects. So what exactly is the next part of our plan?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"> As for the next step is to find a way to control Dialga by overriding his brain. I plan on giving a him a taste of his own medicine.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">I would say that runs a greater risk of being detected by Dialga. And do you even know how to control Dialga?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Stop worrying! I'll learn along the way once I get in the brain center. Plus, I having so much fun up here. Checking out all the apparatuses and stuffs. Most of all, I confirmed the existence of the shrunken human by looking at some memories. But here's also something very interesting I found. Dialga seems to have this human under constant surveillance. All I need you to do is intensify your voltage on his balls and give'em a good jolt. I bet it'll be enough to cause a system crash up here.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Ow! Sounds painful.......wait, what surveillance?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Yea, this weirdo has records of all the human's locations, thoughts, dialogs, and what he's seeing right now. He's heading down to investigate the pains we caused. The screen for the human is showing a tunnel or something.</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Kinda intrusive but also cool if you ask me. I always wanted to explore a Pokemon's deepest thoughts. Maybe I can start with you, Suicune.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">What was that?!! You're inviting me to freeze your balls as well, right? This freak is enough of a problem already. Get back to work.....</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Whatever you say. Hope your plan doesn't actually cause actual harm to either Dialga or the human.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued down the path that leads to Dialga's private. If the bundle of wires along the wall is any indication, you're pretty close. You wondered how did Suicune inflict pain at two places at a time. An admirable feat for her. Soon enough, the walkway opens into a multi-floored chamber. Circular in shape, it houses two large transparent cylinders that glows blue. The wires from the walkway connects to both ends of the cylinder. No doubt those are Dialga's batteries, literally, for lack of better description. As you circled around the room, you heard the distinct buzz of electricity that seems out of place for the location. That must be the cause of Dialga's throbbing pain, you thought, Is something wrong with his power source? You quickly walk around the cylinder, closer to the source of the sound.</span></div></div>",

You want to at least know what is wrong before you do a thing. However, you definitely don't plan to reveal that Suicune is the culprit behind all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly see a quadrupedal figure, with yellow fur, an odd purple mane and a mask-like face, using its powers against the batteries. You really didn't expect to see Raikou shrunken, much less inside Dialga, and much less doing something like causing severe pain in the nether regions of the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was true! Suicune just confirmed it, but it is good to see by myself that there is a human living inside Dialga\" you hear Raikou say, when he finally notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?!\" you whisper, trying to not to be heard by Dialga \"I thought Suicune was the one behind this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune is in here, too. She is carrying her revenge. I'm just helping her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge? I was right, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you'll stop us now\" Raikou says, while stopping using his electric powers. You move your image to hint that you won't. Raikou's eyes widen, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I have heard, Dialga deserves this. In that case, I want to help. However, it is also my responsibility to make it stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou seems to smile. He clearly didn't expect your attitude towards all of this. \"Okay, I think I know what you can do. Near here I think I had seen a lot metallic rods, possibly for maintenance matters in this place\" he says, while looking at the opposite direction. You faintly see an huge stack of rods. \"I know how my electricity works, so this is what we're going to do:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake several of these rods, and stick them into the base of these cylinders. Once you have done that, I want you to go around Dialga's reproductive system.  Stick rods in vulnerable spots, such as flesh, or similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're done, I'll channel some electricity into several of these rods. If I do it correctly, the electricity should be going back and forth between all the rods scattered in the system. I won't even need to continue streaming electricity, the cylinders will provide a good amount of it. I need to rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You picked up one of the rods on the floor and carried them over to the base of the cylinders. As easy as it sounds, it still took you a lot of efforts to move just one of the lengthy rods. They must have weigh twice as heavy as your are. The slippery surface of the floor isn't making it any easier. You looked at Raikou who is eying you curiously and trying to observe your every move. Despite the Electric Pokemon's stoic expression, his glimmering ruby eyes revealed his barely contained excitement. You can almost see sparks of electricity swirling with admiration in them. <i>Looks like Raikou wants to do some research on my behavior and activity.</i>, you thought, <i>It feels kind of unnatural being watched the whole time. But I couldn't blame him for his curiosity, I mean.....how often do you get to meet a shrunken human?</i> With this new found alliance with Raikou, giving Dialga a miserable time will be far simpler. As much as you wish you could help him out of this, you decided that it's best to let things run its course. The Temporal Pokemon has dug himself into this hole and caused his own problems to snowball into its current unmanageable state. There is little sympathy you could give him. Plus, you could also get a good kick out of Dialga's upcoming woe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the base and found an excellent place to embed the metallic pole; right between the cylinders at a point where the pole can touch the wirings at both ends. You placed it there and make sure that it fits securely where you wanted it to go before going back to get more of the poles. Each time you carried one over, a strong sense of satisfaction brought a smile upon your face. You placed the poles in a crisscross pattern to maximize the areas touching the cylinders and inflict the most damage once Raikou puts electricity through them. The space around the cylinder were soon crammed full of the rods that it resembles a dense jungle gym more than a reproductive organ. You started to look for other areas for things to stick into. Despite the metallic interior, you still spot several soft parts that resembles flesh and a boxy structure connected to the two cylinders. Whatever that thing is, it must be important for Dialga. Those must be some kind of energy delivery system or regulator for a Pokemon with various electronic stuffs lying around in his body. <i>What will be Dialga's reaction if we managed to destroy his reproductive ability and his opportunity for offspring (if he ever finds a mate....or even exists)? Will he cry and be melodramatic like he typically does? Or will he go supernova and wipe out everything? Even if that results in Raikou, Suicune, and me being sent to dimensional inferno, it will be an answer worth finding out and know forever.</i>, you thought jokingly. Without hesitating, you rammed a couple of rods into the fleshy parts and surrounded the box with all the poles you have at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole operation took about an hour to complete. You let Raikou know about it and told him to unleash the strongest currents he got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, human. You don't have to tell me how to do it\", Raikou said confidently as he charges himself up, \"I have saved the perfect voltage for this occasion for quite some time and now..... please stay back a little and let my lightning show commerce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately see a glowing, white-hot bolt released from the clouds mane on the Pokemons back. The light generated temporarily blinds you as the ear-splitting sounds of thunder rumble overhead. With your hands over your eyes, you can make out the silhouette of Raikou directing the powerful bolt toward the rods you've set up with a fierce roar. It was a sight to behold! A Legendary Pokemon unleashing his full potential before your very eyes. You couldn't tell if you're standing in awe from the scene or from the stray electricity that has numbed your body. The moment the electricity came in contact with the rods, the spark jumps over all of the chamber and made the poles glow yellow. A loud buzz echoed throughout the chamber, creating a ominous fizzle, droning, and popping sounds. You dropped down and crotched in an attempt to avoid being affected by the electricity. You faintly smiled as your heard a familiar voice in the distance crying loudly in pain before being cut off.<br>\r\n______<br>\r\nOn the outside, Dialga was puzzled by the lack of response from the human. An hour has passed since the human promised him to relieve the pain in his groin which has only gotten worse since. Despite numerous repeated attempts, all efforts to reach the human has failed. When the Pokemon tried to activate the Human POV, Dialga realized his surveillance software in the human has also gone a bit glitchy because he couldn't see through his eyes or read his thoughts as if someone has disabled it. For a moment, the Pokemon feared that the human has discovered his covert monitoring. Dialga performed a system check and found the software to be in perfect order. It must be some electrical interference, he thought. He sighed and reminded himself to give Suicune a piece of his mind once the ordeal has ended. As Dialga wondered about what the human is currently doing, an immense pain shot up from his body and toward his brain. He didn't have time to react to the sudden spasm in his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"AH.......</b></font></font> <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"> <span class=\"cgreen\">[**DIALGA SYSTEM OVERLOAD**]   ---Error 4851++++  =initiating safe mode= &amp;/&amp;&amp;$$$&amp;,&amp;  Please input reboot time_</span></span><br>\r\n______<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes again, you see the electricity among the poles have become self-sustaining and actively arcing over each other. Raikou stood a couple of feet away from you with a wide smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked 'shocked', human.\",  he commented at your flabbergasted face, \"I bet you've never seen such a huge thunder like that before. I bet this shock has knocked Dialga out. The electricity will be self-sustaining and can only be stopped by me. It took nearly all of my reserve power but I'm proud about this feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......You should've warned me that your thunder shock will be this intense.\", you said, \"You could've electrocuted me and who knows what will happen if it goes that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, sorry about that. But that sure shows you 'the dynamics of electricity and it's effect on the reproductive system of a Pokemon'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a new research topic that you came up with or is it the beginning of another cheesy pun?\", you asked with an eyebrow raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little of both I guess.\", Raikou said, \"Anyway, I guess we're done here in the groin. Time to meet up with Suicune at the brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then. Better not keep a lady waiting.\", you said smirking back at the Electric Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree....\", Raikou whispered while trembling slightly, \"Never be on the receiving end of Suicune's wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you left Dialga's reproductive organ with the electricity still going strong.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first you thought of using the capsule, but seeing how Raikou and you messed with the electricity in the body, using it may not be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou nods, but seems to be thinking about something. \"What's wrong?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big feline didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Suicune, I have been thinking about this, and I think the best would be to tell him about what Dialga is doing</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">If you're willing to take that duty off my shoulders, go ahead.

Then I'll continue with my own fun, just what he deserves for being such an asshole</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou and you had walked silently for a while. This isn't how you expected some time with another Legendary would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...have you enjoyed your time around here? Have you explored a lot?\" Raikou seemed to want to start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't gone everywhere, there are a lot of places I haven't visited or don't really plan to visit, but it has been an interesting experience\" you reply, and you really mean what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou gives you an strange smile, or something similar. You aren't too sure about his expressions. \"How has Dialga treated you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he has been a nice host, and we get along nicely\" You decide to hide the fact that he gave you powers. It didn't seem like something to spread around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm...there is something you need to know about Dialga. He has been monitoring you very closely, maybe since you entered\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you didn't understand what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou then proceeds to tell you everything Suicune had seen up there. You are aghast at the revelation. How could Dialga do this to you? And why? You're shocked, but you can feel the rage bubbling inside you. Dilga indeed deserves everything that is happening now. You promise yourself that you're going to help Suicune and Raikou to get out without Dialga noticing, and to cause Dialga all the inconveniences that you can before they have to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're finally getting there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead and see an entrance. If you picked the right road, it should be the entrance to the brain. Raikou enters first. After some seconds, he peeks back into the tunnel. \"Yes, it is here. Suicune must be around\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter, and observe around. The steel walls aren't welcoming, and there are several tunnels, surely branching to different functions. You hear sounds coming from one of them. After getting to the end of the path, you find Suicune in front of a strange machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is the place I wanted the most. Time to do it\" she says to nobody maliciously. Then she notices Raikou and you. \"Hi human. Surprised to see me?\" she talks in a more friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and feel the need to assure her that you're on her side. \"I know, Raikou told me. Glad to have you on board. You arrived just in time to see me do this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll control Dialga's body. Do something first, then mess around. You'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after saying that, she stepped on a platform, part of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The platform containing Suicune formed several purple vines that adhere to her paws and body. When the vines started to brush against Suicune, the Pokemon gave a faint shriek. One of the tendrils extends itself to the front of her muzzle and grew into a bulb. You are reminded of the motion capture shirt with the microphone that you once saw in a documentary about movie production. Judging from it's appearance, it will function similarly. Several screens in front of the Aurora Pokemon began depicting views from the outside. You can see the forest and Dialga lying motionless on the ground, right where he ate the fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your gaze toward Suicune whose legs and body are now covered with vines. It somehow makes you think of a spandex. You shook your head and chided yourself for that thought. The controller she's using is completely different from the one you played with days ago. You're hoping that Suicune knows how to use the thing otherwise Dialga better ready himself for a bumpy ride. She seems to notice you watching her and gave a confident smile in return. Something about that grin assured you that Suicune had everything worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on to your butts, boys.\", said Suicune with a glint to her eyes, \"I'm about to take you all on a joyride. Today, you are all about to witness the first ever Pokemon-jacking in history. Dialga will rue the day that he ever crossed me. He can only watch in horror at the things I'm about to unleash on him and he has no ways to stop it. We're going to give him a threshing that he deserves so much. And you two \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou gave a holler of approval while you quietly watch on from your spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, why do these disgusting looking vines do, they're probably ruining my coat. I had about enough with these things...... I'm not exactly sure how to control this weirdo so you boys can look around here to figure out his brain while I play around with this.\", she said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\", Raikou acknowledged with a faux salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll be looking around to see if there is anything that I could do then.\", you said. You quietly hoped that Dialga won't suddenly restart himself and catch you all red-handed. But the thunder shock in his 'jewels' should keep him in check for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Suicune started moving her legs, causing the chamber to rumble. On the outside, the motionless body of Dialga started stirring. It looks as if Dialga is trying to stand up with all four legs spawned out, with his head bent at an awkward angle. To a spectator outside, Dialga look rather like a puppet being manipulated by an inexperienced person. For Suicune, it is like learning to walk all over again. <i>Hey the hell are you supposed to control this thing.</i>, Suicune thought as she fidgets around on the platform. The Pokemon caused Dialga to clumsily drag his feet around, making walking more like crawling. After several tries, Suicune managed to make the Temporal being stand up wobbly with her best effort.<i> Finally</i>, she thought,<i> I got this hunk of useless metal upright.</i> Just then, the Pokemon noticed a little bulb near hear mouth and wondered about it's function. Suicune tried speaking something into it and heard her words in Dialga's voice. <i>Perfect.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look I'm Dialga, the most awesome legendary Pokemon in existence. I'm also a jerk to Suicune because my thing is too small for her. And for that, she always rejects me\", she said sarcastically, \"I hereby apologize for all of my past actions to everyone that I have pranked, for the sake of all Pokemon. I hope she'll accept my apology this time after she's done electrocuting me. Ouch..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joke had Raikou laughing on the floor while you gave an uneasy chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that both of you are enjoying her little show, Suicune smirked and continued speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have no respect for the human's privacy; I monitored and read all of his thoughts and memories. Since I've done this, I should allow the human to browse my memories as well. But I can't, the human will see all of my weird and risque fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat elicited a louder howl of laughter from you. Despite the somewhat disturbing nature of those \"confessions\", Suicune has a way of making it a lot more funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making a few more jokes, Suicune decide that it's time for something serious. That's just the warmup, Dialga, I have far more tricks up my sleeves for you., the Pokemon thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he noticed that he was walking, albeit clumsily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What is going on?\" Dialga wondered aloud. Then he heard a voice talking. Much to his surprise, he realized it was his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who woke up! About time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga gasped in surprise. He soon realized what it meant. Somebody had hijacked his body! Could it be...the human he had sheltered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not the human. That creature must be somewhere around your groin, looking to what caused all that pain. Oh, also: my fault for that\" his voice said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga named the first name he could think \"Palkia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice laughed. \"Palkia?! I'm almost offended! But sure, if you want to think it is Palkia, then fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my head and my body! And don't dare to hurt me or the human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you care about the human, how nice of you. However...I saw something very interesting around here. You have been monitoring the human, haven't you? Don't lie! I can see it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga was speechless for a moment. His voice continued. \"It would be a shame if the human heard something about that. The big dragon, invading the privacy of a human's mind. Something I didn't expect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, I'm turning it off. Just get out of my body and don't say a thing about that to the human\". Dialga reconfigured his mind, deleting the program that monitored the human. He didn't notice that it was showing that the human was walking through the halls of his brain. \"There, it is gone. Now please get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is a very comfy place. Besides, I'm just starting with this controlling game. I want to have some fun first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have wronged me too many times, Dialga. It was time for revenge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga tried to stop his body from moving, and while he did that, he thought about who could be controlling him. It didn't sound like the human and Palkia at all, that was for sure. After seeing when the pain started, and the personality of the invader...he had a very good hunch of who it was. He proposed himself that even if it were Suicune, he wouldn't refrain from punishing her for the invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...I'll get you out of my body, and it'll be the way you deserve, the most ungraceful way I can think. I'll make sure of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see that. Now shut up and enjoy the ride!\" the voice said, before Dialga's body started to acquire speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the halls of Dialga's brain, Raikou and you heard all the exchange. You couldn't avoid admiring Suicune's bravado. Raikou, on the other hand, was getting more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like Dialga was serious about it...I shouldn't have came here. Surely Dialga wouldn't...force us to go out with...\" he muttered, disgusted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been there, and it wasn't nice, true. But relax. You two have me here. I'll help you two to get out of Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou cheered up after these words, returning to his more calmed personality. \"Good. Got any plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt you'll escape in the next few hours. It is almost night. We'll try to escape when Dialga is careless. Surely after Suicune stops controlling him, he'll add defenses to the brain. We may be unable to do anything in here\" you say, looking through an entrance. You're looking for Dialga's memories. After what he had done, you felt it was only right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you think we'll get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga's body has a lot of entrances, which may be used as ways out. A way that doesn't involve any effort from Dialga would be good. Meanwhile, stay with me, you and Suicune should stay close to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou nodded, approving the plan. \"I hope it doesn't take long. I have a few concerns, if Suicune and I are forced to be her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply, still focusing on your own search. \"What will we eat? I doubt that Dialga will give Suicune and I nice food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see when it is time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I feel the need to run like thunder, how will I do that? I haven't seen any good place for that yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, when it is time it'll get solved\" you say, a bit more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if nature calls? We can't just go anywhere. It would be unhygienic and a bother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet now\" your patience was starting to run out. You hoped that being with Raikou for a day or so wouldn't be like this \"I think I found the memory bank. Want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou nodded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How you discovered the way to Dialga's memory bank couldn't be simpler. From unknown reasons, the Pokemon left directional signage for all parts of his brain. Arrows and flashing lights are placed along walls and on the floor. The signs are written in Pokemon and English along with a pictogram. You commented on why would Dialga leave such vital information out in the open for visitors to see. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of keeping the data bank safe? Or was he expecting you to visit the brain or something. Raikou remarked that Dialga is probably careless and perhaps too complex a creature for his own good. He probably can't even browse through his own brain without getting lost, hence the directional signs. You laughed at the possibility and imagined Dialga with a lost expression while mentally searching about how to deal with Suicune. <i>That will be something I'd pay to see.</i>, you thought, <i>It would explain his constant long pauses.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you and Raikou arrived at the doorway to Dialga's memories, you are greeted by a wide metallic door. Affixed to the door is a sign: <b>Important! Vital Data Inside. Do Not Enter Without Authorization.</b> Raikou facepawed at the obvious notice. You approached the door and expected it to unlock. Instead, it remained firmly in place. For half an hour, you attempted to find ways to open the door but it wouldn't bulge. There's no buttons, no levers or anything to indicate how to unlock the door. After a fruitless search, you tell Raikou to contact Suicune and see what she could do. Raikou agreed and told Suicune about their current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga felt powerless as he hopelessly watch himself move around in the forest. Within a few more miles, he will be heading up a mountain. The Pokemon can almost guarantee himself at this point that Suicune is the manipulator at helm. Embarrassment and anger flooded his mind. How could a mere Aurora Pokemon take control of one of the most powerful Legendary in existence? Did the human allowed this to happen to me? Was I betrayed ? I won't be able to find out now since I just deleted the surveillance software. She sure got guts! <i>If Arceus finds out......</i> Dialga's thought was interrupt by his own voice speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are listening to me?\", his voice asked, \"I always knew that you are short on attention, but I didn't know it's this bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? It seems that you're having great fun controlling my every move. Hope the dimensional prison I'm preparing in my rear end won't be too uncomfortable for you once I get my hands on you.\", Dialga spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have serious doubts that you'll be able to do that to me. It takes wit and brain to do that. Something you seriously lack.\", his voice mocked, \"Anyway, mind telling me about how I can access your memories? I sure love to look at the dustbins you have in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!! First my body, now my brain? You just can't help it, can you? You just want to do whatever you can to make my day worse. And no, I'm not telling you. You can't just go around and ask a random Pokemon for his memory, you know!\", Dialga shouted, \"Don't you have any respect for my privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that you are concerned about that one right that you apparently denied the poor human.\", the voice replied sarcastically, \"I've seen a lot of his information you've collected up here. You seem to have a voyeuristic interest in his whereabouts and thoughts, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga's heart stopped and his face went pale....<i>Shit shit shit.....What should I say now?.....The human can't possibly know......</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only doing that for his own safety.\", Dialga defended himself, \"If you're in my position, I bet you would do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I wouldn't consider reading a person's private thought and monitoring their movements through their eyes to be essential to safety. It sounds more like you're trying to get whatever knowledge you can extract from him without his permission.\", his voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine. I'll admit that I was kinda curious about the human. But wouldn't Raikou, that nerdy friend of ours do the same if he encounters the human? He seemed pretty excited when he's on the messenger with the him.\", Dialga retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The difference is: Raikou would've asked before doing such invasive observation. If the human declines, that's it.\", his voice calmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga remained silent, a rage building up within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it's nice talking with you. I gotta get back to making you miserable. By the way, I found a little switch here to unlocked your data bank. You're still indiscreet as always, leaving all these buttons within my reach. Hope you won't mind me taking a peek at what in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune flipped the switch with her paw and made a glass monitor pop up on her platform. The monitor shows the human and Raikou at the memory bank. The screen provides both a live video feed and audio to her platform. Suicune can perfectly hear their conversation. <span class=\"clblue\"><i>Let's see what fun the boys are up to.</i></span>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Dialga is sweating bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm done....... Done for sure! Why haven't I reconfigured my brain when the strange headache came?.... She'll see everything now. How I wish for her to run me to a cliff.....Hopefully Arceus won't demote me for this if I'm not disintegrated first....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible click came from the door and they slowly opened up. You heard the little conversation between Suicune and Dialga. You felt a lot better as the Temporal Pokemon is about to get a generous dose of his own medicine. What is it that Dialga don't want us to find out about?, you thought. He sounded like he has some hidden stashes lying around his brain. The room you and Raikou entered was dark and warm. You could hear a low din that echoed throughout the chamber. Raikou was the first to venture deeper to check things out. Without warning, blue lights turned on by themselves and illuminated the room. With a better grasp of your surrounding now, you try to get a grasp of the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory bank is a large vaulted chamber that covered entirely with glass panels of various different size. If you were to compare this to an art gallery, the magnificence sure exceeds that of the National Museum of Sinnoh. You and Raikou couldn't help but stare at the palatial wonder before you eyes. You ventured closer to the walls to have a better look at the glass panels. When you stepped in front of one of them, it displays words and images as you passed by them but you didn't give them much attention. They range in size from a notebook to that of large windows. You glanced down for a while and discovered that the floor, too, is made from glass. Beneath the see-through floor, an enormous galaxy-like object swirls gently while giving off a cold azure glow. A lone ladder in a corner leads down to the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those panels must be an individual memory of Dialga. This place must contain millions, if not trillions of data.\", you said to Raikou,\"I'm not so sure about that thing down there. But I bet it has something to do with his power. To be on the safe side, let's not go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're here, are you planning on getting back to Dialga for spying on you?.\", Raikou smiled, \"I wonder where should we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since this is the brain, I bet we can learn a lot about Dialga's background and stuffs like that. But first we'll have to look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And I think I know where should we start.\", you smirked ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much looking around, you and Raikou found a section of the panels labelled as \"Suicune Collection.\" One of the panel reads \"The Aurora Affair: A Temporal Romance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what kind of weird thoughts Dialga have for Suicune up here. \", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't Suicune be mighty pissed if we stumbled upon some sick fantasies involving her?\", Raikou asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. She wouldn't know a thing here. What we see in here, stays in here.\", you assured Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\", Raikou said nervously, \"I hope this doesn't end with us as ice statues in her cavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched the \"The Aurora Affair: A Temporal Romance\" panel without further delay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you touched the panel, a bright light blinded you. You covered your eyes, startled, and when you removed your hand, you saw Suicune in front of you. \"Wow, when...oh...true...\" Suicune didn't move or anything. Everything stayed static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you, you seem to be on a meadow. You don't see anything odd, so it must be your dimension. Suicune is sitting in front of you, with a vacant expression, possibly because the simulation hasn't started. At your side, Raikou is examining the surroundings. \"This is a quality simulation. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was real\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold back a snappy comment, and words start to sound in your mind. They're basically instructions to how to use the simulator, but they are so confuse and odd that you don't understand a thing. You suppose it must be just a reminder for Dialga, and nothing more. You do manage to find an option to watch the last session. \"Want to see what is this thing, Raikou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came here, so we may as well go all the way\" Raikou replies, approaching you. You do the steps to see the last session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga starts to materialize where you are. You get out of the step before the Pok\u00e9mon fully turns solid. Dialga seems like he got slightly improved than how you remember him, bigger and stronger physically. Suicune doesn't look different, however, her eyes look full of life now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good in this fine morning, Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, Suicune. It was around time you accepted my invitations\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I resist such a strong and handsome dragon?\" Suicune flirts with an overly sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're very amused. Suicune is so out of character that you seriously can't believe this is Dialga's image of her. Raikou is watching with an expression you can't decide is enraged or barely containing laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Suicune and Dialga exchange increasingly sickening and syrupy compliments \"Is this really what Dialga does in his mind?\" you manage to say, trying hard not to laugh. The image of the serious and somewhat aloof Dialga you had when you first met him was fully destroyed now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a dork, trust me. At least it isn't that bad, just embarrassing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date continues, and this time food appears in front of the Pok\u00e9mon. They couldn't contain their clich\u00e9 compliments, most towards Dialga, even with their mouths full of food. You remember a few of the most embarrassing ones, with the intention of telling them to Suicune...yet you doubt about doing it. Could Suicune really leave Dialga and you and Raikou intact if she knew what you were watching?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food is over, Dialga and Suicune stand, and start walking. You two follow them, while they walk leisurely. You exchange a few jabs with Raikou towards Dialga, while they go. At some point, Raikou says something you didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like where those two's conversation is going\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen back, as you had been distracted with your own conversation to notice what they said. What you hear makes you feel really uncomfortable. \"Have I told you what I have dreamed so many times, Dialga? That you would show me your talents, and I don't mean any talents\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not here? Anywhere is a good place for it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeees...let's do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking towards the opposite direction, not daring to look back. Maybe it was your somewhat perverted mind, but you only could suppose what would follow. \"Let's go, Raikou. If we watch more and Suicune finds out, then we'll need to hide a thousand feet underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better to be safe than sorry, eh?\" Raikou says, understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Raikou walk to the starting point. On the ground there is a small disc of light. In the distance you can hear howls of what could be pleasure, or Dialga getting gutted. And since Dialga wouldn't do that in his own simulator...you remove those thoughts out of your mind and touch the disc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light once again blinds you, and you both are back to the place in Dialga's memory bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that worth it?\" Raikou asks you. You think for a second. It went more or less as you expected, but the dialogue and the content itself was priceless. You definitely wasn't going to tell Suicune, but maybe someday you'd tell Dialga about what you say, just for the sake of seeing his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was worth it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dialga is now traveling through a dense forest while his controller continues to lead him to who knows where. This is the first time that he had felt so frustrated with everything; he is a prisoner in his own body and unable to access any of his powers. His memory is being read, the human nowhere to be found, the pain in his groin still going strong, the lists just get longer. The further he thought about these setbacks, the more anger he felt at the Suicune. The Pokemon pictured her in his brain with a wide, victorious grin while parading his body around like a new toy for all to see. Dialga could only dread the reactions he will receive from Palkia and other Legendaries once this fiasco goes public. <i>They'll surely laugh their heads off about me being controlled by another Pokemon. And to add salt to the injury, it's Suicune.  I seriously doubt that I be able to regain my credibility.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. You're credibility is completely done for, that is, if you still have any left. Also, I would love to see the jokes about you hurled around the Pok\u00e9net. Serves you right.\", his voice chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARRRRR, could you please keep your filthy mouth shut for a few minutes. Can't you see I'm in an awful mood right here?\", Dialga growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why should I stop when I'm having so much fun? You said that to me when you're pranking me in every, single dimensionally-possible ways. How does it feel now that the shoe is on the other foot?\", the voice replied, \"And technically, you just asked yourself to shut up so do me a big favor and zip that freaking black hole up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I won't just step aside and let you recklessly drag me around. I tried to be nice to you since you've got control but you still tried to push my buttons. It's time I let you know who's in charge here.\", Dialga snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. And how would you do that? Try and drag me into another cosmic limbo?\", his voice cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...When I get my claws on you, I'm gonna-- \", Dialga was cut off mid-sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga tried to say something but his mouth wouldn't bulge. Not because he ran out of snide remarks, he literally cannot move his mouth. He even couldn't vocalize a single sound. It's locked shut. As Dialga is fumbling to get his mouth to work again, he heard a familiar female voice speak in his head. The toyboyish tone grating his brain ever so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're gonna what, huh? ........I didn't know that you had an audio output jack plugged in here. Mind if I remove it? I can only wonder why you would include such a functionality but it sure saves me the trouble of having to listen to your incessant whining and threats.\", Suicune said.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Awwwwww, don't be sad. I thought you wanted me to shut up so I did you a favor. Well, here you go.\", the Aurora Pokemon jabbed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I initially thought about going easy on you, but you're attitude made me reconsidered that offer. Don't get mad at me for this. It's you who has problems. Hahaha   without that loud mouth of yours, you're pretty much useless.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga suddenly exploded with rage and mentally shouted virtually all forms of Pokemon obscenities. He wished he could obliterate Suicune this instance. But all of those thoughts are futile. For Suicune, his anger are merely displayed as words on the platform screen. At the moment, the entire screen is filled to the brim with bold letters and other non-discernable symbols. It really pleases her to see Dialga so helpless and at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cgreen\">&gt;&gt;Suicune!!! You b&amp;$&amp;h ass, I'm gonna screw you silly! You messed with the wrong Pokemon!!! You're going to be fucking mine!!! Those little pranks are nothing compared to what coming to you!</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, temper temper..... I never knew you had such interesting vocabularies.\", Suicune exclaimed, \"You could be the champion on the PokeBoard. Heard they got all sorts of nasty comments there. Oh wait, they might not even welcome you there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cgreen\">&gt;&gt; I'm truly mistaken about you, Suicune.......Dimensional prison is too kind for a control freak like you!!! Now give me back my damn control! </span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not going to happen. You and me have a lot to settle. So why don't we start with little something called \"The Aurora Affair:  A Temporal Romance\" stored up here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cgreen\">&gt;&gt; no.........it can't be  *gulp* I don't know what you're...ta..talking about! Is that a novel you've written about me?</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the change in Dialga's tone, Suicune pressed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmph. Stop playing stupid with me, Dialga. I've seen it all on the screen. What's all that 'lovely-dovey' simulation in the memory bank all about? Me, finding you handsome and strong? Not in a trillion years! And that whole scene in the cave.......Now that's something I find rather disturbing and unpalatable.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cgreen\">&gt;&gt;Fine! I got those thoughts for my own enjoyment. Males need their personal entertainment, you know. I bet you got some about me yourself, kissing and entwining with my...</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Quiet!!! You just don't understand, do you?

He isn't slowing down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cgreen\">&gt;&gt; Nononononoono......Suicune, please no.....</span></span></span></div></div>",

You had been checking the most recent past, while Raikou checked earlier ages. \"Did you find something interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Check this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking at a plaque that was called \"First Meeting - Suicune\". \"This is a chance to possibly find out why Suicune has so little patience towards Dialga. Want to confirm it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be good, although you don't have the same interest Raikou has. You're more interested on seeing Suicune's reactions when meeting Dialga. You touch the memory, and the light once again blinds you. You really don't like it, and decide that you will cover your eyes next time, you hope to not to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you recover your sight sense, you're in a some sort of forest clearing. There are trees and plants arranged in ways that just can't be natural. Everything has a mystic aura, and there are a few Pok\u00e9mon around. You recognize several of them. All of them are Legendaries, that is for sure, but there are several that you had never seen before, probably because they're from places you have never heard about, or are Legendaries that are now extinct. Dialga is between the trees, you can't see what he is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember something like this\" Raikou says \"This is when a new Legendary is introduced to the group or given big responsibilities. This must have happened long before I joined\". Effectively, Raikou is nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, all Pok\u00e9mon gather in a circle, in the borders of the clearing. All of them have a solemn expression. In the distance, you can see a figure walking towards the group. There is a smaller figure floating at its side. When they approach, you recognize Suicune and Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the boss?\" Palkia asks when Suicune and Mew reach the rest. Mew floats around freely before answering, apparently thinking a lot. \"Busy doing the usual stuff. I was told to continue with the ceremony, and I'll do a good job at it, don't you think? I'm ready for it!\" Some of the Pok\u00e9mon seem to doubt it. Suicune is barely containing her excitement. Who knows for how long she had been waiting for this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune stands on the center of the circle, looking proud. \"Suicune. You have been called here to be given a new purpose. Are you ready to hear what's it?\" Mew says, sounding surprisingly serious. You suppose there is more sides of her than you thought. Suicune replies saying she is ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then your task will be to be one of the guardians of Johto. You'll run all over the territory, with your main responsibilities being the water bodies and the cold regions of the territory. You'll start with the task given tomorrow. Is it understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then with this, we declare you're fit for the job, and officially welcome you into the group of Legendaries. Welcome\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew floats away, to the edge, while Suicune looks around, while the rest of th Pok\u00e9mon muttered some words of welcome or nodded towards her. When she looked at Dialga, he didn't do any of those things. Just looked at the forest behind Suicune, as if there were something in there. Soon the curiosity was too much, and Suicune turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big blob came out of the forest, as if it had been fired by a cannon. Knowing Dialga, it probably was. The blob exploded on Suicune, covering her in red tint. She fell down due to the impact, while Dialga smirked, obviously containing his laughter. Several of the Legendaries were laughing, and very few remained stoic. Suicune looked at Dialga, furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Tradition\" That was all he said. He was acting almost exactly like when you had met him. Mew approached, giggling. \"Calm down, Suicune. Most of us have gone through something like this. It is always something new in every ceremony\" she kept giggling. Suicune definitely wasn't amused. You could notice that she was saving that grudge, and surely, in the present, she still remember that moment with all the fury she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou once again felt the need to comment \"I did go through something similar, I fell into a pit of mud. It took me days to be clean\". He was talking almost with nostalgia, he didn't hold any ill feelings towards Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, you decided it was time to get out of there. You looked around for the disc, and covered your eyes. Seconds later, you were in the memory bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was the first moment Suicune hated Dialga, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And he hasn't done a lot of things to make her change her opinion\" Raikou said, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think over this, but then a loud yell reverberates in the place. It sounds worse than anything you had heard in that day. Raikou seems to be very concerned about this \"That really sounded bad. What is Suicune doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't stop to wonder about it, and walk to the exit. Whatever it is, just judging by the sound, it was something that went too far. You had to get Suicune out of the control room quick, before something really bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Raikou rushed as quickly as possible toward the control room. The loud scream out of nowhere has greatly unsettled you. There is no way of telling as to what happened but something in your guts tell you that someone was hurt. The yell sounds a lot worse than the ones Dialga gave when his groin was in pain. You went through a list of possibilities, did Suicune made Dialga do something humiliating? Did she finally had enough of him and decided to settle things herself? You tried your best not to think in the latter direction.<i>Don't worry.</i>, you attempted to reassure yourself,<i>It can't be anything worse. It just part of Suicune's revenge. She wouldn't overdo it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't like the way this is going. Although Suicune hates Dialga down to his very being, she would never do something to actually hurt him,\" Raikou said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to think so too,\" you sighed, \"But, did you hear that scream?! It doesn't sound like the fun kind of scream. That's the kind you would give when your life is in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever she's doing now, we must stop her immediately,\" Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finally arrived at the control center to see Suicune at the platform with a smirky expression on her face. She has eyes fixed on the large screens in front of her. One of them depicts the Temporal Pokemon's body lying on the ground writhing under tremendous pain. Fragments of rocks are strewn on the ground around him. You can see scratches and bruises along the underside with the area around the reproductive organ looking particularly bad. Another screen is filled with words of all sorts. There are dialogs of some sort between Suicune and Dialga. One of the last lines on the screen is Dialga begging Suicune to stop what she's doing. After that, an error message that the Pokemon has fainted and would require some times before he could be rebooted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, look at you! A moment ago you're all boastful and confidant. I thought you said that you could easily handle me. Turns out that you're a wussy! How do you like them pranks now?\" ,Suicune victoriously proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou was the first to rush toward Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune!!! What the hell are you doing?\" Raikou exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aurora Pokemon spun her head around and looked at both you and Raikou with an unnaturally cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. It's so good to see you boys back,\" Suicune said with a sweet smile, \"Did both of you have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....Suicune. That's not what we're asking you,\" Raikou said in a serious tone, \"We heard a loud scream coming from Dialga. We're kinda worried about you, you know. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing, dear. I just taught Dialga an important lesson in respecting a female Pokemon. But he somehow got overwhelmed by my extreme lecture methods. Don't worry about him, boys. He'll be up again in a day or two,\" Suicune continued in a saccharine tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think this is going a bit too far?\", Raikou asked, \"I get it that you hate him, but there's no need to make Dialga childless by messing up his dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha not at all, my Raikou,\" Suicune chimed, \"Dialga always claimed to be that handsome and powerful Pokemon who I'll fall in love with. So I decided to give that theory a little test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Suicune talking so syrupy eerily reminds you of that gross-out memory you saw back there. You tried your best to repress that scene from the surface of your mind. You shook off the creepy resemblance as a mere coincidence. But the atmosphere remains ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Suicune always talk like this when she's extremely happy?\", you whispered to Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She never talked like that before. Suicune wouldn't be caught dead with that kind of voice. I'm truly concerned about her,\" Raikou murmured back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\", Suicune smiled as she moved her face closer to you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, nothing. We're just wondering about what made you such a happy Pokemon,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, silly human. Now that's a simple question,\" Suicune said, \"I just defeated Dialga at his own game! Of course I'll be cheery. By the way, did you boys find anything interesting on your little stroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...we went to check out Dialga's brain anatomy,\" Raikou blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. That's funny I thought you guys told me that you wanted to visit the Memory Bank. Dialga must have awesome stuffs stowed in there, right?\", Suicune beamed as she stepped even closer. Her face very subtly darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou and you are getting sweaty and nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found... nothing but times-wimey.... stuffs.,\" you said shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's not interesting enough for you to know. So we instead talked about male things. Stuffs girls wouldn't want to know about,\" Raikou added sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let me take a guess? Are you boys talking about something called......<i>'The Aurora Affair'</i>?\" Suicune said smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, how did she know about that?</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\", you asked, on the verge of a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you boys had a lot of fun watching that,\" Suicune growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Suicune sweet smile started distorting into something unreadable. Raikou has a very fearful look on his face when he looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the part where we......<b>.RUUUUUUNNNNNN</b>!!!!!\", the Electric Pokemon yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint at full speed along with Raikou toward the exit. But before you had any chance of reaching it, you felt something wrapped around your feet and made fall onto the floor. You saw a white ribbon-like object slowly tying itself around your feet, body, and arms. A quick look at Raikou revealed him to be in a similar bind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere, boys?\", Suicune said coldly as she dragged you two back to her, \"I saw everything you guys did there the moment that door opened. That means you probably know the reason why I hated this idiot so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon positioned you and Raikou in front of her raging, crimson eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune, no!\" Raikou pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too afraid to even utter, completely paralyzed by the Pokemon's glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I make you two do?\", Suicune smirked sinisterly. </span></div></div>",

Pamper?\" Raikou says, confused, but you can sense some fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Raikou, go, bring me food. I'm getting hungry. You know what I like, so you better not bring me anything you know I'll hate\" Suicune released Raikou, who bolted towards the exit. A few seconds later, he re-entered shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know where to get food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune rolled her eyes, and gestured to behind Raikou. From the distance, you think you saw a tunnel opening. \"This should lead your way. Go\" Raikou once again left the place. Then the Aurora Pok\u00e9mon turned all her attention to you. You gulp, nervous about what she could tell you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to take care of Dialga from the inside, didn't you? Wake him up. I'm not done with him yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you be done?\" you ask, truly concerned about Dialga's well-being. All this revenge thing has gone way too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get tired, which won't happen soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get released as well. You look to the side, near the controls. You walk to it, and start fiddling with it. You're sure that what you're doing won't wake up Dialga, but if you don't look like you tried then who knows what would happen to you. Around ten minutes later, Raikou returns, rolling around big amount of food., You observe how he brings it to Suicune, and she examines it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be better, but I suppose that there is nothing better. At least you didn't bring me anything terrible\" suddenly she turns towards you. \"Are you done, human? I'm getting impatient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fear your own life when you reply \"I-i-i-i-I'm sorry, Suicune, but th-there is nothing I can do. He'll have to wake u-u-up by himself...\" you close your eyes, afraid of looking at Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel any pain or anything. You expected to be attacked, but when you opened your eyes, it looks like she is containing her frustration. \"Ugh. You really can't do a thing, but I hope that your next tasks are at least better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to yell Now What?, but you don't feel like dying in that moment. \"What's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me. And you, Raikou, try to do what the human couldn't do. Maybe some shocks can awake Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou and you changed your positions. He now was pouring electricity over several wires, while you took the food, tore it in pieces and gave them to Suicune in her mouth. She insisted on making things hard for you, maybe what you two watched in Dialga's memory was something she really didn't wanted people to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long will we have to...service you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune doesn't reply, just continues eating what you give them. She doesn't say a thing until you're done, and even then, looks like she ignored your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was about to talk, Raikou told Suicune that he was unsuccessful as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to do, then. I'll have to wait until he wakes up. I'm tired of being in this spot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got off the platform. You hope it means you two are free as well, but Suicune destroys those hopes \"Ah, and you two stay with me. You're not free to go yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has opened a path, and when you three get to the end, you're in a room you had never seen before. It is decorated on what you suppose if Suicune's taste. On a side there are two small mattresses in the floor, which you suppose are for you and Raikou, and a big bed-like thing for Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbs her bed, and looks around. \"What time is it?\" You look at your clock and reply. \"Ah, it is almost time for me to sleep. But before, there are two last things I want you to do for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou. I want you to keep a watchful eye to see if Dialga wakes up before it is time. If he does and you don't tell me, my revenge will be as big as the one I'm carrying on Dialga\" she says threateningly. Raikou seems about to faint due to his fear, but he leaves to patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human. I want to sleep. But before that, groom me. I can't sleep well if I'm not clean and tidy\" she fills a nearby recipient with water, and passes it to you. \"There you go. And make sure to do it right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bucket, grimacing. You need to think of a way of stopping Suicune. Suddenly, you remember something. Dialga had given you some small temporal powers! But...were they enough to help you? You doubt that at your actual state, you could do a thing. You're tired and want to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to get over what Suicune asked you, then go to sleep. You promised yourself that tomorrow you would make sure things were right again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want you to do your cleaning as gently and slowly as you can, human. I don't want any rough actions that might ruin my lustrous coat. Have I made myself clear?\" Suicune said as she holds a brush with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Let's just make this quick, okay? I'm kinda tired here,\" you said half-mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you start cleaning me right away, human,\" the Pokemon said, \"You don't want to keep a lady waiting, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune whisked herself off the bed and started walking to another opening in the chamber. You followed right behind her and was lead to another interconnected room that intends to be a shower room. A large recessed tub lies at the center. Once again, the decors are designed to supposedly fit Suicune's taste. The walls are decorated with colors to resemble aurora while blue diamond crystals are studded onto the floor in a crisscross pattern. The centerpiece of the chamber is on the ceiling where a painting depicts Suicune and Dialga in regal and, bluntly, suggestive pose. Both are embracing each other with their ecstatic gaze trained on each other. You face immediately blushed upon seeing it though you have no attractions of any sorts toward Suicune. While looking at it, you wondered how Suicune could find this location with relative ease. <i>And just how obsessive can Dialga get with her? With this kind of devotion to Suicune, it's outright narcissism and delusional</i>,you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus damn it...that pervert had to keep that painting up there. I'd thought I told him to remove that abomination,\" Suicune grumbled. As if she suddenly remembered the reason she's here and look at you with commanding eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna use that tub right there and I want you to use that bucket of water to clean me. From there, you will brush my fur in a single direction from my head toward my rump. You are not to stop until I said so. Anything done the wrong way will be immediately punished. Now, get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are barely able to listen to Suicune's instruction after the exhaustive ordeal of the day. It's challenging to maintain an appearance of alertness when you are about to fall asleep. Maybe it's just because of the fatigue, but you felt an urge to talk back to Suicune and disobey her. But still, it's better to comply with her demands than to find out what kind of punishment she could enact. You sighed in resignation as you grabbed the brush from Suicune and examined her body. At a distance, the Pokemon's fur looks uniformly smooth but closer scrutiny reveals obvious problems. Some parts of her coat looks matted and disheveled. Her paws are all grimy, brown, and a little sweaty; signs of an exhaustive day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully used the brush to gently stroke her coat in a slow, rhythmic pattern. You can hear Suicune give a sigh of relaxation and feel the tension on her body start to loosen. A lot of tangled or loose clumps of fur came off her along with all the dirt hidden deep inside. Her fur is softer than you imagined, silky yet prickly. Your brush sometimes got stuck on the fur which makes Suicune yelps in pain. Her red eyes glared deeply at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!! Watch where you're brushing!!!\" Suicune barked, \"One more of mistake and removing my paws from your rump will be the least of your worries.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat soul-piercing glare...... It sends a shiver through your body and is enough to make you double your efforts at cleaning. When all visible dirt are removed, you took the a small ladle from the pail and pour the water on her body and brushed a little harder. The water carried with them all the sweats and grime accumulated over long periods. The most challenging place to clean are her paws because they have a lot of gaps and crevices which are difficult to reach. <i>That girl is either bent on making my job hard or she has a passion of making males suffer. Well at least she didn't order me to brush her nether region. I'd rather her punish me than be made to scrub 'there.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn interesting effect begins to manifest on Suicune. Her coat glowed brilliantly where it has been cleaned. It's reminiscent of stars and auroras. The beautiful glow mesmerized you at times. You complimented Suicune on how beautiful her fur looks when they're cleaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to hear some praises after a rough day, human. The lustrous effect on my coat is the physical embodiment of my role as the Guardian of the North. Usually it'll glow even brighter under a full moon when I'm recharging my power but I can't afford the luxury of that at this time. It's also the reason why you need to scrub me; I can't stay clean without a lake or moonlight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense to you: Suicune represents the northern light and the forest. Legends said that she's responsible for keeping lakes crystal clear around the world and enacts punishment upon those that fouled them. One ancient account even go as far to say that she will find a human who truly cares for nature and make him one with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you longer than you anticipated but Suicune was completely clean and free from any dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...not as good as I expected it to be but still an adequate effort for a starter,\" Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little put down by Suicune's comment but you are relieved to know that you are finally free to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright human, I hope you learned your lessons today. Let's go and take some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you head back to the bed chamber and settled in your respective beds. A question you've always wanted to ask Suicune popped up in your head as you are tucking in the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune, I don't know if it's okay for you to answer this question I've been thinking about. Have you ever thought about the reason Dialga is attracted to you? I mean like the dynamic behind it,\" you asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unreadable expression briefly formed upon Suicune face. Her eyes sternly focused on yours. You are afraid that you might have asked the wrong question. The Pokemon marched in your direction. <i>This can't be good. </i> You squeezed your eyes shut and prepared for the pains. Seconds passed but no punishment materialized. Instead, you only felt a paw upon your shoulder. You opened your eyes and saw Suicune looking at you with a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I don't and I'm not interested in finding out. It's probably for some odd reasons. Dialga is a very enigmatic and there's a lot, excluding those fantasies, that we'll never find out,\" the Pokemon answered casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been with Dialga for a little over a week and he's already upsetting me with his recent attitudes. It's hard to imagine how you dealt with him for so long and yet still remain sane,\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely,\" Suicune added, \"His presence alone makes me nauseous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel for you, Suicune,\" you said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, human. I have to admit, I initially neutral about him. He was almost likeable back then. His tricks then were pretty playful if you're willing to accept his definition of fun. I never really disliked him.....until he started receiving all these new powers from Arceus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus?\" you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Legendary One who created the Pokemon world and all tangible things. Dialga is his protege. After receiving more temporal powers from Arceus, Dialga kinda went over his own head and started testing his power out on everyone in a show of superiority, especially me. He always tried to find the opportunity to teleport me to another dimension to 'proclaim' his love and flaunt his powers. I truly wonder what was going through Arceus' mind when he accepted Dialga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a powerful Legendary, Arceus really screwed up on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All thanks to him, I avoided Dialga at all cost. But he messaged me endlessly and it drove me nut. Eventually I just ignored him. That went on for decades until that message you popped out at me and here we are, trapped in the very thing I despised the most,\" Suicune gritted through her teeth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"...It's all my fault that you and Raikou are dragged in this quagmire,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, human? There's no need to feel bad about it,\", Suicune said, \"We're in this together now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.....and don't forget what will happen to us the next morning once Dialga restarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*yawn*</i> \"We'll figure that out tomorrow. It's sorta late right now, let's get some sleep, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,  let's just hope we make it to tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, human. Rest assured, I know how to deal with this prick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made yourself comfortable in your bed, you thought about Suicune's behavior lately. Although she's acting all commanding and domineering to you and Raikou, you are beginning to like her more. </span></div></div>",

Suicune was still asleep, Raikou was nowhere in sight, and nothing around was moving, which you supposed meant Dialga was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're fully awake, you try to wake up Suicune.You do it carefully, trying not to anger her. Thankfully, nothing bad happens to you, and soon she is ready for the day. -\"What will be done today, Suicune?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not done yet here. But once I'm done, we're getting out\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Any plan?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune only smiled enigmatically. -\"You'll see. Go get Raikou and some food for us three. I'll be going to the brain. Don't take too long\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary and you exited the room, and parted ways. You walked around for a while, trying to think where Raikou could have gone. Dialga's body is pretty big, so he could be practically anywhere. You search for him around, but you can't find a trace of him. Where did he go? Could Dialga have awoken at some point, and punished Raikou without he being able to notify Suicune or you? You don't want to think that is what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go look for food, trying to calm down. Before you left the room, Suicune gave you instructions to get to the room where Raikou had found the food last time. You enter, and quickly see some sort of storage, divided in different types. You take what you remember Raikou had brought the last day, and went to the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune was already near the same platform from yesterday. Looking around, you see everything is inactive, but one of the screens shows that Dialga is almost fully rested. -\"I see you got the food, but where is Raikou?\"- Suicune asks, with a hint of annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the food on the floor, and inform Suicune about how you can't find Raikou. Her annoyance seems to be gone when you're done talking. -\"Ugh, did he get lost? Possibly. I'll try to find him in these screens, but it'll take a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meanwhile what? If Dialga finds him before you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop worrying! I'll continue where I left yesterday. You start searching for Raikou. Think of where he would like to be, think of what he would be interested in. I'm willing to bet you'll find him if you try to think like him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and take your portion of the food. While you step out, you hear some sounds behind you. You suppose it is Dialga waking up, and Suicune starting to control him. You decide to focus on your searching of Raikou. You're not too worried at first, but the more you walk, the more you hope that Raikou didn't get in trouble somewhere in Dialga's body. Who knows what that legendary could be doing in some point of the dragon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The search for Raikou proved to be much more difficult than you had anticipated. It was further compounded by the fact that you've technically conspired against Dialga and asking him for help would be out of the question. With Suicune at least, you won't have to worry about the Temporal Pokemon coming after you for your betrayal. The potential comeuppances is what sent a chill down your body. <i>Why is Dialga the one with overreaching metaphysical power? And why did I even trust him in the first place, especially after snooping on me with his 'mind-reading' software and trackers? When I meet this Arceus mentor guy, I <u>will</u> \"politely\" inform him of Dialga's power abuse.</i>, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the frustration with Dialga subsided, concerns for Raikou is at the forefront again. You tried your best recounting every last memory you have of the Pokemon from you first meeting to last night when Suicune sent him on night watch duty. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary from his behavior. To be honest, Raikou and Suicune seems to get along pretty well so far despite him being more of a follower. You tried convincing yourself that nothing bad has happened to him; he just probably wander off to explore places like the curious nerd he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that's what he's up to, then Suicune is within her right to freeze up his balls for the panic he has caused. You resigned yourself to the inevitable long search. There's just one little problem...Huge portions of Dialga remained unexplored and, frankly, dangerous. There will be obstacles, mazes, and perhaps even surveillance apparatuses that are still active in here. You carefully continue down the path, wishing that your mission could end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour into your search, you are now far off from the brain section and no idea where you're heading. You've entered countless grand corridors and chambers, finding nothing but featureless steel walls and neon blue strips to luminate your way. The occasional rumble and tumble of Dialga's organs made you stopped and hide; fearful that he might have caught Suicune and started looking for you. The rooms are filled with server-like devices that goes toward the ceiling. The hums generated by the machines echoed loudly. Pipes and wires are interconnected everywhere, transferring data or body fluids out to the main corridor to a location ahead. There is no indication of what these machinery are for but they must be vital to Dialga's body functions. You moved through several more halls of the same things when the passage opens into a larger chamber where a large towering monolith stood. It has a dark obsidian-like edifice and runes scattered across its face. The wires from the server rooms runs directly into it in thick bundles. The most relieving sight is that of the elusive Electric Pokemon before the entrance of the complex, seemingly mesmerized by the sheer size of the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou!!! Thank goodness I found you,\" you called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon spun around and looked at you with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found me! Oh my, oh my, oh my....You're not going to believe what Dialga has stored here! This is something we gotta tell Suicune,\" Raikou chirped, ignoring the concerned look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've spent hours looking for you. At least you could say something along the line of 'thank you'. And Suicune won't be happy when she discovered you wander off without her permission. You do know what will happen when you displeased her, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. Suicune won't do that. She's always the one to threaten me but never actually carry them out. Besides, Dialga was completely crashed the whole night and I got bored from watching those blank screens and sleeping is totally not my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay...So what led you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really. Random stammering around all night in the bows of Dialga and here I am, discovering Dialga's deepest secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this thing anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou pointed toward a sign on the monolith's wall: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><u>Suicune Center</u></font>- <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>Everything there is to know about Suicune. <b>Everything!</b>\"</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign's emphasis on \"everything\" caused an uncomfortable feeling to swell between you and Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Dialga is weird but this one sure takes the cake. Whatever is in there will be worse than that dating simulator,\" you said with apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone way beyond that already,\" Raikou added, \"At this rate, he'll be mind controlling her in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That aside, we better tell Suicune first before we go in. I don't wanna imagine what a week-long servitude would end up like.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sigh and manage to contact Suicune through the net. You tell her that you found Raikou, but that also he found that Center structure. Suicune is really not happy to know that such thing existed. She commanded you and Raikou to explore the Center and inform her of your findings, to \"decide how much she would punish Dialga that day\". More than what she had planned originally, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's go in\"- you tell Raikou. He enters before you, and you follow slowly, unsure of what you could find inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two arrive to a lobby, with a huge and incredibly detailed statue in Suicune looking upwards. She looked majestic in that statue, and approaching, you could swear you were able to see every hair of her fur, sculpted. Raikou looks at the entrances to several areas. -\"According to the signs, this place is like a very detailed encyclopedia of Suicune. Maybe it isn't as bad as we thought!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We won't know until we check in depth\"- you remind him, while entering the first hall you found. There are drawers filled with videotapes. Lots and lots of them. There is also a screen, although not very big. This place was possible not a place you were intended to visit. If Dialga found out you had entered here...what had he say he would do, again? You already forgot. You put one of the tapes in a slot under the screen, and see it turn on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Suicune going through her duties a a Legendary. You're impressed to see the amount of power she harnesses, but Raikou seems to be more focused on how Dialga recorded Suicune. You two watch for a while, then put another tape. It is the same thing, just on a different day and with different activities, but it is clear it is still her duties. After testing several tapes, you two come to the conclusion that this room is focused on Suicune and her powers as a Legendary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next room you visit is full of colorful diagrams about her powers. This is more focused on the workings behind them, something you would expect more from Raikou, than Dialga. -\"This is some amazing information, human. What I wouldn't do to have this stuff?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hopefully not the same Dialga does\"- you reply. Raikou isn't really amused with the implication he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you visit a third room. This one is filled with small structures, put over pedestals. There are plaques near, with text. You approach one. It seems to be some sort of mechanism that opened a trap on the floor. You can't identify what is on the bottom of the trap, but it seems mud. Under it you read the description. It is a detailed narration of how Dialga used it on Suicune. It doesn't take long before you figure out what the meaning of this room is. It is filled with the many pranks Dialga has ever done on Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a long time taking a marvel on Dialga's inventive. A lot of those pranks were pretty detailed, and very few ended being embarrassing for Suicune. At least Dialga had a good trait in his interactions with Suicune. Not that it forgave everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you two decide to end the exploration. There are many rooms left in the center, but sooner or later you would find something very bad for Dialga. So you call Suicune and tell her that there is nothing to worry about in there. You tell her it is mostly general stuff, and thankfully, she believes you. Raikou and you start to go back to the brain to see the last stuff Suicune would do with Dialga's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're walking, Raikou asks you something you didn't think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What will you do after we're gone?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought of what Dialga could do to you. He certainly wouldn't be happy with you.Who knows what he would do, but you also had some matters to discuss, if he dared to punish you. You could maintain control, and you tell Raikou that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't you come with Suicune or me, then? We both aren't going to be around for long, but you could live with one of us. We'll return to normal size, but if you don't want to, then come with one of us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat isn't a bad idea. It could be fun. You take a decision right there. You'll go with one of them while you settle things with Dialga. But who will you stay with after you get out of Dialga's body along with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The option of leaving Dialga sounds more and more attractive to you. Deep down, your view of the Pokemon has greatly deteriorated over the past few weeks. Everything from his intrusive thought surveillance to his unsettling obsession with Suicune made him more of a disturbing, out-of-control guardian. The fact that he could control time and space adds several dimensions of creepiness to it. You could only imagine what else he had done to you without your consent. Besides that, Dialga seems to be actively avoiding your question about how he plans to restore you. When asked, he always responded by saying he is searching for the solution as fast as possible. Frankly, it never looks like he's serious about it. He's most likely making an excuse to keep you as a test subject just to learn more about humans. A hidden agenda on the Pokemon's part, perhaps. It's all starting to make sense. The body scanning, the abrupt and unwelcomed thoughts, and even the powers Dialga granted you are all one big scheme to see how you would react. In your opinion, that just further demonstrate that this 'demigod' is just playing you for fool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weighed your options and made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you, Raikou,\" you answered the Electric Pokemon, \"Perhaps you would be a better host for me in light of the recent discoveries about Dialga's snooping practices. Between all of this, I just about had enough of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. We'll tell Suicune about it and see what we could do for you,\" Raikou smiled gently, \"Once we're out of here, we've got all the time we need to figure out a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how exactly can we make it out of here without Dialga knowing? Once Suicune leaves the brain he'll regain full control and I doubt he would be happy about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, that's the trickier part of the escape. That and the various security features in here are what we have to deal with. It won't be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't Suicune deactivated all surveillance equipment in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's only about half of it. You see, when I explored around this morning, I noticed that Dialga's body has several layers of safeguards that are independent of his consciousness and control. The security apparatus ranges from basic antivirus sensors to encrypted password entry/exit processor. It similar to the autoimmune system of organic beings. Their job is to prevent anything malicious from entering and data from exiting without authorization. There is also a set time window where Dialga's body with perform routine scans to check the system for alteration and corrections. Effectively, without some kind of hack 'key' or computational error, we're out of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we figure out a way to send a virus or at least glitch his system? Dialga's a giant walking computer after all,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible. Dialga isn't some cheap Pokedex that you can modify at will. He's more a sentient supercomputer armed with metaphysical properties. The best electrical glitch I can come up with will be mere parlor tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...Let's hope that Suicune has better ideas up her sleeves, Raikou.\"<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Suicune is back at having fun controlling Dialga, making the dragon do all sorts of silly gestures and walking. Suicune smiled as she felt triumph for the first time over the Pokemon she despised the most. On the display screen Dialga is still trying his best to persuade Suicune out of controlling him. Offers of forgiveness and cessation of unwanted advances did not shake the Aurora Pokemon's resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;Come on, Suicune. There is absolutely no need to go down this route. Just step away from the control and I'll give you several Ancient Power upgrades you wanted so much. We can resolve this in a calm and mature way. After that, we can just forget about this whole thing and move on.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, proposal denied. Just shut up already. You've been parroting the same thing for like an hour already and I'm getting sick and tired of it,\" Suicune said annoyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;Aren't you at all interested? These powers could make your reign much easier. I'm sure that Entei would be impressed if you show him the abilities I'll give you.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a big NO. The thing I'll be more interested in is whether or not your dick will stand a second impact which I'm more than happy to give you if you don't stop,\" the Pokemon barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;Still being a mean girl, huh? I'm really hurt by your remark. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/frown.png\" alt=\"*Frown*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Frown\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> And that ramming did a load to my 'pride'. I'm offering an easy way but still you refused to take it?</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your bait-and-switch all too well, Dialga. Like last time when you tricked into an ice cave that you claim contains energy crystals. Rather than crystals, I found you once again pestering me to no ends. I'm glad that Entei came and gave you a whipping otherwise there is no knowing what you would do to me. Perhaps, that perverted dating simulation is a dress rehearsal. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;...Let's not talk about that, shall we? Before you ask, I know that game that you're up to. You are trying to take the human with you. No way I'm allowing that! Now, back to the topic for you to relinquish control of me.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This conversation is getting us nowhere, Dialga. There is no purpose in continuing it. No chance I'm letting you take advantage of me or the human again. So you can save your batteries and just let me have my fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;You are really getting on my nerves now, Suicune! Step away from the damn control!!!</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Can't stand the taste of your own medicine, Dialga. You have no rights to complain. You had this one coming a long time,\" Suicune smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;You're taking this as a FUCKING joke, Suicune?!! If you were ever a program file on my system, you know what I'm gonna do to you? I'm gonna quarantine you within several encrypted file layers, slowly run all thinkable 'torture programs' on you, ram you several times through a firewall before I DELETE what's left of your pathetic codes from a miserable existence!</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sure. And how do you plan to do that, huh? ...Oh I remember, you can't. Because you don't own me, idiot!\" Suicune said sardonically, \"So much for the peace offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;...... Words....cannot express how much I hate you right now. &gt;: - (</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've said the same thing about you.\"</span></div></div>",

Hopefully the escape could start as soon as you got up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou set for you and Suicune a place to be able to talk. You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We need to escape, but it won't be easy. There are many ways out of Dialga's body, but chances are that we won't be able to just walk through them. Any ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I propose to knock Dialga out, then we take that as a chance to escape. I can make him fall pretty easily\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even with him unconscious, there are several defenses that we can't disable\"-Raikou added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If Dialga is unconscious, then he can't actively try to stop our escape, and we'll have better probabilities of being far when he is awake. I say we put that in the plan\"- you proposed. There were no objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are other ways to bypass the defenses. Apparently, the most basic functions aren't as protected. Suicune and I entered disguised as food. As much as I dislike it, we could come out disguised as..\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop talking. Right now.\"- Suicune interrupted -\"Mark it as Plan Z, but there is no way I go through that experience willingly\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that we should use a way out that is close to the brain, so we don't waste time. There are several options. Which one could be the most unprotected?\"- you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can rule out the mouth. I can't see how we could open it from inside\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If some sort of command from Dialga is needed, then what could we do? No matter which way we choose, then we would still be stuck\"-Raikou pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.\"I can deal with that from here. If there is a password, surely it is about me, or about how great he is\"- Suicune was confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raikou and I could go ahead through the chosen path and check any obstacles. If we find any, we could notify Suicune, and she tries to deactivate it. Then once the path is clear, I could stop time so she can reunite with us. It'll be only for a short amount of time, though. I don't have full control over this time stuff\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"After we're out then we'll have to run. At least we're fast, so despite our actual size, it shouldn't be a problem, while Dialga is unconscious\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The human will have to ride one of us\"- Suicune added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll carry him. The human is going to stay with me after I return to my normal size. I'll leave him in a safe place while you and I go and get ourselves back to normal\"- Raikou replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that is all there is to discuss\"- Suicune finished. You agreed. It seemed like a pretty simple plan, but one never knew what problems there could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou and you finally arrived the brain, and looked for Suicune. She was still taunting Dialga, and getting more angered responses from him. Once she noticed your presence, she nodded. She was getting ready to knock out Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What path will we choose?\"- Raikou whispered. You meditated the options. You could think four possibilities in the head. Which one could work? You made your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll say the snout is our best bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought is interrupted by a loud \"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we choose somewhere else to make our exit?\" Suicune asked with obvious disgust, \"NO way I'm going through there. I can only imagine how filthy it'll make all of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really makes no difference,\" you replied, \"Even if we went through the ears or eye sockets, contact with body fluids, grim, and the likes is inevitable. We might have to get a little dirty here. We got choices to make or are you willing to be forever a resident in Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. The human has a point. No better alternatives I could think of, Suicune,\" Raikou added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever a resident in here? But I.....no........\"<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><i>Suicune imagined herself several years from now. She is still trapped in Dialga all by herself. The human and Raikou had long been banished to dimensional limbo in perpetuity for their foolish attempt to escape a Temporal Pokemon. Dialga has remade his mechanical innards into a gigantic residence solely for Suicune but it feels more like a prison for the Aurora Pokemon. Since control has been restored that fateful day, Dialga followed through on his promise of sweet revenge and made Suicune run all sorts of services in his body. Most of her time is spent on making metalwork replacement parts, fixing errors, and watching the creation and destruction of the cosmic as Dialga transverse time space. Days are often long and slow and perhaps, Dialga deliberately made it so. Escape at this point is impossible for her; her entire brain, thoughts, movements, and power were closely watched by Dialga's internal computer. Many evenings, Dialga would take Suicune out on a date in various computer-generated environments that he thinks suit the mood. On occasion, he would simulate Suicune's forest home to cheer her up. But his clumsiness and unrealistic expectations about her has only gotten worse since. A pre-written script sometimes provided the 'story' that Dialga has written for her to act out, some of them with intimate endings....</i></span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune cringed at the thought of the possible consequences for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. But once we get out of here, I'll get back to you on this, human. You owe me one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a quick nod in acknowledgement and prepared for what will be the grand finale she had longed for her whole life. Now, Suicune needs to find a suitable spot to give Dialga just the right force to his head. Even with a metallic skull, a blunt force trauma should do the job of rendering her out cold. The Pokemon spied a thick tree trunk directly in her line of sight. The tree looks solid and wide enough to handle the force of impact. <i>Perfect</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight, boys,\" Suicune warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bared her trademark smirk and rammed down on the control at full speed. The entire room jerked and tumbled, knocking you and Raikou off your feet. Suicune held on tight to the floor with her claws and watch the screens intently. The trunk gets larger and closer by the second. Then... a large slam reverberated in the chamber. Everything became a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;AHHHHHHH NOT AGAIN........DAMN YOU, SUICUNE!!!!!!!! ~~~~~  @ER##46810&amp; System Fail___</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rumble subsides, you gradually recovered from the impact and stand up to see that all of Dialga's screens are displaying error messages. Suicune has succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulation Suicune! Dialga will not be able to recover until 11 hours from now,\" Raikou exclaimed, \"No time to idle, let's get out of here now before more trouble comes our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you quickly left the the Control Room to find the way to the snout. The impact seems to have damaged a lot of the electronic doors, forcing them wide open for you to easily walk through. Electric sparks are shooting out of the ceilings and side panels at random points like a short-circuited computer underwater. Suicune and Raikou are dashing as fast as they could to check on every side tunnels and chambers, sensing the exit solely by intuition. Your mind is completely focused on finding the exit, only momentarily interrupted when you try to catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple flight of stairways down, the nostrils were located. As you imagined, the passage is dripping with glowing mucus and boulder-sized dirt on walls and the floor. Blue sparks jumping off the mucus indicates that they're electrified. <i>That's something original</i>, you thought. You warned the two Pokemon about it and carefully transverse the passage. You all carefully made your way through the passage, stepping only on areas that are dry and moving your heads to dodge the gunk dripping from above. The end of the tunnel is guarded by a single working security station. You can see lights underneath the door. When you activated the station, it requests a password and gave you a hint: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><u>A pair of rubies that captures my soul amid rainbow hues. I see my smiling reflection in them as you welcome my lips with a blissful tongue.</u> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/suitheart.png\" alt=\"*SuitHeart*\" title=\"SuitHeart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness. I was right. His password really is me,\" Suicune muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou typed: <b>suicune</b>........Access granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lock opened and revealed sunlight. Suicune and Raikou were the first to step out, relishing the fresh air and warmth of summer. You remained behind at the security station to type one final message for Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div class=\"bquote\">Dialga,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time for you to realize something. I know of what you did behind my back. Raikou and Suicune told me everything. All those thought-monitoring is pretty fun, isn't it? I don't find it amusing at all. You never intended to return me to normal. Instead, you kept me as a test subject for your weird purpose. I strongly object to your practice.  Most of all, I find your treatment of Suicune is be the worst. It's clear the girl never wants you. That's why I'm leaving you for good. Good Bye and don't try to find me. Maybe Arceus would love to hear your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Former Captive<br>\r\n<br>\r\np.s. thanks for the temporal power, they'll come in handy for me :P</div><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you head for freedom without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once you got used to it, you looked towards the ground. Raikou and Suicune had already descended, and now were waiting for you. You didn't even look back to the cave you had came from, and started to descend through Dialga's skin. It was a slow task for you, but soon you managed to step on the solid ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good! Now let's get out of here\"- Suicune said, impatiently. Raikou told you to ride on his back, and once you were properly secured, the Pokemon started running. There was silence for a good while, until you asked something that had started to bother you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How will you two return to normal size?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's complicated. Maybe it could work for you too? How did you get shrunk?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Palkia did it. It was an accident\"- you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh...then it won't work. It'd be better if Palkia fixed your problem. I'll talk to him, don't worry, I'll deal with it\"- Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you and the Legendaries arrived to a forest. There was less speed now, due to a lot of obstacles. After wandering for a while, Suicune approached a hollow section of a tree. -\"The human should hide here while we go to get our normal sizes back. We'll go faster without him on your back\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed that you were fine with it. Once they made sure you were well hidden, they got ready to leave. -\"Thank you for everything, human. Don't fall inside Dialga again\"- she said before leaving. Raikou told you he would be back as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent around half an hour hidden, hoping that your soon-to-be-host would return soon. You finally hear his voice outside, and see a yellow toe outside. -I'm back, human! You can come out\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of your hideout, and you instantly feel overwhelmed by Raikou's normal size. You had gotten used to see him as more or less your same size, but now, despite him being three times smaller than Dialga, he was now humongous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you ready to come with me? I have prepared the most basic stuff for you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him that you're ready. Raikou lowers his head and opens his mouth. You can't avoid recoiling for a moment, but you gather courage and enter his mouth. It takes you a moment, but you manage to get on his tongue, but before you walk towards the throat, Raikou talks again. -\"We should start moving again. The further we're from Dialga, the better. Hold on tight, human\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Reacted quickly, and grasp as much tongue as you can. You could swear you could see the tastebuds, once another reminder of your size. Then Raikou started running, full speed. If you hadn't grabbed the tongue as strong as you could, you would have flown to the back of Raikou's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know for how long you held on the tongue. While you were doing that, several thoughts crossed your mind. Raikou said he would talk to Palkia. It kind of worried you, but you calmed down thinking that Raikou was capable of dealing with it. And even if Palkia gave a solution...was it really needed for you to return to normal in that moment? You were surprised to notice that you were interested to explore Raikou's insides. Unlike Dialga, your new host was a fully organic Pokemon. Surely there were many differences betwee  Dialga's body and Raikou's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour host stopped running. -\"We're pretty far now. We can relax. Are you okay, human?\"- You reply that you're okay. Raikou starts talking in a more excited tone now. -\"I can't believe a human will live inside me! I hope I can make it interest for you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Surely you will\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Great! Now why don't you go down and start your journey inside me? You know the path. Once you get to my stomach you should be able to go to other places. Sorry if there is a mess in there\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and face Raikou's throat. You felt a growing excitement too. You stood up and started walking to what would be the beginning of your stay inside your new host.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even in the darkness, you can still make out muscles and fleshes squirm and contracts as warm, moist air rushed against you. A giant uvula above dangled in the strong wind like a pendulum within a well-tuned clock. You remained in place only to feel Raikou's heavy breathing threatening several times to knock you off balance but you luckily secured your feet between the taste buds.The prospect of falling down yet another dark chasm no longer really scares you. In fact, you are more intrigued by the organic nature of your new host and what you might find down there. Raikou felt you remaining on his tongue for the last 10 minutes. The Electric Pokemon reassured you that living with him would be a remarkably different experience and promised you that he won't do anything invasive without you agreeing to it. You appreciate his straightforwardness which is a vast improvement over your last accommodator which you would rather forget soon. That Pokemon is now a mere afterthought as you prepared to make your leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped off the ledge and began to free fall in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall isn't as bad as you remembered but the feeling of your stomach turning is still a nauseous one. But there is no way in alleviating that this time seeing that Raikou lacks that ability to slow down time to reduce your imminent impact in his stomach. Within a snap second, you mentally smacked yourself in the head when you recalled that you still have some temporal power left over from Dialga. You started focusing your mind and try to access the power that is stored within it. It took some efforts for you to concentrate amid the disorientating direction and nausea but you managed to slow yourself down slightly. By your own calculation, you're still falling too fast to make a comfortable landing. You know it's too late to try again as you swiftly sailed past the opening to the stomach and toward the welcoming pool of stomach acids. <i>Brace for impact.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLASH!!! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt warm liquids washing over your face and a sharp acidic odor invaded your nostrils. Your tongue caught a few drops of the acids which made your mouth pucker up in disgust. You flailed your arms wildly in an attempt to find the right side up. When you did emerge on the surface, you are once again assaulted by the smell of acids around you. You held onto your breath and swam toward the edge of the stomach which fortunately contains a dock of some kind. You climbed up and spent several minutes trying to remove any bits of food clinging to your body. The dock gave you a general view of the stomach which is filled with unrecognizable pieces of a previous meal. Behind you are a dozen or so closed openings that will soon be yours to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...heh...Sorry about the mess,\" Raikou said sheepishly, \"I guess I shouldn't have eaten that much for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot a glare toward the source of the Pokemon's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" you deadpanned, \"Aren't you supposed to warn me about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I warned you on your way in but you probably missed it in your excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you have drained out your stomach first before allowing me to fall into some soggy remnants of a Berry pie?\" you tried to say while breathing as little of the air as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I liked to, I can't control most of my body functions the way Dialga did it. Everything works the natural way in my digestive system. Again, I'm sorry about it. Please don't be mad at me,\" Raikou said in an attempt to placate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not really mad at you for this, Raikou. It's just that in addition to ruining my only clothes, I now smell like a person who hadn't bathed in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. You don't have to hide you feelings from me, you know. I can feel your frustration lingering beneath that veneer of calm. I'll see what I can do to make up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Doing something about this smell first and my clothes will be a good place to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sphincter behind you opened up to reveal a set of stairs for you to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the stairs up. I have prepared the appropriate things you will need in your room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I appreciate that,\" you said, \"And by the way, you should slow down on all those berry pies or you'll likely get 'thunder thighs'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that again if I were you,\" Raikou shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? 'Cause the term can be used literally for you?\" you jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It just reminds me of this one time where a Luxray friend of mine used the same word to describe Suicune, right in front of her. The guy was flirting with her and attempted to ask her out. He was far less obnoxious than Dialga but she still take kindly to him using that term. He got all his electricity knocked out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He kinda deserved it anyway for being foolish and oblivious to the meaning of 'thunder thighs'. Maybe he thought it's some compliment used for an attractive electric Pokemon. Lucky for you, Suicune isn't around here; She's keeping it low for the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! She can't be all alone out there. I bet Dialga is feeling mighty pissed right now. At any moment he wakes up, she'll be the first he'll be looking for. I can imagine the murderous look in his eyes as he stormed every corner of the world, searching for his prey. Poor Suicune didn't know what coming for here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry! I told her about my worries which are similar to yours. After much persuasion, Suicune decided to remain small and guess where she is right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....no way. You're also keeping her in your body, aren't you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Raikou answered as matter of factly, \"The least-likely place that Dialga would look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll be sticking together after all. Alright then, show me the way up, Raikou.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From time to time there were other branches, but Raikou always closed them and led you through the right one. After a good while, when you were starting to get tired, you arrived to a chamber, where you found two odd mounds. You approached one, and found that it was soft and cozy. You guessed that it was going to be your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This room is pretty empty, don't you think?\"- you say, looking around. Besides the lumps that would be the beds, there was nothing else, just two doors. You had entered through one of them, while the other was unexplored so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I said I only had the very basics ready\"- Raikou reminded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where's Suicune?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She is looking for a place for her to relax. You should go meet with her later\"- he suggested. You nodded, and walked to the other door. Behind it you found a big pool of what seemed to be clear water. It was a nice sight, as you really wanted to take a bath. You took all the dirty clothes quickly, and entered the pool. The water was cold, but it was pretty relaxing. You let yourself sink until you were fully covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath for a minute, letting yourself be fully soaked by the water, and when you couldn't resist more you resurfaced. You swam around, enjoying the pool. Staying inside Raikou was going to be a good experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you judged you were finally gotten rid of any traces of the acids and the bad smell, you exited the pool. Raikou notified you that he had left a clean set of clothes inside your 'bed'. You picked up your dirty clothes and saw a chute on the floor. You threw them in it, supposing it was a toilet or similar. Raikou confirmed that it was, when he asked you why you had done that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could try to retrieve them for you, if it was an accident'\"- he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not wearing them again. I didn't like them that much, though, don't worry\"- You reentered your room, and found the clothes that you had been offered. It was a  yellow and black simplistic design, with a stripes design. After getting dressed, you took a moment to evaluate your first hour inside Raikou. It had been a relatively nice start, leaving aside the unwanted plunge into the stomach content, and the prospect of living with Suicune for a while was actually appealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you ready? Suicune is over at the Leisure Room, let's call it that. It's the room with the big platform in middle, it's near your actual location. So far it's empty besides that, but in the future it should have ways for you two to be entertained\"- he indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to meet Suicune. You peeked through several entrances, until you found the right one. There was Suicune, sitting on the platform, clearly waiting for you. You stepped inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Leisure Room, as Raikou named it, was a fairly large room. The ample spacing is enough to accommodate your old bedroom several times over. Memories of your old room and stuffs you did in your free time reminded you how long you've been removed from your old life. Though, admittedly, things are more interesting now, you kind of missed your home. You placed your thoughts aside and surveyed the room for more details. The velvety walls are colored pale blue to match a light yellow carpeting which feels like thick fur. Lighting is provided by the ceiling itself which gives off a soft yellow ambiance.  By the look alone, you could tell that this chamber is designed for comfort and Raikou did quite a good job at it. Other than the center platform, the room is devoid of anything else excluding you and the Aurora Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune heard faint footsteps and took notice of your entrance into the room. She turned her head toward you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back. Good to see ya again. Come on over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beckoned for you come closer. You complied and walked toward the Pokemon. When you got to her, an indecipherable expression found its way onto her muzzle. Suicune's eyes scanned you several times, scrutinizing every inch of your body. Upon her fourth head to toe scan, she placed a paw over her mouth as a light chuckle came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some cute Raikou costume you've got there, human,\" Suicune complimented, \"I must say that you need to substantially improve your sense of design when it comes to imitating a Pokemon's appearance. Raikou's gonna have a laugh out of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These aren't mine,\" you corrected her, \"Raikou let me have these after he ruined my old clothes with a stomach full of Berry pies. My goodness, he sure has a voluptuous appetite. You know, it took me several dunks in the pool to remove that horrid smell from my body. As kitschy as the designs are, it's still better than no clothes at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Raikou got lots of improvements to make then. It still looks cute on you though,\" Suicune giggled, \"I always wonder why humans always insist on wearing clothes. It's not like we don't know the details of each others body,\" Suicune commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more of a modesty thing among humans, Suicune. You see, being without clothing is frowned upon in our society. You'll be considered weird at best. It's analogous to walking around without your fur,\" you said as you pulled the long sleeves of your shirt to make a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, without my fur? That's sound awful! I wouldn't want to be caught in those situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our clothing is also used to obscure our more intimate part of the body,\" you continued, \"Having those parts visible will be viewed as making advances for each gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no other humans around here so there's no one to judge you. And clothes aren't really useful for Pokemon unless they're attending some beauty contests. I wouldn't feel a bit uncomfortable if you're without clothing. Seems more natural to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you suggesting that I go naked in here? No no no. I couldn't just do that. It just feels so.....wrong for me,\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I didn't say that. You're getting the wrong idea here, dude,\" Suicune said with a light blush, \"I'm speaking from my perspective as a Pokemon on human stuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh sorry. So how exactly did you made it into Raikou without getting all drenched in acids like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light frown formed on Suicune's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had it just as worse. Raikou didn't even warn me about his stomach content. I plunged head first into that stuff and nearly got sent into his digestive tracts. As for the smell, if it could linger that long on your skin, just imagine its effect on fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune shot a look toward the ceiling as if to catch Raikou's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he have any idea of what he did to me? Why didn't he warn poor little Suicune that she's about to be drenched in his breakfast?\" Suicune said with mock melodrama, \"I thought I would lost my fur to the acid. Oh the horror...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune,\" you said, \"Hopefully, Raikou would be more careful next time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better be! One more mistake and I'll be more than happy to do a rerun of Dialga on him,\" the Aurora Pokemon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he'll get your message, Suicune. What you did back there is more than enough a deterrent,\" you assured the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. Anyway, what could we do now? I'm getting bored by this empty room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou didn't tell me much other than this Leisure Room. Maybe there's something we could do down the passageway.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's something exciting on just exploring mindlessly around, without knowing what you can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're not going back to the stomach. I don't want to enter that place during the rest of my stay in here\"- Suicune said grumpily while she came out of the Leisure Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We won't, I hope, but if we don't find anything, we could take another route from there. I saw a dozen entrances or so in the stomach\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking down, and entered through the first possible path you found. You're now in a cramped room, with a lot of small glass spheres. You pick one, and examine what's inside. It's a piece of a leaf, looking as if it had been recently tore from a plant. Other spheres has different samples of leaves, roots, mushrooms or fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, the first thing we stumbled upon is a testimony of Raikou's bookworm status. Not the best first choice, human\"- Suicune comments<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Should I be insulted, Suicune?\"- you hear Raikou -\"You two are now in the place where I keep my samples of the stuff I have tried before. I like to check the different effects certain plant elements has on Pok\u00e9mon\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you try them on yourself?\"- you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My own body is the most reliable testing ground I know. I can feel every single effect, and based on that I remember which plant elements are beneficial and which ones are harmful\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That sounds actually dangerous! What if you eat something poisonous?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm very careful, always having small doses and antidotes ready if it ends being toxic. Besides, I'm much more resistant than you think, human. If Suicune or you ever feel sick, tell me. These samples will help you. They're too small to cause any effect on me, but they'll be perfect for you two. I have a few new samples I collected from that forest where I returned to normal\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're somewhat impressed by Raikou's dedication. There are dozens of different samples, and several of them seem to have caused adverse effects on him. It does take dedication to take risks like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's go somewhere else\"- Suicune said, pushing you towards the entrance. You comply, and go down the passageway until you find another possibility. This time there's a small tunnel at the other side, where you need to crawl. At the end of it, you're knocked down by the wind, just when you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Suicune, I think we're in...\"- you start saying, but Suicune interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're in his lungs, yes. I'm not completely satisfied with your luck choosing places to visit, but at least here we could do something\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something like what?\"- you ask. There isn't anything remarkable in the huge chamber you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something like...you're it!\"- she tackles you, once again causing you to fall. She runs away, bouncing and letting the wind carry her around. You didn't expect her to want to play games around, but you chalk it up to it being her way to coping not having anything else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia finally appeared as online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey Palkia. There's something I need to tell you about. It's an, eh, curious case</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">What's it now? Again got killer cramps from eating random stuff?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">No. There's this tiny human, and he needs help to get back to normal. I was wondering if you could help him</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I can, but I thought it was with Dialga</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">So you knew about him? He is inside me right now</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I suppose Dialga screwed up. And he says I'm the one who makes big blunders. What did he do to the human?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">It's a long story. Can you help him?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I could but I won't. Raikou, that human is not just a simple human. That's why Dialga gave him minimal temporal powers. The human fits one of those legends you should have read about.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">What should be done, then?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Keep him for now. I'll try to find somebody who train the human to enhance his temporal powers. Mew should do it, she's not as good as Dialga, but she can do it. The human won't even have to leave your body to receive the training, she could train him telepathically. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Should I tell the human? Seeing how big part of the problem he had with Dialga was that he didn't tell him everything...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Do it, then. I'll contact Mew. Meanwhile, tell me everything that happened with Dialga. Don't worry, I'm on you and the human's side</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sudden tackle by Suicune was hard enough to make your chest hurt. You lie on the floor trying to catch your breath and get those sparkling stars out of your vision. It never ceased to amaze you how unpredictable the Aurora Pokemon could be. Her mood swings is at work again. It's gotta be that impulsive, competitive streak in her. You slowly righted yourself up as the aching in your torso gradually fades. Suicune stood right next to you giving off a confident smirk that's getting wider by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you exclaimed, \"Could you've at least given me some warning? Humans aren't exactly as well-built as Pokemons are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't handle a little bump, human? I thought you could get used to a little surprise. Haven't any other Pokemons tackled you before?\", Suicune asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but they are way smaller and lighter than you, Suicune. I could handle a Skitty or two, but you would crush my ribs with those strong paws of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even use a quarter of my strength yet you looked shaken already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've injured me or worse,\" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you seem fine to me,\" Suicune said as she eyed you, \"Toughen up, will ya? By the way, it's your turn to catch me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? I haven't even...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Suicune exclaimed, \"Quit the talking and start playing. I said that you're it. Come on, I wanna have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest, Suicune went off and resumed jumping around in the lung. <i>I don't even know what to think of her</i>, you thought,<i> she's just so random.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started chasing after the elusive Pokemon. Several times you came close to grasping her flowing tail. But Suicune always finds a way to evade you at the last moment. She giggled whenever you made a frustrating grunt, teasing you about how she overestimated your ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the best you can do, Slowpoke?\" Suicune taunted, \"I'm starting to get bored. Yet another reason why Pokemons are the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pounced around the lung faster than your eyes could follow. To you, she is just a quick blue blur. Seeing her filled with excitement is surprising given how she tried to project herself as serious and analytical. Though she may come off as a little dickish sometimes, you bet that she's really just trying to coverup her soft side. It's uplifting to see Suicune enjoying her time even though it's tiring you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There must be a way I can catch her. Her movement is far faster than an average human with her flexibility further aiding her. Without some form of power, chances of catching her are close to zero. Using my temporal power would be a bit low but there's no other choice. I just gotta make it believable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated and focused yourself on slowing time to about 3/4 the normal speed. A faint aura formed and radiated from your head and spread out across the lung. Its effect was immediate. Suicune slowed down enough for you to make out the confidant smile still plastered on her face. You took the opportunity and slowly walked toward her. You exaggerated your arms swings and take wide steps to make your \"running\" more convincing from Suicune's point of view. In no time, you touched her sides as a look of shocked slowly formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're it, Suicune\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaaat'sssss immpossibbleee. IIIIII'mmmmm caaughht,\" Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at the low and prolonged effect your temporal power had on her voice. You quickly restored time to<br>\r\nit's normal pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a stroke of luck I guess,\" you smirked, \"Or...perhaps you've had a generous amount of cake yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune's shocked expression quickly turned into a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used temporal power, didn't you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...yea. It's practically impossible to catch you without some additional help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cheating! I demand a rematch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Suicune, you even said that no one has ever caught you in this game before. You even said that you are bored by the same results everytime. I thought I could do something a bit more refreshing by using a bit of strategy. Plus, you didn't exactly prohibit me from using my powers,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. But I'll get back to you real soon,\" Suicune groaned, \"Could we do something else now? I need something to get my mind off losing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let walk back up the passage to see if we missed anything.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though she went in front of a lot of entrances, she didn't stop at any. You're amused at her intent at beating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How longer will we keep going?\"- you ask, starting to feel tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you when we're done\"- that was her reply. You have the feeling she's trying to exhaust you. However, her plans come to an end when the path just ends with an entrance. Suicune opens it, grumbling. You follow her, trying to regain your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where are we?\"- you ask, before even taking a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Judging by the two giant pupils in front of us, then I think it's obvious where we are\"- she says bluntly. You finally bother to look around. Indeed, you saw what Suicune was talking about. You also noticed the perfect roundness of the room, and how it was paler than the rest of the places you had seen so far. There was also an odd wire thing at the back. It's perfectly obvious for you that you're in the space behind the eyes. It's odd that they aren't separate eyeballs, but a big room divided in two sections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why don't we rest, Suicune? I'm about to faint\"- you say, exaggerating how tired you are, in an effort to make her stay for a while. It works, as Suicune laid on the floor. You sat, and took deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune and you spent around ten minutes watching whatever Raikou was doing. Your host was walking around the forest, without a destination. From time to time he picked stuff from the floor, which you suppose are stuff he'll check later. There's something relaxing on watching him continue his life, as if he hadn't gotten out of another Pok\u00e9mon a few hours ago or now had a human and a Legendary inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you felt good enough to continue going around, hopefully without Suicune forcing you to run out of energy. Before you stood up, Suicune approached the eye itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wow, you have to check this, human!\"- she said, surprised. You approached, and tried to see whatever it was. In that position, it was hard to see through the eye. -\"Lean closer. It's amazing\"- you leaned closer, trying to see what had caused so much amazement from Suicune. Suddenly you felt yourself pushed through the eye, and you felt in a harder surface. A quick look around shows that she pushed you out of Raikou, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn it!\"- you start pounding on the eye, inadvertently causing pain to Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop that!\"- you hear him say. You tell him what Suicune did. At the end, he nods, almost making you lose your balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I see it, she's trying to ascertain her superiority over you. It's possible that she's also taking a small revenge for you making her go through Dialga's snout\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I need to stop that before she does something else\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then you should show her that you're superior. Do something that shows she'll never beat you. Once she realizes it's useless to resist, she'll leave you alone. But be careful not to exaggerate, or her small games may turn into something real big for you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to him, and start thinking of ways you could do it. It's hard to think of something good enough but not too harsh. -\"I'll think later. For now I want to be back inside\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My eye isn't an entrance. You'll have to enter through some other way\"- he informs you. You walk to the edge of the odd mask thing you had seen on Raikou before, and look down. You had to enter the body again. The mouth was good enough for this, as long as you didn't go and splash into the stomach again. Maybe you could walk slowly down the throat until you find a way that isn't the stomach? Or maybe you could enter into Raikou through some other way. Whatever you chose, it had to be quick, before Suicune had the time to prepare something else for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those red mirrors glimmered with concern and fear for what Suicune may have planned for you. They are eyes that have seen what the Aurora Pokemon can wreak if you slighted her. In response, you nodded and confidently gave Raikou a salute despite being unsure yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the worried look, you can see Suicune in his pupil barely containing her laughter as though she just watched a comedy. You can't hear her laughter but you knew that she likely witnessed the entire exchange between you and Raikou. You glared at her and told her that you won't put up with her behavior any longer. She just winked at you and mouthed what you interpret as \"smell ya later\" before disappearing from view. It made you even more lurid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suicune is so dead for pushing me out like that. I swear I'll find her and push her off Mt. Coronet  if I need to. Well, it's partially my fault for trusting her so easily. I really need to start taking her words with a grain of salt. Is she still pissed about the tag game? Very likely and this is just the beginning for her. But it'll take a lot more effort before she could assert her superiority over me... I'll never understand what's going on behind that girl's head.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed your way down to Raikou's muzzle. Going through the mouth may be the safest option for the time even if it means taking another plunge into the stomach. You told the Electric Pokemon your plan. He agreed and instructed you to follow the contour of his mask, reminding you that the mask is quite steep at your size. Once you reached the edge of his mouth, you are flanked on either sides by two colossal fangs. The Pokemon felt your arrival and promptly opened it and allowed you to enter. You walked toward the edge of the tongue when uncertainty clouds your thoughts <br>\r\nonce more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou, I really don't wanna get covered in digested muck again. Is your stomach the only way I can enter your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, that's the easiest way in and my breakfast isn't going through my intestines anytime soon.\" The Pokemon's deep voice resonated throughout the mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man,\" you groaned, \"You got so many routes in and out your body. There must be some that we haven't gone over yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you thinking about alternative openings, are you seriously considering using the 'back door' or even my dick for a lack of better word?\" Raikou asked bewilderingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoiled with disgust at the other options. There's no way you would go to either place unless necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I crossed out those choices long ago. What I meant to say was: is there any other places I can go to down your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou paused and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that what you want, then there is one place you can go to. Midway between my throat and stomach, there is another opening which will direct you to the Research and Analysis Center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A place where I observe and record things for my research. You really gotta see that place. All subjects that goes here will be tested by the most advanced apparatuses I have. The information I gained will be transferred to a encyclopedia in my brain for personal use. I have collected plants, rocks, minerals, and other things. It's one of my most awesome accomplishments!\" Raikou said with nerdy squee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm, Raikou. You're losing me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, sorry. Got carried away again. It's just that I'd like to ask if you want to allow me to do some research you? Previously, I can only make visual observation of Pokemons around me and less so for humans. You'll be the first living thing and first human subject to be observed and analyzed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, are you sure you know what you're doing?\" you asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, human. All things you disclosed will be purely voluntary. Unlike Dialga, no mind tricks will be involved and no information will be shared to others or the PokeWeb. All will be safely here with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune won't find me, will she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, while I'm conducting the research, all entrances to the center will be sealed off. She has no idea this placed even existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, I'll give it a try. For knowledge, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped down the throat and instead of falling into the stomach, you are guided toward another opening in the gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is gonna be so great! What should I collect first? Fingerprints, eye scans, voice print, sample collection, measurements, brainwaves, questionnaires, cultural studies...etc......!!! So many things to do!\" Raikou said with increasing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou! Calm down! You're kinda creeping me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops..sorry. Just too excited at the opportunity.\"</span></div></div>",

You covered your eyes, until you were sure you could look around without being blinded. You removed your hands and examined the new place. It reminded you too much of Dialga\u2019s insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral screens filled the walls, with small blinking numbers in them in constant changing. Machines of unknown purposes littered around the room. \u2013\u201cThis place is the most technological you\u2019ll see inside me\u201d- the host\u2019s voice commented \u2013\u201cSit on the chair, and we\u2019ll start\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the chair. You\u2019re very nervous, as you really don\u2019t know how gently Raikou will examine you. You kind of feared he\u2019d go overboard with his excitement and accidentally hurt you. You sat, and long wires fell from the ceiling. Raikou instructed you to stick the wires in key points of your head and chest. \u2013\u201cYes, it\u2019s all set. We\u2019ll start with the most basic stuff, and then we\u2019ll progress into more specific. Now type into this keyboard your answer to the questions I\u2019ll make now\u201d- just as he said that, a keyboard rose from the floor. Definitely this place was too much like Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou asked you a lot of questions. Some of them were obviously made as a way to test your responses and how you reacted to them, while others were more about your past life in human society. Raikou kept musing \u2018Oooh, that explains it!\u2019 and \u2018This is some good data\u201d, although you were sure that at times those words weren\u2019t directed at your answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also made you go through several physical tests. Treadmills, weights, ropes, among other different stuff, appeared with each test. You did your best. This too brought back memories from the time when Dialga supposedly tested you on several stuff, and now that you see it could be done in a safe place like these testing zones, you were sure that Dialga was messing with you and making you through those experiences just because he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou have been very patient, human. Just one last test, please\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already tired, but you accepted, asking what it would be. Raikou continued \u2013\u201cI need you to use those temporal powers of you for a moment. Slow time or something\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied, and focused. Soon you felt the energy going through you, and knew you were doing it. The numbers of the screen seemed like they were appearing slower, although you had no way to know if your efforts were what did it. You stopped, and the numbers instantly went back to their usual rhythm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThat was amazing! Dialga would have never let me see from so close his powers in action. This blew my mind\u2026and almost did it literally, too. I have a headache now\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cOh no, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have accepted\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just rest. You should go relax too, human; we have been doing this for quite some time already\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off the end of the wires, and looked around once again. Most of the machines weren\u2019t even touched. \u2013\u201cWhat are these things for?\u201d- You asked, looking at the screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cThose screens measure my body functions. Any effect my experiments have on me will be recorded by those screens, so I get to my conclusions. The other machines in that room let me perform different experiments in rocks, mineral, between others. You wouldn\u2019t like to go through them\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machines themselves have several pointy elements that make you agree. You leave the testing area, and go back to your room. All those tests have you tired, but you don\u2019t feel like going to rest now. You go once again take a plunge into your pool, and just let yourself float. You feel good enough to go do a few more stuff before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to eat, and while you\u2019re in it, you remember the other Pokemon that is supposed to be with you. \u2013\u201cWhere\u2019s Suicune?\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cShe\u2019s just exploring around. I bet she\u2019s looking for more ways to make you have a hard time. Have you thought of what you\u2019ll do to triumph over her?\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really think about it, the tests had you distracted. \u2013\u201c\u2026no, I haven\u2019t\u201d- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cYou have a lot of time for that, but be careful. Suicune can be really pesky at times! Hey human, I finished the Leisure Room. Now it does have stuff inside besides a big platform. Want to take a look?\u201d-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do. What could there be in the Leisure Room, now that it was finished?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You traced your steps back to the Leisure Room. When you entered the room, you saw that the room is now filled with several different entertainment devices. There are several board games on tables in one corner. Some are familiar like chess, but you've never seen the other games before. You examined one that is a large cube with a lot of elemental symbols on each side. Another one beside it is a hexagonal board mark with a map of the Kanto region. You looked at several more of the game on each table, each adding a new layer of mystery. If these are games that Pokemons have invented, then you are truly amazed at how advanced they are. Not only can they communicate with each other with their mind, they have also developed some form of games with or without human inspirations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The games you see are some of the most popular games in the Pokemon world. My guess is that you would eventually be bored if all the games are familiar to you. So I decided to do some cultural exchange and introduce you to some of my favorites. Once you get to know the rules, I guarantee that you will be addicted to them.\" Raikou tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any favorites that you can share with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't where to start, human. But can tell you two I played recently. The first one is 'Elemental Bets', a game where players make bets based on their respective element. If the cube falls on an element that matches yours, you can do whatever you want to the next player. But if the element doesn't matches yours, you have to perform something that embarrasses yourself the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty similar to 'Truth or Dare',\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the second one is called \"Trainer!\" In that game, we role-play as a Pokemon trainer as we navigate him through all the cities of Johto. The goal is to defeat all the gym leaders and the Elite Four. Players will take turn making decisions on how to move the trainer within their move limits each turn. Winning or losing Pokemon battles in the game will either increase your move limits or knock you out of the game completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can try some of those later,\" you told Raikou, \"You play these games frequently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Whenever I'm not training or not at Suicune's whim,\" Raikou said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm intrigued. But how did you play games when no one's in here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them are done telepathically with the other Legendaries. Having multiple players is a lot more fun. If you ever want to try them, you can always ask me to teach you the rule.  One thing to take note of: don't ever play with Suicune at your first try. She's a wiz with these games and I haven't beaten her ever since I knew her. But I don't think she's in the mood to play with you now. Go and look around while I keep an eye out for Suicune. There's a lot more things I created for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked across the room and found a large screen with a cool-looking console hooked up to it. The console is a cube with electric yellow details. There isn't a tray for loading a disc or card slot to insert the play media. You pressed what you assumed is the power button and hear the console rev up. The display screen flickered to life. An interface popped up and displayed a list of games to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of my proudest creation: the Pokebox. I created several games for the console I figured that you would like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up an T-shaped controller and looked at the choices you got. Many are games you already knew but with Pokemon theme. One in particular caught your attention: \"Adventure of Suicune: Legend\" You asked Raikou what it's about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one is inspired by recent events we endured together. It's an adventure game starring the titular character trying the save her realm from the sinister Dialga. Wanna play with me? I can can multi-player with you. Just put on the head and start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the controller and place on a headset and ready for a long time of gaming with the Electric Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't let Suicune find this game or we're toast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><br>\r\n&gt;System check.....<br>\r\n&gt;Scanning for possible error==@@#}<br>\r\n&gt;No errors found=0<br>\r\n&gt;Syncing time, date, dimension...<br>\r\n&gt;Restarting system.......all sys go!<br>\r\n&gt;Booting 'main data_dialga'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;SYSTEM_RESTORED<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;1 unread message from unknown<br>\r\n</span></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You glanced at the headset. It looks really uncomfortable, and not something youd really like to have on your head for long. <i>The game Raikou made better be worth it</i> you thought, putting the headset on. You were right, it felt like you head was on a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got this on. Lets start\"- you grabbed the controller, just in case the headset wasnt enough. Sure enough, the screen turned black, and some credits appeared. A rather gaudy start screen filled the display. You saw it automatically move to Multiplayer, so you suppose that Raikou was already controlling his part of the game. Soon a forest appeared. The graphics were actually good, although you considered them outdated, but you cared more about whatever story there could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were controlling Suicune, and to your side, a Raikou model was walking around -\"Thats you, I bet. I mean, youre controlling it\"- you say outloud, and your partner does confirm it. Suddenly a really thin section of the headset lights up, and you see a map with several shapes and a group of red points in some areas. -\"Oh wow, whats this\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thats the game map, itll be very handy for you if you want to really play\"- Raikou explained the mechanics of the map. Apparently the red points were something like Dialgas mooks, metallic creatures with very minor temporal powers. There was no sign of the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon himself yet. -\"The game is divided in missions. Your actual one is to push the invaders out of the area over there\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I do that...like this!\"- you managed to use Ice Beam on a tree, freezing it -\"Oh whooops\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We cant do it alone. Lets gather some allies\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are more people playing this at the same time than us\"- you ask, impressed. Raikous reply disappointed you, though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Im talking about NPC. There are a lot to choose! You just need to know where to look. Let me guide you for a while, then you do the rest\"- he proposed, and without waiting for an answer, his model ran into the woods. You stumbled with the controls and after making Suicune crash against some trees and rocks, you manage to follow Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was pretty much alright. Raikou found several unevolved Pok\u00e9mon, which you supposed would get stronger in battles. He also made you train them by attacking them or making they fight between themselves. Later when you considered you all were ready, you lead all of them towards the enemies you had to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing battle was largely a loss for you, mainly because you hadnt discovered all of Suicunes attacks yet, and when you accidentally used one, at times it hit one of your allies. The only positive side of the ordeal was that everybody gained experience, which was some progress. -\"That was bad. Reorganize and try again\"- your partner said. For the next half hour you made an effort to find as many moves as you could, and practiced against moving targets Raikou had somehow inserted. Soon you felt confident enough to attack again, and this time you and your army managed to get a win. Dialgas invaders retreated to a farther point, and you celebrated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That should conclude the first mission. Dont get cocky, human. Youll also need to defend yourself and your turf, in case of more invasions. If all your areas are defeated, its a game over\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How am I supposed to do that\"- you ask, wanting guidance in this new side of the game<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should place some patrols oveeeeer...this part, I think. Flying types work specially well if you want to have a heads-up\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou and you continued playing, clearing several missions while also having drawbacks at times. Your host even gave you some food right there so you could eat and continue playing, at the same time. You spent around six hours playing, until the screen turned all blurry for you. You were just too sleepy to continue. -\"I think thats enough\"- you took off the headset, and rubbed your temples -\"Why dont you want Suicune to see the game} It seemed great to me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are some parts of the game where she isnt really portrayed in a way shed like. Im not saying theres anything like Dialga did! Its just that in the game she isnt as great as she thinks she is. You know how she is, shell be likely to react wrongly\"- he explained. To you it seemed like a bad explanation, but you werent willing to see by yourself if it was true. The secret was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled around until you returned to your room, and plopped on your overly-soft bed. You notice that Suicune was on her bed as well, apparently sleeping. <i>Where had she gone all this time</i> is your last thought before you drift into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune raises her head and looks at you, smirking. Then she stretches. The human was vulnerable now, but he also was sleeping. What could she do to show that she would be several steps ahead of him...of course! She had found several paths throughout the body, leading to a variety or organs, and several of them would be a nuisance for the human, for whatever reason. It would be matter of dragging him, and he would have a not-so-nice awakening in the morning...but what kind of place would it be...Suicune stood from her bed and carefully grabbed with her teeth the humans leg, trying to not to wake him up, and slowly got him out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air felt still and cold. Much more so than you remembered. Your body shivered from the frigid sensation of wind against your body. Wild dreams faded as you slowly returned to the realm of reality. You stirred and snorted as you tried to regain you sense. <i>Did Raikou left the window open again? Great, now I probably caught a cold.</i>, you thought absentmindedly. The first thing you do is to grab for the blanket and curl up in its embrace. However, your desire for warmth was cut short when you can't feel the blanket anywhere. Moving your legs around yielded a similar result. The bed also feels a lot harder. You gave an annoyed grunt and opened your eyes preparing to catch whoever disturbed your peaceful slumber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your eyes showed you a very unfamiliar environment. You were no longer in your bedroom but rather lying on the metallic floor of a large chamber. You jolted up and slowly take in the new surrounding. The floor you're on is actually a square shaped island in the midst of a neon blue liquid. Electrical sparks can be seen flickering near the surface of the unknown mixture. Tall rods protrudes from the substance and punctured the ceiling into other places above you. The scene is surreal enough but the shock is further compounded by the fact that you are missing your shirts. Your underwear is in full view as you noticed your pants hanging precariously on one leg. Something is definitely wrong here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou? Can you hear me? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Please answer me. If this is one of your weird experiments, I'm telling you that I don't find it funny at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou didn't reply, leaving you calls to echo unaddressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard faint footsteps behind you coupled with a muted giggle. There is only one Pokemon left as the culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune!!!\" you shouted, \" I thought you're better than ambushing your opponent in their sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did someone called me?\" A familiar voice replied sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around and saw Suicune perched atop a balcony way above you looking at you with a mischievous smile. Her red eyes are gleaming at her own handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. Missing me already, human? And I thought I have to be the one to reveal myself to you. Killjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dragged me done here, didn't you?\" you glared at the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct again, my dear human. Boy, were you such a heavy load to get here. First I tore your shirt while biting it. So I grabbed your pants, but it kept sliding off. it was worth the sweat and muscle ache in the end. The good thing is, I got to see what human male anatomy looks like. Those are some fine ones you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what? You can't just...\" your eyes twitched, \"Don't you think you're taking this too far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that I have my ways to be better than you. But you refused to take my threats seriously enough. So I figured that I need to make my moves memorable,\" Suicune chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have let my guards down around you. Where exactly am I?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to tell you, human,\" Suicune said with fake sweetness, \"You're in Raikou's Electrical organ. It's where all his electricity is stored and generated. I found this place when I was exploring. I figured it's the perfect place for my little scheme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your point of getting me here is.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you aware how much voltage Raikou can store in here?\" Suicune interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Approximately enough to power an entire city for ten minutes. The liquid before you is the source of all those electricity. I assume you know what would happen if your body touched it. There will be a firework show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles tensed up at the gruesome imagery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp* Can we talk this over please? Look Suicune, I know you're still pissed about me using temporal power to win that game. But, seriously, do you have to put my life in jeopardy because of that little slight?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, but I was having so much fun with this, human,\" Suicune's voice whined, \"I wanted to teach you an unforgettable lesson. The only way out of this is to play my game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game? Let me guess. Some kind of trial that I have to play to your rules, huh?\" you answered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune's expression brighten up at the remark. The Pokemon suddenly jumped off the platform and landed besides you with precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have to ruin my fun, don't you? Hmmph.\" Suicune turned her nose up at you melodramatically, \"You are right. I have a game planned for you. If you win it, consider us even and we can reset our relationship...but if you lose, you'll gonna have to do what ever I asked of you for two straight weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune brushed up against your body, allowing your upper body to feel the silky warmth of her coat. She used her long tail to lift your head and make you face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, human?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's start with the rules.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smirked and continued. -\"Second: you're not allowed to make use of anything besides your own abilities, which is whatever strengths and wits you have, which I suppose isn't certainly a lot\"- she taunted you. You groaned, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you planning me to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you when I'm done. Third!

He knows how serious I am in these matters\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that if Suicune told him to stay away, he surely would. Looks like you had to defeat her on her own terms. -\"Anything else?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that's all. It's time to now tell you what the game is\"- she paused dramatically. -\"I have prepared a little game where the end goal is your own bedroom. I'm ensuring you won't be getting back to it or stray far from the path I have outlined for you. Automatic loss and all that. Remember that if you lose, you'll do anything I tell you to do, for two weeks. And do you think I'll be a good mistress?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't say you expected her to be kind and considerate, so defeating her was your high priority. You told her to continue and get to the point. -\"Now I won't tell you all. We'll go along the path, okay? Now, for the first obstacle in our fun game would be to...\"- she formed an arch of ice, going from the island you were on, to a safe edge on the far point of the organ, near the exit. She walked on it as if it were stone, until she got down at the other end. -\"...to cross this arch until here\"- she finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thought so\"- the arch was pretty round, and it actually seemed to be pretty risky to cross, even climb. You had no idea how you would do it. The reminder that right now you didn't even have a lot of clothes on you and that you'd be in contact with the ice was even worse. Suicune really meant her games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, what are you waiting for? Go, do it! Or are you giving up now? Oh, and if you fall from it, don't worry. I'll make sure you'll be okay, although you'll fall down again at that island\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Eeeeeeh...\"- you walked to the arch, and touched it. Exactly as you expected.

The frigid surface of the arch stung your skin where your belly came in contact with it. It was an uncomfortable task. And to make matter worse, the ice felt colder than what you're used to, perhaps because it was created with Suicune's Ice Beam. Legend has it that she has blizzards and ice storms at her beck and call, wreaking havoc on those who dared to foul her forest. If the stories you heard in Pokemon Centers were to be believed, they said that a group of loggers once went in that pristine forest to search for ideal materials to build houses. Once they spotted the good trees, they marked the trees with knife marks and cut off a few smaller ones for fire. Things went as planned for a few days until one evening when all contact broke off with them. Search parties were immediately formed to look for them but only found their campsite covered with thick snows in midsummer. The authorities presumed that rogue weather had something to do with their disappearance. A week after all had given up on finding the loggers alive, they emerged from the forest, pale and traumatized by their encounter with a mysterious Pokemon they say followed them day and night while lecturing them about respecting nature. One even said it sounds like a record being looped. Now that you recalled the legend, you find it sorta fitting that she would punish you with this trial. Perhaps you should consider yourself lucky that she didn't intend to torment you with some speeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime dragged on and you hadn't have much success in climbing. The arch wasn't getting any kinder with you. Your hands and chest are numb from all the tries. Suicune sat down and watched your futile attempts to scale the structure. She seemed to take pleasure watching every fall you made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey human, why don't you just forfeit the trial and serve your mistress for two weeks? It'll be a lot easier like that,\" she taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you're not going to give in. You'll not become her plaything again. Serving her for two days previously was more than enough. If the word 'mistress' doesn't raise a red flag, you're sure her behavior will. You're not even sure if you'll last two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Can't do, Sui?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh yes you will,\" she nearly sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just trying to push my buttons, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just reminding you of the awesome alternatives you've got,\" Suicune shook her head, \"We could let this go on for hours and still you wouldn't make any progress. Just admit that I'm the superior one here and get over with it. What are you gonna choose, the chilling arch? Or a warm, loving embrace from the mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint you but I'll go with the former,\" you said, \"One time is enough for me. Leave me out of your fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune pouted and put on a sad face, looking at you with big watery eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so mean,\" she said mockingly, \"Refusing to give lil Sui a nice cuddle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut you chose to ignore it. You refocused your attention back toward scaling the arch. After numerous tries, you learned that climbing the slope directly isn't gonna work. You looked at the structure, analyzing every inch of it. There are numerous icicles jutting out on the side. They look hard and sturdy. You gave the ones closest to you a swift kick, breaking them into a rudimentary picks. Holding them like ski poles, you thrusted the pointed end into the arch. It punctured several inches deep and allowed you to gain a foothold. Within five minutes, you scaled the peak of the arch and slid down to Suicune's side. A large smiled was plastered into the Pokemon's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive show of ingenuity, human,\" Suicune congratulates, \"But can you take on the next challenge?\"</span></div></div>",

For a moment you consider running away, but you guess that if you did, Suicune could freeze you solid as punishment and call it 'automatic lose'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What will it be now, Sui?\"- you asked. She walked as if she had done it several times already, until she located the path she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You know what I want. Now let me show you what's behind this door\"- she opened the door, beckoning you to enter. You're now in a brightly illuminated room, stretching into the distance. There's an huge hole in middle, with only one thin catwalk as the connection between each side. You look at the liquid that's pouring from the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The liquid you saw before didn't come from nowhere, human. So you better not fall again\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered down the hole, to the bottom. The substance pooled and leaked through a small hole, which you suppose went directly to the place you just visited. Falling in still meant instant death, or at least you supposed. Suicune confirmed it with her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what will I need to do now?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's easy. Get to the other side\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did look simple, but you knew that Suicune wasn't just let you pass without some sort of obstacle. The catwalk was thin enough to warrant a careful footing, so if there was some other challenge, it'd be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated, but took a step forward. You only advanced when you were sure there was stable terrain, just in case the challenge was that some parts were weak. Suicune stayed behind, watching your progress. When she judged you were near halfway, she gathered an Ice Beam and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the sound of it approaching, and ducked. You saw how it hit the opposite wall, forming an icicle. -\"What was that?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Think fast!\"- she fired again, forcing you to stumble back to not to get hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that she'd continue firing Ice Beams until you gave up or completed the challenge. It was much harder now. You needed to move quickly to avoid getting frozen, but soon you started to get the hang of it. If you were allowed to use your temporal powers, it would be much easier, but you now were able to win just with your own physical agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times, the beams hit the catwalk, leaving a patch of ice. In those cases, you laid down and slid over the ice carefully, doing progress and defending yourself better against the Ice Beams<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the other side, shivering due to all the ice that had gathered on that side. Suicune scoffed and walked gracefully through the catwalk. -\"Okay, second challenge done. That was entertaining\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll keep winning, Sui\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's see, then. The third part is right after this point\"- she looked at the new path, among the ice. You bravely marched forward, ready to encounter whatever Suicune had prepared for you. You sensed that you were entering a new chamber, but in contrast to the other places you had seen inside Raikou, it was pitch-black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where am I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ah, nowhere special. It's just an empty room\"- Suicune replied, behind you -\"You have to get to the other side\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And what's the catch?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This place is full of holes. Not even I know what's at the bottom of the holes, they're too deep for me to see, but just to be in the safe side, don't fall in them\"- she bolted into the chamber and ran to the other side. You listened to her steps, until they stopped. It seemed that the chamber extended for a while<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come over there!\"-* you knew she was able to see you despite the darkness. Sighing, you prepared to walk ahead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The creeping darkness of the room made you uneasy. The pitch black caverns you visited on Kanto don't hold a candle to the one you're in right now. Even then, you had a Pokemon who knows how to use Flash to brighten up the cragged rocks and passes. This time, however, your Pokemons aren't here to save the day like usual; you've left their Pokeballs back at your house when you took that leisure stroll. Thinking back, it was a little walk in the forest that started it all or more precisely, Palkia. You kinda regretted overlooking the maxim all trainers learned: Never leave your own Pokemon behind. The way Suicune described your challenge didn't help either. There's a feeling that she deliberately said that to strike uncertainty and make you fail your challenge and force you to be her personal servant for two weeks. This is an obstacle course that she has deliberately set up as a test. There's no telling what she would do next. <i>Bodies don't have endless holes, do they? If I fell into one of them what will happen to me? Will Suicune leap out to rescue me?</i> You didn't intend to find that out.  If only you could see through this darkness, you would find the Pokemon smiling sinisterly as she watched the human from the safety of the finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you moving or what? Don't tell me you're chickening out,\" Suicune scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, Suicune,\" you fired back, \"I'm just planning my next move. Formulating a strategy to win your little game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If so, then stop idling and take the challenge. Or...you can just admit defeat and enjoy two weeks pleasing your mistress,\" the Pokemon taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw that! There's no way I'm not going to end up playing maid for you again. No ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...Isn't cleaning me good enough for you? Perhaps massaging and body pillow would be nice additions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune, I hate to rain on your parade but that isn't gonna happen except in your dreams maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph...just get started, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather up what's left of your courage and move forward in the pitch dark chamber slowly one step at a time. You took minuscule steps, carefully feeling for solid ground before making the next step. You carefully swept your feet around the floor to search for the holes that you might end up trapped or hurt in. The holes ranges in size from the diameter of a beach ball to those large enough to swallow you whole. Occasionally, it is necessary to crawl on narrow ledges between the gaps. The sounds coming from the bottom of the holes do not sound welcoming at all,  resembling a combination of growling stomach and wind. At one point, you nearly slipped down into one of them. Suicune's laughed and taunted you, advising that it is best for you to give up because humans will never be up to par to Pokemon when it comes to prowess. By now, you are well-used to Suicune's antics and decided to ignore her and focus on winning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took half an hour for you safely navigate to the other end of the chamber. Your clothes and body are wet from both sweat and the moisture from the surrounding flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that, Suicune? I completed this challenge despite your dire predictions. I hope I haven't surprised you too much. Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune emerged from the darkness with a pair of glowing eyes she used as lighting. The sight unsettled you slightly. It is rare to see a Pokemon with this type of ability. She focused the beams on you, temporarily blinding you with their intense brightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph...Not bad. I guess my opinions needs some change. You better but still not good enough, human,\" Suicune said. It is evident that she is doing her best not to growl in frustration at your little victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upset that I ruined your plan?\" you rubbed her mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrrr.....Let move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune quickly led you out of the dark chamber and back into the welcoming brightness of another hallway. This hall is wider than all the other you visited so far. You followed Suicune down until you reached another door. The Aurora Pokemon opened that door and motioned for you to enter. What you see on the other side is shocking. The room is completely blank and white in every direction. There is no telling if there are walls, ceilings or floor; everything is just plain white. It looks like something that only exist in a surreal dimension. You and Suicune are the about only thing in the chamber that can be distinguished from the surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Raikou's Environment Simulator. It is environmental emulator that can recreate all sorts of stuffs based on the desire of the user. Everything from cityscape and mountaintops can be created in an instant with the sophisticated computer in there. In this case, I will decide the what you will have to face. You will have to accomplish the objectives I've set or else I will consider that you forfeit this test. Do you think that you can take on what I have in store for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I technically can't lay my hands on you, I have no way to prepare against you. But that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. If things go too far, I reserve the right to self-defense. In short, show me what you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A word of caution, though. I'm gonna make it hard for you this time and I mean it! Prepare to face the challenges within my imagination.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, everything around you started representing some sort of underwater scenario, and you instinctively held your breath until you couldn't resist anymore. Luckily for you, the water was simulated. You concluded you weren't going to drown, so you relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, swimming was definitely not one of your fortes. You could do it, but do a challenge while swimming? That was going to be really hard. You waited to see if there was any clue of what Suicune could do as your challenge. Suddenly, you felt you were in danger. Something primal in you awoke and started to tell you to run.... or swim, or whatever. What mattered is that you needed to run away. But from what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around you. It seemed like the seabed. Nothing but kelp, conchs, corals and other similar elements littered the ground, but you didn't see anything unusual or dangerous. The bad feeling didn't fade away, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw a silhouette at the distance. You could see that whatever formed it was huge, but you couldn't distinguish was it was. But it was approaching quickly. You started swimming away from it, as fast as you could. When it got close enough, you finally could see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyogre. Even through you knew it was merely a simulation, you were still greatly intimidated by it. You were at your normal size, but it still was huge. Kyogre lunged towards you in what was a pretty clear attempt to maim you. You managed to dodge it, and you grabbed onto its skin. Kyogre didn't like that. He started shaking around, trying to get you off. Seeing how you tenaciously held on for dear simulated life, it started to swim ridiculously fast towards the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simulated Pok\u00e9mon jumped over the surface of the sea, ready to slam you with its back. You let go, and when Kyogre falls, the splash pushes you far. You really didn't know what you were supposed to be doing, but after you saw Kyogre again charging towards you, you supposed that your objective was to defeat Kyogre...somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it charged towards you, you didn't fret. Instead, you held your hands to the front and grabbed into its snout, avoiding its razor teeth. You quickly moved until you were looking directly into an eye as big as your head. Knowing it was a simulation, you were okay with what you were going to do. If it were the real deal, you wouldn't even dare to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punched Kyogre in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyogre let an huge scream of pain, and tried even harder to shake you off. You were forced to let go, so you were disorientated for a moment, until you saw Kyogre swimming around, trying to find you. You approach as stealthily as you could, until you grabbed onto the skin of the tail. While it once again tried to get rid of you, you crawled over the back until you found the other eye. You punched it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyogre, now blind, started swimming erratically. This time you managed to hold on, but you didn't know what to do now to subdue Kyogre. However, you managed to find something curious: when it felt you, it instantly swam in the direction it felt you. You had an idea. Soon you positioned yourself in front of its snout, making it charge ahead, trying to bite you. Then you daringly pushed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sudden change of direction, Kyogre continued the same strategy, charging forward without a second thought. hen you saw the seabed approaching, you jumped and tried to swim, bracing for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyogre crashed against the soft floor, and didn't move. You really managed to knock out a legendary Pok\u00e9mon...well, a simulation, but it was still very satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have long to rest. Before you knew it, the environment around you had changed. Now rivers of what looked like lava flew in several parts around yo, among lots of rocks and spiky flaws in the terrain. It looked like you were in a volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune appeared -\"I can't believe you really managed to defeat Kyogre. That was...fairly impressive, yes. Okay, I accept it. You're tougher than I thought\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I'm so tough then make this the last challenge, alright?\"- you replied. Suicune thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay. This will be the last one, but don't expect me to make it easy. In fact, why don't you find out by yourself what you have to do? Oh, and don't touch the lava\"- she smirked -\"It may be simulated but it'll still hurt a lot\"- and with that, she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that this was the last task you'd need to do, you got ready to start</span></div></div>",

Superheated winds blew against your face, forcing you to squelch your eyes upon the barren landscape before you. Sweats started flowing on your forehead as the relentless heat baked your body. You quietly cursed Suicune for rendering this difficult course as the final challenge.  She really wanted to test your limit; perhaps human limits would be the more appropriate expression. The path that the Pokemon has created spirals precariously along a steep cliff that leads down into a red glowing inferno of fire and molten rocks. The path ended at a plateau some distance away. Suicune didn't elaborate much on what to expect but you know that whatever you'll encounter would be just as dangerous as Kyogre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no backing out now. You've come too far to take that option. The taunting voice of Suicune echoed in your head, mocking you for your failure and teasing you into submission. Thankfully, the rumbling lava brought you out of your thoughts before it gets disturbing. You'll prove her wrong; that's one thing you're certain about. Gathering all remaining strength, you pressed forward onto the narrow path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way slowly up the cragged mountain, cautiously navigating the narrower section by sidling along the rocky walls and jumping over the little gaps that appeared intermittently. An occasional distant eruption would shake the floor and send pebbles raining down on you. Even though you know this is simulated, the threats felt extremely real. You feared that the rocks below you might collapse at any given time and drop you into a fiery end. Each step was taken with all courage you could mustered. To your utmost relief, that never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour of hair-raising trek later, you safely made it to the plateau. The flat surface is about as large as your typical Pokemon arena. White smokes billowed in all directions  but you sensed that there was something lurking in these veils. Your suspicion was answered when a bone-chilling roar emanated from behind. You slowly turned your head only to see a towering four-legged figure looking at you menacingly. The creature gave a low rumbling growl that shook your very heart. Its red eyes focused on you as the smoke slowly cleared away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure has a thick brownish coat, a flowing gray mane and tail,  jagged plates on its back, a star-shaped red-gold face mask, and large paws bulky enough to crush you. The Pokemon observed you with a curious expression on its muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Finally a human brave enough to venture into my lair? Interesting,\"  its baritone voice mused as the creature approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too intimidated to make any sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a first I suppose. A lot of trainers dare not to take even one step up my mountain. Those who did made it to the entrance were scared speechless by the mere sight of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. My... Is that fear I'm seeing on your face, human? Unfortunately, it's too late to change your mind now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...y-...you're...,\" you tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entei,\" the Pokemon added with a slight annoyance, \"But that isn't important; you aren't here for me to remind you what to call me, is it human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll assume by your silence that you're here to fight me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive...A brave yet foolish feat I might add. Most trainers used their Pokemons in a futile attempt to capture me, but I see that you haven't brought any with you. Perhaps you're looking for a more original form of dual. If that's what you desire, that I can accommodate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....what do you plan to do with me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be unfair for me to challenge you to a physical fight owing to vast differences in our abilities. I propose that we dual in a location where our powers are more matched,\" Entei said as he got even closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's better to show you then,\" Entei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon stood tall in front of you and looked you in the eyes. Your head barely reached his chest. Entei leaned his head closer to you and narrowed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extrasensory!\" he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon's eyes widened and a bright flash emanates from the pupils and you were suddenly unable to move your body. A indescribable heaviness washes over you as your gaze remained fixed toward the Pokemon's red eyes; there is some force preventing you from breaking the contact. You felt nauseous as though you're on the brink of fainting. The mountains and lavas gradually faded from your field of vision as your consciousness is pulled toward Entei's stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look deeper...you shall find your arena soon enough,\" Entei said your mind got thrust into his hypnotic gaze.</span></div></div>",

You could see several marble statues depicting Entei, almost like this were a temple. Were you in a temple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're in my mind. It's the only way we could have the same level of strength\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the Pok\u00e9mon. -\"I don't feel any different\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I do. I feel infinitely weaker, so now we are in the same level\"- you felt insulted, as Entei expected. But he was still way taller than you, and even if he said you were both with the same strength, you really didn't feel like you had a chance. -\"Now we're going to fight. Get ready!\"- he started running towards you before you could be ready for an attack.He tackled you, making you fly towards one of the statues. You crashed against it, feeling as if a steamroller had gone over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We can't really have the same strength...\"- you muttered while you struggled to stand up. Without letting you recover, Entei grabbed you with his teeth and threw you to the other side. He was clearly overpowering you, and you had no time to counter. For a while Entei had fun, until he finally let you lay down in middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is being way too easy. Fight, human, this is starting to be boring\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly stood up and tried to punch him. You managed to hit his leg, which was like a mere bug trying to bite him. -\"Damn it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, Entei didn't attack. He instead fell down to the floor, laughing hoarsely at your puny attempt. Very annoyed, you approached and punched him in the throat. He stopped laughing, and instead tried to breath. You saw that as your chance, so you hit him once again. Apparently, even your weak punches could hurt if you hit the right points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Entei tried to stand up so you couldn't reach his neck anymore, you promptly kicked him in the shins, in rapid succession, hoping to cause enough discomfort. Entei didn't stay down, but the delay let you climb on his back. He didn't thrash around, as you expected, so making him crash against something wasn't really an option. You decided to go for something drastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved until you got to the back of his neck, and tried to choke him. You knew this was merely a projection, and that chances are that you wouldn't kill him, but you hoped you'd knock him out. You held on with all your strength, feeling him trying to take air. Due to the his size, it took a good while of him trying to get you off and you clinging on until he was weak enough to be defeated by the lack of air. Entei fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room around you warped, until it turned again into the plateau you had been on before the fight. In front of you, Entei was in the same state you had left him while in his mind. You approached, somewhat worried, and checked if he was still alive. You were relieved to see that he was merely knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...damn it. Damn it. Damn it!\"- Suicune was at the other side of the plateau, clearly unhappy. The environment faded until it turned into the completely white void you had seen before the challenges started in that place -\"I can't believe you really could do that without using your temporal powers\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are we...are we done?\"- you panted, hoping the answer was positive. Suicune nodded, upset<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, we're done. You win. Congratulations\"- she says without enthusiasm, and a way appears in middle of the void. You go through it, and follow the hallway until you reach your room. You practically collapse on your soft bed, falling asleep quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune observed you, until she heard Raikou -\"You really left him exhausted\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not my fault\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was a good show. I didn't think he'd manage to pull it off, but aren't you worried of possible retaliations?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can deal with anything he does\"- she says confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay. Let him sleep. I found a way to let him continue sharpening his temporal powers. Mew could do it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mew?\"- Suicune left the bedroom -\"I don't see how\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Her powers are much less powerful than Dialga's temporal powers, but she should be able to give him the bases for him to continue. After all, some part of Dialga's genes are into her, albeit a very small part\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And how is he going to practice with Mew if he's inside you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's a Psychic type. Even telepathy would be enough, but knowing her, she'll do something like an image of her appearing in front of him or something. I don't know. She'll arrive later\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune and Raikou spoke for a good while about the human's potential, while the subject of their conversation slept.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune woke up from the chilling winds she's feeling. The Pokemon blinked her eyes and focused her gaze upon the ceiling. The room was still dark and the human's snoring could be heard coming from another bed across from hers. The gentle heartbeats and breathing several floors below them indicated that Raikou was, too, still asleep. The Aurora Pokemon checked the clock on the wall. It was 6:00 in the morning. Another indicator beside it showed that Raikou won't be waking for another 4 hours. Suicune was perplexed at how her friend managed to sleep so long. It was beyond her. Though Suicune was used to living places that are dark for a good half of the year, her internal body clock always woke her at the right time with virtually no errors. Suicune was both appalled at the length of Raikou's sleep and how she has to live with these two heavy sleepers for who knows how long. <i>Look like it'll be my job to be their alarm clock from now on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"Get up sleepyhead,\" Suicune's voice chimed as she pawed at your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....what Suicune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up up up...morning is here already,\" the Pokemon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you lifted you hand and read the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez....it's only 6:04am, let me sleep some more,\" you said while tightening the blankets around your body in a futile attempt to shield yourself from Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aurora Pokemon jumped on you and pinned you down. Her paws felt like clamps pressing down on your chest.  She lowered her head and beamed a cocky grin at you. You returned the favor by glaring at her intensely. But that only seem to widen the grin plastered on Suicune's muzzle. Her eyes sparkled with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have won the tests I set up, but that doesn't mean I can't order you around. Now get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we had a deal. What's with all the talk about you considering me an equal after what I had been through yesterday?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Equal as in my respect for you. But I'm still on top of the hierarchy here. Even Raikou knows his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just imply that you are some type of alpha female here?\" you asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure have a clear picture of what's going on here. Just know your place and I will make you stay the most comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, you can start by giving just 10 more minutes of sleep,\" you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Can't do. For now on, you'll have to learn to get up early. Now come with me. I'm planning on waking Raikou. Time to get him out of his dreamland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are few times where a dimensional being feels this much rage building up inside him. More often, he let his anger subside for fear of allowing it to affect the cosmos. Dialga tried concentrating on all positive things in his mind and breath deeply. It was a trick Arceus had taught him during his training long ago.  But that obviously didn't work in this case.  Dialga could feel the massive flame building up with him. He was angry at being played and controlled like a rag doll by Suicune and  shocked in the balls by Raikou. But those two are an annoyance compared to the rage Dialga reserved for the human as he read the message he had left on his system. Each word made the Pokemon visualized all the possible ways of eternal torment. The human didn't just taunted him, he also made fun of the temporal power, powers the Dragon Pokemon considered sacred and revered. The human also knew of his invasive research method, making any future cooperation impossible. Only one way left to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing you should have never done, human: Pissing off a demigod!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sleepily walked behind Suicune, wondering how she managed to be so energetic and even chipper so early in the morning. Not even in your journeys you had been awaken so early barring an emergency. Even your Pok\u00e9mon shared your habit of sleeping until the sun was already high in the sky, so it all worked wonderfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Suicune wouldn't let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you plan to wake him up? I doubt pawing at the flesh will be any good\"- you said, trying not to yawn. Sicune smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have my ways. Around here there should be some sort of nerve. Once I find one it'll be very easy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't tell me you're going to torture him until he wakes up!\"- you protest, more awake now that Raikou was apparently threatened. The Aurora Pok\u00e9mon looked at you, offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What kind of monster do you think I am? I won't do that. I'll merely force him to wake up\u00b4\"- She continues walking and looking around for any weak points that could lead to a nerve. After a while, she finds what seemed like a bruise. She carefully touched the flesh until she managed to make a small hole. You could see a rubbery cord, what you suppose is one of Raikou's nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Great, now what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune didn't reply. Instead, she aimed at the hole and released a very weak Ice Beam on the nerve. You're sure you saw the nerve shuddering at the contact with the ice, until suddenly everything around you jolts in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the...Suicune, what're you doing?!\"- Raikou shouts. Suicune stops the beam, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's time to wake up! There's no time for idling around. The day has started\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry Raikou, she woke me up too\"- you mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while before Raikou begrudgingly accepts that Suicune won't let him sleep any longer, so he starts his daily routines. Suicune and you go back to your rooms, where you wait for your breakfasts, now everything in a friendlier atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're finished, you hear Raikou again. -\"Human, please come to the Leisure Room. There's an important matter you need to know\"- You quickly get to the Leisure Room, expecting to see something different, but when you enter you notice nothing has changed. Suicune followed you, too, not having been in that place before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it, Raikou?\"- He had sounded oddly serious, for somebody of his demeanor, so you were a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's a friend that wishes to talk to you in person. She's going in\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, I know where this is going. Good thing I woke him up early, or else she'd have found him sleeping\"- Suicune says -\"You better be ready. You need to be better in time matters that Dialga, or else I'll be sorely disappointed of you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"- you say before seeing something forming on the platform in the center of the room. Soon pink fragments start gathering until it forms what you recognize as Mew. You somewhat remembered talking to her, she had stricken you as excitable and cheerful, mostly. You hope that being with her isn't as exhausting as you think it may be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Greetings, human. I'm Mew,\" the Psychic Pokemon smiled. The small form of the Pokemon hovered closer to you from several feet away. This was the first time you heard her voice which can be described as innocent and childlike. A much light-hearted voice than you imagined she'd possess. The way the Pokemon talked reminded you of soft wind chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Mew. Nice to finally meet you in person,\" you offered. The pink catlike creature levitated herself in front of you and looked at you with her big, watery blue eyes. She momentarily put on a serious look while she looked at your features. Mew turned over to Suicune who gave her an acknowledged nod before turning her attention back to you. Her smile and grin popped back on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Dee-al-ga. I'm so happy that I finally had the opportunity to meet you in person,\" Mew beamed as she circled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still using that nickname?\" you asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it? I think it sounds cute. Just like you! Hee hee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, unsure whether to feel awkward or take Mew's statement as a compliment. But when you looked at those innocent pair of eyes, you couldn't help but smile back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all seated at a round fur-covered table and made yourselves comfortable in plushy chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are things going so far, Dee-al-ga?\" Mew said, playfully enunciating your nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as well as I wanted. But I'm learning to get by with what I have,\" you replied, \"After what Dialga did to me while I lived in him, I learned to be more cautious and vigilant about those around me. Besides Dialga, Suicune here is another good example of a Pokemon you should keep your eyes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch your words, human!\" Suicune shouted, her face red with embarrassment, \"At least I'm not as bad as him, right? You fared far worse under that numbskull and you had the nerve to put me on the same page as him? One more of that nonsense and I'll make you lick my paws clean for three weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faux cheerful way Suicune said the last sentence send a shiver down your spine. But Mew, somehow, was laughing uncontrollably at Suicune's outburst which earned her a death glare and a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, Suicune. Why the hot-headedness? No harms been done in any way,\" Mew said as she attempted to stifle her laughter, \"You really need to lighten up sometimes. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune kept her crimson eyes on the tiny Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. are. so. dead, Mew...\", she growled. But her rage went unheeded when Mew turned her attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are taking the situation a lot better than I expected. Good to see that you have such excellent adaptability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So, what brings you to us, Mew? Is it urgent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Mew exclaimed, \"I was having so much fun talking with you guys that I forgot why I came here in the first place. Heh heh, sorry bout that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. So what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, back to the important stuffs. From what Raikou told me, I understand that Dialga is causing trouble again. PThis time dragging poor Dee-al-ga along for the ride. That scoundrel has caused enough trouble for the Pokemon world and now he wanted to get a human involved. Man, as if he isn't a big enough problem for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Suicune and I weren't the only victims of that guy,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Dee-al-ga, you haven't seen how he deals with the Pokemons around him. You either have to subject yourself to his hurtful pranks or listen to and obey his every whim. Refusing him can be quite disastrous. Even Palkia got constantly pushed around by Dialga. Because of him, I spend a lot of my time saving various Pokemons he trapped in the dimensional realms, which is a very power-consuming task for me,\" Mew explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear about that. I could barely stand a week of his mind surveillance and manipulation. It must've been awful hard work for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How far have things fallen?\", Mew sighed, \"Dialga and Palkia were once students of the Great Arceus, the Creator of the World and Pokemons. Dialga is always the one to test the norms and get into trouble while Palkia is the clumsy but nice one. They never got along really well despite being assigned together by Arceus. Years after years, Dialga became more and more out of bounds the more ability he mastered from his teacher. On the day Arceus send them out on their first day on their jobs, Dialga nearly destroyed the universe by attempting to harness its power for himself. It took a 200 year detention to bring him down a few notches. Can you imagine what Arceus would do if he knows about Dialga's recent adventure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to think about that,\" you dreaded, \"But what does this all have to do with me, Mew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the interesting part about you, Dee-al-ga is that you were vested with some of Dialga's temporal power which gave you a bit of power over time and space. Dialga never granted any other a portion of his power, so this is a rare opportunity for us to analyze his power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking. I hope this power will come in handy one day. So what's your plan, Mew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a few on my mind at the moment. But first, I'm giving our old friend Dialga a little call. You two can drop in the conversation if you want. He'll hear your voices as mine so no worry about him finding out about you two. I wonder what he's up to?\" Mew thought as she activated her messaging system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few seconds there was no sound. You hoped that meant Dialga was busy, hopefully not plotting your immediate demise, but small sounds soon resounded around the room. Dialga was on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hello? Hello? Dialga? Are you there, Dialga?\"- she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You called me, Mew. Of course I'm here\"- Dialga said in annoyance. For once since you got away of him you agreed. Mew could be tiring at times, judging by her behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I heard some interesting news that I'd like to confirm! Like for example about a human! Have you seen a human in your body recently?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who told you about that?!\"- Dialga roared before Mew could even finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You did, remember? I even talked to the human while he pretended to be another of your species!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the connection. Dialga had clearly overreacted. Mew nodded, as if she had realized something important. -\"Oh, true. I forgot\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, sure\"- Suicune muttered under her breath, but it sounded like Mew had said it. Dialga refrained from asking what was that, although his words showed he had heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew surprisingly talked to Dialga with expertise, prodding him around while she measured his mood. -\"You seem really stressed, Dialga, is there something wrong?\"- you asked, just to see what his answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I went through a bad experience thanks to a prank I don't want to remember\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune beamed with malicious pride, and you shared a knowing look with her. What Suicune and Raikou had done inside him wouldn't be forgotten soon. -\"Oh, that's too bad!\"- Mew hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes it was. When I catch Suicune and Raikou they'll find out what happens when they mess with a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They're legendaries too, knucklehead\"- Suicune said. Mew glared at her quickly while Dialga asked what was that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I, ehem, I coughed. *Thlgdtalehead*\"- she did a very unconvincing fake cough, and changed topic hurriedly -\"And what about nthe human? Can I talk to him again? He seemed like a nice guy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He isn't nice. I returned him already to the world he came from\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Dialga lying without an apparent guilt enraged you. Mew quickly put her paw on your shoulder in an effort to calm you down before you ruined the cover. -\"Oh, that's too bad. you had another being inside you! I have always wanted to have something inside me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're not missing anything. It's more a pain than a fun thing\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Being an unwilling test subject isn't fun either</i> you thought, clenching your fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each second it was apparent that if Mew continued the call sooner or later you or Suicune would ruin everything, so Mew hurriedly said goodbye and hanged. -\"Uf, that sure was a handful\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's a handful\"- Suicune retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He isn't so bad, but he does have a very warped sense of what's correct and what isn't. I have known him for a long time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did you get from this call?\"- you asked, not really seeing the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew worriedly landed on the floor. -\"Nothing good. He's clearly planning something bad against you three, specially towards the human. Note how he said he had left you in your world. I think Raikou and Suicune will manage to not be too affected by a confrontation, but you're a human, and shrunken, to boot. I fear for your life\"- she talked with a seriousness you hadn't expected to hear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then let's get him home quick before Dialga finds him!- Raikou said, but Mew argued that Dialga would still find you, and without Suicune and Raikou's protection, it'd be even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The only solution I see is to prepare you for when the inevitable time arrives. Dialga is a tenacious Pok\u00e9mon, and he's really pissed off\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And how can we prepare him?\"- Suicune asked. Mew started to float again, recovering some of her cheerful state <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no idea\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't strain yourself so much helping\"- you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew thought for a moment before clapping excitedly. -\"I could try to help you! You still have those powers, I more or less know some tricks for them. They'll never reach Dialga's ability, but I do think you could at least survive unscathed if you do train\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What else can be done?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raikou is already running away. Keep moving everyday, and never stop to rest. I think that at some point it'll be good that the human leaves you two\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, no way. Where would he be without our protection?\"- Raikou refused to leave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not saying to leave you two now. I mean when he's stronger, but it's for you two's safety. Besides I'll find a good host for him when the time comes\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I won't even be in my normal size?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll be easier for you to be hidden if you continue being small\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perspective of having to hide from Dialga by being small doesn't make you happy, but you do know that until the whole deal ends, it'll be necessary. -\"And I suppose you'll be the host\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggled. -\"Hihi, maaaybe! But if you do reach your potential then it'd be better if your host is somebody you can help. After all, you could be that human in our legends, the one to stand with the Legendaries Pok\u00e9mon. But we'll see when it's time. For now focus on getting stronger\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew started vanishing, waving at you. -\"I'll be back in a few hours, I'd like to help Raikou find a nice safe place for now. Think of everything that was said and get ready!\"-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Mew has vanished from view, both of you are left alone in the Leisure Room. The chamber is silent save for the air vents pumping in fresh air from Raikou's lungs. You and Suicune remained in your seats without talking for the better part of an hour. Even Raikou left you two on your own as he busied himself with another lengthy discussion with Mew about the next step. For the first time, Suicune was looking neither cocky nor loud. Rather, she is looking at you with a contemplative expression as if she was still taking in what Mew had just said. Many times, the Pokemon looked like she was on the verge of speaking, only to held herself back at the last minute and heaved a long sigh. The longer those ruby eyes are set on you, the more you could tell that there was an unspoken sadness hidden in their depths. That brief glimpse of emotion was quickly reburied under Suicune's stoic face as she tried hard to keep up her usual demeanor. You could no longer stand the silence and was the first to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think we need to do now?\" you asked Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon heaves another sigh before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends,\" Suicune answered calmly, \"We don't have a clear picture of what Dialga would do and we don't exactly know the full potential of your temporal power. Besides, Dialga isn't exactly as dumb as I always like to make him. He can be very ingenious if he wants to. In fact, I would consider him an excellent strategist were it not for his unlikable personality and immaturity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strategist? In what sort of ways? Being an expert in pissing people off doesn't count,\" you said sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you this, what do you think he's gonna do with the information he collected when you lived with him? Every movements you've made, every little details of your life you confided to him, and all thoughts you might've had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga knew those, so what?\" you said frustratingly, \"I don't want to relive those experience again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, he had done intrusive experiments on the both of us and most likely will have a copy of our memories saved in his vast data continuum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, Dialga's innate power allows him to have a vague idea of the immediate future. Though not entirely accurate, it give him a rough picture of upcoming events. He can and will use our knowledges against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shoot, I totally forgot about that,\" you gasped, realizing the implications, \"Does this mean that our plans are potentially compromised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. You see, Dialga cannot see the specifics of the future and any memories he downloaded from us would be outdated in the sense that no traces of our current 'state of mind' would be found. The best he could do is run a scenario test and the likely outcomes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still is unsettling enough for me,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is very troubling. Mew said there is no knowing when that monster will catch up with us and obliterate us like some insignificant specks of dust. Which made it all the more important that we must get you to fully master your powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means that we will be running and hiding for the better part of my training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can we do?\" Suicune answered with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just find Lord Arceus and tell him that his star student Dialga is misbehaving again?\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to take the issue to Arceus himself?! I suggest that you learn a little more about our hierarchy here,\" Suicune looked at you as if you made an offensive statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Did I say something wrong?\" you asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune took a deep breath before focusing her attention back on you. She collected herself before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus is a deity to us and is consider the creator of us all. He is regarded with extreme reverence among Pokemons. You don't just walk up to his place and knock on his door and demand his presence,\" Suicune explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even if you're a Legendary?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you found favor in his eyes, finding Arceus isn't as easy as it seems. He is constantly traveling around the dimensions to maintain the delicate equilibrium between them. Additionally, we don't have the presumed authority to directly meet up with him. Only a select few of the Legendaries has seen him in person. The most that lower-tiered Legendaries can do is to go up to Mt. Coronet where there is a shrine dedicated to him and seek his presence. Unless he decides to show up, there's little else we could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't getting any easier, is it?\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...  I can ask Mew if she's got any news about Arceus if that offers you some reassurance. In the mean time, I will not allow Dialga to lay his dirty claws on anyone one of us, especially you! I couldn't wait any longer to give that bastard his comeuppance,\" Suicune growled with resolve, \"Let's get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune stood up and walked toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden determination in Suicune's voice caught you off guard. While you appreciate her encouraging words, you wondered why is she abruptly so protective of you? Is she doing so out of a sense of loyalty or did she see something more in you? Realizing where your thoughts are heading, you quickly banished the thoughts. After putting your mind back on track, you couldn't help but smile at Suicune, she can either be the meanest or the sweetest girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe being shrunken isn't all that bad,</i> you mused.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune walked ahead, while the human followed behind immerse in his thoughts. The Aurora Pok\u00e9mon had her own thoughts too, and she wasn't exactly willing to share them with the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was never going to admit it to the human's face, but she had grown to respect him. At the beginning she had brushed him off as somebody who was in Dialga's body, getting into problems he never suspected. But now that she had spent time with him and, to lack of a better word, forced him to follow her whims, she had seen that he had strengths and a determination that rivaled hers...if he continued doing the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly she wondered if he thought of her as a friend. Not everybody was able to deal with her personality for long enough to actually consider a friend. So far only a very selected handful did that. Raikou, for example. Despite their differences in their personalities, they got along pretty well. At times they even got teased as if they were a couple, which always seemed to amuse Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what will she do? Fighting against Dialga was the priority. Beating him wasn't now just a matter of pride, it was also a fight for three lives. She was completely sure that without her help the bumbling airheads that were her actual partners would be doomed. But another thing she didn't want to admit is that she was at loss of what could be done. Dialga had time on his side...literally. And while the human had some of those powers too, they were insignificant compared to Dialga's abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll be damned if I don't get us all out of this mess. I'll show everybody that Dialga isn't as tough and fearsome as they think he is...if we do defend ourselves correctly.</i> She definitely didn't want to think what would happen if Dialga saw a weakness among them. As she saw it, it all depended on Mew for now. <i>If she brings something new and useful to this group then we'll have better chances</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to their room, Suicune laid on her bed. -\"Sit there and think, human. Don't make the legendaries do all the work\"- she said, hiding her concern under what looked like an unhealthy amount of confidence on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So will we ask Mew about Arceus?\"- the human asks. Suicune rolled her eyes at his stubbornness. She had explained that Arceus' chances to intervene were astronomically low but he insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, yeah\"- Suicune shouted at Raikou to get Mew inside again. -\"And I don't care how you do it, but make her come to our room. We're not going back into the Leisure Room\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou sighed. -\"She's not here right now. She'll be back in an hour\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So now what?\"- the human asked, still not giving any ideas by himself. <i>I really do need to do everything here</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you what we could do: round up some back up. If we do show how Dialga was in the wrong here we can get them onto our side\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't feel comfortable letting everybody know I'm shrunken and inside other Pok\u00e9mon\"- the human said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who else have you talked with?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...Keldeo and Palkia. Palkia is more or less on our side, I think\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune was very hesitant to get Keldeo on the whole mess. -\"I don't think Keldeo would be a good idea. He doesn't have the gall to fight Dialga\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then do you think there is somebody else?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune smirked. -\"Giratina could be an option. Dialga more often than not hates to see that dragon involved in his matters. If we get Giratina in this then we could have an edge\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aurora Pok\u00e9mon waited for the human's answer<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune observed the human lying motionlessIsly on his blockedbed. His facialexpression remained ambiguous as he considered her suggestions. The Aurora Pokemon looked at him and wondered what his life used to be like and what he was doing before his problem started.<i> His life must be pretty interesting. You get to go on adventures around the world, meet new people and Pokeminterest you told me that you haveons, and battle the champions. A trainer lestartingads a life filthought you were in dangerled with passion and teamwork as Raikou likes to say. Our bookworm knows far more about them than I ever will.</i> Out of the many things she thought about, Suicune briefly mused whether the human had any friends or even a girlfriend. <i>Will he like a tomboy like me if I were a human? Or will he prefer me as I am? Man, I'm getting a little lovey dovey here.</i> It's a silly idea but she quietly smiled at the idea of being together with hum before shaking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the trainer seemed to have collected his thoughts and sat up on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giratina, right? He's the third of the Creation Trio if I'm not mistaken,\" the human said, \"From what little knowledge on mythology I have, Dialga and Giratina aren't exactly on good terms with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune adjusted herself in her bed and cleared her mind. She vividly remembered how Dialga told her that story... more than a hundred times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, human. Dialga, being the petulant idiot he is, has countless arguments with him about what is best for the worlds they oversee. Giratina had to spend the better part of his day hearing Dialga whine about how bad his works are or why wasn't he given more important roles in the creation process. Many times, the arguments got out of hand and became full scale inter-dimensional fights. One fight 200 years ago nearly destroyed our planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think I heard about that one. There's some kind of stone carvings in Celestic Town that mentioned a world-ending battle between Dialga and Giratina. Is there any precise cause of this dispute?\" the trainer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To understand their conflicts, you must first learn about their worldviews. Giratina believed that any world created should be free of any' divine' interventions; their job is to make the worlds and let the continuum take its course. With the exception of monthly visits to various dimensions, nothing is directly altered by him. The current world we're in uses Giratina's policy; that's why the existence of the Creation Trio was only a myth among humans and remained so. But Dialga differed on that. He argued that being the creators of the world gives them the inherent right to be the supreme leader of anything within them; existence itself is merely there to serve him. When Dialga proposed this to Palkia, Giratina and his mentor, Arceus, they strongly disagree with that, believing that such ideals only meant to serve Dialga's own purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally agree with the others. I'd hate to imagine what my life would be like under a megalomaniac, metaphysical Legendary if my time with him was any indication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, Dialga, in a desperate attempt to get the others to approve of his 'blueprint' for the world, destroyed countless dimensions Giratina had created just to rile him up. Needless to say, Giratina was extremely upset about it; what he had spend eons building and nurturing was gone in hours. Their relations have gotten so strained that they haven't met each other for approximately 1000 years. I have no doubts that Giratina still has a few unsettled scores with Dialga which we will use to our full advantages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not hard to imagine Dialga doing that,\" the human remarked,  \"I'm curious, Suicune, you seem to know a lot about what goes on between Dialga and Giratina. How exactly do you know these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the misfortune of hearing Dialga bawling himself out to me (waterworks and all) about how mean everyone is treating him and how no one likes his ideas. He even used that creepy mind trick against my will to make me see his side of the story. It was my most awful day. The short version, he always blamed Palkia and Giratina for sidelining him but he never cared to take a hard look at himself or his ideas. He also hated how Arceus treated him like a kid which I think is an honest assessment. Even when Arceus threatened to revoke his temporal power, he never seek a compromise. It's absolutely useless to talk sense into his thick brain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Suicune's anger rising as she talked more about Dialga. It probably better to calm her down before her temper got out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...we'll contact Giratina then make our next move to get more allies on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...you can use the computer hub on the desk but I doubt we'll reach him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of the flesh bed and went to a device resembling a laptop embedded into the desk. It was far smaller and more organic-looking than the one in Dialga's steel-clad interior. The electric yellow computer has an elastic display and a keyboard encased in a gel-like membrane. A simple touch of the screen turned on the interface. You heard Suicune walked up beside you to have a better look at the screen. There are several apps on the menu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou selected the icon indicating the PokeNet Messenger to start the software. A list of Raikou's friend popped up; a list that's longer than Dialga's. The message board seem to be very active at the moment as dozens of messages flooded in. Most of the conversations are filled with concern for Raikou. A lot of them are talking about how Dialga is spamming them with a message asking for the whereabouts of Raikou and Suicune or whether they've encountered any shrunken humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"corange\">Dialga claimed that you, Suicune and a human plotted to kill him, is this some kind of joke, man?</span></i>, a message from Ho-oh reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh boy, Dialga sounds mighty pissed at you, Raikou. An advice from an old friend here: time to get your ass out of the galaxy :P\"</span></i> another from Xerneas reads jocularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga is really hellbent on getting everyone involved, is he?\" Suicune gnarled her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's doing so to score a few sympathy votes from whoever fall for his story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's falling for that dumbass unless they're accomplices. Raikou, tell your friends that Dialga is being himself again. Nothing to take too seriously. If any if them are still curious, tell them to join the group chat \"Dialga Debate\" under your name,\" Suicune ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Raikou replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went through the friend list and found the information for Giratina. Fortunately, he is currently available. You clicked on the name and started a conversation. You placed the conversation under 'group chat' and allowed the other Pokemons to join the dialogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. Trainer:  <i>Hello? Are you there, Giratina?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: Yes, this is Giratina. Who is this I'm speaking with? </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. Trainer: <i> I'm am a human who got shrunk and is currently living with Raikou and Suicune.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">Gira0523: ??? I don't understand you. What is a human like you doing with the Raikou? If you are trying to prank me here, I must let you know that I do not appreciate it.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's a good idea to directly state your identity to yet another Pokemon,\" Suicune whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can I do? Mention Dialga's name and risk angering him?\" you hushed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. Trainer: <i>No. I'm not. I am living inside of Raikou because of a mishap done by a certain dragon Pokemon. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">Gira0523: Huh? What exactly are you trying to say?! I don't know who you are or what you're doing but your claim sounds really dubious here! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. Trainer: <i>Dubious? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">Gira0523: Yes, dubious! You are worse than Dialga at fooling. Come on now. Tell me who you are and we can end this unconstructive conversation soon. I don't have the time to clown around with you. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to blow the whole thing up. If he disconnects, we are screwed,\" Suicune snapped and facepawed, \"Get Raikou into the conversation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nH. Trainer: <i>I think it's better to allow Raikou to explain. He knows how to deal with this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: Huh?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">RaikoutheJolts: Hey there, Gira. Long time no see.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: Raikou!!! Are you alright?  Someone claiming to be a human just messaged me and told me he's living in you?... Wait a minute, I get this...Is this one of your jokes again, right? It's one of those weird fantasies you told me about. Ha ha! Such a way to start a conversation with your friend! :D</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">RaikoutheJolts: Actually I'm not joking her, pal. The human is actually shrunken and we are on the run, Gira. We need some help here? Me and Suicune are in serious danger here.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: Alright alright. I believe you, silly! :) What can I do for my little jolter? :P</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">RaikoutheJolts: ....I hope you're ready with what you're about to hear.

You mentioned how at the beginning it all seemed surreal yet alright, and how slowly you realized Dialga was behaving shady. You described how you encountered Raikou and Suicune, although you avoided mentioning any vendetta they had against him, just in case.

She's with you, right. What can I do?</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">RaikouTheJolts: Dialga surely is looking for us, we need protection from him</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: And you want me to host you three into my body? :P Just kidding, just kidding. That was your fantasy, not mine, hah</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: Leave it to me! I'll keep that little idiot far from you, you take care of the human and Suicune</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need anybody to take care of me\"- Suicune grumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You do and you know it\"- you replied before typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>H. Trainer: Thank you so much, Giratina!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Gira0523: No problem, human. Make sure to not to cause a mess inside my friend!!!</span> and with that, Giratina disconnected. You breathed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That went alright. We can count with him\"- Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. Now that we have another dragon involved, let's do something else, alright?\"- Suicune said before leaving. You wondered what was up with her, but leaving that aside, there was something more you needed to ask Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now what wil we do, Raikou?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll try to get everything straightened up before Dialga distorts everything. I think that for now I can do it by myself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Will Mew return later?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know how long it'll be before she's back, so why don't you take some time to relax?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing seemed good to you. The day so far had been pretty hectic, first with Suicune's games, and then with you knowing that Dialga was trying to get you into trouble with the rest of the legendaries. -\"I will. Any suggestions?\"- you asked, hoping Raikou had some quiet and calm place in his body where you could rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's something, but it won't be calm at all\"- Raikou says. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As long as it keeps me busy then it won't be bad\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I noticed that Suicune got you through a series of tests earlier! Would you like to do the same to her? You'd still go with her, but just as a spectator\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The same to her? You mean a game like she did?\"- the idea didn't seem that bad to you. It'd be good to be on control for once -\"But I don't know your body well enough to trace a good route\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could help with that. I have several possibilities, you choose one\"- and with that some folders appeared near you. You took one and took out the contents, which were a map and a list of organs. You checked the name of each route, and picked a few that interested you the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gross-out Route: you won't want to visit any place like these, ever</i><br>\r\n<i>Aquatic Route: Swimming through different organs without a stop</i><br>\r\n<i>Resistance Route: A highly-intensive route that will tire you out </i><br>\r\n<i>Scenic Route: More like a maze of fur, walking through Raikou's hide</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"These all seem interesting, but I'm not sure Suicune will accept\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have to make clear you challenge her to do it. She won't refuse if you do\"- Raikou promised. Accepting his words, you finally decided on which one to take. -\"Raikou, I have made my choice. Please tell me all about this route\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Hmmm... What route should I make her take? Decisions, Decisions... All routes sound like pretty good choices for tests. Well, Suicune is the kind of girl who's a bit competitive and arrogant at the same time; she's willing to take any challenges as long as she believed that she could win. And like any other people with similar characteristics, Suicune definitely wouldn't settle for anything less than humiliating her opponent like she did to me last time. Speaking of that, I'm still kinda upset that she dragged me all the way down there in the middle of the night. The Gross-Out Route seems like a good payback. Now, in order to make her participate in a similar test, I have to find a way to make her take the challenge without arousing her suspicion. This could be my chance at embarrassing her. All that's needed is a little subtlety.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Raikou. Let's make it the Gross-Out Route for her then,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that, human? That's kind of mean,\" Raikou asked with an uncertain tone, \"I really don't want this to become some sort of tit-for-tat between you and her. Please reconsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tit-fot-tat? Nononono... We've gotten over that phase already! Besides, I think Suicune can handle a little grit if she's as tough as she claims to be. She absolutely loves friendly competitions and so do I. Tell me, what do you have along that route?\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou heaved an audible sigh. The Pokemon seemed unconvinced about your statement. <i>Come to think of it, Suicune and I aren't exactly at peace yet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen carefully, human. The Gross-Out route will take you through my intestines, bladder, and ends at my testicles. The test will be more about endurance because you are being carried around and encountering all the gross stuffs. It's as awful as the name suggests. Suicune will have to journey through all of those places for her to win. Are you reaaaalllly sure about this?\" Raikou asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! What is there to worry about? You think she can't handle the tests you've got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm confident that she'll be able to tackle them. I'm just not sure how she'll react especially after how Dialga also played these games on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did that guy do to her?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I understand, after being turned down by her for several times, Dialga finally had enough of the refusals. He had evolved from simple jocular pranks to total obsession with Suicune. Everyday he tracked over her incessantly, sent her mysterious messages, trapped her in new dimensions, mentally spam her mind with unwanted thoughts...all without significant progress. One day, Dialga had the idea of luring Suicune into his body to play her. He camouflaged himself as the entrance to her cave through both mental trickery and planning. Poor Suicune, she never realized what she walked into. I never made it there in time to attempt to save her from the upcoming disaster. That nimrod trapped her in his body to undergo those \"love story\" tests to make her love him which are nothing more than pestering her endlessly. I'm thinking that Dialga was probably trying to break her down in an attempt to get some feelings out of her. She spent three weeks within Dialga's little world before escaping only when she went along with his cliched scripts long enough for him to get 'way over his head' and fainted as a result. Suicune never precisely told me what happened in there but she said it's absolutely petulant and utterly laughable. Remember the Dating Simulation we saw back there? It's probably as pathetic as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...sounds like something Dialga would do...out of desperation,\" you laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. We need to be a little more careful with our pranks lest she equates us with him. If she does, we are in one heap of a trouble,\" Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm...we should never go down that route again. But on the other hand, you really have to stop worrying so much. You need make your voice heard more often. Just a little advice based on my experience: if you keep doing things her way, Suicune will get even more assertive on you until the point you're basically her servant (which I think you're getting dangerously close). You told me that you are getting tired of always being pushed around by her and goaded into doing her bidding. Don't you ever think about doing a little comeback against the girl? I bet deep down you always wanted wipe that smug smile off her face for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I would never thought about Suicune in such a hostile manner. I would never do that to a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, time to change that, Raikou,\" you smirked, \" Let me ask you: Do you remember how she treated you ever since you knew her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune and I first met at the Legendary Council when we were appointed into our roles as protectors of our respective realms. She was exactly the way she is right now and frequently got into trouble with the council. As part of a Trio, I have to be with her and Entei whenever we roam Johto on adventures...Come to think of it, while Suicune isn't vicious, she does get on my nerves sometimes. I've answered every beck and call she'd ever made, stuck by her side everyday, and get dragged around on adventures...and I haven't gotten anything really good in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! This has virtually become the rule: No matter the species, tomboys have a thing for dominating the males in their group. If you are her friend, don't friend usually help each other out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, a little \"harmless\" fun wouldn't hurt too much,\" the Pokemon grinned. <span class=\"cyellow\"><i>This is definitely my chance to negotiate some better perks from her.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are now in the same league, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... but if this gets us into any trouble, you'll owe me a new pair of 'batteries' if Suicune does anything to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...I bear all responsibility for whatever happens from this point. ...Now, finalize your plan for the Route while I get Suicune over here. It's time to put the shoe on the other foot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suicune...the Gross-Out route will be perfect for you... heh.... heh.... heh....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked to your room, where Suicune was lazing over her bed. Barely containing your excitement for what you expected would be a great way to get even with her, you got her attention -\"Suicune, let's play a game!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not now. I can't think of any right now\"- she had the impression you were asking her to think of one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already got one. Remember what you did this morning? There's one for you too\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune got off her bed when she realized you were talking of a group of challenges for her. She was pretty interested, so you threw the folder with the information on the floor. She opened it and glanced to its contents, including the map and the description. She didn't make any comment until she was done reading. Finally, she chuckled. -\"Whose idea was this? Yours or Raikou?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you want to know?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So I know whose ass to kick\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned nervously. You weren't going to throw your host under the bus. Besides, if she started to hurt him from the inside, chances are that you'd be affected as well, so you decided to take the full blame. -\"It was all my idea. He's merely giving his body as the grounds for this\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune was amused by this -\"I didn't think you'd have the guts to challenge me, much less such a...curious route\"- she passed the folder back to you -\"And what's my incentive?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Incentive?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do I get if I win? And what do you get if I lose?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. You hadn't considered it, Raikou and you were satisfied with she going through the route. The Aurora Pok\u00e9mon seemed to take advantage of your lack of foresight, because she quickly added -\"Oh, I think I know what would be good\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you have in mind?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If I lose, then we'll be even and I won't bother you anymore. Never again\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed...kinda a letdown, but you weren't going to refuse. However, you insisted that she added Raikou to the losing condition. She conceded that if she lost, he wouldn't be bothered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And if you are successful?\"- you asked, hoping that it wouldn't be weeks of serving her. Much to your relief, and strangely, she said she didn't want anything if she won. -\"What? Are you serious?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm serious. Why would I brag on your face that I beat you? No, I have a better plan\"- she spoke slowly, you were starting to get a bad feeling -\"I'll accept this challenge with only one single condition: you're coming with me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I am?\"- you had hoped you'd be able to watch from the distance or something, alongside Raikou. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yes. I was with you while you struggled with my own tests, it's only fair you stay with me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...You're saying that so you have chances of making me have a bad time when you can, aren't you?\"- you realized that chances are that she would find a way to make you suffer a bit, even if she was the one to complete the tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you're right about that! And trust me, I believe I'll be capable of passing this with flying colors AND make you realize this was a bad idea, at the same time\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He accepts\"- Raikou intervened. You glared at the ceiling while Suicune laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Somebody is anxious to see me go through this! Let's do it. Get ready, human, this will be fun\"- and with that, she left the room. You stayed behind for a moment. This hadn't gone exactly like you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's too late to change the route, isn't it?\"- you were sure you wouldn't be able to fend off Suicune during the whole thing. The perspective wasn't pretty, judging by the places to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It is. Be careful, human, she won't play nice\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're lucky you don't have to be with her\"* you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like to see my own insides but I can't. It'd be interesting. I should learn to make an image of me\"- he trailed off, before returning to the right topic -\"I'm ready. Suicune won't have a walk in the park\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I trust you have everything planned. Let's get this over with\"- you took the map, and saw Suicune waiting for you a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Finally! I hope you didn't expect me to get there by myself. I don't even know where to start\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and looked at the map, finding the closest route to the bowels. -\"It's that way\"- you pointed, but Suicune shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll be going ahead of me. I'll follow you. Make sure everything is safe before I enter, please\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't like how everything was going.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"This. Is. Bad!!!\" </i>you thought nervously as you led the way. The perfect plan has been totally disrupted and you haven't thought of a backup. You chided yourself in part for being so shortsighted and naive to the point of forgetting that Suicune can be just as resourceful and cunning. She had totally played your cards against you and you now find yourself at the short end of the stick. You could feel Suicune smiling mockingly behind your back, savoring the despair that you are feeling as you walked closer to the Route. Despite the reassurance from Raikou that he'll go tough on her, you now have to worry about the same challenging obstacles that was originally meant only for her. There is no doubt that she figured out that you and Raikou are behind this ruse to humiliate her and that someone's is gonna pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune quickly reached a closed circular opening. A sign on the top reads \"To Intestines\" in bold yellow letters. A secondary sign affixed below it reads \"CAUTION! Slippery floors and walls ahead!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Suicune. The start of the route,\" you said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I take down whatever challenges you have for me. You'll see,\" she remarked confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we have to do now is to touch the opening to start the game,\" you explained with some uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you aren't looking too good, human. Are you having second thoughts here?\" Suicune grinned from ear to ear, \"You are always free to make a 180-degree turn back to your bedroom if you can't handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much,\" you replied sarcastically, \"What about you, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really aren't good at hiding your feelings or dodging questions. The look on your face tells me otherwise, human. I've seen that expression on my opponents countless times: you're just afraid. Don't worry! I'll win this game for you and let you relish my sweet victory...that is, if I have any left for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk, Suicune! Don't gloat about something you haven't accomplished yet,\" you said annoyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph... I'm not gloating as you like to put it. I'm simply being confident and optimistic. You're the one who needs to take your own advice. Or perhaps I need to remind you two who's in charge here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to make that easy for you, then. I'm going first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest. I like to take my time slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing with Suicune can be really testing especially when she's being all stuck-up. You just aren't going to sit behind and watch Suicune get all domineering on you; the precise opposite of you and Raikou's original goal. You sighed and gathered your courage and stepped forward to touch the opening. There was a little hand print-like recess upon the flesh for you to touch. The moment you hand came in contact with it, the tight muscles loosened and a strong gust of wind came from behind you and Suicune. The suddenness caught both of you off-guard and swept you off your feet and paws. You landed face first while Suicune fell on her belly with her legs outstretched. The force of the slip made you slide toward the opening. You desperately tried holding on to something but due to the slime covering the floor, your efforts are futile. Seconds later, all the could be heard were the shrieks coming from you and Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long plunge downward...but that doesn't really matter to you now as your stomach turned and churned at the lack of gravity. It felt eerily similar to the one you felt when you jumped down Dialga's throat, an experience that you would rather quickly forget. You briefly wondered what has happened to him and whether he is actively hunting for you. But with Mew and Giratina behind your back, it's unlikely the Temporal Pokemon would be making any return soon. The former had promised to train you in the little temporal power you've been given, adding another layer of reassurance that you would know what to do in the event Dialga showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOomf! You landed hard on a soft surface which still hurts a lot despite the elasticity it provided you. You righted yourself up and look around. Slimes, half-digested food masses, pink walls covered in more slime. Yup! This is the small intestine. Far above, you heard Suicune coming down. The Pokemon has been shrieking for the entire fall, a far cry from her usually composed demeanor. Your eyes widen when you realized that Suicune is about to land right on top of you. It was too late for you to move as you helplessly watch her form nearing you. Her entire weight came crushing down on you like a boulder. Pain was the only thing you felt before blacking out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Raikou felt the two inhabitants landing in his intestines. He had decided to rest in a nearby cave and informed Mew about his new location should she return. Minutes passed and Raikou still didn't feel any movements coming from the two and got worried about his friends. He quickly did a search for the human and Suicune finding that their hearts are still beating, merely passed out from the fall. Raikou felt bad for the human. He was supposed to be enjoying this little act of sadism against Suicune together. But due to the drastic change in the last 10 minutes, the human will unfortunately be a collateral victim now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry...but the plan still has to move on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's sure that the two are fine, the Pokemon began the process of initiating the next step of his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This will sure spice things up. Sorry, human. I'm afraid that you're in for the ride. A collateral damage.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou released an herb from his storage chamber to encourage bowel movement and metabolism and waited silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nDarkness and numbness is all that you're feeling. Your world still feels murky. There is a sense that you are floating, drifting in this vast emptiness. The feeling was strangely soothing and relaxing despite the feeling of unexplained urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!!! Wake up human!!!\" a voice barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to shut that voice out of your hazy mind but it continued to call you. Then something shook you violently on the floor, forcing you to slowly come back to your senses. With your eyes now opened, you saw Suicune still on top of you glaring at you with her penetrating red eyes. Her paws are pinned upon your chest with her claws slowly digging through your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up! You're pinning down my tail, you clumsy!\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that you are indeed lying on her ribbon-like appendages and quickly helped yourself up. The Pokemon shot you a death glare as you tried to dust off yourself in this humid environment if that's even possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what you did to my tails. They're all wrinkled and dirtied,\" she said in momentary sadness as she nuzzled them, \"I'm starting to wonder if this was your idea to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look too happy with the arrangement Raikou had planned for her. Suicune eyed the greenish slime covering the intestine walls and the half-digested food mass around her and scrunched her nose in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just gross!\" your friend scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're at the small intestines, Suicune!\" you offered with a satisfying grin, \"What did you expect? A clean, sterile hallway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it! I'm in a very bad mood right now. I suggest that you don't make it worse; I might take it out on you, human,\" Suicune glared and flicked you with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so. But it looks like there is no way out of this besides completing the challenge as scheduled. So I advised that you better get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrrgh...\"</span></div></div>",

One led to the stomach while the other led to the large itnestine. You supposed that, judging by the route's intention and the location of the second part of the route, the large intestines were the place to go to. But if Suicune picked the wrong direction, you'd be returning to the stomach, leading to waste time, at the very least. You hoped that nothing else would happen in that scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune decided a direction and started walking, mumbling to herself irately. You followed her, trying to calm yourself down. You said to yourself over and over that everything would be fine and that Suicune would have the worst part of the game, but you knew that at some point she'd be able to make you have a bad time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe environment around you didn't help to calm you. There was nothing soothing in the slime dripping down the walls or in the groaning noises that resounded through the intestine every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We screwed it up!\" Suicune shouted in alarm, and ran to the opposite direction. You froze in the verge of a panic attack when you saw that there was a wave of sludge going towards you. Judging by the color and the pieces of food you could see, you knew that it could only come from the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Suicune passed near to you, she stopped and pushed you to the ground before running away. You stood up as quick as you could, only to find that in those few moments the sludge had got nearer, way faster than you had expected. You weren't sure you could outrun it. Sure, it was to be expected that at some point you'd get dirty, but you wanted to delay that moment as much as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started running as fast as you could, trying to keep the distance from the sludge. Suicune had an advantage over you, as, maybe because of her affinity towards ice and water, she could handle better the slippery floor and the puddles strewn around, unlike you. You fell to the ground several times, each time feeling like the wave of sludge would catch you. Thankfully, it didn't happen when you expected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, soon you managed to put some distance between the sludge and you. When you were sighing in relief to that, you turned around another one of the countless bends you had gone through, and saw Suicune sitting in front of a huge sphincter, as if contemplating the possible daunting tasks that could await her behind it. \"What are you waiting for? Get in there!\" you shouted, understanding her reticence. Not a lot of people would enter a creature's colon willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not sure...\" Suicune wasn't boasting in courage like she had been in the beginning. You felt satisfaction to see her like that, but a groan from the intestine reminded you that there was something incoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there's no more option. You either enter there willingly, or you enter with a mess of semidigested food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you come with me\" Suicune replied very softly. She looked at you almost pleadingly \"I can't do something like this alone\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you understood some of her behavior. She hadn't brought Raikou with her just for kicks when she went into Dialga, nor she had made you come with her in the route just to get revenge of you for suggesting it to her. It was more because she needed somebody to be with her in those moments. She didn't feel like she could do it alone, and she'd do anything to have somebody else with her, even if it meant making them go through stuff they didn't want to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost regretted starting this thing in the first place. And you knew that if Raikou had heard her, he'd regret it too. But there was no way to make him know about this until everything was over. You could only hope that whatever Raikou had planned, you'd be able to help Suicune to endure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sludge advanced towards you, snapping you out of your epiphany \"Yes, let's do it\" you shook Suicune. She changed fastly into her confident state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go. Just this once, I'll go first\" she said, running towards the sphincter and not even waiting for it to open completely. She jumped through the hole that formed there. You followed her, having to wait. When it was open enough for you to enter, you did so without wasting time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what Raikou could have planned for Suicune in his colon, but you did know that it wouldn't be nice. You also remembered that the second stop, the bladder, was pretty much near the backside of Raikou, so chances are that Suicune and you would have to trek for quite a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smell in the Colon was worse than the small intestines. You knew that such a location would inevitably smell like this but this is far worse than you imagine. It's a malicious cross of natural gas and nose-irritating chemicals. You heard Suicune gasped and gagged at the odor and felt a bit sorry for her now that you are slowly regretting even starting this challenge. The place was dimly lit, making any further attempts to continue very dangerous. Just then, something in the corner of your eye caught your attention. It's a wall-mounted communication device with a glowing square button labeled \"Press Button to Confirm Arrival.\" You pressed the switch and immediately heard switches and circuits clicking and whirling to life. Service lighting from the ceiling flickered on, allowing you a good view of the place for the first time. Repugnant was the only word you could come up with. The flesh of the colon is a sickly dark purple with greenish slimes forming trails that dangled from the ceiling. A casual look at the wall tells you that its better to leave the substances untouched. Another cause for concern is the metallic rusty catwalk that's somehow here. It's narrow and just large enough to accommodate your width and from the thick rust upon it, Raikou hasn't been maintaining it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing about the colon is that it's twice as large as the small intestines. But even that roominess is rendered nil by the presence of solid wastes on the walls. There aren't just food wastes, there are also remnants of broken test tubes and organic specimens from Raikou's past experiments are strewn over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're not just in a colon. This is a biological supersite. This will get me genetic mutation once we're through!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune didn't look at all pleased with the arrangement. She's trying her best to put on her confident grin but failed to hide the cringe that is showing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is far worse than I thought,\" you murmured to her, \u201cRaikou really set the bar high with this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for stating the obvious... So tell me again, how the hell did we end up in my friend's colon?\" Suicune asked derisively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps Raikou is simply returning what little courtesy you gave him and me. You know, guys always likes to team up,\u201d you jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d The Aurora Pokemon's expression turned into frown as she stared at you with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...Don't look at me like that. It's not my fault that you ended up here. If you have an issue with this, tell Raikou. He's the owner of this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune narrowed her eyes further at your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get this straight. You and Raikou are pissed because I dominated and owned both of you at games and in life. So, you two figured that you gotta do some counterattack to save your manliness lest you be remembered as several of the guys I've beatened. Did I cover everything?\u201d Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way...yes. That's one of the reasons why he planned this. And I may have a little input into his decision. Sorry,\u201d you said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm....I'm surprised....Not!\u201d she scowled, \u201cBoy, am I glad that I dragged you along for this ride. You really think that I'm naive enough to believe this little \u201cfriendly\u201d challenge you proposed was not a thinly veiled revenge plot, hmmm? You're truly a poor liar, human; your body language literally telegraphed me your intention this whole time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's true. I'm never good at deception. But this is mostly Raikou's idea. I'm kind of sorry that I dragged you into this. I never intended to hurt you or anything. I assume that Raikou would feel the same if he hears you out. Anything I can do to make you feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll give you some advice alright, if you want to make my mood better, I suggest that you find a way to get us out of here....now,\u201d Suicune literally growled the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSadly, it's too late to turn back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late? So...you mean we have to go through all this?\" the Pokemon asked with a worried tone. She bend down and looked at the many abandoned canisters and paper notes and scrunched her nose, \"Ugh, this is too much for me to take in all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded silently while looking at Suicune. Her expression is somewhere between 'screw that, I'll charging forward' and 'I give up.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....there is no way I'm going into Raikou's bowel. No freaking way!\" she said firmly, \"Lets get out of here, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to, Suicune. But the only way would be heading down. Though I'm not even certain if it's wise to head down, it's the only choice we got.\u201d you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Not only are we trapped, we are also the first being to explore my friend's ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after Suicune's groan, a chime sounded from the device on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, human and my dear Suicune. Welcome to part 2 of your challenge,\" an intercom speaker on the wall device said. Suicune stormed over to the device and shouted into the mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAIKOU!\" Suicune screeched, \"You are freaking nuts if you want us to go through this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon motioned her paw toward the large intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Didn't my small intestine offered you a hint of what's coming up or are you just that ignorant about the bodily process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot dumb enough to realize that you and the human planned this schtick together. We'll get to that at a later time. Right now, get me out of your colon, you weirdo. I want out of this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear that, Suicune. But you only have two choices here. You can finish the challenge or you can forfeit the challenge and I'll just bring you back to your room...but as a condition, you will stop bullying me and give me everything I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown your colon. No thanks. I'd rather be in Dialga's weird world than go through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm... is that so? I was planning to give you and the human some handsome rewards for finishing the challenge? Looks like that won't be necessary,\u201d Raikou baited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune's expression softened substantially when she heard Raikou mentioned rewards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of rewards, huh? Better not be some kitschy trophies or medals or random souvenirs. Oh, and don't tell me you're giving the human another one of your toy plushies. They don't even look like you,\u201d Suicune remarked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. It's gonna be something way better. I assure you that it will be of great interest to you both. But I'm keeping that a secret for the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou best have something for us once this is over, you hear me Raikou? If you dare to fib me.....well, you get the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I promise you. Good luck and may the best win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the communication station went silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...Stupid Raikou...\u201d Suicune muttered, <i>\u201cAlright, human. Guess we have some trivial incentives to go forward.\u201d</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon turned noticed that she is standing right beside you the whole time and blushed momentarily when she realized how close she had unknowingly gotten to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Is there anything you need?\u201d you asked when you felt her fur brush against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune leaped away from you with a squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business okay. Raikou had something for us once we win this game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn't exactly say what is it only that it's interesting for us both. I wonder what could it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune scanned you for a few seconds before yutning her attention to the deeper parts of the colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww. I wonder what Raikou has been eating lately to create this mess. He should have stuck with absorbing lightning powers; that's what his type is meant to do. Ever since he started his research, he sure started acting more like humans. Come on, there's no use staying here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune went deeper down the colon, finding the wastes and stench to be very stomach turning obstacles. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you were walking you were really glad that the catwalk was there. If it hadn't Suicune and you would have needed to walk through all the muck on the floor of the colon. Judging from what you see, the mix of solid waste and the remains of Raikou's scientific work could be likely to give you a nasty disease if you fall in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, your blessings weren't perfect. The catwalk itself was so narrow Suicune and you had to go in a row. She had forced you once again to go ahead of her, but if she wanted to change places then you'd have to dangerously stand at the edge of the catwalk, unless you crouched on the floor and let her walk over you. And the smell was still a problem. Your eyes were slightly watering, and you wished you got used to it real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raikou really needs to do maintenance here\"- you commented while you saw a part of the catwalk fall apart. You jumped over it -\"I thought everything inside him was organic, I don't think all Pokemon have these structures in their colons\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course they don't. Raikou always had this fascination with beings inside other beings' body. Have you heard about it?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No\"- you wanted to make a conversation to distract your mind from the place you were in -\"Tell me more\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's not much to tell, that's simply how he is. Some of the legendaries know about that trait of his and we don't think much about it. Giratina once tried to indulge him, out of curiosity. As Giratina is pretty big, they thought Raikou could get in and stay for a while\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How did it go?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Arceus had to be called to dislodge Raikou out of Giratina's esophagus and get him out of the dragon's body-\"Suicune laughed pleasantly -\"Arceus was so stunned, and Giratina and Raikou so embarrassed, they all attempted to keep it as a secret, and now you know they weren't successful\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed too. It was amusing to hear about that, and you wished you had been there. Suicune continued -\"Since then I think Raikou only has focused on his fantasies of hosting beings inside him. I had brought him with me inside Dialga because I thought he'd like it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune continued talking in an effort to forget the challenge you were in, but after a curve you had to focus back on the problem you were in -\"The path is blocked\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, the path wasn't blocked with a wall of feces, as you would have expected from a place like this. It was half of a chestnut shell. It went from side to side of the colon, resting directly on the catwalk. It was impossible to climb it, as it had several tiny spikes protruding from its exterior, and not only that, it also had several longer spikes, getting dangerously close to the walls of the large intestine. You approached, bewildered -\"...Now what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Raikou! Chestnut shells aren't edible!\"- Suicune shouted behind you, trying to get a reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you found it. The lining of those shells are made of a compound that revitalizes mind and body and is said to allow one to go beyond any limitations one previously had. Swallowing it despite the spikes is not easy\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not going to eat from anything I find here, if that's what you're insinuating. I want this to be moved aside\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't do anything. You still have to continue ahead if you want to win\"- and after that, Raikou didn't reply anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe it. Simply wonderful\"- she grumbled, looking hatefully at the chestnut shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I suppose we'll have to move it\"- you proposed, carefully searching for a part without spikes of any size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But to where? We can't move it to one side, and I'm not going to get onto the floor to walk through that!\"- she pointed at the horrifying mess of waste that now seemed to be a few inches thick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then we only have the option to move it forward. Let's push from here\"- you found a spot that wouldn't hurt you, and started pushing with all your strength. It barely moved, but when Suicune fired Ice Beams to the shell, the combined strength of both helped more -\"Yeah! At this pace we can get this done\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Suicune continued pushing the chestnut shell forward. It was an exhausting task, and it didn't move as fast as both of you wished. The sooner you got out of the colon, the better. Moving it down another curve was something that took both of you around twenty minutes, because the shell always seemed to get stuck on the walls. There was also another obstacle, the thickening sludge that was Raikou's waste. It had now reached levels just barely under the catwalk and started to appear on it, difficulty the shell's movement. Besides you had to move to avoid stepping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is disgusting\"- Suicune understated, after firing another Ice Beam -\"I don't want to ever be in a place like this again\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How could this have gotten in here, though?\"- you said, pushing the chestnut shell -\"This thing wouldn't have fit through the small intestine. Has Raikou had this lodged in here for a long time?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm tired, I am in Raikou's colon, I touched his waste, the smell is going to stay in my fur for weeks, I want to tear your jugular off and give Raikou a wallop he won't forget for the rest of his legendary life. I'm not in mood for conversations\"- she growled. You judged more prudent to not to say another word for now. After a while, Suicune spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long will we have to be pushing forward this thing?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I only see two options\"- you replied -\"Either until we find the path to the next task of this route, or until the end of the large intestine. Knowing the point of this route, I'd say they're both the same\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you saying we'll get into Raikou's rectum?\"- Suicune cringed -\"What's next after this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The bladder\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Great, more bodily waste. Let's get this over with\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou was laying on his belly, relaxing on the ground of the cave. He didn't need to check Suicune and the human's progress, he could easily feel it. It had been difficult and painful to bring the chestnut shell from the storage to his bowels, and now the spikes caused him some discomfort, but it served to pinpoint his guests' location. Right now they were around 4/5 done. He shifted uncomfortably when he felt the walls of his large intestine getting prickled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped they'd finish soon. The sooner he got that chestnut shell out of his body, the better. For a moment he considered expelling it while Suicune and the human were with it, at the end of the road, as an added challenge for them. While he was thinking about doing it or not, Mew arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So here's where you are! Giratina managed to hold Dialga off, but he has realized you changed locations\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Does he know we're here?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He doesn't know, but he'll find out at some point. You can't run forever. Dee-al-ga must continue his training too, if we want him to be able to fight back at least a little. I'll go in\"- she localized the human before Raikou could stop her. She doubted for a moment -\"Raikou, did you realize that they're in...well...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know where they are. Don't worry about it, they're...training themselves\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. I'll return later, then\"- and with that, Mew left without making any further comments. Raikou watched her leave, and once again felt the chestnut shell's spikes. He made his decision about what to do when they got to his rectum.</span></div></div>",

Not only would it be a very mean joke, if Suicune's previous threats are anything, he could find himself with several broken fangs and her rump sitting on top of his face. Suicune would then...The Electric Pokemon shuddered at the intrusive and bizarre thoughts. Raikou's attention snapped back to the waves of stinging sensation of the chestnut moving closer to his rectum. <i>Ow......Owwww.......OWW...</i> It was getting more difficult to hold back his tears as the pain grew in intensity. Despite that, this actually good news because, if memory served him right, it was probably stuck in there for at least a week. He has a huge load to drop off once Suicune and the human are out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Note to self: Never directly eat chestnuts without cracking the shells lest you want to have an awful constipation. I hope Mew isn't too creeped out.</i><br>\r\n___<br>\r\nDown in the colon, Suicune and you pushed the chestnut down the remaining length of the intestine without talking much. The further down you went, the drier and smellier the path seemed to get. The lack of lubricants on the wall made pushing all the more difficult. Raikou's grunts echoed through the flesh; apparently, it wasn't too comfortable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grueling half hour later, you and Suicune finally pushed the chestnut shell to the rectum where a wall of wastes has already accumulated and solidified. It's an irregularly shaped chamber with dark pulsating walls. A pool of greenish water filled with more waste sits a few feet away from where you're standing. The chestnut floated upon its surface for a moment then slowly sank into the mess. Both you and Suicune lean against the sides, too exhausted to notice how dirty it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that will solved Raikou's constipation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel sorry for him. It'll teach him some common sense which he seem to be deficient in,\" Suicune rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's sorta mean of you to put it that way. I would say that he's more of the curious kind who likes to take things slowly. But I'll admit, his acumen does need polishing,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was the one doing all the work here and you call me mean?\" Suicune grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mostly teased me and Raikou into doing things your way. If that's what you considered work, you obviously did a <i>stellar</i> job there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever! You could say that he has the habit of over-dedicating himself to research. Say, I wonder if he ever gets any accolades for all this hard work he's been doing other than from Giratina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen a bit of his work and was a willing subject of a little project of his. If he were a human scientist, there's no doubt that he would've gotten mountain loads of awards by now. I supposed he's got a lot of data to share with people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's too wise to give him ideas about taking his works to humans. And I don't think people are prepared to attend a lecture by a Pokemon, at least not yet,\" Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The professor back at my hometown would've love to hear from Raikou. He's really into Legendary Pokemon studies and would be thrilled to hear information straight from the mouth of one. Raikou kinda reminds me of him,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, at least he's got one guy who will listen to him. But he'll probably be bored out ten minutes in. Hahaha...,\" the Pokemon laughed haughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Suicune muttering something about how humans are a strange species as she walked around. There's something that's been lingering on your mind for some time. It was a question for Suicune. The Aurora Pokemon has been acting really funny around you lately. She really likes to stick with you a lot of the time and always find ways to tease you in a jocular manner. Coupled with that little burst of emotion back at the small intestine, you started wondering if the Pokemon is trying to get closer to you. You took a deep breath before firing off the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Suicune, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how you acted back there when we were escaping from that huge sludge? You suddenly went all emotional and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious about that little piece of my soft side, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kinda like that. Why did you suddenly act all emotional? It feels really out of place for your personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....,\" her face softened briefly before hardening again, \"...none of your business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's obviously not true. People or Pokemons don't just randomly display such strong emotions so openly. That happens when someone needs help or when a person has a cru....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare finish that sentence, human. I know where you're going with that,\" Suicune interrupted with a stomp, \"I'm not the romantic kind so forget it. Sheesh! As if it isn't enough that I'm stuck with two incompetent fools for friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Sui. Anything I could do to make you like feel better, Suicune and perhaps, get you to like me more\" you offered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shutting up and focus at our current problems would be a good start. Wait! What did you just call me? Sui! That's the most awful nickname since Dialga called me his 'little darling princess'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it sounds nice,\" you answered with fake enthusiasm, \"But that still doesn't change the fact that you're feeling something in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's not like I like......oh great, the horrors of Dialga's date sims assaults my brain again. I've got tons of romance dialog crammed in my head with no end to it. Those still give me the cringe,\" Suicune said with a disgusted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...you look kinda cute when you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever use that word in front of me. I'm cooler than you or Raikou will ever be,\" Suicune glared at you, a deep blush forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. So it back to tomboy mode again? Alright then, Sui. Lead the way,\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop. Calling. Me. By. That. NAME!\" Suicune gnarled her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Suicune and continued onward. The Pokemon started screaming something about making you her personal servant for a year if you keep up with your crack. Despite her threats, one thing is certain: Suicune has somehow developed feelings for you but still refused to acknowledge it. Come to think of it, you've also kinda grown to like her type of personality despite how she acted toward you. <i>I'll just play cool for the time. I need to see what she's up to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter feeling that you have rested enough, you found another pipe-like tunnel in the rectum for you to walk on. In contrast with the colon, the walls here are mostly clean and pink. A few steps into the tunnel, a strong scent of ammonia assaulted your nostrils. It's the kind of awful smell that you'd encounter at the Pokemon park or a poorly cleaned restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! The smell of a male's piss... Yup! We're going in the right direction.\" Suicune said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes down the path, you began seeing trickles of urine seeped out from the walls and floor, merging into a widening river that flows increasingly fast. There weren't any traction for you feet or hand to get hold of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Suicune yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back just in time to see her lose her footing and send her slipping right into you, knocking you off your feet. Both you and Suicune became entangled to one another as the current of urine carried you down. Even with your head in an awkward position near her rear, you felt Suicune grasping you firmly with her paws. Likewise, you secured your arm around her body. Without any frictions, the tunnel became a slide bringing you unceremoniously into the bladder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long before the slide ended and you plummeted into the air. You soared though the air for a second before plunging into what at first glance seemed like a sea of liquid. You closed your eyes instinctively, knowing where you had just fallen. Once you resurface, you observed your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely was the bladder. It was much bigger than you thought it'd be. From what you could see, you supposed it was a bit more than half full, so there was still a good amount of dry terrain. Along the walls there was a spiral of flesh that ended in the top of the bladder, you suppose it led to some sort of exit. Suicune had already swam to the dry terrain, and was shaking off the urine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swam the best you could, struggling to keep your head above the surface. You're not the best swimmer, since you relied on your Pok\u00e9mon to take you through the water in your journeys. In moments like this you wished you had made an effort to learn to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get to the dry terrain you approach Suicune. She was staring at a button on the wall, just like the one you had seen in the large intestine. -\"How many kidneys does Raikou have?\"- you asked aloud, looking at the four holes you could see. Maybe under the surface there were more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you expect me to know? I suppose there are two, and the rest are from other parts of his body. Who cares?\"- she said, pressing the button. Raikou's voice emerged from the communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Welcome to the second phase. You have done a good job so far. This is simpler than the first part, and shouldn't take you so long\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Say it quickly\"- she ordered impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Alright. In the bladder you should find four transparent spheres. It's simple: retrieve them all\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is it? Doesn't seem difficult\"- you commented. Suicune glared at you, as if now Raikou was going to add more difficulty to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That is it. The sooner you finish, the better. Don't take more than an hour and half, I think.\" And with that, the transmission stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"An hour and half? That's more than enough. We'll be done in less than half an hour\"- Suicune said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do we have a time limit now?\"- you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune walked to the edge of the terrain and peered into the urine. -\"Isn't it obvious? If this place gets filled then we'll have to stop and leave. Surely when it's emptied the spheres will be expelled too, meaning we lose. Let's get this over with. How long can you hold your breath?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A minute or so\"- Suicune's expression showed it was an unacceptable answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So you'll be useless. I'll have to do this by myself\"- she grumbled, slowly getting into the liquid. You watched her swim to the center of the bladder, then she dived and you couldn't see her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat and waited for around ten minutes before being bored. Suicune hadn't resurfaced yet, so there was nothing for you to do other than looking at the streams of urine that fell from the holes. You grew antsy with each second. There must be something you could do. Raikou didn't say all of them were submerged, did he? Maybe there were a couple in the dry terrain. It was worth checking. You stood up and started walking, roaming around the bladder. After a while you had to accept there weren't any spheres in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, you looked around quickly. There was a hole near you. You decided to check in it to see if there could be any hidden in there.It'd be kind of clever of Raikou to do that, Suicune wouldn't think of checking there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed on the hole, fighting the stream of urine that threatened to push you back outside. You ascended, grasping the walls the best you could and trying to keep the liquid from entering your eyes. It was bad enough to be doing that, you didn't need to be blinded too. In your ascent you saw something shine among the stream. It was a clear sphere of the size of your fist. It was lodged into the flesh, but you thought you could get it out. It would mean you'd be in risk of being pulled by the current, but there was no other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you doing up there?\"- you heard Suicune calling you. She must have realized you weren't around, so she searched for you until this moment. You avoided speaking and focused on the sphere. In a bout of bravery, you let go the wall and grasped with both hands the sphere and pulled. The sphere and you got thrown back into the bladder, again falling into the urine. You held onto the sphere to ensure it didn't sink, and floated to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune swam to you and saw what you were holding. -\"So that's where it was. I already found the other three\"- she said, dragging you to the edge of the dry terrain. There were another three spheres identical to the one you were holding. You put the fourth with the other ones and walked to the communicator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're done here. We found them\"- you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Good. Well done, and it really was quick. It was just twenty minutes!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune scoffed. -\"You understimate my eyesight underwater. It was horribly gross\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's continue, then. In the bottom of the bladder, way under the surface, you should see a sphincter. That'll be the route to the third stop. Remember to use the communicator when you get there\"- Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune once again got ready to dive into the urine. -\"What's next?\"- she asked, resigned to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um...we're now going into the testicles. I suppose the sphincter down there leads to the urethra, and we'll find the path to the testicles from there\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune laughed softly. -\"So Raikou is sending me to such a sensitive part of his body? Does that sound smart to you?\"- You had to agree that it wasn't very smart. Once again, common sense wasn't Raikou's strong point -\"Hold onto me. I'll dive as fast as I can to the exit. Take a very deep breath\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held onto Suicune while she slowly swam into the urine. Once you told her you were ready, you took a deep breath and were led under the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune took you to a deeper area into pool of urine, searching for the sphincter that will lead to the testicles. Though your vision is blurred by the yellow hue of the urine and slight stinging in your eyes, you could still roughly make out the pinkish bottom of the bladder. Suicune stopped and scanned her environment before swimming deeper. You eventually made out the darker shade of an opening several feet ahead and notified Suicune by tapping her back. The Pokemon looked back at you and saw you motioning toward the sphincter. She gave a quick nod and paddled faster, aware that you might exhaust your breath in a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the sphincter, it intuitively opened up. The Pokemon swam through the opening before it closed up again. She turned back to check on you and immediately widened her eyes. You face doesn't look right and your body is flailing slightly. Suicune dramatically increased her speed when she realized that your face is turning pale from the lack of oxygen. You felt every muscle in her body moving to transport you as quick as possible to the end of the tunnel, the urine around you rushing by at a breakneck speed. You paid no attention to your surrounding; you focused all your energy on conserving the little oxygen remaining in your lungs. Oh no! you thought as you started seeing stars and flashes at the edge of your vision. Suicune. you can do....it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune did her best to swim as fast as she could. Darn it, I can't get any faster with all the extra weight the human has placed on me. Her lungs could hold far more oxygen that a human could do but even that is running short. She felt her muscles straining and aching. The pain briefly prompted the thought of giving up and just let it be over but Suicune banished it as quickly as it arrived with her will. After another minute of swimming, the Pokemon saw bright lights ahead of her, indicating the end of the tunnel. With a last dash of her energy, Suicune forced herself to swim forward toward the light. Come on, human. Hang on there. I'm not going to let you die like this. I'm not going to give in either. how the heck will I tease Raikou or pull my ultimate prank on Dialga if I end judt like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you feel you're about to black out, a loud splash thundered as you felt yourself being thrown in midair and landing on soft flesh with a thud. You instinctively gasped deeply at the presence of fresh air in the environ. You've never felt so much relief at the presence of oxygen; the emotion bordered on euphoria. There was another person panting even more loudly right beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant* How's that.....for a......quick swim, huh human?\" the voice said with a heavy strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked toward your right to find Suicune lying on her back with her legs curled up and her chest rising and falling. Her furs are all matted and disheveled; even her eyes looked a little bloodshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...... made it, Suicune. Thank goodness...... I thought I was a goner,\" you tried to say while panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha,\" she laughed raspily, \"I'm not much better now.....heck, I'm so gonna tell Raikou....to make some body \"modifications\" after he pulled this schtick.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I agree with you on that one, Sui. Raikou kinda overdid this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh......you won't.....stop using that nickname, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No plans for that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune gave you a look that sends shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep note of that, human.....Anyway, we've gotten to Raikou's....testicles....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune took a full five minutes to regain your breath and energy. Sure enough, the walls in this area looks flabby and loose in an almost cloth-like fashion. A couple feet from you is another communicator device affixed to a thick vein. Beyond that, you saw a pair of humongous ovoid structures hanging loosely from the ceiling. They are held in place by thin veins that crawls up from the floor in a fashion similar to stalagmites and a thick tube that interconnects the two testicles before disappearing into the ceiling. By estimate alone, each of those balls are at least 10 times your size, perhaps large enough contain a full-sized Pokemon stadium. Because Raikou was resting in the cave, it caused the light purple balls to skew slightly to the right. Everything looks anatomically right save for the electric arcs can be seen passing between the two structures which can be entered through small openings that can be reached by walking on of the veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you've seen enough of the new location, you headed over to the communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Raikou, we're here,\" you announced to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Welcome to the place where all life begins. I was wondering what's taking you two so long,\" Raikou's voice cracked from the speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune perked her ears up at the voice and marched up to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you why!!! You made us take that long winding urine-filled tunnel. We almost drowned there and you're not even aware of it?!\" Suicune barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Don't be mad, it was all part of the test. I thought you're good enough for that. Am I sensing that you've reached your limits?\" Raikou said apologetically yet with a sarcastic jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let me be clear with you: Because of you, we are now covered in smelly urine, exhausted, and feeling a bit nauseous. Plus, I have absolutely no intention of dying in you dick. Let me just remind you where we are now, what I am capable of and the precious warnings I gave you,\" the Pokemon said in a dangerously low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright man...I'm sorry...I probably didn't thought that out well enough.... Easy there, Suicune. Don't do anything rash now,\" Raikou said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that!\" Suicune smirked and fired off an ice beam toward one of the testicles hitting it spot on. The effects of the blast made the entire chamber jerk violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeouch!!!\" Raikou screeched, \"You really did it! You froze my testicles!!! By Arceus, how could you do this to me? There goes my children and mates! Nononononononono......Now, how am I supposed to explain this to my friends and parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit the melodrama, will ya? I merely chilled the surface a bit,\" Suicune said jocularly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Raikou quickly stopped his wailing and rubbed his scrotum as if to warm it up. He realized that it's still in one piece and functioning, albeit a little shook up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha...I've never seen you squeal like that. Priceless!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the worst, Suicune\" the Electric Pokemon fired off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment. On your next offense, it'll be popsicles for real,\" Suicune scoffed, \"So what should we do here, Raikou?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, you get to visit the interior of my precious jewels. One contains the \"Sperm Bank\" while the other is the home of the \"Fantasy Fulfillment Resort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are those?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sperm Bank is a collection of my seeds in various stages of developments kept for research and further enhance of my offspring. You can think of it as a production and research center for any for my potential mates. Pokemon genetics is a really fascinating thing and you two are in luck. I have several successful results to show you. Plus, I'm currently undergoing a radical experiment in there that might require some cooperation from the human. If you want to, you can also interact and play with the specimens I have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced momentarily at Suicune when you heard what Raikou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...that sounds interesting enough,\" Suicune remarked, \"What about that resort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fantasy Fulfillment Resort is the place for you to relax and fulfill anything you want. There are many amenities offered there. I have some nice stuffs for you inside as a reward for making it this far into the challenge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...I'm a little skeptical of that, Raikou. How are we supposed to relax here?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough. So what will it be?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you had gone through a near-drowning to get there, you expected whatever you found to be good, so you decided to check Raikou's work. You notify Raikou it, and are told to follow a path that ascended towards one of the testicles. You entered and was instantly blasted by the atmosphere. It was warmer than the rest of the body, and you supposed it had something to do with the function it supposedly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's get done with this as soon as possible. I don't want to be here for too long\"- Suicune growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Who knows, it could prove to be interesting. Let's take a look\"- you said, although part of you agreed that spending unnecessary time in there wasn't something you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was smaller than you had thought it'd be. What you found was a staircase that descended deeper into the testicle, until you entered a room that held a strange assortment of machines. You couldn't guess their function, but those wouldn't look out of place inside Dialga. -\"What are those?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Those machines practically control my own genes, and help to simulate the results. I also have gathered different genetic codes from different species I have met during my life\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not one of them, right?\"- Suicune was getting tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course not. I wouldn't dare. Everybody who has given me their genes have done it voluntarily. Would you like to cooperate?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't\"- that was Suicune's answer. Raikou wasn't fazed by the negative answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about you, human? Would you like to help?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Um\"- you weren't going to get into a mess without knowing exactly what it was -\"What would I have to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll need a sample of your genes. It'll allow me to analyze what your species is made of, then I'll start combining it with my own to determine how viable it would be to form offspring with a human\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Would you really do that?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honestly I wouldn't. It's mere curiosity. I promise that the results wouldn't even get out of the room I'll assign it, and it'll be completely stable, not a deformity. It's just an experiment\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. The concept of the experiment had some interest to you too, you wondered what its results could be, but you still didn't know what it entailed for you -\"Okay, what will I have to do?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A sample of your blood should be enough. Approach the machine closest to you and I'll do the rest\"- you nervously obeyed. As soon as you got close to the machine, a mechanical arm emerged from the top, carrying what looked like a needle and a small capsule. You took a deep breath, getting ready. You barely felt when the needle got in contact with you, drawing the needed sample. The capsule returned to the machine, a buzz filled the room. You rubbed the sore spot, and looked around, as if the results were going to appear instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It'll take a while until the specimen is produced. Meanwhile, why don't you take a look at the specimens I have tried already? You'll be amazed, I promise. Just go downstairs if you want to take a look\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess that you may as well go. After all, part of you has gone through the same process, so now you could check what Raikou has done in the past. It could help to prepare yourself to what the end result would be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The prospects of seeing 'hybrids' of Pokemons might seems a little unsettling at first but it also greatly piqued your curiosity. There is that strange part of you that want to see the specimens no matter how bizarre they might be. <i>What are the chances you are gonna see a Raikou\u2013(insert Pokemon name) combination in real life?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You wanna see the specimens, human? Or are you just gonna stand there and zone out?\" Suicune suddenly asked cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Suicune. Guess I was a little shocked about Raikou's experiment. Let's get going,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your expectations up high, human. I bet half of those crossbreeding experiments resulted in something pretty weird. Be prepared for \"Raikou's Spectacular Freak Show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You better take that back! My experiments are not freak shows\" Raikou fired back, \"I've dedicated a large portion of my time for such research and I am confident that the results are worth showing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Raikou? I do recall you telling me that a particular genetic experiment between Mew and you ended rather badly. You kinda traumatized her with that creation, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was years ago and that's just one mishap. Do you know that I had to apologize to Mew for nearly two weeks before she's willing to shrug that off?\" Raikou said, \"Since then, I have discovered some of the secrets of Pokemon genes and the process which a life form came to be. If you had gave me a sample of your genes, I could have created something that would 'wow' you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Combining traits of a ditzy egghead and the dominant leader. That's a big no-no in my book. What in Arceus' name were you thinking? I knew you long enough to know where you're taking this; you'll make me your personal Rattata for whatever reproductive studies you're doing. Gee, wonder what the offspring would look like?\" Suicune jabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be just fine. After that failure, I haven't created any abnormality; just new prototypical creatures. As a researcher and scientist, I assure you that it has a 99% chance of success. We might even be on the verge of creating a new Legendary that's exceed us both in strength and stamina. With that said, have you ever plan on starting a family, Suicune? If you just give me a single strand of your mane, I can show you a...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.....just no...\" Suicune interrupted, \"You are crossing a very dangerous line here. I don't plan on doing that just yet. And if you recalled where I am now, you really wouldn't want me to deprive you of that same joy, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't gonna do any better without my help and you just won't admit it. It isn't like your assertiveness is the real reason you never found a mate,\" the Electric Pokemon rolled his eyes, \"You know, Suicune. You really get on my nerves sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feeling is mutual,\" Suicune smirked, \"Anyway, you better have something worth my attention down there. Or you may just find a pissed off Suicune to deal with in your testicle, ready to render your punishments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man...Can't we just focus on something other that my balls every time we have an argument? It's getting really old...\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll depend on how worthwhile your exhibits are, dearie,\" Suicune chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two Pokemons finished their jabs, Suicune marched toward the stair with an annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, human. No use in standing there,\" she said.<br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs toward the lower level is narrower and steeper than the first one you and Suicune descended. The lower level looks similar in size to the first one. As with the upper level, a huge array of machinery is neatly organized into stations The difference is that numerous glass windows are built into the testicle walls and standalone cases occupied the floor. In each of the display, you could make out something moving within but you're still too far away to really discern them. Whatever in those displays are definitely alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you let Raikou get a sample of your blood. Who knows what he'd create out of that?\" Suicune whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna give Raikou a little help with his research. What harm is there to that? It won't get out of this place anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thought of him doing some crazy experiments with your genes just doesn't sit well with me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can blame that on his never ending curiosity. Let's just humor him for a while, Suicune, \" you grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...But aren't you gonna make his bookworm mode even worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the fun part of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go...why am I sticking with these two again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led Suicune toward one of the display cases that house a medium-sized bird Pokemon with Raikou's body color. Two little fangs protrude out of it's orange beak and black stripes streaked through the plumage. The Pokemon is perched on a metal bar while it preened its wings which has claws on them. When you two approached the specimen, the creature turned and looked at you with a pair of violet eyes and fluttered it's wings which generated a mini thunder storm. A plaque affixed to the display showed that it's result of a hybrid between Raikou and Zapdos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft! That's nothing really special, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved on to the next display case, you saw something that looks like a golden sword shaped into a lightning with black details around the edge. A circular and motionless eye is located at the center of the cross guard. Upon seeing you, the thing hovered closer to Suicune while emitting an indescribable yet melodic ringing. The sounds reminds you of a glass harp and the celestial space; it was a beautiful being. This time the plaque explained that it's a Raikou\u2013Unown hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Entei is gonna react if he sees this,\" Suicune said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully more amused than upset,\" you added as you moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope for the latter sometimes. I do wanna see if his flame really burns up everything,\" she said absentmindedly, \"But this does look a little more interesting than the last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother display contains a golden-colored Mew with ruby red eyes with a electrical plug for a tail. The Mew dashed around excitedly at the sight of you and Suicune. It seems that even the personality of the original donor can be replicated here. The specimen reminded you that real Mew is supposed to train you soon for your duty as the human in their legend and the upcoming fight with Dialga. You wonder where that sorry excuse of a Pokemon is doing now. At this point, you just wished that Dialga would just give up the chase and head home to whatever dimension he came from; you were having so much fun in Raikou that you almost forgot about him. <i>Hope that Dialga would postpone his plan a little longer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune viewed a few more specimens: a Porygon in the shape of a Raikou origami, a Diglett covered in electrical spikes, a Skitty that looks like a miniature version of the Electric Pokemon and many more other you can't really tell where they came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought that such genetic experiments are possible, but you Pokemons sure proved me wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as your happy with these little parlor tricks, I'm good,\" Suicune smiled, \"I'll admit, these are somewhat interesting for my taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to hear that,\" you said, \"I'm getting curious as to what my specimen would look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome only by Raikou's standard, but probably still decent enough to be acceptable by mine,\" Suicune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww...what's that? You just can't admit that Raikou trumped you in at least one area. Heh Heh,\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph...,\" Suicune huffed and glared at you, \"You are so gonna get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>A few more minutes of random chats and teasing later...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're specimen has been successfully created. It's one of the most awesome creation I've seen. You gotta take a look at it.\"</span></div></div>",

Apparently the new creations were done in the lowest floor, so when you found a staircase descending into the darkness you followed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was barely illumination, you could only fuzzily distinguish the edges of the objects. -\"Can you see anything, Suicune?\"- you asked, supposing her eyes were better fit to see into the almost non-existent illumination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Follow me\"- you heard her say. She wrapped one of her tails around your arm and pulled you through the floor, until you reached a marble platform. Suddenly a light shone from the ceiling, making the platform glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll now present you the result of the most recent experiment!\"- Raikou said with enthusiasm. You waited expectantly until you heard soft steps from somewhere in the room you were in. Soon a figure entered the platform, allowing you to see the experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a naked blond man. He was more human than Pok\u00e9mon but he didn't look like he was related to you, and there were several traits that indicated there was something strange and unnatural about him. Slender and elongated yet oddly fit, you were half-expecting to see him crouch and jump from the other side of the room towards you. He looked perfectly capable to do that. Speechless, you stepped back. -\"Uh, he's impressive\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He is!\"- Raikou replied -\"I'm proud of this creation. A shame he can't be real in the sense of him existing out there\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment approached to you. -\"Hi there\"- you say nervously. The experiment didn't reply, he only examined you intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He can't talk. Maybe in the future, but right now he only has the most basic survival instincts\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least it isn't a freak like the rest\"- Suicune muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already said they're not freaks! But this time I achieved a very stable specimen. All the practice I had pays off now\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What will you do with him?\"- you asked. In a sense this was your offspring, you felt oddly protective of him. You approached, extending your hand to touch him. He recoiled away from you, snarling. It was possible that with some time he'd show more feral behaviors, but so far it wasn't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll let him live in an exhibition and I'll teach him to enhance his human capacities. Right now mentally he's more like an animal than a human. Maybe after a while, when Suicune and you aren't inside my anymore, he'll be my companion. He can help me so much with my work from inside myself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou started murmuring the possibilities the specimen had as an assistant, while Suicune and you left. The specimen had gone back into the shadows, you just hoped he'd at least be comfortable. Suicune was pensive, possibly impressed by what she had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I had never realized how serious Raikou is about his experiments. I always took him as an eccentric nerd but there is...passion, after all\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought it had been obvious from the beginning\"- you replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In hindsight it was. I simply didn't take him seriously\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune and you returned to the main floor, where you could see the entrance to the testicle. -\"So now what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well this was the last stop from your challenges. You were supposed to let myself take a sample of your genes to create a speciment of you but you didn't comply, Suicune. You lost\"- Raikou stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Suicune was furious. After what they had gone through that day, to inadvertently lose like that...it was unfair. Suicune looked as if she was going to unleash her fury on everything around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But since the human helped me to create what may be my most valuable experiment...I may count it as your win\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You will? What about the reward?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's up to you to take it. You may go into the other testicle and indulge yourself in your fantasies, if you want. You earned it\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not much but I'm not going to reject a reward\"- Suicune said, walking towards a passage -\"What about you, human?\"- The truth is that you didn't feel fully comfortable with letting Suicune and Raikou know about your innermost fantasies. You hurriedly made an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh, being inside another living being was my fantasy, and I'm in it right now. I don't need to do anything else\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure? I'll be going, then. See you later\"- and she entered the passage. You watched her leave, still indecisive if you should go with her. After all, you ent through the same things than her. The reward was technically yours too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you decide to accompany her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, the Pokemon started up the set of gelatinous stairs that lead to the entrance of the Fantasy Resort. Upon reaching the landing, Suicune grinned and winked at you and beckoned with her long, wispy tail as if daring you to follow her. That little mischievous display obviously meant to goad you into making a decision. The choices are clear here: you could either head back to your bedroom and spend the night alone or you could take some risk and enter the resort with Suicune, facing whatever that may be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Pokemon was deliberately teasing me to go with her. Is she trying to catch a glimpse of my personal fantasies? But she already knew about my thing for endo-exploration. That leaves...oh my... she wants me to see hers. Well, maybe I should stick with my old bedroom and let the girl enjoy whatever devious dreams she might have. But on the other hand, this is my opportunity to explore the personal thoughts of Suicune. What kind of fantasy would she have? Are they similarly as intense as those of a human? Perhaps it even involves humans. It's a topic worth delving into!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you've completed all the challenges, you could tell from her occasion stumbles that despite her cockiness and tough-girl image, the Pokemon has shown all signs of becoming attached to you. She would never straight up admit it but her actions said otherwise. <i>I'm starting to enjoy her sarcasm and threats. It's like I'm also falling for her in some ways. She does look rather cute when she's all bossy yet affectionate.</i> There's a lingering curiosity within you. You wanted to find out more about Suicune and what else is there beneath her tomboyish facade. Who exactly is this Legendary Pokemon? What made her demeanor so attractive? That's it, you're going with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly ran up the steps and hurled toward Suicune, who was about to enter the doors to the testicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait up there, Suicune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprint went a little too fast and you soon lost your balance. She turned her head in time to see you coming her way. Suicune's eyes momentarily widened in shock as she saw tumbling toward her. You bumped face first in to her body and fell back with an 'ummph'. She shrieked in a way very unlike her usual self and fell back on her rear. Stars and images erupted in your field of vision <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Easy there. You almost plowed yourself on me,\" Suicune exclaimed as she dusted herself with her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you stop being so reckless?\", she chided you, \"It's almost like you're doing it on purpose just to get your hands on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a bit too excited, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too excited, huh? Are you trying to 'score' some advantages with me?,\" she said with an raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely no way, Suicune! I wouldn't dare do that. Why on Earth would I attempt that and end up being added to your personal ice sculpture collection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you secretly like being tormented by me. Admit it! You like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", you said as your face turned red, \"Dialga is far more deserving of that treatment with all his weird fantasies. You should take it out on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon mentioning the long-forgotten Pokemon, Suicune momentarily looked at you awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to mention that sicko again. But you didn't really answer my question,\" the Pokemon grinned, \"That's fine, I'll find out soon enough. Anyways, what''s on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah uh...I want to come with you and see what this Fantasy Resort is about. Besides, this is an opportunity for you to understand each other a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression was unreadable for several second but then Suicune's muzzle cracked up into the most mischievous grin you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're tagging along with me after all. We all got \"needs\" after all. I wonder what things you've got in your little brain. There are maybe even some fantasies involving me. Mind if I take a look at those later?\" Suicune playfully jabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by the blunt request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'm okay with that. Those are personal,\" you blushed deeply at the Pokemon's suggestion. Her smile only seems to get wider as she realized that she may have struck gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. You won't regret your choice, human. This will be different from your previous experience. I'll make sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Suicune said the last portion is starting to sound kinky. You are worried about what tricks she might be playing but you're also piqued by her suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get in the and find out our options, shall we?\" the Pokemon motion to the entrance with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed with her and went in through a set of doors flanked by a pair of Raikou statues. Crossing through the door, you are greeted by an interior that is even larger than Sperm Bank. At least ten times the size of your average Pokemon stadium by your estimate. The first the you noticed is the vast white-grayish ocean and that you and Suicune are on some kind of pier that leads toward a large island. The dome-shaped ceiling depicts an artificial cloudless sky with the sun shining down brightly. There's heat radiating from the blinding orb overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down from the guardrail toward the shimmering sea and a distinct smell of the substance wafted toward your nose from the pounding waves below. The said island in the distance is a large mass of cartilage. From several hundred feets away, you can see two imposing buildings on the massive island along with small two-story buildings along a 'waterfront'. You can even make out the beaches that are lined with artificial-looking palm trees and deckchairs. Behind all of that is a mountain that overlooks the entire resort. There is something gleaming brightly at the peak at intervals but you're too far away to make out precisely what it is. The efforts and details placed into this place far exceeded your expectations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Raikou placed a lot of efforts into this place,\" you said to Suicune, \"Looks like it will be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't be sure yet. Large and majestic don't always equal good. Wait till we try out this place before passing our judgment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked on the bony pier for several more minutes before reaching the shore of the island. If it weren't for the white sea or the rather organic-looking structures, you might be as well on some vacation islands off Sinnoh. The grand entrance to the resort is a large public square decorated festively in yellow and purple. A large statue of Raikou and a plague at his paws that reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\"><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">RAIKOU'S FANTASY FULFILLMENT RESORT</font></b></span><br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cviolet\">Fetishes, Transformations, Legendary Kinky Stuffs, and Everything In Between!!!</span></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my most prized and proud creation!\" Raikou voice echoed from an intercom speaker in the statue, \"This resort is a culmination of years of research and many of the places are modeled on real locations I traveled to but with my personal touches to them. I hope you two will enjoy this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll do! I busted my flank for this so it better be good as you suggested!\" Suicune fussed, \"So what do you have for us? Don't tell me this is a kitschy romance vacation spot straight out of your imagination. I don't want any of those stuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than that! As you may notice, this location is more than just the hotel. It's got virtually everything you could possibly find in a real resort town. Dining, shopping streets, waterfront beach, rooms for two, atmosphere, kinky shops, etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting. Where should we start then?\" you asked Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to you to decide. It's your vacation after all,\" the Electric Pokemon replied, \"But as an advice just follow these guides that I have personally prepared  for best experience. I am an expert in this type of situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pamphlets materialized on a pedestal in front of the statue. The cover page reads \"The Best Fantasy Experience for Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Suicune answered with an unamused expression, \"That still looks rather campy to me and since when are you good at making itineraries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... Stop being such a killjoy or you'll never get on a date, Suicune. I'll be busy with something else right now. Have fun you two!\", Raikou said before the statue went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Some days I wish I could strangle that ditz,\" Suicune muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Suicune walked down the waterfront of the island, taking in the sight of the boundless \"ocean\" and the random buildings that lined the shore. You were studying the guide like a tourist in a new country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where does that cheesy guide want us to go?\" Suicune asked you as she strolled beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme see...It recommends that we can go for the Shopping Arcade first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! Raikou's recommending the classic dating routines,\" Suicune said in an exasperated tone, \"After that, he will probably want us to go for the restaurants, then the strolls, some more cliched blah blah blahs, and finally the big night finale. Typical storybook endings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....It's basically what you just said,\" you said as you scanned the brochures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trash those guides! They're just lame and predictable! Nothing more than junks lifted directly from books he read. Let's do this our way and Raikou can't do anything to stop us. Give me that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune grabbed the guides from you and shredded it up with her mouth until they are nothing more than confetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we gonna go from here then?\" you eyed Suicune inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want something more fun and unpredictable? Just follow my lead then, human!\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\"><i>Surprise, surprise...I knew you wouldn't follow my guide, Suicune. But I got more things planned and you two are gonna love it!</i></span></div></div>",

You didn't like very much the perspective of laying your mind wide open for her to peruse. \"Tell me we're not going to enter any of these\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting out of her to the wilderness. These buildings surely will have copies of Raikou and I don't want to have him around\" Suicune didn't stop to explain further. You barely could keep her pace while the buildings were replaced by hills and trees. The road turned rockier until they arrived to the highest hill in the simulation. Effectively it was an island, and there was a logs cabin there. When you arrived to the top you barely could breathe, but Suicune didn't seem tired in the slightest. She looked around, evaluating the different places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start here. This is a simulation, we may as well cause some chaos. That'll deviate enough from whatever Raikou has planned he'll be forced to acknowledge he lost and I won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nRaikou was listening to everything Suicune said, amused. That was going exactly as he supposed it'd go. <span class=\"cyellow\"><i> I don't need to do much to know how this'll go. </i></span> The water level of the sea started to slowly raise. After a while the island would be covered under the tide, leaving only the top of the hill and the cabin as the available terrains. They'd be forced to enter the cabin, which was always supposed to be the final point of the simulation in his guide.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos?\" not that you didn't like the idea. The mere thought of not doing what Raikou wanted was enough incentive for you to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We'll run this simulation to the ground doing what Raikou less expects. The more extreme the better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Good. How do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kitschy beach town is within our reach. Let's jump in. Hop on my back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tentatively got on Suicune's back, not sure where exactly you should grasp. The last thing you wanted was to pull her mane and get rewarded by getting thrown down the hill into the sea. Simulation or not that was going to hurt. \"I'm ready\" you said, settling to hold onto her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then here we go. Let's drive this simulation to the ground!\" Suicune ran forward and once she got to the very edge of the hilltop she jumped in direction to the city, soaring with grace. You felt the wind and the buildings quickly approaching. You noticed that Suicune's paws were being surrounded by ice. All hinted there was going to be quite a ruckus once she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd curiously enough, you couldn't wait to see what else she had in mind</span></div></div>",

The force of the impact almost threw you off her back but you held on to her neck for dear life. Harsh sounds of glass and the stone floor grating on each other filled your ears, screeching and popping. You opened your eyes slightly and saw the Pokemon glowing with an ethereal blue haze around her body. Her purple mane sparkled and brushed against your face causing a chill wherever it touched you. You also note that ground where Suicune was frozen with blue crystals that spread out like an infection from the point of contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the chaos begin!\" Suicune cracked a grin bordering on manic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice crystals expanded and started covering the fake tree and the storefronts on the island. Multiple copies of Raikou ran wildly out of the buildings in an attempt to flee the onslaught of the ice. But all of them failed and became ice statues in the process. Although you knew that those were simulations of Raikou, it still felt unsettling. Suicune blasted them with a powerful blast of Ice Beam and shattered them into thousands of fragments. You could only look on with both fear and curiosity at her powers. The Pokemon then extended her double tails and hardened them into blades and thrashed at the store buildings at unfathomable speed and retracted them back. Within seconds, an entire block of buildings collapsed and sent a cloud of debris your way. It felt more like a cold blizzard than the musty concrete smell you expected. When the dust settled, Suicune looked back at you with her glowing eyes and gave you her trademark smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was my little power demonstration too shocking for you, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Was it really necessary to do this, Suicune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I have to make him admit that he's weak and needs me to get anything done. Besides, my threats aren't bluffs and he's asking for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit mean though. But I'll stick to your side. I have this interest for destruction so this kinda suits me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Suicune smiled and gave her neck a playful shake, \"The demolition isn't even half done yet. You wanna see more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you and Suicune are enjoying tearing down the resort town, Raikou doesn't enjoy the feeling one bit. With each Ice Beam blast, a stinging sensation shot through his testicles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Ow ow ow ow...This... isn't what I... had in mind,\" Raikou cringed as he held his paws to his testicles, \"Maybe it wasn't a good idea to invite the girl to a place she previously threatened to obliterate. Damn it, Suicune, you sly dog.\"</span><br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour went on, the resort island gradually resemble a war zone as Suicune continued her unbridled destruction of the place with Ice Beam and Blade Cut. The trees were being blown apart, roadways shattered, the scenic piers sunk, cafes and shops rendered into rubbles. After destroying the last of the buildings, Suicune inspected her handiwork: an island that look like a hurricane went through it. She frowned at the sight, still dissatisfied with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't enough yet!\" she said, \"Time to the finishing touch to chaos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon jumped high into the air, enough to surpass the island's tallest peak, and focused an energy ball in her mouth at the center of the island. Your eyes grew wide as it gradually grew large enough to encompass the two of you. Suicune smiled victoriously as she fired off the ball of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say goodbye to your precious plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, an explosion unlike any previous one erupted. A white blinding flash covered the entire area and a deafening boom shook you to your core. You see the outline of the island melting away as the brightness forced you to shut your eyes. <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Ahhhhhhh!!!\"</span> Raikou screeched, <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Screw you, Suicune...you...\"</span><br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped Suicune with both your hands and feet as you felt her gracefully swooped down to the featureless landscape below. When you felt it's safe for you to look around, you gasped. The blast has completely blown away any remaining portion of the resort, leaving only the frozen wasteland below. The biting cold air made you shiver; you only have a shirt with you. Suicune must've sensed your trembling and quickly offered you her mane for warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. You can loosen up already,\" Suicune's said, \"You're starting to rough up my coat, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry,\" you said as you got off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avalanche Missile,\" Suicune said, \"A move that I saved for the most extreme battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you overdid it, Suicune? Poor Raikou, he must be feeling very awful right now,\" you asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, That bookworm will get over it soon. And he is about to start whining.....now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!!! My beautiful resort, my testicle. Suicune! How could you?\" Raikou's voice exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! If you weren't forcing me and the human on the cliched date, your testicle would still be intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally ruined my simulator. My resort is now gone. You destroyed and froze the place. All the efforts I spent crafting the place is for naught,\" Raikou said sadly, \"How can I ever mate now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft...Don't be such a crybaby, will you?\" Suicune rolled her eyes, \"I did you a favor by increasing the likelihood you'll find a mate. I destroyed an unoriginal creation and replaced it with something far better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just admit that I'm the winner and you're the loser, Raikou! And it means that you have to create something to my taste now, you hear? If you make me happy, then maybe I'll consider unfreezing your ball,\" Suicune said triumphantly, \"Ha ha ha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" Raikou said as he felt like crying. Okay, you won Suicune! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">But only this time.</font></font> What do you want me to do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suicune smiled slyly towards you. \"You, stay here. I have something to talk with Raikou\" While Suicune got a bit further away you looked around. Suicune sure did a mess, you really are glad you and her are in good terms. Imagining what she would do to you is something that send shivers down your back. \"Note to myself, again: don't make her mad\" you think, looking at the rests of what used to be a town. Although virtual the destruction was still impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the distance Suicune was saying some stuff you couldn't hear. You suppose they were her plans for the simulation. You wondered what she'd like to see, after all she now was shoehorning her fantasy in. Just in case you prepared yourself mentally for what could come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Suicune returned, jogging cheerfully \"It's done. Come, human, it's finally time to do what I want to do\" and so you started following her through the destroyed street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of walking later you arrived to a structure you were completely sure wasn't there before. It would have clashed with the simulated town, after all. Now on the beach there was a big temple made of basalt. There were fountains and streams of water falling into the sea, and the overall effect was one of ancient luxury. You could even see a couple statues of Suicune, which you had half-expected. \"That's more subtle than I thought would be\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she said, from the entrance of the temple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd ask for something that would have you plastered all over it. This is milder than I thought\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune grimaced \"Are you insinuating I'm egotistic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! I didn't mean that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not egotistic. You better not be thinking that\" and with a huff she entered the temple. You followed her, unsure of what you would find inside. After all this is Suicune's fantasy, who knew what she had in that mind of hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't expect was that the interior of the temple would be only one room, modeled like a very well taken care of temple. Everything was bright and of different tones of blue, contrasting with the gray basalt. Suicune was sitting on what seemed to be a big pillow, with another one to her side. \"What's this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my home some time ago. Humans do have a knack of adoring beings more powerful than them\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean people built this for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sit here\" she commanded. You obeyed, relaxing. It wasn't the chaotic vortex of activity you had expected to see. It was more...subdued than wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I knew you would make Raikou create your fantasy I didn't expect this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't somebody like me just want to relax in a familiar place? I haven't been here for a while and since I'm on the run I won't be for a long time. I just wanted to...to be back here again. And if I can be with somebody I tolerate then even better\" she put her head on your shoulder, thoughtful. You had the feeling you weren't merely 'tolerated', but you weren't going to ask for clarifications either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nice place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have anything original to say then don't say it. I think I'd like some...some silence. Forget what's going on and just be here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, hesitantly placing your arm over her. You two stayed in silence for a while, trying to forget you were being chased by Dialga and hiding inside the body of one of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mew returned Raikou was laying around pitifully, bitterly regretting everything that had happened during the last few hours. \"Are they done yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're asking if they're not in my colon anymore then yes\" Raikou answered, standing up \"But it's not a good time to bother them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew fretted, her usual cheerfulness gone for now. \"Raikou, Dialga is causing more problems to Giratina than we thought. Giratina won't hold him for much longer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou paid more attention, disguising the discomfort he was feeling in that moment. \"And what do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga will find you sooner or later and will try to hurt that human and Suicune\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem, I can run away again. I won't let him catch me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but sooner or later he'll get you and you'll have to fight. Look how quickly he found out where you are now. Do you seriously think you can take on Dialga by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou obviously didn't think that. He was in great disadvantage against Dialga, fighting was impossible. \"But won't you and Giratina help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can, but at some point other Legendaries will demand an explanation for why we're attacking Dialga. It's possible they'll be on his side on they hear about Dee-al-ga because it's a human who has a bit of Dialga's powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't the human help in the fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! With its size and its budding time powers he can't! And I don't think I'll be able to train him in time for him to at least be able to harness those powers successfully. This is a bad situation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew floated around frantically \"Dialga is looking for you, Suicune and Dee-al-ga. What if...what if we separate you three? If at least one of you is away from the rest that'll be a big obstacle on his plan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it'd have to be the human who'll be away. Suicune and I can defend ourselves already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know! Then we have to hide the human but Dialga will suspect anybody who was in contact with the human. I would host him but Dialga knows I have been involved in this, he could try to go for me. We need to hide it with somebody who hasn't talked with it but won't reject it. I don't know who, that's the problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou thought for a moment, it was a delicate situation and they needed to define everything now. \"The other Legendaries won't help us if they don't think it's the human from the legend. The legend says that human will be of help to us, making us reach new heights we wouldn't achieve by ourselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can show them the human IS capable of doing that then the rest of the Legendaries will have to help protect him and make Dialga back off. That would be the end of this mess, once and for all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't say it helped us, we can't prove it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's give it the chance to actually help a Legendary, then. What we need is somebody who has a goal but isn't near yet of achieving it. If the human can get into that goal and helps to achieve it then everything will be okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds to me like you have somebody in your mind...\" Mew said tentatively. The truth was that she would have preferred to train the human's powers, but ironically there simply wasn't enough time for that. A more 'diplomatic' plan was needed now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard about the Swords of Justice? There's this Legendary who wants to be part of them but hasn't done it yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo?\" Well that was a choice Dialga would never suspect. The human should be safe with Keldeo, but the problem was convincing Keldeo of accepting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Keldeo. If the human can help him to get into the Swords of Justice and Keldeo testifies about its help then everything will be solved. Besides the human already was in contact with him once, he knows how Keldeo is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll have to talk with Keldeo, then\" Mew sighed. She was proud of being able to call herself Keldeo's friend and she hoped it was enough for Keldeo to trust her judgment, accept the human and be its new host. When she was about to vanish Raikou stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! How long do we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Giratina can keep Dialga entertained for around twelve hours more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't think it'd be good to talk to Keldeo without the human. If we let any time pass Keldeo can think it twice and refuse, take the human with you and make Keldeo accept in that very moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nodded \"You're right about that. Okay!\" she made a flip in the air,starting to cheer up \"I'll pick the human up tomorrow at dawn! Tell him what will happen and make him go to sleep, okay? He'll need to be rested for tomorrow!\" she said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou sighed. It was going to be necessary to interrupt Suicune and the human, but he wasn't really looking forward to inform them of the development. He knew very well Suicune was getting attached to the human and wouldn't hesitate to force him to go with Mew and Keldeo, but what worried him was what the human would say. He just hoped the human would trust them to know what they were doing, even if it was necessary to leave Raikou and Suicune in potential danger while it was transported into a safe host.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the temple, you've lost count of how long Suicune had buried her head in your shoulder. The Pokemon has been silent for the past 15 minutes, her thoughts likely tucked away at some other unreachable places. What was she thinking about? Was it about her old home? The uncertain future? Or is it about this new and close friendship she found in you? The rare serenity was a drastic change from her usual cocky personality and you really enjoy this different side to Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arm is wrapped around her soft yet solid neck and you felt the powerful muscles relaxing beneath her plush coat. Suicune's blue velvety fur gives you a strange appealing sensation that makes you wanna stroke it endlessly. Normally, this would have resulted in you being yelled at or pummeled beneath her paws but now it felt like she expected you to brush her like a love-seeking Skitty. You decided to humor het by gently gliding you fingers through her purple mane, eliciting a contented sigh from the Pokemon. Suicune lifted her head and smiled at you. Her half-lidded red eyes seems to shine with the colors of an aurora in the dim environment of the stone temple. You noticed that though her gaze has softened substantially since your first meeting, the lights within those precious rubies still danced with playful dominance. Instead of an unrelatable prideful Legendary, you see someone who's longing for a close friend. You moved closer to her head and gently leaned against her neck. Suicune felt you at her side and brought her right paw around you and pulled you closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there we go. Silence does get you all relaxed and comfortable, doesn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the sudden strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Looks like you're really enjoying my company. Don't you just wish that we could sit like this for a few hours more?\" Suicune asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want, we can sit here for as long as you desire. The lady makes the call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune thought about your reply for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, let me cuddle you some more. Also, I want to feel those hands on my coat and mane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune turned her head slightly away from you and enjoyed the soft hand moving through her mane. She has to admit: it felt wonderful. The human leaning against her provided some much needed warmth. It's a feeling that's been missing since she left the idiotic Dialga. And this human, interesting and enjoyable, might be the one who'll refill that gap. Suicune collected her thoughts before speaking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, human. Let me ask you something: do you think it's possible we can take our friendship further? Ever thought about me being your girlfriend?\" she asked, her muzzle cracking up at the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did a double take at the question. Did Suicune just invited you to be her special person? Given the circumstance, you were half-expecting it to come up in your conversation at some point. But you weren't expecting it to come up so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...based on how things went so far, I think that's a given.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't believe you. After I the way I treated you and Raikou like personal servants or playing the alpha female this whole time, I doubt that you would find my personality appealing ,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, that's what I find interesting about you. You were so unlike the typical Legendary; you don't do those stuck-up routines and always seek to push the fine line to the maximum. Plus, you are a magnificent-looking Legendary. Is it possible to find a second one like you in the world, Suicune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...here we go again with the typical girlfriend lines,\" she said while rolling her eyes,  \"But I'll give it that you're being honest about your thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Suicune fell silent again as you both contemplate each others words which was unfortunate ended by an uninvited guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Suicune!\" Raikou suddenly interrupted, \"You there, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nimrod!!!\" she yelled, \"Can't you see we're having some quality time together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to cut short your time. But we've got a major problem: Dialga could soon be coming our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? If there's one thing that jerk is good at, it's the resolve of his stupidity,\" Suicune muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought Giratina is taking care of him,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad news human, Dialga is tougher than he'd anticipated. Giratina isn't gonna hold him down for long. Probably less than 11 hours from now, he'll track us down. I believe that we are all in grave danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! You got any contingency plan? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mew told me that she could take you to another host,\" Raikou explained, \"It's one that's completely out of the picture for Dialga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who would be this host?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that you have heard about the Swords of Justice,\" Raikou said, \"Your likely new home would be the youngest and aspiring member of the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that Keldeo fella?

She really was serious about you being her significant other, but you knew you couldn't let that get on the way of everybody's safety. \"Suicune, I think that...\" you started saying but she shook her head with a lot of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't agree with that. We shouldn't get separated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raikou hasn't even said we're going to be separated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't mentioned me, it's obvious what'll happen. This is unacceptable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suicune, you and I can defend ourselves but the human is an easy target\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll defend the human, that's what we should do\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let Dialga get close to the human in any way. We must send it away, it's for the human's safety\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why can't I go with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it'd achieve nothing. Dialga is looking for us three, if he finds you two together he'll succeed in his revenge plan. This way he at least won't be able to do what he wants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune gritted her teeth. She knew Raikou had touched a point he knew she'd react to. She wanted Dialga to fail miserably, after all. Knowing this part of the argument was already useless to argue she went for the next. \"Keldeo hasn't even agreed to it. We can't send the human to him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew will convince Keldeo, I'm sure of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo is just a child, you're putting him in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou sighed. \"First than all Keldeo is what the human would call a 'young adult'. He's ninety years old, he hasn't been a teenager for forty five years already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, that's definitely not a child, Suicune\" you said meekly, but she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo isn't the kind to welcome somebody, let alone host anybody. How do you expect him to give the human safety and everything he needs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a mindless pet, I can talk to Keldeo and we can arrange something\" you said, and Raikou soon voiced his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...are you really okay about that? They never even asked you...\" Suicune realized she was losing the argument and that you'd be sent away mere hours after she confessed her feelings towards you. You understood it was hard for her, but it was something that needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that they have our safety as their priority. We should trust them, Suicune, everything will be fine\". You kind of felt that if you said that she'd accept it much quicker than if Raikou continued discussing it. Suicune looked at you for quite a while before sighing in acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't like you won't be able to talk with me, Suicune\" you said softly, but Raikou interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, well, we'd have to be very careful but we could arrange something, I suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will he be away?\" Suicune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. The objective is that he'll help Keldeo get into the Swords of Justice, which would make him seem more like the human from the legends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never mentioned that until now\" you pointed and Raikou laughed a bit awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but will that be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You'll have to find out by yourself. I know you can do it, human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now knew you had a new task piled on yourself. As if the pressure of honing your temporal powers wasn't enough now you needed to help Keldeo to fulfill his dream. Now that was something you had no idea how to do yet. <i>I suppose I'll know what to do once I'm with Keldeo.</i> Raikou continued talking. \"Suicune and I will run far away in the morning after Mew picks up the human.You two should rest now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will\" you answered, touching Suicune's back. She had been silent for a while already, but she followed you. After several minutes you arrived back to your bedroom. You laid on your bed and Suicune cuddled near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so with Suicune you had an idea to make the transition a bit easier on her. You carefully stood up, making sure not to wake up Suicune, and walked outside of your bedroom. \"Raikou? Raikou are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Raikou sounded like he was still wide awake. Maybe he couldn't sleep due to being worried about Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to leave Suicune a gift. Do you have any gift store or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Let me guide you there\" Raikou opened a path you supposed led there. You wanted to give her something in the morning before leaving. It'd be the proper thing to do, in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd find a good gift, go to sleep and the next morning you'd give it to Suicune before leaving with Mew to see Keldeo. That should be enough to calm down Suicune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her soft face is covered by stray strands of her mane. Seeing Suicune like this only serves to dampen your mood. It wouldn't be easy for you to leave her behind for a long time. A temporary separation is the optimistic way of putting it. But in the grand scheme of things, you know that you have to. The blame falls squarely on Dialga, who not only threatened you, but also Suicune, Raikou, and many others who might fall on his list in the future. You only hope that you won't get too many others involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure that Suicune is safe and sound, you traveled through the passage that Raikou had just opened. With a few hours left before Mew pick you up, you proceeded as fast as you can. The gift shop shouldn't be far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so nerve-wracking...\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is a lot of stuff to digest, human. It might seem overwhelming but I trust that you'll prevail. We have to stay positive,\" Raikou tried to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heaved another sigh before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know how long I'm going to be away from her. It's just depressing to think about it. Plus, it'll take some time for me to adjust to new places. I'm not sure if I can handle that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine,\" Raikou proclaimed confidently, \"Keldeo is one of the nicest Pokemon you could meet. He'll make you feel just at home. Additionally, Keldeo has a similar personality like yours. You two will get along almost perfectly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so. But he better not expect something big from me. I have zero idea on how to him into that Swords of Justice organization he dreamed about joining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that one out later on. We still have a gift to choose, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued down the passage for some times before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Raikou. I've moved from body to body, Pokemon to Pokemon for the last couple of weeks. If things went as planned, I would've been in at least four to five Pokemons. Now, that's a lot of mouths, stomach, chambers to visit. It sorta makes me wonder who's gonna be next in line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea about that. Perhaps Suicune?\" Raikou said jokingly to liven up the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...,\" you thought for a while, \"Probably not a good idea. She might make us personal servants again. Imagine being forced to clean her colon or her you-know-what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Lord Arceus help us if that happens. Who knows what will happen then? But good thing that you two are close friends now. Maybe she'll even enjoy it if you do it for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Let's not go down that direction, shall we Raikou? You sure have weird thoughts sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Sorry about that. We're almost at the gift store. But I must tell you, calling my place a gift store is a gross understatement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou directed you to another opening which opens into a large chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the imposing structure with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou's gift shop is a large tent made from translucent films of membrane. It's the type that reminds you of the Pokemon Beauty Contests that you attended a year before. A sign reads \"Raikou's Emporium\" hangs above the opening into the store. You saw Raikou's projection waiting for you at the entrance. Appropriately enough, the Pokemon is wearing an apron and a name tag. A large grin is plastered on Raikou's face as he beckoned for you to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Raikou's Emporium,\" he said, \"Allow me to make your shopping a fulfilling experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks there buddy. I just wanted to find a present for Suicune. Something that's small but meaningful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Small and meaningful. I have many items that fits that description. Follow me if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as you're told, following Raikou's projection through the entrance. The interior of the store is similar to that of a shopping center. Items of all sorts are arranged on tables and shelves throughout the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time to look around. I'll explain whatever things that caught your interest,\" the projection offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is gonna be a bit more difficult than I thought.</i> A lot of the item is Raikou-themed which made it rather difficult for you to find a more suitable present for Suicune. The first shelf is lined with Raikou's plush doll with size ranging from a keychain to a life size replica of the Pokemon. Beside Raikou plushies, there are also Suicune ones. You helped yourself to two of the hand-sized plushies and gave it to Raikou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Nice choices. These plushies are a nice choice for snuggling while your far away.,\" the projection said before placing it into a basket at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted a table on the opposite side that is stacked with photo books of Raikou. You opened one of them and browsed through endless pictures of the Pokemon in various scenic locations through the world. Another book contains photos of Raikou showing off his muscular body . One of the pictures depicted Raikou in a cave with a pleasure-filled expression while his paws are...You closed the book and tried to get the image out of your mind. <i>Whoa! I didn't know you could use Electric Stone like that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projection barely contained his laughter at your encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved on to the next couple of aisles: toys, posters, paperweights, stationeries, card games, cheap plastic jewelry and even exotic dolls. But no items seem like one fit for Suicune. They're either too kitschy, inappropriate, or mundane to make a good gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Raikou. But none of the items here really fits my expectation.  I don't know what I can give to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Electric Pokemon thought about his next steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll have to find something from my special collection, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special Collection? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find out soon,\" Raikou said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou took you into a deeper and dustier part of the store. Rather than the cheerful atmosphere of a department store, the air gives off an arcane and enigmatic vibe. It felt more like you stepped into an old curio shop in an alley. There are ancient artifacts that looks like they were collected from desert ruins; several you believe came from the same place you would find a Claydol or rune stones. On one of the shelves, you spotted gems and and amulets of all sorts. Other shelves consist of mirrors, stone-carvings, powerful-looking swords, crystal staffs, orbs, and necklaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get all these trinkets and curios?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I acquired them on my adventures but some are my very own creation. Many have their own special powers that could aid the wearer. Feel free to choose one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at hundreds of items along the shelve. You scanned past the dusty items until one caught your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...How about that?\" You said as you pointed to a  pair of identical necklaces. Each has an transparent orb that glows with a soft multicolored  light. The colors compliment Suicune's coat and mane. It also resembles an aurora, her favorite phenomenon. Something about the the necklaces mesmerizes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those pendants? That's a gift from Latias and Latios after I ran an errand for them. They say those were imbued with some of their abilities. But I haven't tested them out yet. No telling what powers they might have though I supposed they are safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have them. It's the perfect parting gift.\" </span></div></div>",

The uncertainty of the future was nerve wracking, to say the least, and you still had no idea if Suicune would be okay. Well, she would, she was stronger than you in many senses, but after the moment you had with her the day before it's understandable if you're worried for her emotional state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou spent the whole night awake, preparing himself for running away. He said he'd be able to get far away and you hoped it'd be enough for Dialga to not to reach him. You had come to appreciate both Legendary Pok\u00e9mon and really wanted everything to go well for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaikou notified you that Mew would be there in half an hour, and shortly after that Suicune woke up, stretching. \"Suicune?\" you asked softly, approaching. She seemed to be like always, not showing any weakness. She sat on the floor and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving soon. I'm going to miss you, you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I...I got this for you\" you took the necklaces. One for you, one for her. It was kind of cheesy, but these were special necklaces, surely it'd be beneficial for both of you. \"I'll take one too. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicune stared at the orb on the necklace that'd be hers, smiling fondly. \"It's beautiful. Where the heck did you find that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Family heirloom\" you lied. You were unsure if Suicune would accept anything if she heard it was something that belonged to Raikou. Suicune tilted her head, clearly not believing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were carrying two necklaces with you all the time without letting them go for even a moment? I'm not going to fall for that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's a long story. I promise that when we see again I'll tell you\" That should work, there may be enough time for Suicune to like it. Besides even if it was owned by Raikou first the fact you had picked those necklaces should be good. Putting yours and feeling somewhat strange having what's likely to be a sign of the bond between Suicune and you you spent the next half hour talking with Suicune about where he'd go. She was not convinced yet about Keldeo's efficiency as a host but had to admit she didn't know him very well. Raikou was closer to Keldeo and he wasn't even what they would call 'close friends'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew is here\" Raikou's voice resounded in your bedroom. After hugging Suicune for a moment you followed a path Raikou opened until you got to his mouth, which opened quickly and extended his tongue forward. After getting used to the lighting outside, it was surprisingly bright for such an early hour, your eyes focused on Mew, huge as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dee-al-ga! Are you ready?\" she said cheerfully. Clearly she was the most optimist about the situation right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready. Is Keldeo near...?\" you asked, looking around as if you expected Keldeo to jump from behind a random rock. Obviously that didn't happen, and Mew made you know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We're going to go to where he is. It's pretty far away but it's no problem for me\" Mew made you levitate using her psychic powers and Raikou closed his mouth in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun but don't forget what you have to do\" Raikou said as a farewell \"Thank you for everything Mew. We'll be in contact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, will I be able to contact with you?\" you asked to Raikou. Raikou seemed unsure for a moment, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I think it would be safer to be careful with that...maybe that's how Dialga tracked me, through my conversations with other Legendaries\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was kind of disappointing, but you didn't let it show. You nodded, understanding, and Mew floated you to the top of her head. You were practically submerged in her fur, the tall tree-like strands reaching upwards. For a moment you had thought Mew would take you in her body while you were transported, this wasn't what you expected. You couldn't see Raikou but judging by the sudden running noise he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get going!\" Mew announced and without waiting for you to be ready suddenly everything lurched around you. It didn't last more than a second but it felt disastrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Of course. What was that move called, again? Surely that was what happened. Mew once again levitated you, until you were on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had said you hadn't talked to him about this. What will you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me and be silent, I can deal with this\" Mew said with firmness and you didn't protest. Keldeo didn't strike you as somebody that'd trust you at first sight, better let Mew keep control of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Mew got to Keldeo. The young candidate to the Swords of Justice was pacing from one side to another and when he saw Mew he let out a sigh of relief. \"M-Mew, what was this urgent thing you wanted to talk about?\" he shot without even giving a greeting. He was clearly nervous for some reason and you wondered what Mew had told him to make him come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo, there's somebody that needs help and only <i>you</i> can be of help. Are you willing to take the mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can do it?\" Keldeo lifted his head, satisfied that he was trusted with something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You're the only one who can do it. A friend of mine needs protection, he's being pursued by evil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...protection? I-Is it somebody I know?\" Keldeo's flattered expression dropped, replaced again with bashfulness. \"I'm not v-very good with people, Mew...people I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trust me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'd trust somebody I call a very good friend, right?\" You rolled your eyes, somewhat annoyed. It's true Mew and you got along but there was no way you could be called 'a good friend'. You weren't going to protest, though. You carefully climbed Mew's fur until you were able to see what was going on. Mew was smaller than Keldeo but due to your diminutive size they may as well be as tall as mountains. Your future host was looking at Mew with attention and it was a wonder he hadn't inquired why Mew had her hand in that position all the time she had been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I would...who is this good friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a human and-\" that was all you heard before Keldeo gave a couple steps back, stammering 'W-w-w-w-what?!'. It took quite a while before Keldeo accepted to listen to Mew's explanation, as he was clearly worried about being caught and imprisoned in a Pok\u00e9ball. You briefly wondered if most of wild Pok\u00e9mon had that fear, you never really considered it. Mew had to insist you were somebody they could trust and that everything would be fine, until he finally calmed down, breathing deeply. <i>Raikou, you said his personality was close to mine. You're either insinuating I'm a nervous wreck or Keldeo is different towards those he fully trusts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine...I can give that tiny human protection...but I have never shared my home with anybody. I don't know if I can do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have asked you if I weren't sure you'd be capable of it\" Mew said softly. Keldeo nodded, cheering up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll take that human home, but I'm afraid I'll lose it...with the size you said it had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no problem about that! Your insides can be the perfect home for the human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...my insides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! This human goes through your mouth and...\" You groaned when you saw Keldeo's pupils shrinking in horror, exclaiming. 'I'm going to eat somebody?!' It took another five minutes to calm him down and make him know nothing would happen to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but I have never been a host to anybody! I don't even know how to modify my insides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll learn quickly, I'm sure of it\" Mew replied. You raised your eyebrows. So Keldeo didn't even know how to do that? You were starting to have some doubts about everything but it was too late to back down. The best you and Keldeo could do was learn quickly and get used to that ridiculous situation. \"So! Here it goes! I have to leave now\" Mew carefully left you on the ground in front of Keldeo. You looked upwards, your new host was looking at you with uncertainty. \"Remember that secrecy is vital for this mission, Keldeo!\" Mew said as a farewell and vanished away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo and you stood there for a couple minutes, in awkward silence. \"Sooooooo...\" Keldeo nervously muttered, looking from one side to another \"Do you...want to go in...now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he wasn't breaking down or anything like that. Maybe you really would get along with him. \"I think that'd be good\" you said as calmly as possible, hoping it'd make him relax. Keldeo nodded slowly and lowered his head as if he were going to pick you up with his teeth. \"Eeeeh...no, please, stop!\" you quickly shouted, moving away. Keldeo heard you and stopped, awkwardly placing his snout on the ground to look better at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First than all I'm way too small for you to pick me up or anything\" you pointed \"And second: I don't feel comfortable being between anybody's teeth\" again, you were very small so nothing would even happen to you but it still made you nervous. Keldeo apologized profusely until you were able to calm him down. This was all another hint he was very unused to dealing with tiny beings. You once again wondered how living inside him would work. \"Just open your mouth close to the ground, I'll get in by myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" he accepted and did that. You took a deep breath, preparing yourself to enter your new host. You managed to climb the lips and the teeth, it was official: you were entering Keldeo. Peering towards the back of the mouth you went ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked toward the throat and peered down the dark chasm that expands and contracts with each breath the Pokemon took. Warm, moist air rushed up against your face while the gurgling sound of the body emanated from the depth. The feeling is all too familiar now. This will be the third mouth that you'll be jumping down in the last few weeks. But Keldeo's statement about not knowing how to modify his body has you worried. \"I hope Mew knows what she' doing,\" you thought. Keldeo's booming voice dragged you out of any thoughts you might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" Keldeo's voice is filled with concern but it sounds more like yelling with you near his vocal cord, \"Nobody ever taught me anything about body modification before. Besides, I'm not sure how other members of the Swords of Justice will take the news that I am charged with protecting a shrunken human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about that when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm afraid that I might hurt you, or worse, kill you,\" Keldeo said worriedly, \"I don't know what Mew was thinking when she chose me out of all Pokemons. Why couldn't she have chosen my mom Virizion or uncle Cobalion instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She believes that you are the safest choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...For her to be this desperate, you must be in some pretty big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually. Mew believe that I'm some chosen human from the legends and wanted to train me,\" you explained, \"The issue is that my personality still isn't quite up to the job yet. She told me that we both can learn from each other and strengthen ourselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Legend?\" the Pokemon said with surprise, \"Is she out of her mind? That's only a myth. There hasn't been a human with that description for thousand of years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the other Legendaries beg to differ,\" you said, \"That's not all. Try adding a maniacal Temporal Dragon hellbent on vengeance on top of my list of problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temporal Dragon? I assume you mean Dialga. Okay.....,\" Keldeo put a hoof to his horn to stop the migraine, \"This is getting a bit complicated. How did things ended up like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story. I'll tell you more when we sort out how I'm supposed to live in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...still a little ambivalent about this. Alright......if you say so....you may proceed,\" the colt said, \"But I want an explanation as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any second thoughts, you slid down the throat and allow the esophagus to carry you to your intended location. The warmth from Keldeo's esophagus surrounded you as it slowly squeezed you downward in rhythmic pulses. You were coated with a thick layer of mucus by the wall which greatly aided your travel. Another 20 seconds or so, you plopped down into the stomach which is half-filled with Keldeo's previous meal. Although it looks smaller than Raikou's, it's more than enough to accommodate you with rooms to spare. The stomach is also completely unmodified; it's just pink stomach lining with a pool of acid, the sight of which worried you. Maybe it isn't such a good idea to hide in Kedeo. You landed face first into a pile of crushed Oran berries. A small amount of the juice went up your nostrils causing a burning sensation to fill your throat. The pain made you scramble for a drier and safer part in the chamber. You coughed and gagged in an attempt to reduce the discomfort but the humid, stifling air only served to make it more stinging. It took you roughly 10 minutes before you felt good enough to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just perfect...Why am I always ending up in digested foods?\" you grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, human?\" Keldeo said nervously, \"So...Sorry about that. I'm totally new to this body modification thing. Mew made the request rather abruptly so I didn't have time to practice any moves to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides crashing and choking your breakfast, I'm good for the moment,\" you said, \"But you'll need to modify your body before your stomach mistakes me for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...if it offers you any reassurance, I'm not a meat eater. If I even took a nibble of meat, it'll give me indigestion. First thing, I'll try and get those food out of there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Keldeo change his posture and grunted a little. Then a rumbling sound came from the bottom of the stomach. The contents around you started churning and swirling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...whoa...what are you doing?!\" you exclaimed as you tried to balance yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, buddy. I'm not going to harm you. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">You're scaring me....</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise resembles a bathtub draining but on a larger scale and more gross. You looked in amazement as a large whirlpool formed at the center of the stomach, taking all the mush and acid with it into the intestines. It was rather disquieting sight to witness and probably ended your appetite for any berries in the near term. The burbling cacophony eventually subsided as the last of the Pecha berries disappear into the hole at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are a bit more comfortable in there now,\" Keldeo said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That helps a bit. But I don't want to stay in your stomach for too long. And I'm getting a bit nauseous from the swaying. Please get me somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down in the now-empty stomach and wait for Keldeo to make his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Mew to be so confident in my ability, it must be pretty easy. All I have to do is just focus on the body part I want you in and connect a path to the stomach. Come on Keldeo, this is nothing compared to the Swords of Justice entrance exam...,\" the Pokemon talked to himself with an uneasy tone, \"I'll....give it a try then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo focused the energy from his horn and directed it into his stomach. For a Pokemon his size, the concentration required creates a large strain if the groaning and panting is any indication. A patch of flesh near you glowed with a blue light, causing it to deform and open into a sphincter. The entire process took less than a minute to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Keldeo. I think you had it figured out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Without any basic knowledge about body modification, I don't think it's not a good idea to do anything else. I'll need to head home and ask Virizion or Cobalion for further advice. In the meantime, try out that hole I made. Please....be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the newly-formed hole that reveals a path going up. But that's no surefire way of knowing whether or not it'll take you to the right place. Is it worth the risk to try out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, anyplace should be better than the stomach, right?</i> you thought before stepping in.</span></div></div>",

The ascending tunnel wasn't very well done. While you trekked upwards you found it to be bumpy and uncomfortable to walk through, and in some places it wasn't even opened completely. You counted at least four times you had to practically squish yourself through pieces of flesh to continue. Despite all the problems you were having you didn't comment it to your host. The colt was already doing a lot of effort in a field he had no idea what entailed, you were willing to not to be fussy about the quality of the passageways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as he didn't accidentally link a path to his colon or anywhere that could mean your doom you were fine with whatever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I do...?\" you hear Keldeo tentatively asking. Judging by the volume of the voice you were nearing his vocal chords again. You told him there were no problem yet and to not to worry too much about this. There was time to learn to control his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later you finally arrive to the destination Keldeo had set. The tunnel ended on a curved platform made of bone, which had several holes that both ascended and descended. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it'd be better if you were in a place with no risk for you so...I opened a space in my head\" Keldeo explained. You frowned, frankly not liking the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure it's wise to modify anything in your head when you're not experienced\" the last thing you wanted was Keldeo accidentally hurt his brain physically while trying to keep you safe. You weren't sure you could bear the guilt on that. Keldeo was silent for a moment, realizing you were right. After he said he wouldn't try again for now you walked to the tunnels. There were very few that seemed wide enough for you to barely crawl in. \"What are these ducts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, they were a side effect, I think. They lead to other parts of my head, I think a couple even exit my skin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're going to ask Virizion or Cobalion for details about body modification, right? I suppose you won't tell them about me\" You had no idea who Virizion or Cobalion were, but hadn't Keldeo called them 'Mom' and 'Uncle'? Maybe they were related to Keldeo's species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't do that, they wouldn't take it kindly. I'll go home now, one of them should be there\" the bone chamber started moving slightly, sign Keldeo started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my family and they're also members of the Swords of Justice. Virizion adopted me a long time ago and Cobalion is just a friend of hers. There's also another member of the Swords of Justice but I haven't seen him for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You may as well get to know Keldeo a bit better \"What did they teach you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they have helped me to train. My Swords of Justice entrance exam is in a week\"<i> I have only a week. Huh</i>. \"Cobalion taught me to empty my stomach like you saw a while ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was gross, unexpected and impressive, all that\" Raikou had said he wasn't capable of doing that and you wished he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cobalion says fighting or training with a full stomach is not a good idea. It makes me feel queasy so I don't do it often\" Judging by Keldeo's tone he admired Cobalion a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else have they taught you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virizion taught me this!\" Keldeo proclaimed but nothing happened for a moment. It took a minute but soon the air at the other side of the chamber started glowing. Small dots of light gathered until they formed a shape on four legs, gathering and compacting. With a flash the particles melted together, showing Keldeo. You raised your eyebrows, pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had seen Keldeo's picture quite some time ago you had calculated the colt only would be tall enough to reach your waist, but the representation in front of you was as tall as you. \"That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keldeo in front of you bowed his head, grateful of the compliment, and continued talking \"It's good for training too, it's tangible and all. It's about channeling some sort of energy we Fighting types have and using it to create this. Normally I'd be exhausted to create a real size projection, but this is tiny...I can continue walking like nothing happened\" Keldeo sat on the other side, keeping his distance from you. Looks like he wasn't ready to really approach you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look young\" you commented. Keldeo grimaced and for a moment you feared you had said something impolite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my species is...going to look like this for most of their lives. I'm not terribly young, I could even have offspring if I wanted and had a mate, but I'm going to have to be called 'a colt' for a very long time. Maybe someday I'll stop looking so...youthful\" You made a mental note to avoid insinuating he's way too young. <i>Calling him a stallion may not be completely fitting but it could make him happy. At some point I should do it. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any questions for me?\" Keldeo had talked about himself. You may as well offer to do the same. The colt tilted his had, considering for a moment the options and finally picked the one closely related to their situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been inside other Pok\u00e9mon before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Raikou. He was my host when I first ran away from Dialga. He was a great host, although a bit tiring at times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo stood up and approached a bit before sitting again. You could stretch your arm and touch him, if you wanted \"Then...I have a few questions...\" you signaled him to go ahead and the colt started to fire a rapid series of questions. \"How will you eat? Will I have to start eating meat? Will you have to go to my stomach every time you needed to eat? Where did you sleep? Could you die inside me? Are there places you shouldn't go to? When you're leaving my body how will you do that? I won't have to push you out with my waste, right? What did you do to keep yourself busy the whole day-?\" you raised your hand, stopping him. Keldeo's tone had grown more frantic with each question. You weren't sure how to deal with a panicking host, so you made him take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hear very well most of the questions. Please, go slowly. I'll do my best to answer everything you want to know, okay? Think everything again and start over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo nodded, calming down. You knew the colt was scared. He was burdened with a responsibility he surely never thought would have and you were willing to guide him as much as possible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The colt remained silent for the last ten minutes or so. In fact, it was so silent within the skull that you could pick up the sound of light heartbeats and blood rushing through the vessels. From the opposite side, you watched with both amusement and concern as Keldeo's representation seems to be attempting to make his mouth form words but his muzzle was locked tight as soon as they parted. Although the Pokemon tried to make himself look calm, his trembling forelegs and sweat-covered face tells another story. Admittedly, he looks adorable in this state when he is trying to figure out what questions to ask. Keldeo's blue eyes are glazed as they looked blankly at you. You could still hear him taking deep breathes and muttering indiscernible sentences under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the colt seemed prepared as he closed his eyes and took one last deep breath. When he looked at you again, you could tell from his posture that he is more mentally focused, but there is still a hint of uncertainty written on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al...alright. I think I've made up my mind....on the key questions I want to ask you,\" Keldeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and motioned for the colt to ask the first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, what kind of stuffs do you usually eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer that, I'm not much of a picky person over food. In my opinion, there is not much difference between meat and vegetables. I don't prefer one over the other. So there is no need for you to take the extra effort to eat something that you normally don't like. I'm perfectly fine with a vegetarian diet. Although..... you might have to slow down on the berries for a while,\" you said with image of digested berries still fresh on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookay,\" Keldeo replied, \"Next question: Where are you supposed to eat then? I can't have you going down into my stomach and getting yourself messy from the ordeal every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...that's a little more tricky. From what I know, Raikou always had a separate stomach to store all the foods that I need and another chamber for me to enjoy the food. He could transport the food throughout his body with his advanced network of tubes and openings. I guess that means that you'll need to learn to create a new organ. But I'm not going to demand that you learn it right away. We'll figure out how we can directly get the food from your esophagus once you're better trained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I don't want to do anything that could harm my body, we'll defer that one for now. Still, I don't like the idea of you being forced to slosh around my stomach content for food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my choices are currently limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be for long once I get the basics from Vizirion. Eating aside, where are you supposed to sleep then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to you to decide. You can put me anywhere you want besides the stomach. As long as it's soft and reasonably quiet, I could make it my bedroom. This room, for example, is my current top choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That addressed the issue of accommodation,\" Keldeo said, \"Will you ever need get outside of me once in a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a bit of fresh air every few days or so. It's a good idea but it'll be dependent on whether I'm in a safe environment or not. And I assume that I'll use your mouth as the primary entry and exit point, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo blushed and looked at you awkwardly. \"Well, obviously yes. I wouldn't think of putting you through my colon. Where else would you expect to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha...sorry, my mistake. I wasn't thinking clearly. That sure was a bad question to ask,\" you said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all get \"those kind\" of questions so it's no big deal,\" Keldeo shrugged, \"Anyways, on to the next question: Protecting you from external danger means that you'll be spending a good amount of time within my body, do you have any plans about what you'll do  while you stay with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this plan here, Keldeo. Once you are more comfortable with modifying your body, I'll volunteer to be the first to explore the chambers and organs you created for evaluation. With some experience I garnered from Dialga and Raikou, I can advise you if there are any rooms(no puns intended) for further improvement. Particularly, if you ever mastered creating the \"Body Control Room\", please let me be the first to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..... not... too.... sure... about that whole 'controlling my body' thing. It sounds seriously like an creepy attempt to take over my mind,\" Keldeo said uncomfortably, \"How exactly is this \"Control Room\" supposed to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. You have the benefit of a second mind at the helm to give you additional brain power. I'm a Pokemon trainer and I may be able to offer you tips and strategies to help you use power in the most efficient way. Think of it as an energy upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound great but I still have to think about that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, you sensed that the Q&amp;A is getting to a close, so you decided to put the final note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think that brings our little session to an end,\" you said, feeling fortunate to make it through Keldeo's wall of questions.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I think I may have one more for you: Under the worst case scenario, how will we explain to Vizirion and Cobalion should they find out that you are living inside me? What fail-safe should we prepare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the event that my presence has to be revealed, I will personally explain to them my situation from start to finish. If they're skeptical, I can ask Mew, Raikou, or Suicune to corroborate if possible.\"<i> It would a risky operation though. Any psychic communications could be picked up by Dialga to find me. Let's hope Keldeo won't be dragged into this.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are very reasonable and level-headed Pokemons but you need to be very convincing for them to believe you. For now, we'll keep your presence a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my home is around the corner. And Vizirion and Cobalion should be back from their practice by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo's representation stood up and you did likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you my parents then. Come on, follow me down this hole. <i>I think this is the one that links to my retina. It'll give him a good look of my family. Hope nothing too embarrassing will come out of this.</i>\"<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo reached a clearing where a grove of trees where two tall Pokemons stood. The colt trotted across the tall grasses toward the grove where Vizirion and Cobalion are conversing. When Keldeo got within a few meters of the trees, the green quadruped Pokemon face the colt and smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dear Keldy. How was your day? Did you have fun training yourself today?\" Vizirion's cheerful voice beamed. <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a female voice while you followed Keldeo down a hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's my mom for you,\" the colt blushed.</span></div></div>",

Just like the journey to what was now your sleeping place it wasn't a very well done passageway. \"I should have been more careful...\" Keldeo grunted, pushing apart flesh with his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad for a first try or an accidental side effect\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were walking through you listened to what was going on outside. At least Keldeo had enough ability to not to say aloud anything he said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun, I think it was good\" Keldeo replied \"I'm going to rest for the rest of the day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest before noon? Are you feeling well?\" Cobalion asked, although judging from his expression it was more a joking question than real concern \"You usually continue training until midnight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's good. Keldeo has trained very hard during these months and should rest more\" Virizion said to him before turning her attention to the colt. \"Cobalion and I are going to have to leave later, I hope it's not a problem to be alone\" Keldeo stepped back, looking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem, you know it...\" Virizion laughed warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. It never gets old to see you react to my words\" Apparently Virizion liked to tease her adoptive son as if he were still a kid. Keldeo raised his head, pretending nothing had happened, and approached Virizion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to ask you something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo and you were observing what was going on from one of his eyes, even if the view wasn't really clear. While Keldeo had managed to make a small compartment for you two to stand on and see outside the eye was filled with liquids that turned everything blurry and unfocused. At least you still managed to distinguish shapes and could hear what was outside. \"Virizion is the green one, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Cobalion must have been the blue form over there\" Keldeo had the benefit of seeing clearly but he tried to imagine how you were seeing everything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Cobalion is just a friend of your mom?\" You had the hunch they could be closer than that, but judging by Keldeo's blank stare he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could he be? I like to think of him as a parent but he's more like an uncle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Confirmed, the idea they could be together didn't even cross his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Virizion and Keldeo were far enough from Cobalion Keldeo gathered courage to ask. Unfortunately he hadn't really prepared what he was going to say so he had to improvise and hope for the best. \"What is it, Keldy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking to, um, Raikou...\" Keldeo felt you facepalming at that \"...and he brought up something about...about modifying one's internal organs. Is that something that really can be done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirizion tilted her head curiously \"It's possible. Why are you asking me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does one do that? I mean...\" Virizion hadn't changed her expression yet Keldeo was growing more nervous with every second \"...I think I could find a way for it to be useful to me, to my training and everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? It's not something that's done easily. You'd need a lot of practice to be able to do it well enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, just what I didn't want to hear</i>Keldeo thought. \"Then the most basic concept could be good enough. Like how does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple in theory. You simply need to focus on what you want to do, picture it in your mind. The hard part is actually making it happen, using your energy to move your tissues and cells. You need to know a lot about your insides for it to work properly, otherwise you could screw up and do something you didn't intend to do\" Keldeo supposed that's why the ducts and holes appeared in the small room he had created for the human. He surely was lucky nothing bad had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to make it easier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard it's really matter of practice. Once one has mastered this one could do anything in their insides and not even blink. Are you interested on trying something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\" Keldeo thought quickly \"After hearing all this I won't for the moment. I have to focus on my training for now and on , um, work in the Swords of Justice once I get in. Have you done it, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I do know how to do it without any problems but I don't have any reason to really do it\" Virizion looked back to where Cobalion was waiting for her \"If you ever are going to try remember to stay away from your head or your chest. It's better to avoid any trouble and it's less likely you'll be harmed if you adhere our kidneys to your spine than if your heart grows another chamber. If you're going to try please tell me so I can supervise you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, I will\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with Cobalion if you need me. Rest well, Keldy\" Virizion said affectionately said before returning to Cobalion. Keldeo watched her go before settling down onto the floor with enough privacy, thinking what Virizion had said. It wasn't really of help but maybe he could work with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virizion sounds like a kind Pok\u00e9mon\" you commented, going back into the tunnel. Keldeo and you were going to return to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's amazing. I knew you'd like her\" he said, entering the empty space \"Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really\" Most of what Virizion had said went over your head. You had no idea how to help Keldeo with this. However it seemed the colt had other plands, judging by how he paced around thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try. It can't be that hard and if I'm careful nothing will happen. I'll need your help, human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I want to change my insides then I must first know my insides, don't I? Where everything is located, the general shape and how everything is connected, all that. I should have thought it before. I know what my organs are and their functions but it would be good to confirm everything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded logical to you. \"And how are you going to do that? Do you have anything like a map of your insides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo stopped pacing around. \"I don't and I don't know where to obtain something like that but it shouldn't be a problem. I'm already inside myself, I can go ahead and see. It can work\" And with that Keldeo trotted to the tunnel you had used to arrive there. \"I'll need you to remember all of this and to guide me if you can. I'll create paths while we're near. I'll follow Virizion's advice and stay away from the head and the heart, everything else should be fair game\" the colt started descending \"I didn't do a good tunnel here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter\" you said, following him. You weren't completely sure of what Keldeo was going to do and how effective it was going to be, but you knew you couldn't leave him alone for that. After all he was doing this for you, it was your responsibility to see nothing happened to your host \"So how are you going to see your organs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\" Keldeo stopped for a moment \"How would this work better? We could take our time and be inside the organs. I'd see exactly how they work and all but it'd take us the whole day to be done. Or we could look from outside. That way we'd done quicker but I think it could be less informative. You tell me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered the good and the bad points from both options. Combining them was the most obvious choice but the truth is that you'd need to predominantly go for one of the options. \"Let's take a look...\"</span></div></div>",

I prefer to explore your organs from the inside,\" you said, \"I want to know you a little better, Keldeo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sooooo... that means we're taking the more challenging way then,\" Keldeo smiled, \"You know, I'm as curious as you are about my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any place on you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Brain and Heart are off limit, obviously. So you'll have to wait a while before attempting a take over with body control,\" Keldeo grinned, \"We'll try with an easy and safe organ first. I was thinking about giving the Water Pouch a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Water Pouch?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a part of me that stores water that I could eject from holes under my hooves to let me walk across water,\" the Pokemon said as he lifted one of his forelegs to show your the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and studied the underhoof. \"Looks interesting. How does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch.\" Keldeo demonstrated the ability by using several small jets of water, allowing him to hover. You looked at the colt as he maneuvered by shifting his hooves, circling around you with a triumphant look. While seeing Keldeo perform various moves, you have to wonder how his small body managed to store water several hundred times the volume of his body. Your mind thought about several explanations: he could have drawn in moisture from his surrounding. Or alternatively, his body has some type of mechanism for producing water. While you were thinking, you failed to notice Keldeo hovering toward you. The Pokemon performed a few flips and rolls and playfully sprayed some water on your face to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's that for?\" you said, recoiling from the cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought you could use some water to freshen up a little. Hahaha...,\" he replied as he landed beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you claimed that you consider yourself to be a young adult but sometimes you sure act more like a colt,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on...I love a good prank or two occasionally. Much of my target being random Pokemons around my home. But my favorite target is Cobalion. Virizion told me that we all need a good laugh once in a while much to his dismay. I'll admit, I can be a bit of a show off sometimes.\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo went for Virizion who was at the edge of the clearing talking with Cobalion. The colt walked through the tall grasses and flowers in the meadow to his adoptive parents. Keldeo thought up an explanation for his sudden interest in body modification. The green Pokemon took notice of her adopted son. She beamed at him and trotted toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldy, dear. There you are! Is there anything you need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Yeah, mom. Actually, I was wondering if you have time to supervise me while I perform my first body modification,\" Keldeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, Keldy,\" Virizion smiled, \"Cobalion and I were just discussing that it may be time for you to learn about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Keldeo's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo,\" Cobalion replied with a calm tone, \"We think it's time for you to learn about some of the more advanced moves a Legendary has to master. In light of your upcoming Swords of Justice exams, it's perfectly appropriate for the occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, aren't you excited, Keldy? You will soon be part of our group. There's so much to being a member fo the Swords of Justice. There's new responsibilities and places to visit. You'll even get the chance to attend the Council. Where you can catch a glimpse of Arceus. Oh, I just can't wait for the day of your exam.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" the colt blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, dear. Come along now, we have some practices to do before you perform your first modification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!!! Now that's what I'm talking about,\" Keldeo feigned excitement. <i>Just as planned.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there,\" Cobalion suddenly said, \"I was wondering, though, why do you have such sudden interest in body modification, Keldeo You're usually more preoccupied with learning the Sacred Sword and physical training at the hills. This is so unlike you. Is there something you want to tell us in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I......ummm...,\" Keldeo droned as he thought up a believable reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We usually change our bodies to allow our virtual representation to make useful visits to any organs if we're aren't feeling well. Is there anything wrong, Keldeo?\"<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within Keldeo, his representation is sweating profusely as he stood dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....what have I done,\" the representation groaned, \"Now, they'll realized that I'm up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to calm down, Keldeo. By the way you're acting, you won't keep me secret for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....okay....okay.......deep breath, Keldeo.....,\" the Pokemon tried to comfort himself, \"Okay...let's try again. A believable reason...do not reveal any references to a shrunken human.....convince my mom and uncle.....\"<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really........I just......just wanted to learn more about my own body and power...that's all,\" the Pokemon blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked nervously Virizion and Cobalion's reaction. Both of them looked at the colt with a surprised expression and eyed each other with mutual realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo....are you......,\" Virizion struggled to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious about certain body functions, are you?\" Cobalion completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......Ummm....yeah sorta like that.....,\" Keldeo said absent-mindedly before he realized what his adoptive parents meant. <i>Oh no, what have I done! They have a major misunderstanding....I'm just digging myself deeper now. I don't know what to do about this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here, Keldeo, the stag asked. The younger Pokemon complied and walked toward his uncle while his anxiety level crept up. Once Keldeo got beside Cobalion, the larger Pokemon looked at the colt deep in the eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo. it is perfectly normal for a Pokemon at your phase to be a bit more inquisitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo felt that the conversation has taken a very wrong turn and that he needs to quickly shift it back on track before things get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Uncle Cobalion! It's not what you're thinking. I meant understanding the functions of my body parts. But it's not the kind you're thinking about! I want to learn how to strengthen myself. Nothing more than that,\" Keldeo desperately tried to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy about it. We all get to be exploratory when we were young. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Let me explain some things to you,\" Cobalion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle, can you just let me explain myself please? Mom, please help me. You have to believe me. This is a big misunderstanding,\" the colt pleaded with Virizion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldy. You don't have to hide that. I know fully that you're a grown Pokemon and this is bound to happen soon. Even if you're not planning to use body modification for those purposes, it wouldn't hurt to listen to uncle Cobalion, would it? You could learn a lot from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too!\" Keldeo whined.<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the body, you watched Keldeo panicking and twitching on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just wonderful! I made uncle Cobalion give me 'the talks' out of all things,\" Keldeo's representation said as he whack his head against the floor, \"Arceus save us, we're gonna have to sit this one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be interesting enough though. I want to hear about it,\" you grinned before getting sprayed with a faceful of water jet.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keldeo practically dragged himself on the ground, about to have a panic attack. You dried your face, amused. It was not very kind of you to be enjoying the show. How was it called, again? Schadenfreude? Wasn't that a german word about having happiness from other people's suffering? This was a very watered down version of that, but you couldn't deny you didn't want this to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel finally ended and Keldeo and you entered to a very long and thin organ, stretching into the distance. There was a deep grove on the center, filled with water, and near you there seemed to be a deep hole. The water fell in waterfalls but the level of the water didn't deplete. It was possible somehow there was a duct in the legs that led unused water back to the pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Keldeo couldn't care less about the inner workings of his water systems. He was too busy brooding about the perspective of having the talk again to care about any of that. \"Come on, help me here! What can I tell them to stop this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is almost embarrassing, Keldeo\" you said with a smile \"It won't be that bad, and look at the bright side: you have a believable explanation for your questions. It's all perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll listen to all that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inside you, it was to be expected\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-what are you, some kind of voyeur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My interest is purely academical! Come on, it won't be for long. Open your eyes naively and pretend to not to know a thing. This is for the good of both of us...I think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo had to fight his own self to not to grimace. \"M-mom, really, I don't think I need this. I have known the workings of all that for a long time already! It's instinctual!\" Virizion shook her head, somewhat annoyed at his protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have learned it by yourself decades ago but your own words are showing your inexperience. Cobalion is male like you, he's the most appropriate to talk to you about this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrakion already talked to me about that before he left\" Keldeo argued. Cobalion shook his head, clearly not believing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrakion was never the kind to care much about that. Let's sit\" Resigned to listen, Keldeo obeyed. The stag and the colt awkwardly held silence for a moment until the older Pok\u00e9mon broke it. \"So, when every Pok\u00e9mon reachs a certain age changes start to happen in their bodies. You're not the exception, and the reason of these changes are so you can have your offspring in the future\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already can, you know\" Keldeo mumbled. Cobalion didn't react annoyed, after all it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need a reminder how the process goes? You don't want to screw up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodie\" you muttered, smiling awkwardly while Keldeo tried to bury his face in the flesh of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this day happening to me? That's what I want to know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something I have wondered several times during the last few weeks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo had shaken his head with vehemency, but Cobalion hadn't paid attention to that. Instead he launched himself into a long speech about the miracle of life, the procedures of how to properly engage with a mate and overall specifications and precautions in the whole matter. Luckily for Keldeo, Cobalion was of a completely different species and therefore couldn't go into excessive detail about several things, but that just meant an extension of the talk would be required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this wasn't so bad, Keldeo. I had a similar talk when I was a kid, mainly because in humans it isn't instinctual apparently\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I wanted to hear it a second time. I DID talk to Terrakion about this a long time ago,I just didn't want Mom or Uncle Cobalion to know I asked that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you known Cobalion and...that Terrakion guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo stopped trying to smother himself with his own mane and peered through it to you. \"They have been there since my earliest memories. It's true I haven't talked to Terrakion in a while, but I remember they have always been part of the Swords of Justice. They're like my family\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Hey, listen, I think Cobalion is getting into a related topic to what interests you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason you want to learn to modify your body is so you can see by yourself the results of all the developments, right?\" Cobalion asked lightly, as if it were something he asked to everybody every week \"At this point of your life it's already finished, in fact I think you're around thirty years late. But really, it's just for that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what else could I have in mind?\" Keldeo asked imprudently and regretted it almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you may have wanted to try to improve the changes to your liking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have said it isn't that!\" Keldeo shouted. Cobalion sighed for a moment before turning to Virizion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust him about that, Virizion. Do you?\" Keldeo noticed relieved that Virizion nodded. \"I believed that from the beginning but as I said: he could learn a lot from you about these matters\" she said. At least they didn't think he was going to learn that to do it. If only they had agreed that before the whole spiel then maybe all this embarrassment would have never happened! Having confirmed that with Virizion Cobalion returned to the topic. \"So if isn't that then I suppose you're really asking just for curiosity to see by yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...agh, just finish this\" Keldeo muttered as softly as possible, enough for none of them to hear it. Cobalion smiled coyly and continued \"Ironically unless you learn body modification you won't see anything worthwhile. After all most of what happened was inside you. I know you can authentic create copies of yourself and it's possible you can create one so minuscule it could get to the innermost crannies of your body, but even then I doubt you'll like what you see. I haven't seen it by myself, never thought of doing that and I doubt I ever will, but it can't be pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nModifying your body you could make it a bit more interesting, but I think Virizion would like to see you having descendants so maybe you should be careful about messing anything there, okay?\" Cobalion was far from solemn. Maybe he was enjoying the whole thing despite Keldeo's reactions. \"Why don't you focus on harmless modifications and leave everything else intact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Um, thank you for, um, the talk, Cobalion, um, I think I have to, um, go over there and, um...um\" Keldeo hurriedly stood up and ran away. Cobalion laughed to himself and walked to Virizion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldy is so strange at times, Virizion. Way to raise him so well adjusted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your influence, you prick\" Virizion pushed Cobalion away playfully \"Aaaand...it's his personality too. Keldy already knows everything there is to know and doesn't need me coddling him anymore, but it's just too nice to see him bashful. At some point he...he won't be like this anymore. I'll miss these times\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will too and I'm sure Keldeo will too. He's in a hurry to try to act dignified, and I get it, at his age he wants to make clear he's independent and can deal with his life. Until then...let's enjoy this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad it's over\" Keldeo said, guiding you through his water pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Cobalion must be right, though. You know, yesterday I visited Raikou's testicles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked at you with bemusement. \"Do I want to know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story and for your information it was not for whatever reason you're thinking. The point is that in there it wasn't like anything you imagine it'd be. Modifying your body is...something that can lead to unbelievable results\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have never tried to know about it if it weren't for you, so don't expect me to turn my body into some sort of amusement park for you. Now let's focus on what's here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does all this water come from?\" you ask. That was pretty much the only question you had. In answer to that an opening appeared on the wall and Keldeo and you looked through it. Outside, between Keldeo's organs and extending further than you could see, lots of thin capillaries emerged from the pouch and sneaked into every corner of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These ducts pick up the water, including from the outside. It's not hard to understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Hey, look over there\" you pointed to an area between the stomach and what you were sure were the lungs \"There's a lot of space over there. In the future you may need to create something there...when you finally get Virizion to supervise you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask her when I stop feeling so embarrassed about the talk. What else do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" you looked around and pointed to just a couple organs more. Keldeo took the time to see carefully how everything was placed, memorizing it \"Those are the intestines, that's unmistakable. And that over there is...I'm not sure, I think it's the liver?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know what that is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way I know how all that works and I'm sure you do too, so I don't think we need to see by ourselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, down here again\" Keldeo and you stood on the floor of the water pouch while the opening closed. \"Let's get to the end of this. This runs to my hind legs too, so we could cross entire body here in no time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other option do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get out of here now and see where to go now. You tell me\"</span></div></div>",

The view from that wall opening was the first look you had of his complex body. By your own estimate, the number of locations to explore could rivaled those of Raikou. You saw various organs beside the familiar ones. But Keldeo has no answer about their functions. With a novice like him, there is a real risk that he will sent you somewhere you wouldn't want to end up at. The large intestine comes to mind. Who knows what else this colt has in store for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It doesn't feel like a good idea to be traveling down Keldeo's Water Pouch. You even started having second thoughts about being in his body.<i> Why can't Mew just choose someone more experienced yet little known? I'm seriously thinking about 'moving in' with Virizion.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we should temporarily put our trip on hold, at least until we get some instructions from Virizion?\" you cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It is safe for you to travel through the Water Pouch,\" he said, \"And I don't think I'm ready to go back to her yet. My cheeks are still burning from the sheer embarrassment that Cobalion has caused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earlier scenes played out in your head again, causing you to mentally smile at the Pokemon who's seems to be recovering. <i>It's understandable. No one like having to hear that, especially if you're well past the age that normally make those type of discoveries.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about what kind of plan you've got. Care to explain,\" you asked, \"It could save us a lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we'll travel down the Water Pouch. Then, we'll just wait near the rear end  until I calmed down enough to return to my mom. After that, we're free to do all the exploring we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, how long would it take for you to get yourself back in order then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably need at least an hour. Not much,\" Keldeo said straightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That works for me,\" you shrugged, \"But promise me, in the mean time, that you won't do anything dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arghh....\" Keldeo rolled his eyes and pouted, \"You're starting to sound like my mom when she's worried. I hate it when she goes into protective mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And rightly so. Virizion really cares about you, Keldeo. Better to be safe than sorry. Come on, let do something less risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh......alright,\" the colt groaned, Follow me, my rear is this way.\"<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Keldeo walked north to a more secluded part of the clearing. Virizion and Cobalion are out ofsight; no one would disturb him in this peaceful corner of home. Away from all the nuisance, he made himself comfortable on a soft patch of tall grass and thought about his life so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*sigh*  Peace and quiet at last. As much as I like them, mom and uncle can be really annoying. Can't they just take me seriously for once?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked at the sky and counted the clouds zooming across the area above him. He looked at their shape and imagined what they might be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colt noticed his pale yellow horn in the upper part of his vision. By measurement, it is only about a third of the length of his hoof.  Keldeo frowned at the sight. Compared with those of the Swords of Justice, his appendage is rather on the short side. This has been a source of awkward jokes from Terrakion and Cobalion, much to his mom's chagrin. <i>You'll learn about its true length once you're older,</i> Keldeo heard them said long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, it's been several more years since then and there's no lengthening at all. Would this affect how I could use Sacred Sword or the possibility of finding a suitable mate, if any still exists?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo rolled onto his back and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My exam is in a week and I haven't practice frequently enough. This is getting stressful....I seriously need an outlet for this frustration. </i><br>\r\n ____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Water Pouch is vast and complex. You saw countless passages branching off from the main chamber, carrying water from other parts of the body. Those water gathered into the main canal and flowed toward the end of the Pouch. Along the way, you glanced at Keldeo every chance you got. He had this uncertain expression on his face as he shifted his eyes cautiously the path ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you and Keldeo some times to reach the end where the groove split and drained down two holes that leads to the hind hooves. The water crested down with a thundering roar that drowned out Keldeo's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are! We've reached the end,\" Keldeo announced on the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a breathtaking sight to take in. A thick mist blew across your face as you looked down the chasms. Kelsey found a drier spot that's slightly elevated and beckoned you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just wait here until I get myself together,\" Keldeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...any ideas what to do in our downtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could show you the story behind the Swords of Justice if you're interested. Wanna do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hear a little Legendary history directly from a Pokemon. So, yeah. Why not?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keldeo took a deep breath, as if it were going to be a long story, and went ahead. \"The Swords of Justice is...not really an organization. It's a small group whose objective is to keep peace between humans and Pokemon specially in times of war, but they tend to lean more towards Pokemon protection than protecting humans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No surprise there. I have the feeling most Legendary Pokemon look down on humans in some way or another\". Dialga taking you only as an interesting study subject was a hint of that. At least Mew, Raikou and Suicune treated you more or less like an equal, although it was hard to consider yourself an equal when you're tiny. Keldeo seemed to be in a middle ground. He had a lot of reticence and originally didn't want to serve as your host, but now that you two had spent some time together he at least seemed to accept you. There was almost no trace of his nervousness by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cobalion, Virizion and Terrakion are the actual and...only members right now. Since the group was created our numbers are pretty limited because very few species have the ability to learn Sacred Sword, a essential move to be part of the Swords of Justice. It's said it's a move created by Arceus to harness enough strength to overcome any obstacle and achieve greatness for the benefit of others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked away. \"I know the basics but I haven't really done it yet. I have been working with them to learn it but I need to be strong and determined to do it! Not just anybody can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swords of Justice are fighters and are rarely defeated. Mom told me once that the first Legendaries that knew Sacred Sword demonstrated its power in one of the many wars this land has gone through, saving hundreds of Pokemon from collateral damage done by humans. Hostile Pokemon, fueled by fear and loyalty to their masters, attacked anybody who wasn't on their side, including wild Pokemon. The first Swords of Justice fought against all of them, taking the wild Pokemon to safe places and avoiding a bigger tragedy altogether. It wasn't confirmed but it's said their actions are one of the reasons the war they took part in ended in the first place, as both human sides felt afraid of attracting their wrath if they continued\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an impressive first appearance of the Swords of Justice, you had to admit it. \"When was all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several thousand years ago, even before Mom was even born. Mom and Cobalion are part of the fourth group. Once a group has trained and taught new members the secrets of their work they can retire into obscurity, away from everybody, but it's hard to find worthwhile candidates. Even if they spend years training...it's very hard to meet their expectations\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens if you don't reach their expectations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked introspective for the moment. \"Not much, but once one is rejected the chances is that...one won't ever reach them...I'm lucky on this regard because I have been with Mom and Uncle for so long and even if I'm rejected I'm sure they wouldn't abandon me, but...I have wanted to be part of the organization for such a long time I don't know what I'd do if I didn't achieve it...I don't think I'd be able to forgive myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just what I needed, some pressure</i>. Keldeo, not knowing what you were thinking, continued \"The actual group is more accepting of humans than former groups, but even then they are...hostile against them. If you approached them I don't think it could end well for you, even with Mew arguing in your favor. I think that she approached me despite my inexperience not only because Dialga isn't going to suspect you're with me but also because...because I'd accept you after a while. Mom Virizion or Uncle Cobalion would outright reject you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It can't be that bad, right? If the situation is explained to them I'm sure they'd support me...they fight for justice and I haven't done anything wrong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some of the things I know of the Swords of Justice. Our stories are many and heroic and it's likely there are many I haven't been told yet\" And so he started to tell several stories about the kind of battles and fights the Swords of Justice had taken part in. They were riveting tales and you listened with attention, it was no wonder Keldeo wanted to be part of them: it sounded like a hard job but worth doing. \"Nowadays Arceus contacts us directly in very problematic situations, but if I'm part of the organization I could receive orders directly from Arceus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not talk to...him? Her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what they are. Cobalion, as the leader, would be the one to talk. Very few Legendaries are in direct friendly contact with them\" Keldeo groggily stood up, the hour had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go talk with Virizion now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I am. I would rather to avoid talking to Mom for a good while but I'll have to swallow my pride and go. This situation will need all my attention...for your sake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With an attitude like that I'm sure you'll be part of the group next week!\" You didn't know if you were saying the right thing, but you did think it was at least a good step onto the right path. Feeling encouraged Keldeo nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving relaxed and not feeling as embarrassed as before Keldeo carefully stood up and walked to a point where he could peek where Virizion was. Fortunately there were no signs of Cobalion, which was good. Despite his will to go ahead and ask he didn't think he felt like talking to him for now. \"...Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Keldy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to ask you to talk about body modification, please...I still think it'd help in my training and would be good as a test of my power\" Keldeo lied. He didn't think it was convincing but it was better than saying the truth. Virizion didn't believe it fully, but despite feeling Keldeo was hiding something she felt there may not be any harm on telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I don't know what you can hope to achieve but I'll answer you some questions. Ask, Keldy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nVirizion sat down and readied herself for the questions Keldeo will ask. The colt acted a bit fluttery whenever she looked at him. Having raised him since he was a foal, it usually a bad sign when Keldeo started avoiding eye contact with her. She has this constant feeling that something is definitely going on. Though it might not be anything important, it's still troubling that her son would conceal information from her. More so, he wants to know how to do body modification which isn't part of his upcoming exam. His explanation that it's for training purposes just doesn't add up. <i>What is my Keldy up to? she wondered.</i><br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo noticed his mom looking at him attentively. He could tell that she wasn't entirely satisfied with his explanation. Virizion has a keen sense and could tell when someone isn't being honest. Based on childhood experience, it's only a matter of time before she figured out what happened with stunning accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirizion never broke eye contact with Keldeo since inviting him to ask her questions. It always makes him uncomfortable when his mom did this. He could see himself in those rose-colored irises. His tiny images looked back at him innocently as if pleading for him to tell Virizion the truth in order for them to be released from their crystalline prisons. He looked away, no longer able to bear the prying look of his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry, mom...but I don't think you're ready to hear about the human yet.</i><br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Virizion to scrutinize him any further, Keldeo launched off his first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, what do I need for body modification to work?\" the colt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirizion blinked her eyes and refocused on her son's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good question, Keldeo. First of all, you need to have a strong concentration. Your mind has to be strong and impervious because any distractions could result in serious harm to your body if you're modifying vital parts,\" she said calmly, \"Secondly, you will need a detailed picture of what your body looks like. That includes the location of vital organs, your bone structures, nerves, and so on. Do you have a good understanding of your organs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...I only know a few of the basic ones, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be enough for a starter like you. Don't try to push yourself too hard. We will start with the easier moves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo deflated slightly at the remark but put on his best poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what kind of force is behind body modification?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The easiest way to put it is that each organ in our bodies produces a unique energy form that allows them to function properly. Those energies have vastly different properties; as different as oil is to water. A skilled Pokemon will be able to shift those energies based on their needs without disrupting the natural flow of their organs. In other words, body modification is done by shaping those energies and using them to create or reshape an organ.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard about that before,\" Keldeo marveled, \"It must be difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much harder than you creating copies of yourself. Once you get a hold of it, it'll be second nature. You can do it!\" Virizion smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How long has body modification existed? I want to know a little of its history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The knowledge of it has been around since the 1st generation of the Swords of Justice,\" the Pokemon explained, \"Although the names of the members were lost to time, their lore still remains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo sat down and listened to his mom's story,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit fuzzy on the details though. Several thousands years ago, the 1st group leader was practicing his moves for an upcoming battle. When he tried to use the Sacred Sword, he was momentarily startled by the loud crack of a thunder. It was intense enough that he misdirected his power and accidentally swapped his lungs and created a second stomach. Fortunately, his health was not adversely affected but it caused a great deal of panic. The leader became curious about the phenomenon with his body and started to study it. And his research later set the foundation for body modification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it used for back then?\" The colt asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was said that the leader initially have no use for it since it won't aid him in war. But his second-in-command proposed that power be put to good use. His subordinate suggested that the extra stomach be used to store weaponry and food supplies, a practical and efficient alternative to bringing in auxiliary forces. Initially skeptical, the leader decided to give it a try anyways.....We'll fast forward and skip the gory and detailed parts....Long story short, the strategy worked perfectly and the Swords of Justice soon because the most feared and effective of all Pokemons. Body modification has since been mastered by several other Legendaries and used many others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to know about that, mom. The previous Swords of Justice did a lot for us. I'm so honored that I'll get the chance to join such a group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without their effort, our world would be far less diverse and some legendary Pokemons won't even be here today. Countless lives would've been lost...\" Virizion said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were the modifications used for any other purposes, then?\" Keldeo asked with feigned ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know....but I heard instances of  Pokemons, even humans, taking refuge in the stomach and other organs of a host Pokemon. And that's all I'm aware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weird concept,\" Keldeo commented awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that's enough explanation for now. Want to give your first modification a shot, Keldy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be quicker to show than tell. I need you to remain quiet while I used my mind to probe your energies. It's not harder than creating copies of yourself. I'm sure that my Keldy could do it,\" Virizion said, \"Sit still now and follow my directions.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Virizion talked to Keldeo about the most basic details about what Keldeo wanted to learn, you listened carefully. The backstory of this ability made some sense, although that meant it was relatively recent, but what got your attention was Virizion mentioning some Pokemon had taken humans as guests inside their bodies. That was unbelievable to you. You had thought you were an exceptional case, but apparently there had been other instances, enough for Virizion to know about them. Pokemon residing inside Pokemon was expected, humans inside Pokemon was stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since Legendary Pokemon were the ones who mastered this ability did that mean that for one reason or another other humans had been inside other Pokemon? You wondered in what circumstances that could have happened, and also if more common and known species could do this as well. For a moment you wondered if any of the members of your team back home would learn to do this, but it wasn't like you would have the chance to find out. Once this whole mess was cleared up and you returned to your usual size it wasn't like you had reasons or ways to shrink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Virizion told Keldeo she wanted to link with her mind into Keldeo's energy you got worried. Would she sense you inside Keldeo? She was only going to probe his energies, it wasn't like she was going to find you, right? Keldeo seemed to share your worry. He looked as if he had been caught redhanded doing something he shouldn't have, and you sincerely hoped his real face didn't have that same expression. \"I'll return later. Mom could sense my copy if she's probing my energies\" he said and without even waiting for your reply the representation dissolved into thin air, leaving you alone in a corner of the Water Pouch. <i>Oh, fantastic. I'm stranded in unknown places inside Keldeo and without any guide. I better not move.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo was much more careful with his expression outside of his body than in his representations. He somehow managed to keep a straight face and nodded, feeling immensely nervous. He hoped that at least he wasn't sweating bullets like he felt he was. Virizion stared for a moment before approaching. \"Again, be very still. The probing will take only a moment but it's delicate\" Keldeo obeyed and she slowly made contact between her forehead and Keldeo's horn, for lack of a better place, and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sense Keldeo's energy. She felt it coursing through his adoptive son's body, but there were some anomalies that got her attention. \"Keldeo\" she said with a serious tone. Keldeo tensed up, fearing the worst. \"Your energies are disturbed. I feel several modifications to your body. Have you been attempting this arleady? Without asking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes...\" there was no use denying it. Virizion, alarmed, examined the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an empty space in your skull, very close to your brain. That's extremely dangerous for a beginner! Until you have enough experience I order you to leave it alone. Don't try to make it be gone\" There were also a few tunnels, very small and almost unnoticeable. She could sense they connected the skull and the surrounding areas with the stomach, as well as an organ she wasn't sure what it was. She wasn't very knowledgeable about the internal anatomy of his son, after all. But what worried her the most was a foreign speck of energy. She could sense there was something inside Keldeo, and she was bewildered to find out it was in Keldeo's rear, barely above the articulations of the hind legs. The energy felt strange. She had felt something similar before. 'Dialga?' she wondered. That was the temporal dragon's signature energy, time powers. But no, there was something else joined to that energy, and that was what puzzled her. It wasn't Dialga. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Keldeo had noticed Virizion had turned tense. Now he feared even more the worse, but Virizion made no comment. Instead she went to what they were going to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to modify a lesser organ. Give me a moment to decide what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't we create a new one entirely?\" Keldeo asked, hopeful. The human would need a place to eat and he still thought his stomach wasn't the best place for that. Virizion didn't take long to destroy those hopes, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're way too inexperienced for that right now. Let's go with the basics first and if in a couple weeks you're still interested we can go into the next level, organ creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't have a couple weeks.</i> Keldeo thought, forgetting he shouldn't have done that. Virizion was linked to his energies, she could feel it. Virizion opened her eyes, having heard that, but didn't inquire what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's one. Focus on your belly. In there you'll find a small round organ, it's a container for any debris the water you use for your attacks may have. When it's full it's emptied into your excretory system, but as right now it's not full we can use it. Have you located it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have\" Keldeo pictured it in his mind, a very small organ compared to most inside him. It wasn't even a worthwhile place for the human to see, unless he felt like waddling thighs-deep through useless minerals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picture how it's connected to everything else, it should have countless ducts connected. See how your blood vessels surround it. Carefully imagine that all ducts get separated from it, leaving it isolated\" Keldeo obeyed. Just like he had gone when he got the human out of his stomach earlier, he imagined the change in his body. \"That's right, well done. Let's try to make it larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpand the size of the organ just a bit until it doubles in size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a tad harder to do. Expanding it would mean pressing against the blood vessels surrounding it, he'd have to modify everything. Still, he obeyed, slowly and carefully moving the round shape of the organ until it reached the size he wanted. Somehow the blood vessels moved as well, compressing the organ a bit but nothing burst or got damaged. \"You need to remember there are things around each organ. Don't modify anything mindlessly, always make a plan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he was told to reverse the size change, which he did. There was a series of exercises that focused on very basic changes. The hardest thing he did was to make a thick passageway between that filter and his stomach, just to erase it. But he couldn't deny the time with Virizion had been useful. He was more conscious now of what modifying his body entailed and what the risks were. He hadn't gotten as far as he had thought he would, but it was useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mom. I'll rest a bit now, this was more tiring than I thought it'd be\" he said after the connection was broken. He was in liberty to lie both in words and thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice and be careful, Keldy. I don't know what use you can give to this, but maybe in the future you'll find it useful\". Virizion watched him go before running far away from the grove of trees that formed their common areas. After fifteen minutes Cobalion appeared in the distance and she quickly went to meet him, making sure Keldeo wasn't near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virizion! What's the hurry? Did something happen?\" Cobalion asked, looking around for any danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. Maybe. I'm not sure. Cobalion, we need to talk. It's about Keldeo\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what was going on outside. With Keldeo's representation gone you felt a bit abandoned, so when the air near you started to form the colt's silhouette you felt greatly relieved. \"Keldeo! How did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it went okay\" Keldeo replied, making sure he had created the new copy correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she find out about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you learn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo told you in few words the most important points of Virizion's lesson, which you approved. That all seemed great and at least would mean a smoother stay inside Keldeo in terms that he wouldn't risk the integrity of his organs. \"Good. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colt looked around. The waterfalls that led to his hind legs were still there, but it wasn't like there was much to see in those places. \"Well, I suppose we could continue going around. Virizion's lesson was of help but I still don't have a full grasp of the location of everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. You lead the way\" As soon as you said that a sphincter appeared in the wall of the pouch. \"So, let's see...we're around here\" you pointed to Keldeo's thigh. It was more of a supposition than anything else, but it didn't really matter. \"What is on the surrounding areas you want to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Keldeo went to the newly opened passageway. \"I don't know if we'll find any surprises. Let's take a general look around first, check if there's any point of interest and if there's nothing worthwhile I could make a path to return to the front\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Keldeo head into the newly formed sphincter for further investigation. As you descend the roughly formed tunnel, skepticism and uncertainty reigned your mind. The Pokemon may have mastered a few tricks from his surrogate mom, but you still have no idea about how he actually apply this freshly learned knowledge. Does he know where he connected this to? For all you know, the tunnel could lead to the bowels or some other unwanted locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wouldn't lead us to your large intestine, would it Keldeo?\" you asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it surely won't. I did it as my mom instructed. I'm...sure about that,\" Keldeo said uncertainly. The Pokemon tried to project his stance confidently and give you a reassuring smile. But his trembling forelegs betrayed the real state of his mind. It's both funny and to see Keldeo act like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just drop the act, Keldeo. You have no idea what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I know what I'm doing,\" the Pokemon insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are your legs trembling like that?\" you said while pointing to his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....,\" Keldeo searched for words, \"Okay, maybe you're right. I'm a little nervous, alright? It's just.... this in my rear and you know how things go down here. I'm a little bit afraid for your safety. I don't want to put you into any sorts of danger. That's the last thing we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've thought about that before taking us here. If this actually end up at your colon, you'll have to find some way to compensate me,\" you lightly chided Keldeo, \"Since we've gotten so far,  I must admit that I'm getting a little curious. Just make sure it's not something repulsive. I've been through enough bodies to anticipate all the outcomes. I do not intend to relive some of the worst ones like the cold, metallic walls of Dialga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell me more....if that's okay with you?\" Keldeo looked at you curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Keldeo a firm look. \"It's better that you not know about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Alright, no need for me to learn the details...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon fell silent as he continued walking down the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious. How did Dialga got you here? Why is he so eager to get hands on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought all the ordeals you went through and collected yourself before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga was nothing but an insane demigod Temporal Pokemon bent on making me miserable. He believed me to be part of a mythology that I still do not have a full understanding of; sometimes he referred to me as the human from the Legend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Legend? Yeah, I heard that one a lot from my mom. It's about one human who would usher a new era for Pokemons. The human would unite all the Legendaries in a final big battle against all the evils of the world before meeting with Lord Arceus to create a new world of goodness. I never really paid much attention to that because it is so unlikely and so formulaic, like the other bedtime stories my mom used to tell me. If Dialga believe all of that, I'm seriously doubting if he's in his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beginning to doubt the veracity of this whole thing myself ever since he showed me his bad side. He believed fanatically that I am the key to that story. He did various intrusive tests on me just to prove his point. But eventually, Suicune and Raikou showed up and helped me made it through that jerk of a Pokemon. Things went downhill from there and I've been on the run up to this point. It's better if I spare you the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I want to know about that,\" the colt said, \"I get shudders just to think about the sheer power that Dialga has. Being about to alter time space at will. Terrifying...I imagined that he would be very pissed about bring trounced by a human and two 'lesser' Legendaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why I need to hide in you, it's the place he's least expecting to find me,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry though. I'll try to conceal you to the best of my ability. I cannot guarantee that I could cover your presence forever. Did anyone else know that you are here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides you, Suicune, and Raikou, no one else,\" you answered, \"Still...I'm on the edge about all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But being all tensed up isn't going to help you recover from a horrible experience. I know some methods that Virizion has taught me to cope with stress. You want to try them?\" he asked with a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Maybe later...\"<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you didn't talked much until you reached the end of the tunnel. Immediately, you could tell that it's one of those places you wouldn't want to be at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that you are in an extremely soft chamber. Two large, bluish orbs dangled from the ceiling, connected by a network of veins and tendons. You can feel Keldeo's trotting in here, which caused the balls to sway back and forth. The pinkish arteries that crawled over the soft floor pulsed to muted heartbeats far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what my testicles look like from the inside,\" Keldeo said with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the colt, whose eyes are wide with wonder like someone who had just learned about reproduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, are they not?\" Keldeo said boastfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodness....why do Pokemon testicles and I seem to have so much in common...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the meadow, Virizion and Cobalion sat down face to face besides one of the trees in the grove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cobalion, something's wrong about Keldeo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this time? Was he misusing his sword powers on weaker Pokemon again,\" Cobalion said with a irritated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I feared that it is something far worse. How much do you know about body modification?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body modification is used to store food and shelter Pokemons in time of conflicts,\" Colbalion said, \"It is generally practiced by a larger Pokemon by changing the characteristics of their body to transform it into a makeshift living space if the necessity arises. What does this have to do with Keldeo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught him attempting to modify his own vital organs without training or proper supervision. He made several crude passageway to his stomach, brain and heart,\" Virizion explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the male stag sounded bewildered, \"A young Pokemon such as Keldeo has no business attempting moves beyond his expertise. He could hurt himself or worse. Did you find anything else off about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I did an Aura Scan of Keldeo, I detected Dialga's energy along with another unknown life energy within his body,\" Virizion said, her voice filled with concern, \"Do you know what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion heaved a heavy sigh and looked at Virizion. He focused on those worried red eyes of his companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dialga's energy....unknown life energy...\" he repeated, \"That doesn't sound good. We haven't had any contacts with Dialga for years. It shouldn't be possible for his energy to show up in Keldeo. Are you absolutely sure the energy came from him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did a double take the first time I discovered that. You cannot mistake his energy signature. It's very weak and bounded to another life energy that I cannot precisely put my hooves on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion's golden eyes grew even more concerned at Virizion explained how the unknown life energy seems to be moving around Keldeo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo is hiding something in his body,\" Cobalion stated directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that he's been acting a bit more skittish than usual around me. When I looked at him, I felt that he was hiding something from me. I knew that expression in his eyes. It's the kind of look that he gave when he's in trouble. What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Pokemon closed his eyes as his mouth formed a serious frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out. Let us go together. We'll confront him subtly. Keldeo will explain himself whether or not he wants to,\" Cobalion said with determination as he looked at the distant form of Keldeo on the horizon.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You did this on purpose, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gets him to stop for now. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You led us here on purpose. You seem a bit too elated for this to be a mere coincidence. Quite daring for somebody who was protesting a lot when Cobalion was informing you about the facts of life\" you said, rolling your eyes. Keldeo spluttered, looking for something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tha-That has nothing to do with this! B-Besides, even if I did want to come here, it'd not be my fault. This is what happens when someone talks about that stuff onto me out of the blue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop denying it already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one to talk! You said just yesterday you went into Raikou's testicles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't let that get to you. Instead you looked straight to Keldeo's eyes, undaunted. \"I didn't ask to be taken there. I didn't wake up one morning and decide I'd like to spend the day inside my host's balls. This is all on you, buddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo, somewhat embarrassed, stepped back and looked away. \"S-Sorry\" At least he apologized. Deciding to give Keldeo a break you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be in worse places, and besides I'm not judging. I'd appreciate a warning next time you decide to lead me to some place like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't it on purpose\" Keldeo kept denying it, and instead started walking around, looking at everything there was to see \"B-But you can't deny this is interesting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose. At least it doesn't look like you mangled anything here. It would have been quite a tragedy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was careful! Besides-\" Keldeo started saying, but suddenly he froze \"Drat, it's Mom and Uncle Cobalion again. They don't look happy. Uh, I think I should get away\" Everything around you shook, you fell onto the soft floor. Keldeo seemed to be about to have a panic attack \"I can't get away! This is it. We screwed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" You had to admit you were pretty worried about this development too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! M-Maybe if you left my body for now...no, you are too far away from my mouth and there's no time to create a path there. I-If they know about you I won't be able to lie...I don't know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hoped Virizion and Cobalion had no idea about you, but judging by Keldeo's reactions he had a bad feeling about all this. Suddenly everything stood still, you supposed Keldeo had given up on trying to get away. All you and him could do was hope this wasn't going to last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo could see Virizion and Cobalion were trying not to seem tense, but since Keldeo had something to hide he had a feeling of paranoia. He tried to not to look nervous, and if he did he hoped it wouldn't be visible enough for them to notice. Virizion took a deep breath and decided to go ahead. \"Keldeo, I'll go straight to the point: are you fostering someone inside of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I thought the plan was to confront him subtly\" Cobalion whispered to her, but she just glared at him. Maybe it was better this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why do you think that?\" Keldeo grimaced. They had been found out, he was in trouble...the last resort option was to protect the human the best he could. Virizion didn't go into detail about the exact mechanics behind her finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like a foreign presence, somehow with Dialga's energy contained within it. It is too weak to be Dialga, and Cobalion is going to confirm his location later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Keldeo shouted immediately, and when Virizion looked at him inquisitively he realized he had just yelled that \"P-please don't tell him about this. It won't be good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds to me you know you're doing something about Dialga. You won't go anywhere unless you explain yourself right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked at the ground. He could feel the disapproving stares, and silently he cursed Mew for choosing him as the host for the human. Virizion glanced at Cobalion, who said with the most authoritative tone he could do: \"If you don't explain yourself - and even if you do it isn't a satisfying answer - I'm afraid we'll have to reconsider your candidacy for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'm talking!\" Keldeo yelled immediately. Although Virizion felt guilty for having used the Swords of Justice as a way to get Keldeo to talk, at least it seemed to have worked. Virizion and Cobalion waited patiently for a minute while Keldeo looked for the best way to talk about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutright saying it was a human may not be good. Repeating everything the human had said didn't seem good, either. He had to be careful now. \"D-Dialga may have been...doing some e-e-e-experiments with a Pokemon, shrinking it and...I don't know what else happened to it. That's how his energy has bonded with m-my guest's life energy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of experiments?\" Cobalion inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Mew knows more than I do. She's the one who found the Pokemon and s-she said it would be safe with me. S-Since the Swords of Justice are about protecting and being guardians I thought it was good...\" Virizion and Cobalion weren't the only ones willing to use the Swords of Justice as an attempt to get the other side to yield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have consulted us about this. No offense, Keldy, but we are much more prepared for this than you\" Virizion said, seething with anger, most of it towards Mew. It seemed she was going to tell Mew what she thought about all this. Keldeo hoped Mew would be discreet and not contradict what he had just explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She said Dialga would never guess I'd be the host...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have told us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree. <i>You</i> should have told us too, Keldeo\" Cobalion said sternly. Keldeo bowed his head, ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you supposed to do now? How long is it going to be in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe a week, maybe two...Mew was vague about that. What matters is that Dialga shouldn't hear about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we shouldn't contact Dialga, after all\" Virizion muttered \"I'll go talk with Mew. Cobalion, please stay with him\" she said. If Keldeo had lied then he would try to run away, better to keep someone here to reign him in if he tried to flee. Cobalion nodded, and soon Virizion left. There was silence for a moment before Cobalion spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you were asking all those questions. It makes sense. We're getting involved in this now. First I think I should talk to this Pokemon inside you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no Psychic type but I should be able to establish a connection to talk with it. It won't be effective but it's worth a try. I'll warn you, Keldeo:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I decide this presence inside you can be dangerous in any way I promise you I'll find a way to shrink and boot it out of your body. You won't have a choice in the matter. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo nodded. This really wasn't in his plans either. Cobalion was going to talk directly to the human, so now he had to worry about two people not contradicting his tale. Keldeo hoped the human had heard everything he had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion moved around Keldeo until he was pretty close to his side. Without letting Keldeo move, he positioned his horns close to Keldeo's flank, focusing.</span></div></div>",

Cobalion navigated his energy through Keldeo's fur, skin, muscle, and bones, finally locating the \"Pokemon\"... in the testicles?! <i>What the....? I'm not liking where this is going.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue stag wrap his energy around the life form and felt the familiar tinge of Dialga's temporal energy that encased the Pokemon. The being itself is very different from what he is used to. A typical Pokemon's force would show up as a faint haze each with a different color depending on their type. But this... \"Pokemon\" has a more defined shape. The stag could see the \"Pokemon\" stand upright on two legs while possessing a purple force energy with a white center. <i>What exactly is this thing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo, I have never seen an aura like this. This Pokemon...feels very different. What exactly is this friend of yours? I need you to be honest with me,\" Cobalion asked with a growing sense of unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew didn't exactly elaborate on that. She said that he had been through very traumatic experiences and must be treated with carefully.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's important that I speak with him right away,\" the stag said as he intensified his beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that he will say much, uncle. He's still very reluctant to talk to someone other than me. The poor Pokemon has been through too much of Dialga's temporal experiments to trust anyone,\" Keldeo lied as convincingly as he could, \"It took me a few days before he opened up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Cobalion's expression hardened, \"Then it is even more imperative that I contact this Pokemon. I cannot allow a being to stay in you without explaining himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo grew anxoius as his uncle's energy approached the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even sure this being in you is a Pokemon and not something malicious pretending to be one?\" Cobalion pressed on while eyeing the colt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...He is a Pokemon. But he might be a little different from what you expect,\" Keldeo answered while his mind worked furiously to back up the claim, \"Dialga sort of played and altered with his physical appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo smiled awkwardly and shifted his gaze upward toward Cobalion. The way those golden eyes are dead fixed on his own made Keldeo shiver in his hooves. It's the look his uncle would give when he sensed something suspicious. <i>Come on, Keldeo. Think! Say something, anything! </i> The colt tried his best to stand straight and look confidently back at his steadfast uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being honest here,\" Keldeo said firmly, \"It may be hard to believe but what I'm saying is all true. How can I make this up especially when it comes to protecting a Pokemon? Isn't that what the Swords of Justice is about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion didn't immediately reply but kept his piercing eyes focused on the colt. After what felt like an eternity for Keldeo, Cobalion finally opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Very well then. I will trust that you are being honest,\" Cobalion answered in a less scrutinizing voice, \"But, if I discover that you are not being honest, you will face serious consequences up to and including revocation of your candidacy. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, read you loud and clear, uncle,\" Keldeo answered affirmatively. Mentally, however, he is sweating bullets and panicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion's eyes glowed golden as he trained his energy on the unknown 'Pokemon'.<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the testicles, Keldeo's representation besides you is hyperventilating and his face filled with dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I gotten myself into?\" he barely articulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him all worked up only makes you more nervous. Telling a bald-faced lie is one of the most nerve-wracking things you could do. You know from experience how awful Keldeo must be feeling right now especially when his dream of joining the Swords of Justice is at stake. You aren't in a better situation either. Cobalion is about to interrogate you and you have little time to figure out a convincing story. Just how are you supposed to explain why you are a human? And what would would happen if he finds your story unconvincing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to give those questions further thoughts, a strange sensation rolled through your body. A blue beam casted itself on you like a spotlight. You heard a deep buzz echoing in you ears and your vision became blurry as a male voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, can you hear me?\" Cobalion's voice rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....what? Who is it? Is that you Dialga?! No! Please get out of my head!\" you said in a frightened tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion recoiled mentally from the loud and abrupt response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here to get me to perform more experiments. No no no! Stop! I don't want to go back again,\" you made your voice more frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It seems that the Pokemon is very agitated. I need to calm him down first before I can make any inquiries. I hope this will work,\"</i> Cobalion thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not Dialga. Don't be afraid, little one. You are in safe hooves,\" Cobalion said in a soothing voice, \"It's alright, you are no longer in danger. No one is going to hurt you anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretend to calm down by slowing down your breath and relaxing your shoulder. Even though you're faking it, he has a very reassuring and soft and hypnotic voice. With each slow reassurance from Cobalion, you felt yourself relaxing at the stag's suggestion. When you feel that you have \"cooled down\" enough after a few minutes, you spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're....not Dialga? Who....are you then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to properly introduce myself. I am Cobalion, the leader of the Swords of Justice and mentor to Keldeo. It is a pleasure to meet you. Keldeo has explained your situation to me. I would like to ask you some questions if your comfortable with them. Is it alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I'll try my best to answer you as much as possible,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little one. Your answers will help a lot. First, can you tell me what exactly are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be a Pokemon...specifically, a Va...Vaporeon,\" you answered nervously, \"Just a regular Vaporeon until I have the misfortune of encountering Dialga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After seeing me, Dialga ate and imprisoned me in his body. He lured me into a chamber where he stored his temporal powers and changed me without my consent. I don't even know how to describe myself now,\" you explained while trying to sound 'composed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Dialga shrunk you down to this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. He claimed that Palkia did it accidentally to me. But I doubt it. Dialga said that I need protection and that he would take good care of me. But that turns out to be a lie,\" you grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a closer look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion concentrated his energy on your body. You felt the beam touching your legs, hands, and face like an invisible pair of gloves. After doing a full scan of your features, you heard a soft gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness... He changed you into a... human?! What was he thinking?\" exclaimed the stag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please believe me, Cobalion. I don't know what Dialga wants. He keeps telling me that I am an incarnation of the human destined to fulfill the Legendary prophecy. He placed me through endless exercises and mental test in this body to prepare me for the role. He even gave me a portion of his power to prove his point. I don't want any of this at all, but still he insisted and forced me to follow his instruction. I thought I was doomed to a life of endless torment in a reality-altering Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Legend? But that is merely a ancient myth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, Dialga believed otherwise,\" you dreaded. <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour, you recounted everything Dialga did to you, how you met Suicune and Raikou, and how you made it here with the help of Mew. The more Cobalion listened to your the \"adventure\" you went through, the more troubled he became. Even you are getting upset by just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable. I've always heard that Dialga is a mischievous prankster but this is unacceptable. Did you know why he might've chosen you for this....experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I have no idea. It feels like he just sensed something about me and just decided to whisk me away for training...If it weren't for Suicune and Raikou, I could have......\" you tried to fight back the urge to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that is enough, Vaporeon. You have been through a lot. We will work this out as soon as possible. Virizion and I will discuss what further actions we should take later. I would like you and Keldeo to be present at our meeting too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's  a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I would like to apologize if my colt took you on some bodily misadventure. I will need to get you out of the testicles and fix up the mess in his body and give him a stern talking to. In the mean time, you're welcomed to stay in my newly formed living quarter while Keldeo received further instructions on body modification. I promise that you will find it much more accommodating.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three conflicting emotions invaded you when Cobalion offered you temporal accomodations while Keldeo was instructed on the proper handling of the body modification powers. The first was elation, you'd be under the care of someone who wasn't a complete newbie at those matters. You were sure you could trust Cobalion not to make mistakes or endanger you or themselves. The second emotion was panic. It could be tough to keep up the lie, especially if Cobalion or Virizion interrogated you any further or if they contacted any other Pokemon involved in this mess. Finally, you felt pretty guilty for causing Keldeo all this trouble. You hoped the stern talking wasn't too emasculating for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept, sir...I wouldn't mind that\" you said to Cobalion, who hummed approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding the need to have you with me for the moment. You'll return to Keldeo's body once he has received the proper training, but I'll also say it doesn't make me comfortable at all to involve him any further. You'd be better with someone like me or Virizion protecting you, although it is true Dialga wouldn't guess Keldeo is your host\" Cobalion was clearly pushing you to leave Keldeo behind once and for all, but after such a short while and all the problems you caused him you felt responsible for the colt. He didn't deserve all this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think about it, but please, don't be rough with Keldeo. He wanted to help me\" you plead, Keldeo looking at you with gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be kept in mind. Now please make your way to Keldeo's mouth and exit to perform the transfer. I'll be waiting here\" Cobalion said, and the strange sensation subsided. It seemed Cobalion had broken the connection. You could hardly believe how things had gone. You really doubted this was what anyone had in mind when you were given to Keldeo to be sheltered, but maybe it wasn't all going to be as bad as it seemed at first? What was clear was that you'd need to be very careful. Cobalion and most likely Virizion would watch over you, at the first sign of suspicious behavior chances were you'd be in serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...f-follow me\" Keldeo mumbled. It was going to be a very long walk back to his mouth, and frankly he didn't feel like opening new tunnels. The walk would go through his water pouch and back to his head. The trek was done in tense silence until you finally broke it, feeling you needed to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo, I'm sorry for what happened. This must have been very stressing for you\" that sounded like a lame apology, but Keldeo seemed to accept it. He nodded, still glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I still don't know what I'm getting into, but it's too late to turn back. Just take care, and try not to mess up while you are inside my uncle\" he looked at you \"Uncle Cobalion is a pretty nice guy and I like him, but he won't hesitate to take action if he feels justified. Don't get on his bad side\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, that sounded fearsome. \"I won't. Uh, if Mew asks about me, what will you tell her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth. I don't think I can lie again like I did just a moment ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me. Anything I should know about Cobalion?\" May as well get some tips. Keldeo looked at the ceiling for a moment, thinking. When he spoke he did it slowly, as if he wasn't sure of what he was saying but judged it was better than staying silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thiiiink you should try your best to befriend him. Try not to talk about being a Pokemon, because I think you'll make a mistake if you push your luck on that. Be friendly, listen to him, and if you can tell him all you want is to be safe. He can be protective of those he cares about. If he cares about you then you should be okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense. The Swords of Justice needed members like Cobalion, after all. After a while you were halfway on Keldeo's neck. The colt stopped for a moment, focusing. You remembered there had been no direct path to his mouth, since the tunnel you used to get to his head had been connected to his stomach, so there was one last modification for the moment to do. When the road to his mouth was formed you thanked him for that. \"I'm a bit curious how it'll be to live in Colbaion even if it is for a short while. What could he be planning to have for my living quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll have everything you need, I suppose. I'm sure it'll be in a nice location, comfy, and if he really believed you then I bet he'll have included information about himself and what you can find in his body\" Keldeo fidgeted \"Don't get your hopes too high...\" There was silence for a moment \"So this is goodbye for now...uh, see you, human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me\" you thanked again, extending your hand to touch him. He flinched for a moment, but then stood still and let you touch him. It seemed he was a tad uncomfortable about it, but let you nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-See you\" he said before vanishing. Now alone, you knew all that was left to do was to exit Keldeo's body. The path indeed did lead to Keldeo's mouth, soon you were standing on his tongue. Keldeo was trying very hard not to move it to not to cause you any discomfort while you walked to the tip of his tongue. Once your host felt you in the correct position he laid his head against the ground, letting you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked behind you. Keldeo was still pretty bothered by how things had gone. You waved at him, but he didn't seem to see you. There was another Pokemon to his side, and you knew immediately who it was. Cobalion's form was very intimidating, especially at your size. He was considerably larger than Keldeo, while not as large as Dialga, he was imposing nonetheless. The way he was pointedly looking at you made you cower with caution for a moment before you forced yourself to relax a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion seemed to be satisfied with his first sight of you. Without saying a word he put his hoof right in front of you. It was clear he expected you to get on it. That was better than being plucked off the ground as if you were grass, like Keldeo had tried to do when you  were going to enter him. This reassured you Cobalion knew what he was doing. You got on the hoof, grabbing onto it as well as you could. Cobalion lifted it, and talked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As ready as I can be, I guess\" you replied. You had to admit the perspective of being in Cobalion's body was exciting in a way, too. Was this interest in Pokemon insides a consequences of having been inside three already? You thought it would have ended with being inside Raikou, but now you were going to see the insides of a fourth legendary Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I welcome you to my body\" Cobalion said before moving his hoof. You braced yourself, ready to enter his body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keldeo looked up at you worriedly, the concerns in his eyes conveyed the fear and troubles that would befall if you let slip your true origin to his uncle. It was understandable the colt is afraid of what his more powerful mentors would do. The Swords of Justice's own history and their infrequent contact with humans means that their attitude toward your kind is rather ambivalent, even hostile. If you consider the group's mission is saving Pokemons from collateral damage done by humans, the implications can be rather unpleasant. Thankfully, Cobalion seems to be taking your 'human appearance' in stride. But there is no guarantee your cover will last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with persisting fear for your own safety, you smiled at Keldeo if only to reassure him that everything will be alright in the face of uncertainty. He lingered on his gloomy expression and looked worriedly at you. You saw Keldeo's mouth about to form something but stopped before a sound a uttered. Perhaps sensing that he is holding things up, the colt finally managed to crack his muzzle into a smile if only a forced one and nodded gingerly as Cobalion's hoof lifted out of his reach, taking the human away. <br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to a stop before Cobalion\u2019s wide-opened maw. His impressive set of teeth towered over you like pillars and his pink tongue stick out like a carpet waiting for you to enter its owner's palatial body. It has become a well-established ritual by this point as you readied to enter yet another host. If all goes well, you could really get used to living inside Pokemons which you must admit offers a lot more than your small apartment ever could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are! Just let me know when you're ready,\" Cobalion's voice boomed so loudly that it almost knocked you down. A bit too enthusiastic for your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....here we go, I guess,\" you replied, still reeling from the ear-ringing and his hurricane-strength breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, you walked onto the Pokemon's tongue and head for his gullet where you took a leap, allowing Cobalion to take you in. The esophagus enveloped your body, expanding and contracting as they worked to move you down to the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you plopped down and landed in a large pool of what you assumed to be acid. But it felt frigid, almost freezing. A gasp escaped your mouth at the sudden change in temperature which caused you to take in a mouthful of the liquid. It didn't have the characteristic acidic or burning taste that you've come to expect. It tastes like plain, cold water with some slimy mucus added in for good measure. Although a bit unnerved at being covered in Cobalion's drool, you thankfully didn't end up landing in some digested Oran Berry and catching a lungful of stale, humid stench like a certain novice did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter righting yourself, you saw that Cobalion\u2019s stomach is far larger than Keldeo\u2019s and much more tidy. By your own estimate, the size of the pool extends as at least 50 meters in all directions. The water is clear enough for you to see the bottom of the stomach which is quite deep and the stomach walls give off an ethereal cobalt blue glow that bathed your environs in a dim, shadowy light. It\u2019s vaguely similar to the glow seen in Dialga\u2019s artificial and steely interior. Sensing the negative turn in your thoughts, your mind swiftly suppressed any memories of that Pokemon to focus at the more pressing matter at hand. You are worried about Suicune and Raikou\u2019s safety and reminded yourself to ask Cobalion to get in touch with them once you get the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach was then filled with the familiar cacophony of creaking and groaning as the stag restructured his bones and muscles to accommodate you. Before your eyes, a dock took shape and emerged from the stomach wall. It took the form of a long pier made from vein-like structures that extended out to the middle of the stomach near where you are floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped yourself out of the water and slowly walked on the soft and squeaky pier toward a tunnel. Taking extra precautions, you entered the tunnel and ascended a long flight of stairs. At the end, the stairs gave way to a round chamber that looks like something ripped directly from the lobby of a luxury hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby itself is an eclectic mix of modern and ancient architecture. Ultra modern sofas and coffee table sat upon a blue rug adorned with ancient runic patterns while the amber walls are adorned with countless bas-reliefs depicting the each member of the Swords of Justice. One that caught your attention has Cobalion battling a large imposing dragon-like creature, the Ice Dragon, Kyurem. Once engaged in a battle, you were told, it will relentlessly find its challenger until he either wins or lose. Additional murals depict the Terrakion and VIrizion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centerpiece of this lobby, however, is the impressive-looking chandelier made from hundred of glowing sacs. You walked down and sat on one of the sofas, appreciating how comfortable they feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the amenities already?\" Cobalion\u2019s voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to what you assumed to be a reception desk and found Cobalion standing there. Even when he shrunk his form down to your size, he still looks imposingly tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your new home, Vaporeon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible!,\" you acted surprised, quickly reminded yourself that you are now technically a \"Vaporeon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body modification can be very useful if one knows how to master it,\" the stag smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"....It looks so....distinctly human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some contact with human civilization previously,\" Cobalion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far better than anything I've seen in Keldeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, Keldeo's hosting may have left a bad aftertaste upon you due to his ineptitude. It'll take time for you to appreciate the full potential. I can teach you this knowledge if you like to learn more about it,\" he chuckled as he walked closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I would love to take up on that offer but first I have to get my original form back,\" you remarked jocularly as the stag came within several feet of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes. Your current form....that's what really intrigues me. Might I take a closer look if you don't mind that is?\u201d Cobalion circled you with glints of curiosity and excitement in his golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence that was punctuated only by the clip-clop of Cobalion's hooves on the hard surface of floor. His pupils focused on your form, taking in details of your \u201caltered\u201d feature. The Pokemon walked close enough for you to feel his breath and warmth from his body. You are almost tempted to touch his soft blue, velvety fur but decided better. It looks even softer than Suicune's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncomfortable silence lasted for more than five minutes when it's finally broken by Cobalion clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...it's been a long while since I last saw a human. As much as I hate to give credit to him, Dialga did a pretty decent job of replicating their physical characteristics when he transformed you. Not that I'm complimenting him or condoning his actions. Regardless, as a sworn member of the Swords of Justice, I hereby pledge to keep you safe from peril and danger regardless of what they may be. I will affirm this duty with good judgement and prudence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, that will be the last I hear about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. we'll sort things out. In the meantime, you are free to use my body as your own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for taking me in, Cobalion,\" you said in a a grateful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. You must be exhausted from your previous ordeal. Let me show you the way to your room.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The way to the room was surprisingly short. You didn't know where exactly in Cobalion's body you were, but everything the room was rather spacious, much more than you would ever need. There was a remarkably large bed, extending towards the middle of the room, you'd need to crawl for several seconds to get to the edge. The temperature was perfect, too, the always present warmness that came with being inside a living creature's body didn't exist, the air was pleasantly cold. There were several screens, most of them of unknown functions. A couple were turned on and showed what was going on outside, perfect to give you a view of nature without having to go there yourself. Several pieces of furniture were strewn around the room for your enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be your room during your stay inside me. It's not much, but you should be comfortable\" Cobalion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? This is amazing!\" you replied. Cobalion smiled warmly, walking along the walls of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing less than the essential. You won't need to leave your room to receive my attention. If you look here...\" Cobalion opened a passageway to an adjacent room, where a comfortable cushion was placed on the floor \"...this is where you'll receive your food, anytime. You only need to tell me what you want and I'll get it ready for you in no time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for that, I can take whatever you want to give me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You're the guest, and after all the problems you have gone through it's the least you deserve\" your host said. You stayed silent, while it was true you had gone through a lot of trouble ever since you met Dialga, it wasn't of the type Cobalion imagined. Cobalion stared at you for a moment before guiding you to another short hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your actual form isn't the one you're used to, Vaporeon, but I have also providad a deep pool for you. I expect you to stay for some time after we find a way to return you to normal, for the moment I don't advise you get in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return me to normal? What will you do?\" That didn't sound good, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about scie nce, or about how Dialga may have caused you to change form like he did, but if you're willing I could perform a few procedures to find a lead on how to do it. That is, if you don't mind\" Cobalion waited to hear your response. Was it more suspicious to stay silent, or to agree and see how there'd be no good results despite anything Cobalion could try?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you later\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. Take your time to agree, but I'd imagine you'll want to return to your original form as soon as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou berated yourself mentally for hesitating. Cobalion continued the guided tour. This place had everything you could ever need and wish, and Cobalion remarked that, if you ever needed anything, you just needed to ask and you'd receive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one last hole, closed by a sphincter. It was smaller than the rest, just large enough for you to enter if you wished. Cobalion stopped to its side, waiting for you to arrive. \"That concludes the tour of your room. Any questions?\" he asked as if he weren't standing to the side of an unknown passageway. You took the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does this lead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" Cobalion tapped the side of the sphincter, making it open. The tunnel behind the sphincter sloped downwards, and in comparison to every other place you had seen inside Cobalion, it was dark and rather ominous \"You shouldn't worry about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but where does it go?\" you were starting to have a bad feeling about it. Cobalion turned his head towards you, any friendly demeanor gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, there's one thing I hate, and it's to be lied to. This tunnel is meant to be a reminder. I don't mean to insinuate anything, but if I ever find out you lied regarding you, or about what has happened to you...\" Cobalion glanced into the passageway \"...let's say you'd be forced to endure a rather humilliating walk, followed by immediate ejection from my body\" you didn't need to get clarification about what Cobalion meant. Great, as if you needed more pressure on you. For a moment you considered telling the truth now and hope for the best, but you hesitated. For now, all you did was stare dumbly at Cobalion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag closed the sphincter. \"Being honest won't be as bad, supposing you lied\" he recovered his usual cordiality \"I suggest you stay away from this tunnel, unless for some reason or another you feel like spelunking through my bowels, in which case I won't judge. Different Pokemon have different wavelengths\" Cobalion walked to a small table on a side. \"I hope you enjoy your stay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, sir!\" you replied with exaggerated eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're here in your bedroom, how about we talk and get to know each other better? I admit I'm curious about you, Vaporeon. Tell me about your life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat beside Cobalion. \"My life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Where do you live? There may be other Pokemon worried about you. How did you encounter Dialga? Tell me about yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt increasing nervousness. Did Cobalion suspect you weren't being completely sincere? Was he trying to get you to pile more lies into your story? You realized you needed to tread carefully if you didn't want to create more suspicion on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be stressful.</span></div></div>",

Good way to get to know each other better,\u201d you managed to force out while trying not to make yourself look too fidgety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was only a matter of time before Cobalion would ask you questions about your past. But you didn\u2019t even have a convincing rough draft of your \u201cpast\u201d thought out. Perhaps, he already found holes in your story and has serious doubts about Keldeo\u2019s explanation.Otherwise,what reason does he have to show you the opening to his intestines and that ominous warning about the consequences of lying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also felt indebted to Keldeo who has done everything in his ability to keep you safe while placing his entire future within the Swords of Justice at risk for your protection. You have to return this big favor somehow. But any miscalculation will be the end of a young colt\u2019s lifelong dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet away across the table, Cobalion sat quietly with his face as stoic as ever while his impenetrable golden eyes remained fixated on you. Even when seated, the Pokemon is an imposing presence. Those large antlers and robust hooves could make easy work of you should Cobalion want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon only quietly adjusted his position without taking his eyes off you. Unable to break away from his inquisitive gaze, you began fearing whether Cobalion could mind-read you like Dialga...or is he just studying your behavior and quietly waiting for a slip up. You felt like an actor caught in an uncontrollable stage fright and forgotten all his lines. Absolutely nothing would form on your lips. Your mind tried to churn out something that makes sense but you are overwhelmed. There is only the thin veneer of calm that is quickly wearing away as your heart started pounding faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Cobalion who broke the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVaporeon, you seemed... quiet,\u201d he commented, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...no. I just got a little caught up in some memories, both happy and sad,\" you smiled weakly, \"I was just wondering what made you interested in knowing about my past?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs someone who has been a surrogate father figure to Keldeo, I\u2019m rather curious to hear about your life story and aspirations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know, Cobalion, there are so many things I could tell you. I don\u2019t know where I can start,\u201d you answered carefully, hoping not to appear too unnatural to your host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to share what you want, Vaporeon. I cannot force you to disclose something that you don't want. But once again, I want to be clear that you will only tell me the truth,\u201d the stag reiterated sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. Understood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m all ears here,\u201d Cobalion leaned across the table and crossed his front hooves to make himself comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really is no backing off from this one. The stag is as determined as ever to dig up your past. You mentally composed yourself and began to piece together a long story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all happened so long ago, my memories are a bit hazy,\u201d you pretended to think, \u201cI\u2019ll try to recount as many details as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tell me what you can,\u201d Cobalion motioned for you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe earliest memory I could recall is without doubt is the green shades of towering trees and the deep, winding cavern in which my family lived,\u201d you began, \u201cI was then an Eevee within a forest a good distance away from a human settlement which I later learned is called Violet City within a region called Johto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohto? Hmm...I remember being told about that faraway place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...but how I got here is another long story. Let's just keep it on topic for the moment. My parents, a Jolteon and Flareon, raised me carefully and did everything they could to minimize my contact with the humans. I could still recite the cautious tales my parents told me nonstop not to venture beyond the woods. They said that there are humans who would capture us in devices called a Pokeball and make us fight with other Pokemons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokeballs, one of the worst fears of a Pokemon after the trainers that weld them,\" Cobalion commented, \"Especially true if you are rare or unique in ways that caught their fancies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hate listening to my parents lecturing me everyday, the tales did their job of keeping me safe, at least when I'm following the rules,\u201d you said half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Cobalion chuckled a little which lightened the mood substantially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a story is far too common among us protective of our children. I remember telling Keldeo something similar. In our case, it was that humans would conduct dangerous experiments on him if steps out of the grove,\u201d the stag laughed as he reminisced about his own past anecdotes, \u201cIn keeping with our ancient traditions, the Swords of Justice prefers to keep a very low profile from humans.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally felt better and calmer now. The good news is the stag didn\u2019t sense anything off about you and is more relaxed that you have something in common with him. But you are mystified by Cobalion\u2019s mention of their ancient traditions. It is certainly something you would want to ask later. For now, you should continue with your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the most part, life in the wood was relatively peaceful... Until one day, the humans cleared a long strip of forest near our cave and constructed a new route. My parents were obviously alarmed by this and intensified their warnings,\u201d you \u2018recalled\u2019, \u201cBut I was a curious little Eevee who loved exploring back then. Despite my best judgements, I ventured out onto the newly made dirt path. At first, I was happy that I got to see an unexplored area and being free from my parent. I saw the dirt paths, the road signs, and fences. It was the first human-made things I have seen. But soon my little adventure got me into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag fell quiet and listened on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spotted some trainers in the distance. It seems that they were busy training or something, but I don't know. I approached them\u2026they suddenly took great interest in me...I could still remember the curious and astonished tone of their voice upon seeing a young Eevee out here...a wild one...All at once, they took out their Pokeballs...ready to have me as their prize...It was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feigned fear and trembled to make it seem more convincing. Cobalion took notice of the tears on your face and placed his hoof over your back and patted you gently. You looked up at Cobalion whose expression softened and nuzzled your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt alright, Vaporeon. You don\u2019t have to go into the details,\u201d he spoke softly, \u201cYou are safe and sound with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was... a traumatizing experience,\u201d you sniffed a little, \u201cI don't want to say much. I was chased for so long I thought I would be doomed... My father rescued me from those pursuing trainers and got me back safely. Within days, my parents decided that it was no longer safe for us to remain in the woods and traveled to the remote mountains. A lot has happened since then, but I don't want to bore you out with hours of stories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion studied you for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Vaporeon. I think we can save you life stories for another day. More importantly, I need you to tell me more about Dialga and anything that he mentioned to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nCobalion along with Virizion and Keldeo are returning to their tree together. The sun was slowly lowering toward the horizon and they planned on returning to their grove to have their dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag curiously eyed Keldeo who seemed to be quieter than usual as he lightly trotted by his side. He seemed to be in deep thoughts, likely contemplating about his upcoming test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeldeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Yes, Uncle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am rather curious about your new friend that you brought in,\u201d the stag said, \u201cHow was he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was good...,\u201d Keldeo replied brightly, \u201cWe talked a little about my aspiration to become a full member of the Swords while he told me about some of his own anecdotes while he trained. I think we would make good friends, we have much more in common than expected despite his current state.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he say anything about his past or where he is from?\u201d Cobalion inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe only told me that he used to be a Vaporeon that was captured Dialga,\u201d the colt answered, \u201cHe also said that his interest is exploring the internal workings of a Pokemon. I recalled him saying that he lives in the forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So far thing matched up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Pokemon with an intense interest in Body Modification, so my Keldy isn't the only one,\" Virizion added while nuzzling Keldeo, which prompted to the colt to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Stop that, I'm not a young colt anymore. I am about to become a Sword bearer,\" Keldeo said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...but you are still my little colt, Keldy,\" she teased which only made Keldeo more embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion laughed at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Keldeo. If you want to be successful within the Sword of Justices you have to start acting like one,\" he said while stroking Keldeo's mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do act like one, Uncle,\" he shot back while giving Cobalion a grumpy look only to hear the laughter grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay...I got it,\" the stag blurted out while fighting the tears of laughter, \"Let's get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to ask Vaporeon more questions to be sure about his reasons.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you for talking about your life. However there's something I'm going to ask you about, no matter how much it hurts\" Cobalion said, trying not to look confrontational. Vaporeon would talk more if he didn't feel threatened. \"Again, please tell me about Dialga and everything he said\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. This was the most delicate topic of all. Everything else was something you were free to completely make up, but everything related to Dialga was a dangerous topic that could either save or destroy you. You had to think this very carefully. \"I don't like to think about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to return to normal you'll have to talk about it. You can trust me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" There was no time to think any further. You just had to think of something fast and hope you don't contradict yourself. \"Dialga and I met almost a month ago. I was exploring a place not too far from home, trying to find a place I could live in by myself, when I fainted. When I woke up Dialga was there, and I was this size. I tried to run away, but then Dialga said...\" you stopped, feigning to be bothered by your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? Please continue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He muttered 'You'll be perfect'...I think he thought I couldn't hear him. Then he talked to me, he said he'd protect me, but I'd have to stay inside his body. At first I refused! I thought I'd die! But he insisted, and I had no idea how I'd survive back home at this size, so I accepted\" you said, trying to look as pained as possible. To be completely honest that moment had been weird at first, but later you had come to appreciate it. If only things had stayed that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the inside of his body like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I couldn't see most of it. As soon as I reached his stomach I was pushed further into his body, where I was imprisoned. I was kept there for a few days, being fed sludge, until he finally told me what he was planning. He said I was the reincarnation of the star of a prophecy, and he...he turned me into a human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible\" Cobalion said rather flatly, too focused on comparing your story to everything you had said before. So far it matched the little you had said while being inside Keldeo, there was no reason to think you were lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so painful...I thought I was going insane! I want nothing more than going back to normal. That's all I want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you we'll search for a way to do that. For now please stay calm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to pass through so many tests...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion leaned a bit closer to you, eyeing you with worry. \"You'll have to be more specific than that\" You grudgingly went into more detail, not really wanting to remember everything. At the time you had felt rather proud of having overcome all of Dialga's challenges, but now...okay, no, you still felt proud. Not anyone would be able to do everything you did. \"That's outrageous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...that's why I was so thankful when Suicune and Raikou rescued me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion nodded, making a mental note to talk with them. \"How did they do that? How did they find out there was a Vaporeon inside Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, that was a detail you hadn't thought of yet. \"I...I managed to contact them, so they shrunk and went inside Dialga to save me. I have been on the run with them since then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told Mew brought you here. Should I suppose she's one of your allies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is! If it hadn't been for her I wouldn't be with you right now. Dialga had found Raikou and Suicune, so I was brought here so I could be safe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be safe\" Cobalion said, standing up \"I promise you I'll keep you safe until the matter can be settled favourably for you. All I ask in return is that you behave while inside me. You're welcome to bother me anytime you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, tearing up without it being entirely fake. \"I will...thank you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome to explore any place you want in my body. I was informed you got an interest in exploring bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter. Keldeo spilled the beans on that? That colt...! \"I-It's not like that! It's just that this is the fourth I'm inside of and I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. You can explore my body all you want. There are no restrictions at all. I'll provide you with some information regarding points of interest you could visit\" A few pamphelts formed in the ceiling and fell on the table, forming a neat pile \"Enjoy your stay, Vaporeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Vaporeon has suffered a lot, Virizion. He deserves some time to rest\" Cobalion was telling Virizion once he got the chance while Keldeo ran ahead. There were only a couple hours of daylight left, if he wanted to train he had to start now. Virizion smiled at Keldeo, and glanced at Cobalion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's telling the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is. But we shouldn't do anything without having all the facts of this matter. And for that reason we'll have to contact all parties involved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can talk to Mew. Suicune and Raikou should be able to talk to you about the human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not the ones that interest me the most. Dialga is the key here. I should listen to what he has to say. That's the just thing to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirizion tilted her head. \"Do you think that's fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm as powerful as Dialga is, if not more. Despite his powers I should be able to have the advantage over him\"<i> I don't expect Dialga to admit his wrongdoings, but talking to him should allow me to have insight on everything that happened.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You opened the first page which contains a fold-out page featuring a diagram of Cobalion\u2019s entire body. A red circle indicated that your bedroom is located in a space between the lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour room is located here,\" Cobalion pointed at the highlighted area, \"Did you notice the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing over the entire map, you see that there are many more paths and spaces leading away from your room to various other organs and locations which you didn\u2019t recalled seeing when Cobalion took you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve added a lot of places that might be of your interest and convenience,\u201d your host commented, \u201cI hope you'll now find my interior much more exciting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExciting?\u201d you repeated, \"In what sort of ways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's for you to find out, Vaporeon,\" Cobalion\u2019s eyes glinted slightly and a smile formed on his usually stoic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat look made you wonder if it was a good idea for Keldeo to disclose your interests to Cobalion. It sounded more like he really wanted you to explore him.<i> Does Cobalion also secretly share this sort of fantasy like me?</i>, you thought, a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you\u2019re relieved that Cobalion chose to believe you for now. But his voice still betrayed a hint of doubt that left you uneasy. You knew that you and Keldeo won\u2019t be able to hold this up forever. Sooner or later, you will be confronted on more personal information and there is no guarantee that you won't slip. On the top of that, Dialga is still hot on your trail and will stop at nothing to get you back in his possession for a good reprisal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is my best bet on getting to the bottom of things and returning to normal size...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you aren't planning to spend all day sitting there, are you, Vaporeon?\u201d your host said curiously as he waited at the exit from your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...sorry to keep you waiting. I kinda spaced out,\u201d you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along now\u2026,\u201d Cobalion gave you a perplexed look before turning away into the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up from your seat, grabbed the stack of pamphlets, and hurriedly followed Cobalion\u2019s representation out of the room. Back within the labyrinthine tunnels of Cobalion\u2019s innards, you moved deeper and deeper through more split paths and up a few flight of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through the seemingly aimless journey, Cobalion decided to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a bit curious, Vaporeon. As a human, do you still get access to the Pokenet system?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking that although you are physically a human for all purpose right now, your soul possibly still retains some connection to your Pokemon form. Do you retain anything abilities from your original Pokemon form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately no,\" you shook your head sadly, \"Aside from the worthless temporal power I was granted, it looks like Dialga\u2019s transformation has virtually stripped me of all my Pokemon power. I have no connection to the Pokenet and I haven't had the opportunity to speak with my friends for weeks. I am as helpless as a human can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made an intensive effort to appear convincingly distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never heard about a Pokemon losing their power in such a terrifying manner,\u201d Cobalion said calmly, \"I will get to the bottom of this. We just need to start getting all the pieces of information we could possibly acquire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we supposed to do that?\u201d you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to go to the Communications Center where you can get much needed access to the Pokenet and begin our investigation,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m interested in hearing more perspectives than simply from you and Keldeo. I believe Suicune and Raikou wouldn't mind sharing some of the details about your stay with Dialga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven't spoken with Suicune and Raikou since Mew got me here. I should really let them know I'm fine. But wait\u2026 doesn't that mean I'll have to communicate under your identity and risk compromising everyone\u2019s safety. What if Dialga intercepts our conversation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVaporeon, I doubt that he will be clever enough to look our way if your description of him is anything to go by,\u201d Cobalion said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope you're right,\u201d you sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nOnce you climbed the last set of stairs, you find yourself within one of the most technically sophisticated rooms you\u2019ve seen inside Cobalion so far. Thick colorful organic wires covered every inch of the wall in this circular space. The floors here are made from steel which made every step you take echo. Your eyes followed the wires which ended at two large screens on opposite end of the chamber. Both screens are blank with a faint bluish glowing indicating that their on. What's more impressive is the computer console itself which looks like a multi-million device you would find in a research lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center of the room is occupied mostly by a large opening that reveals several more floors below. You peered down the opening and got a good view of Cobalion\u2019s brain which is blue and emits electrical sparks among the countless synapses and veins coursing through its mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the Communications Center, which I have built into the hollow cranium space between my forehead and brain,\u201d Cobalion explained proudly, \u201cThese wires connect the devices to my antlers which contain ferromagnetic cores that allows me to emit and tune into a variety of signals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag took you across the chamber to the other end where toward on of the large computer stations which is made purely from veins and membranes. You noticed that a standard keyboard and touchpad are provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are. Feel free to use it any way you like,\u201d Cobalion smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible! I never knew that you could do this with body modification. What do you usually used these for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time to organize conference with other Pokemon about the state of the land. At other times, I simply enjoy some psychic movies and play games with others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in admiration. \u201cPretty much the same for me when I still had the power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and by the way, Vaporeon,\u201d the stag added, \u201cI've been getting a lot of interference from human-created signals. A lot of random stuffs that I must say are quite beyond the comprehension of a Pokemon\u2019s mind. If you're the kind to fancy human-created contents, you're welcome to view them and let me know about your thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the information,\u201d you said awkwardly, \u201cBut I think I better let my friend know I'm okay before exploring any of those stuffs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. If you need anything, I'll be at the other work station.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cobalion representation walked to the other side and left you to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned on the device. You are greeted by a menu that looks surprisingly similar to a regular computer but with very different applications. There are familiar things like a Pokenet browser and a chat app that you saw within Dialga. But there are also various fun-looking games, Pokemon forums, and \u201csight-sharing\u201d networks that you will take a look at later. For now, you opened the chat app and start searching for Suicune and Raikou\u2019s name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Strange curiosity for a Vaporeon...It seems as though he never used the Pokenet before\u2026perhaps being isolated for so long can make one a little data hungry</i>, Cobalion wondered as he observed the human busy at his computer station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAt his own station, Cobalion started searching for ways to reach and talk with Dialga. He had withhold this fact from Vaporeon, fearing that it might put the now-human Pokemon into distress again. It is a necessary step to understanding the story which includes hearing the perpetrator\u2019s version of events to corroborate existing facts even if it's distorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScouring through the Pokenet proved to be a formidable task. Numerous times, several promising leads came into a dead end. Many other Pokemons were reluctant to assist him in gaining an audience with the reality-bending demigod out of likely fear of incurring his wrath. <i>Are you nuts?</i> they said. <i>Haven't you heard about what Suicune did to him and he's totally pissed right now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cobalion remained undeterred as he scoured deeper into the less savory part of the Pokenet. While looking through a nasty comment thread on Legendaries, the stag came across something peculiar. Every then and now, there would be random anonymous posts from an unknown Pokemon promising unusual rewards including new powers and other ludicrous things like gaining an audience with Arceus in return for helping him. It may see like the typical spam post if the poster didn't mention that he is looking for a shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious posts have been voted down by several hundreds points and were flagged as spam by multiple Pokemons. Most of the reply are sarcastic and ridicules about how it is obviously a desperate attempt at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could it be? Is he really that obvious?....Or rather so laughably forthright.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion tapped on the connect icon on the post and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for the connection to go through. It was poor and spotty but enough to transmit messages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this that contacted me?!\u201d the voice demanded,  \u201cHow dare you seek audience of a demigod directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Cobalion, Leader of the Swords of Justice. You've got some interesting posts here,\" the stag held calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you test my patience. I'm in rather bad mood now,\" the voice growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this have something to do with a shrunken human, perhaps? I'm very curious about what story you might have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga fell silent. <i>Could this self-important so-called leader possibly have some news about the human?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cState your concerns!\u201d  Dialga demanded impatiently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cobalion left Dialga stew in his own anger for a moment. He wasn't sounding like somebody who hadn't done anything wrong, so it seemed the transformed Pokemon he was hosting right now was right to be wary about Dialga. Letting them see each other again wasn't a good idea, definitely not. \"My concern is that your intentions towards the human may not be...benign\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all you want is to scold me then go away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where the human is\" Outright saying he was hosting the human would have been a bad decision, but Cobalion saw no harm in saying he knew where the human was. That should be enough to make Dialga talk \"And I have heard a lot of rumors about what happened between you and the human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumors? You have to be kidding me...\" Dialga groaned \"I did nothing wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I have heard is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you have heard, it's not true! Look, all I was doing was share some of my power with the human. It's not my fault the human flipped out and turned paranoid. I did nothing wrong!\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly were you doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence in the other side. \"You know, the usual. Don't worry too much about that. Where's the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis refusal to say anything specific was a red flag. If he wasn't even bothering to lie then his actions may have been worse than Cobalion had imagined. \"A common Pokemon under my protection found the human and is taking care of him. For the moment that's better than letting you have him back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Why do I need to be persecuted like this? This wasn't even my fault in the first place, Palkia made him appear shrunken already, but somehow<i> I </i>am the bad guy here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Cobalion's attention was piqued. In an attempt to make Cobalion tell about the human's location, Dialga told how Palkia had accidentally caused the human to appear in front of him at such small size, that he had given the human shelter, and that his intentions hadn't been bad. Cobalion didn't fully pay attention, because something else had gotten his attention:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even once Dialga referred to his unfortunate victim as Vaporeon. It was always 'the human'. It was also a bit strange he was throwing under the bus someone else...was he trying to say it was Palkia's fault Vaporeon had been transformed? <i>That can be easily confirmed</i>. Just contacting Palkia and asking him about that would be enough. Unlike Dialga, Palkia was much more agreeable. Cobalion didn't doubt he'd talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you everything. Now it's your turn\" Dialga demanded \"Where's the human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion calmly spoke. \"For his sake it's for the better I don't tell you. Thank you for the information\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, I'm not done with you yet! You dare to treat me like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you're the leader of the Swords of Justice. I'm on my way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion hurried to cut off the connection. Really? There was no way Dialga could ever find them. Even if he asked other Pokemon about where the Swords of Justice were at, nobody would tell him, he had made a ruckus in the Pokenet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga looked through the list of Legendary Pokemon he knew. Those words, the Swords of Justice, it sounded familiar. It didn't take long to find where he had heard them before. He had showed Keldeo to the human. It couldn't be a coincidence the leader of the group Keldeo wanted to join had mentioned the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he knew where to look for the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Raikou and Suicune were okay. They were both relieved to hear from you. \"How's Keldeo treating you?\" Suicune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm not under his care anymore. Cobalion found out and now I'm inside him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cobalion? I'm not sure that's a good idea. I have heard upsetting him is dangerous\" Raikou said \"He's not violent, but he's not afraid of punishing those he believes are troublesome\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go get you?\" Suicune sounded ready to somehow get to wherever Cobalion was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I'll be okay. He's treating me well\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should give you a chance to unwind. It's not confirmed, but I once heard from Pokemon he has saved in the past. They say Cobalion sheltered them in his body and gave them all preferential treatment. He was willing to let them explore anywhere they wanted! I think he's into this, he likes having someone explore his insides. You'll get along\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your situation, you had to admit that sounded somewhat appealing, and since Cobalion was willing then sure, why not to enjoy your time inside him? \"I'll stay with him for a while. If anything happens I'll tell you\" you said, feeling a bit more cheerful now. You had a stack of brochures and info, enough to spend a long time visiting everywhere inside Cobalion. Maybe he'd even be willing to accompany you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked him that, and he agreed, if a bit absent-mindedly. \"There are a lot of places I think you'd be interested on, and as your host, it's my duty to make sure you're content. Follow me\" he walked towards a short passageway to the side, ending on a small flat disc inside a narrow tube. \"This will take us anywhere. It's convenient to travel through the arteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were a Vaporeon I'm sure you'd like a place where you can relax with water, don't you? I have prepared a place like that already\" the disc started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feigned excitement. \"Thanks! I'm sure it'll be great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have prepared more places for you once I know what you're interested in. It'll take a few minutes to arrive where we're going now, so in the meantime why don't you tell me about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what kind of places and organs you'd like to visit. You can also tell me what you'd want to avoid, and I'll help you steer clear from anything you don't want. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like reasonable questions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHmmm...about that,\u201d you paused in thought, \u201cI was wondering if you have more places where I can enjoy things like stores, malls, and entertainment stuffs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting choice\u2026. but it\u2019s not something difficult to create,\u201d the Pokemon said, \u201cYou seemed quite curious about humans, aren't you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion looked at you with with a raised eyebrow, eager for an answer. You closed your eyes and did your best to come up with a believable story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I was a wild Pokemon who was relatively isolated, I never had any real contact with humans outside of the little information I\u2019ve gleaned from other Pokemons who ventured into their cities and saw their lifestyle. I was told how their cities glowed at night with bustling activities. There were places called \u2018malls\u2019 where you can get almost anything you want if you look around. Besides malls, there are also places where you play games with others, and locations that offer to satisfy your personal needs\u2026. I'm fascinated by the description of these things and wanted to experience them myself. Sort of ironic considering what Dialga turned me into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I know about some of your likes, what kind of situation you would rather not deal with?\u201d Cobalion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything to do with mind probing or experiment would be a big nono. After my experience with Dialga\u2019s obsession about preparing me for the legend, I hopefully do not want to be subject to mind reading or altering influence without consent,\u201d you said with emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour interests and concerns have been noted. You have my words that no harmful or intrusive things will come to you during your stay,\u201d he reassured you, \u201cFor now, we are going to the Aquatic Resting Area. Step on board.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nCobalion tactfully guided your ride through his capillaries and narrow veins at a lightning speed.  Along the way, you caught sight of other stops that you potentially visit. But you are moving too fast for you to read the signposts. For now, you are clinging onto Cobalion\u2019s front hooves for dear life as the ride gets bumpy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the you\u2019ve must have transverse the entire circulatory system before the disc stopped at your destination. The platform stopped at the entrance of what resembles a water park beyond your imaginations. There are multiple type of slides and terrain for you to enjoy yourself in. Majestic white arches stretch from one end of the chamber to the other. There are two dozen or so pools of various colors spread across the area. At the center of the park is a thundering waterfall about 100 ft high casts down from an opening in the ceiling, tumbling into a large, deep pool at the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, Vaporeon. The aquatic resting area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, this is impressive! Might I ask where do you get all these water from? They aren't from you-know-where, are they?\u201d you asked half-jokongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to worry about the water source, Vaporeon. These waters were redirected from a separate water storage unit,\u201d Cobalion explained, \u201cHowever, converting to the form see here is a very labor intensive process as you should know as a Water Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to Cobalion go on with great pride into very technical aspects of the process of how he made this place, using terms and pronunciations that don't exist in the human language. Something about conversions, mixing, and distilling. You felt grateful that you won't have to know any of those technical stuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the stag carries himself on in his explanation, you turned your attention on the honeycomb layout of colored pools around the main pool. Within each of them, water jets churned and bubbled giving them the appearance of hot tubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mean to interrupt you, Cobalion, but what's with all the colored pools over there,\u201d you pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion stopped his lecturing mid sentence and looked at what caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I got carried off by my little technical lecture,\u201d Cobalion said apologetically, \u201cThose are pools that I have made especially for this occasion. Each of them contains the distilled essence of natural elements found throughout our world. Each is designed to make you relax a specific part of your being. For example, the yellow one allows you to feel the flow of electricity through your body while the purple one allows you to cleanse your mind by experiencing the natural aroma of herbs. Especially in your case, I believe that you will find the large pool with water jets particularly to your liking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sure looks enjoyable,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m quite happy that you are liking it. Won't you give it a try now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Cobalion\u2019s suggestion, you went on to try several of the pools which you enjoyed greatly. You got to try pools that smelled of various herbal aroma, one that Cobalion said was deep sea water he got from Kyogre. You especially enjoyed the pool that has a mild electricity current running through it. The tingling sensation dulled the muscle ache you have accumulated. All in all, a very relaxing experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion sat beside the pool, watching you enjoy yourself, which brought a smile on his otherwise stoic face. Seeing that everything looks fine, the stag shifted his consciousness from his representation to the real world.<br>\r\n___<br>\r\nOutside, Cobalion looked at Virizion tending a blushing Keldeo beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooom\u2026 stop you don't have to do this,\u201d he said with an annoyed grunt. But Virizion simply ignored him and continued licking and grooming him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, Keldy you don't have to be embarrassed about this,\u201d Virizion said sweetly, \u201cIsn't this how you've always liked it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that was years ago, mom. And uncle Cobalion is watching. How am I supposed to become a Swords of Justice if he sees me like this,\u201d Keldeo argued as his muzzle blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing grumpy again? You never change, Keldy. You may be on your way to join our league but you are still required to let me clean you tonight. Like I always do,\u201d Virizion sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOOOOOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo sighed grumpily and resigned himself to Virizion\u2019s gentle grooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion smiled gently at the sight before him while the colt looked at him pleadingly to get him out of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun has long since set and the twilight is slowly fading as well. The scene is peaceful and serene as it can be, however a slew of questions brewed in the stag\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dialga never seem to talk of this \u201chuman\u201d as a Pokemon. What\u2019s also stranfe is how Vaporeon seemed so insistent on no mind probing and his unusual interest in human things?...Something doesn't feel right. I\u2019m getting the feeling that someone is not honest with me. Palkia could be the key to the other half of this story,</i> Cobalion thought as he opened a chat app.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sank into the waters of the pool you were in, relaxing. You could get used to this kind of thing, you thought. There was something about Cobalion's body that was miles above anything you had experienced so far, and much to your surprise you found yourself hoping to see more. The fact he was compliant and truthfully wanted you to relax and enjoy his insides was also good. Dialga had turned himself into a lot of tests, Raikou was welcoming but didn't go out of his way to do anything for you, and Keldeo was too inexperienced. Compared to them, Cobalion was a welcome change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at him, he was staring forward, a bit blankly. You thought he must be doing something outside, you felt some unease. You knew this hospitality could turn against you if you said something you shouldn't, and while Cobalion had a lot of patience, by now you were painfully aware he hated lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I'm overthinking this\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in contact with Palkia took no time. He didn't seem to be busy, the replies arrived immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about Dialga's recent actions?\" a direct question seemed like the best way to deal with this. The celerity in Palkia's replies showed he wasn't trying to deceive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard about them, but I don't know that much. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you aware he has tormented a Pokemon by reducing them and transforming them into a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a new one. I knew about a human, but I didn't hear about that part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So he's not aware of what Dialga has done.</i> It was disappointing, as Cobalion hoped he could get more information, but since Palkia and Dialga were in rather similar status in the big and complicated legendary community, Cobalion thought informing him now would be good. He said everything he knew, Palkia didn't reply until he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm pretty sure he was always a human\" <i>What?</i> That wasn't what he expected. Palkia's words continued appearing on the chat app. \"His size was an accident, I swear, I was getting some fruit for Dialga and looks like the human was caught in that all, but I'm sure I didn't transform them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm working on fixing that, okay? I know I caused him a lot of trouble, what with everything Dialga did to him, but I'm working on how to return him to his normal size. I promise I'll do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I think that's all I needed to hear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was it. No wonder it didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cobalion explained to Palkia the lies you and Keldeo had weaved, you got out of the pool, soaking wet. It was kind of uncomfortable, but given how pleasantly warm it was inside Cobalion, you hoped you'd be dry after a while. \"I'm ready to go to the next place\" you said to Cobalion. The representation nodded, a bit absent, but stood up and moved rather stiffly towards a passageway. You followed him. Cobalion wasn't looking at you, just staring straight ahead with an odd expression. \"Is everything okay?\" You didn't get a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time walking, you reached an expanse. Although the sign proudly said it was Cobalion City, to you it looked more like a town, a very interesting and detailed town. It seemed like you and the representation beside you were the only residents, but you knew there would be surprised somewhere in here. \"This looks amazing\" you praised, still receiving no reply. You looked at Cobalion for a second, he was looking at a building that resembled a Pokemon Center. \"Should I go in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do\" he said. The air around you warmed up a bit, you thought it was him trying to help you dry up. Not suspecting anything, you enter the building, immediately finding the inside was much smaller and emptier than you thought it'd be, there was nothing but four empty walls. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, the door disappeared, turning into bars of some resistant material. You grabbed them. \"Cobalion, what's going on?\" Whatever it was, you were sure it couldn't be good. Cobalion glared at you from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hole formed, encompassing all of the floor in the room. The only place you had to stand was right under your feet, you couldn't move from where you were. You didn't know where the hole led, but you didn't want to find out, anyway. Despite the danger, you couldn't avoid wondering something: Cobalion had remarked that if you had lied to him, he wouldn't hesitate to punish you and get you out of his body immediately. What was he waiting for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was lying! He was never a Pokemon, I have a human inside me right now!\" Cobalion was shouting outside, upset by finding out just how much Keldeo and the human had lied to him. Keldeo, underneath Virizion's care, could only look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it does sound like part of what he said is true, Dialga did misbehave in such a grave manner\" Virizion pointed out. She sounded just as angry as Cobalion, but at least she was refraining from rushing to conclusions. \"What's the human doing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have him cornered. In a moment I'll get rid of him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can't do that!\" Keldeo protested \"Don't hurt him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt him, I just want him out of me!\" Cobalion approached Keldeo \"He lied to you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...most of the lies were my idea\" Keldeo admitted. When he was told to explain, he added: \"I knew this'd happen if you knew he was a human. Uncle, he needs help, and we are the Swords of Justice, we exist to protect those who need our help! It doesn't matter he's human, he needs our help and protection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lied, I can't just accept that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like any of this more than you, but we have to accept it\" Virizion admitted begrudgingly \"It is true we may not have seem like we'd have listened to him if we had known the truth all along\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it'd be a waste to undo everything you prepared, right? Please give him a chance, I'm sure he'll be a good guest!\" Keldeo pleaded. Cobalion looked at the ground. He'd have immediately gotten rid of the human, but he had decided to tell Virizion first, so she wouldn't be mislead just like he had been. It hadn't gone as planned, they wanted him to keep the human safe inside him, treat him like a guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be hard to accept, but he had to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides I know you're very into having someone inside you. You're going to find it fun, Cobalion\" Virizion said, daring to smile a bit \"Don't pretend you won't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I find fun is none of your concern\" Cobalion said bluntly, and turned around to leave. He'd leave up to Virizion scolding Keldeo for lying to them so much, right now he had to deal with the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince throwing him out wasn't an option anymore, he had to make sure he understood who was the boss here, lay some basic rules, and tell him to behave. He was already intimidated by the place he was standing at right now, surely the human would be willing to listen, even if it was out of fear. Afterwards maybe he could give him a break. Virizion was right, it'd be wasteful not to use the city he had just created.</span></div></div>",

The gaping abyss looked certain to claim you at any moment Cobalion wills it. At the other side of the sturdy bars, his representation loomed tall over you. Cobalion\u2019s face darkened as he continuously glared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis little charade has gone on for long enough,\u201d Cobalion remarked coldly, \u201c\u2018Vaporeon\u2019... or should I say\u2026 human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion\u2019s eyes glowed disapprovingly as he continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've spoken with Palkia earlier and he told me you were shrunk as the result of an accident on his part; a human who was merely in the woods at the wrong time and moment. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd through a series of events involving numerous actors, made your way here,\u201d Cobalion said with a frown, \u201cTell me... Why didn't you tell me that you are a human?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to open your mouth but was stopped when the stag raised his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you answer me, I don't want any excuses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid\u2026,\u201d you slowly speak up, \u201cI didn't think you would be as willing to help me if you know that I'm a human. Keldeo told me how you have serious misgivings about my species. I thought that being a \u2018Pokemon\u2019 can make things less troublesome for myself. I don't want to be placed under similar situations I endured with Dialga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can empathize with your situation but that doesn't make the fact that you lied to me any less reprehensible,\u201d the stag stated firmly, \u201cDo you remember the consequences I told you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. I am to be expelled from your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had intended to keep that promise. But.... Virizion didn\u2019t like the idea of you being thrown out to fend for yourself. As did Keldeo,\u201d the stag said begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion closed his eyes and weighed the choices he had. Within his mind, Keldeo\u2019s plea to keep the human safe and his own inner voice\u2019s argument to carry out his own promise played over and over again in a mental tug of war. <i> <b>There is an obligation to protect the human.</b> It'd be easier to keep the human out of the equation. <b>But he lied to protect himself.</b> Lying is not the right way. <b>Neither is leaving the human out in the wood with imminent dangers.</b></i> The stag opened his eyes and looked back at the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are permitted to stay, human.....\u201d Cobalion said sternly, \u201cBut you will bear responsibility for your actions. I am imposing new rules for you. Read it carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of translucent membrane with neon blue text materialized in front of you.<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, <b>Cobalion</b>, Leader of the Swords of Justice, hereby imposed this contract upon you, the human, as a consequence for your untruths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now considered to be under \u2018probationary\u2019 status as determined by Cobalion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will be subject to the following restrictions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--You are to stay within Cobalion City unless authorized to travel elsewhere in your Host\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--A curfew will be in effect. You are required to return to you assigned room before the curfew start time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Your behavior will be monitored throughout each day for evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--More representations of your Host will be positioned throughout the city in various roles, which will act as a simulation of a functioning city. You are to interact with them as part of your probationary training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--The amenities you can access will be increased or reduced based on the above behavioral evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--This probationary status can only be ended by your Host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a part of this agreement, you are also required to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Attend remedial sessions organized by your Host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Participate in work service around the city as assigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Maintain an honest atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, the human, hereby agree to abide by the rules as laid out above by the Host and understand that any violation of the above rules will subject me to punishments as deemed appropriate by the Host up to and including detention in a jail cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignature <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________</span><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the contract again and again. Despite being placed under probationary status, it's far better than getting outright expelled and having to deal with Dialga on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly signed it then turn it over to Cobalion, who made the prison bars dissolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA word of advice. Letting you stay is not an indication that I have forgiven you. Don't you forget that,\u201d reminded Cobalion.<br>\r\n______<br>\r\nYou and the stag made your way back out into the city and saw that the streets and stores are now filled with other Cobalion representations of various sizes and colors going about their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon led you to a 5-story building a few blocks away from the prison. The exterior has been colored cobalt blue like your host\u2019s fur. After leading you through the front door, Cobalion took you to the second floor, where he directed you to another door.<br>\r\nYou are shown a modest room with a single bed, a bathroom, a computer-like device, and a window that allowed you to view the busy thoroughfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where you will be staying during your probationary period. Get some rest. I will be making arrangements for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\nCobalion caught sight of Keldeo sitting  alone by a tree, still hanging his head in shame. Virizion had left him to think alone after giving what was likely a severe admonition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeldeo.\u201d Cobalion called, prompting the colt to look up.  A remorseful expression formed upon his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle\u2026I'm sorry,\u201d Keldeo said, his voice cracking, \u201cI know you've taught me better than to lie to you. I really thought that it was in the human\u2019s best interest. I didn't want him to be in any danger especially after what he told me Dialga did to him\u2026.Did you expel him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm keeping him. But he is under probation with numerous restrictions,\u201d Cobalion disclosed, \u201cKeldeo, we have to talk about what you did and the punishment you will be facing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the word punishment, Keldeo grew pale and a little light-headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you...planning to revoke my Sword of Justice candidacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion looked at Keldeo, who is on the verge of crying. Though he is still mad at him for making up this entire deception, Cobalion felt that his colt has a point about their obligations as Sword holders to protect anyone under their care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Keldeo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Cobalion said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not?\u201d said Keldeo, a little surprised at his Uncle\u2019s decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are still a candidate to become a full member. However, because you had planned to lie together with the human, you will be suspended from participating in training activity relating to your candidacy until further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo\u2019s ears dropped upon learning that he can't continue his training anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now? Being a Sword of Justice is all I ever wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can stay with the human during his probationary period if you like,\u201d Cobalion said, \u201cYou two can learn some things from one another.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleep comes rather easily to you, when you wake up the next morning you find yourself well rested. You look around, a bit disappointed. It wasn't a bad place to stay, but compared to the room Cobalion had showed you when you had first arrived it felt lacking. To think if you had told the truth or kept the charade a bit further you could have spent the night there...although it was also likely if you had told the truth from the start you wouldn't be inside Cobalion in the first place. It was for the better all those lies existed, if only because it meant you wouldn't be inside Keldeo, not knowing if the colt would be able to keep you safe without hurting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you step out of the building you were at, you found the streets were almost empty. A few representations of your host were already walking down the street, when you passed nearby they looked at you with what seemed to you like disdain. Right, if they were all connected to Cobalion it was to be expected none of them would be too happy with you. You ignored them the best you could, and walked until you reached a small park with an active fountain in the center. You gazed into the crystalline water, wondering what you'd do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously obeying Cobalion's restrictions was the right thing to do. You didn't want to anger your host, and even if he wasn't going to throw you out of his body, you didn't want to spend your days in a prison cell. You didn't doubt this city he made for you would have a lot of amenities, but you wished you could see more of his body. After being in three different Pokemon before this one, you were curious how Cobalion was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a familiar voice behind you, when you turned around you saw Keldeo, running towards you. \"Keldeo? What are you doing here? Is Cobalion punishing you too?\" You extended a hand and lightly touched his head. It felt more real than his projection in his own body had felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I came here because I wanted to. I...\" his ears dropped \"I was punished, but this is completely different. He suggested I could be here while you're inside him, and I thought that was fine because I wanted to apologize\" he said \"If I hadn't lied he wouldn't have been angry with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize, I lied to him too\" You didn't mention how that would be good \"Wait, this isn't a projection, this is really you?\" When Keldeo nodded, you said: \"Then you shrunk too! Why can't anyone return me to my size, you all keep changing sizes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palkia did it, he accidentally used his spatial powers on you. We don't know what'd happen if someone who isn't him tried to return you to normal\" he explained, looking around. There was wonder in his eyes. \"So this is how it's like inside Cobalion...I had never been here before! To think I'm inside the body of another Pokemon is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be fun sometimes\" you said. Keldeo walked around the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in probationary period like you, I think I can go anywhere I want in Uncle's body. There are so many places and organs to see!\" he paused \"Maybe if you're with me and I keep an eye on you he'll allow you to walk outside of the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms. \"I doubt that. He was really angry with me, I don't think he'd ever let me out of this city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's strict but he's not so bad. If you're respectful he'll be more forgiving\" Keldeo was rather excited at the thought of exploring Cobalion's insides \"I think I'd be the one to say where to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already making plans as if he already gave you permission, you're getting ahead of yourself\" you wished it was true, but Cobalion had the last word on that regard, no matter how much Keldeo planned and talked. \"What kind of places you'd like to explore, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Keldeo could answer, Cobalion's voice rang all around you. It seemed like it wasn't a projection talking. \"Human, the arrangements have been finished. Come to your first remedial session\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First?\" Keldeo looked up towards the roof of the chamber, far above your heads. \"You're really in trouble if it's more than one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I just hope it won't be as bad as you just made it sound\" you said, walking out of the park. After a moment of hesitation, Keldeo followed you. You couldn't avoid wondering what exactly Cobalion meant with remedial session.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhere do I need to go to get started then?\u201d you asked in the direction of the vast ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Remediation Center is located a few blocks from the park you\u2019re in. You will get further information from me once you get there,\u201d Cobalion\u2019s voice boomed, \u201cI am expecting you to honor your commitments as stipulated, human. Unless, of course\u2026 you preferred the alternative I mentioned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stern warning is enough for you and Keldeo to get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sign with \u201cRemediation Center\u201d conveniently located at the park exit guided you south toward a bustling street lined with numerous shops, game corners and restaurants. You spotted stores that are supplied with clothing, stationery, toys, and virtually anything you could think of. There is even what looks like a Pokemon Battle Stadium in the distance. You couldn't help but wonder how Cobalion know so much about human technologies. But with newly imposed restrictions by your host, you aren't going to explore any place any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local populace of Cobalion were going about their day, scurrying along busy crosswalks past you and Keldeo. You noticed that many of the younger looking stags were preoccupied with their Pokedex-like devices, fidgeting at the screen awkwardly with their hooves. Many others are simply enjoying their day at one of the many roadside restaurants, sipping at their drinks and indulging in snacks of berries and fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour presence seemed to have elicited more than a few looks from these residents, especially the young fawns who surrounded and observed the both of you with wide, curious eyes. Despite their cordial demeanor, you get the unsettling feeling that they are primarily here to keep a close tab on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried putting that discomfort on the back-burner and decided to ask Keldeo something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeldeo, about this remedial session, can you tell me what is it exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026,\u201d the colt trailed off, \u201cI was a bit of a mischief maker back when I was a foal and frequently got myself into more troubles than other Swords of Justice could handle. I pulled dangerous pranks, got into trouble with other Legendaries, talked back when I didn\u2019t get my way, and on more than one occasion attempted to challenge Kyurem alone, much to Uncle\u2019s horror. After Virizion and Terrakion had a discussion with Cobalion about my lack of self-discipline, he devised the Remedial Session. For every act of recklessness or wrongdoing, I would get certain freedoms restricted and will be required to attend lessons or serve any appropriate punishments.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Keldeo continued to describe some his misadventures and what punishments Cobalion meted out each time. Each one seemed more elaborate and bold than the previous one. You listened with interest as the Pokemon told other stories like being made to carry rocks on his back for the entire day for interfering with Terrakion's Boulder Balance training and that another time when he used his newly learned move Water Jet on every unsuspecting Pokemon he met and later had to attend a long, boring lecture about responsible use of his power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the heaviness of your current plight, you still managed to smile at least once or twice through some of Keldeo\u2019s anecdotes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds an awful lot like being under school detention and having to attend classes to address your problems,\u201d you remarked, \u201cI think I can relate to that to some degrees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what you mean by \u2018school detention\u2019 but it must have provided you with strong incentives to improve yourself,\u201d the colt tilted his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sure did,\u201d you said a bit longingly, \u201cPerhaps a little too often... Anyways, do you know what kind of Remedial Session I\u2019ll receive for lying to him? You said something about me really being in trouble when I have to go through more than one session.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t have an answer for that. Lying has always been on the top of the worst offenses list for my Uncle. If he requires more than one session, my guess is that he has a lot to talk to you about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too reassuring,\u201d you uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be too worried. He can be stern and firm, but he won\u2019t go to the point of getting you hurt. Come on, let\u2019s not keep Uncle Cobalion waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nearly seven-block walk down the street, you stopped at a dark blue building that is located at the very edge of town. In contrast with its more vibrant locale, the 8-story tower has narrow windows and austere facade that only drives home the message that the place means business. The local Cobalions are conspicuously missing around this area, leaving the place barren and quiet. The sign \u201cRemediation Center\u201d that looms over the entrance in bold lettering is the only indication of the purpose of this building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are\u2026\u201d you whispered quietly at Keldeo who looked nervously at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.I never seen this before...my sessions were usually outdoors or caves...\u201c the colt managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Keldeo quietly walked up to a set of stairs leading up to a set of tall, metalwork doors. emblazoned with a pair of Cobalion holding up an large sun disk. Beneath the figures is a banner that reads:<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><b><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">\u201cWITHIN THESE DOORS ARE THE ANSWERS YOU NEED\u201d</span></b></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors led you two into a two-floor lobby that was mostly covered in a dark blue marble-like material from ceiling to the floor. It was a mostly featureless chamber except for the long staircase where Cobalion\u2019s representation was waiting for you. The steely expression on his face only made you more anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been waiting for you, human,\u201d Cobalion said stoically, \u201cAll preparation for your Remedial Session is complete. Now, come with me...both you and Keldeo. We will be discussing the details of your tasks.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe stag escorted the two of you up the stairs, through a rather long hallway, and into a chamber that was set up as a meeting room. There was a long desk and three chairs that incorporate many features of Cobalion into their aesthetics. You also noticed two of the Pokedex-like devices that you saw earlier in town on the desk. There is a large screen at one end of the room that displayed the agenda to be discussed by Cobalion: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><i>Remedial Session No.1: An Introduction</i></b></font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"> Attendees: 2</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">An outline of the deception by Keldeo and the human and the recommended solution.</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take your seats. The session is about to begin,\" Cobalion reminded.<br>\r\n</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your earlier assessment of what Cobalion's sessions entailed turned out to be more accurate than you thought they'd be. When you sat down, the fleeting thought you had is that it really was like a school detention. You managed to hold back a smile, because Cobalion surely would have taken badly if you had looked like you weren't taking this seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, the letters vanished, replaced with an empty bullet point list. You had a feeling all of your crimes against Cobalion and justice were about to be displayed. \"I'm sure you two understand already you have committed some grave transgressions. I'm not going to insult your intelligence by saying the obvious, but I will make you unwilling to be dishonest towards me or anyone else again\" The bullet point list divided into two separate lists, and two names appeared on top of each one: 'Human' and 'Keldeo'. You noted with some nervousness yours was at least triple as long as Keldeo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list was succinct but largely accurate. Keldeo had notes along the lines of 'lying to his superiors' and 'placing himself in danger'. Grave stuff on its own right, but not as bad as some of the ones that appeared under your header. 'Bringing danger to the Swords of Justice' 'Getting several Legendaries involved' 'Lying in order to gain protection' 'Invasion of another Pokemon's body'. It almost made you sound like the bad guy instead of someone who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. The indignation bubbled inside you, you managed to repress it to avoid saying something you shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo had less restraint, though. Although he politely requested attention, he said: \"He was scared...that makes it less grave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo, I may not like humans, but I'm firmly on the side of justice. I wouldn't be a member of this group if I wasn't\" Cobalion said with pride. He said it with such vehemency you felt foolish for not telling him the truth from the start. You lowered your eyes as Cobalion started lecturing you and Keldeo about the importance of honesty and trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it any other occassion you would have fallen asleep from such a lecture, it was as if Cobalion had a rather charismatic appeal that prompted you to listen no matter what. You listened to every word of his lecture, without spacing out. \"Trusting others can be difficult, but when there's reason to trust them and you know it, there's no reason to lie to them and put yourself and others in jeopardy\" Cobalion was saying. You felt those parts were directed more at Keldeo than to you. After twenty minutes of continuous lecturing, you saw the Pokedex device light up. It seemed to have some sort of word processor installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point here is that you can trust me. As such, I want you to show me your trust by telling me every detail of what happened. Don't omit <i>anything</i>, understood?\" he remarked that with a lot of emphasis, and added in a much softer manner: \"I won't judge anything you say. Simple write everything you know and remember, and trust I will be impartial\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uncle Cobalion, I don't know how to write\" Keldeo said, tapping the Pokedex device a few times. It did seem a tad difficult to type with hoofs on such a small screen. You had an easier time, so while Cobalion adjusted the device so Keldeo could type with ease, you started with your own tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery detail you remembered was added. How at first it seemed like Dialga would keep you safe, how he slowly turned you into a test subject, every detail of what you experienced, how Suicune and Raikou got involved, how you escaped with them and entered Raikou's body, everything you explored and saw inside Raikou, how you were taken to Keldeo, and your brief stay inside the colt. Soon you were absorbed into the extensive story, focused on writing as much as possible. You wanted to ensure Cobalion wouldn't be able to ever say again you hid anything from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finished after half an hour. To your side, Keldeo was still working, with a look of concentration, and at a slower rate than you. \"Good luck\" you said, patting Keldeo's head through the mane. Keldeo nuzzled his head by instinct against your hand before he realized it and forced himself to continue writing. Hoping this was going to be enough, you passed the device to Cobalion. \"I'm done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know everything you typed. I read it while you were writing\" the projection in front of you admitted. He was looking at you with a curious mixture of pity and authority. Maybe your story did appeal to his sense of justice. Behind him, the screen gained several new sections. \"Based on everything you and Keldeo have said, I have made an outline of the remaining sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy recommended solution is to undergo all of them, to establish the necessary relationship of trust and authority we require between us three. It will take a couple days, but once you're finished I believe we will tolerate each other enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b>Remedial Session No 1: An Introduction.</b> Attendees: 2. An outline of the deception by Keldeo and the human and the recommended solution.<br>\r\n<b>Remedial Session No 2: Authority. </b>Attendees: 1. Community work throughout the city. (Only for human)<br>\r\n<i>Rest for the Night - including a casual meeting with your host</i><br>\r\n<b>Remedial Session No 3: Teamwork.</b> Attendees: 2. Work together to navigate a route in the circulatory system</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I judge more is needed in the future, I shall leave this open\" he looked at you. \"Let's get started with your second session\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Community work...?\" you left the room with Cobalion, leaving Keldeo behind to continue typing. You wondered if while you were working he'd meet you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to walk through the city. You will pick up trash, do menial favors for those who need it, and report any parts of the city that look strange\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrows. \"Let me see if I got this straight: you created this city and its inhabitants. Will you also create trash for everyone here to start throwing around for me to pick up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen put like that it was silly, and Cobalion didn't want to admit it. He limited himself to nodding, trying his hardest not to break the rigid stare he had towards you. \"It is a necessary part of your lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. What's that about reporting any parts that look strange? I thought you had a perfect control of everything you made\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...of course I do!\" his rigid stare broke, like he had something to prove. \"I can control everything inside me perfectly, I even could make the most unpleasant points in my body be so appealing to you you'll want to return as much as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\" you needled him, pleased he had dropped the hard jailer attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to prove it then I will! You, Keldeo and I are going to meet tonight, remember? I will prove to you I have perfect control of everything in my body\" he claimed. Now that he thought about it... \"It also could be a good lesson for Keldeo. He would see what kind of thing he could do once he mastered control over his insides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I be concerned this is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, as much as I don't like to admit it, you are a guest inside me. Not only that, Keldeo is also here. I would never make my guest and my student undergo something unpleasant for no reason. If something ever happens it will be because you or him brought it upon you, not because I felt like making you have a hard time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhat encouraging. You weren't sure if Cobalion would do the part about making something unpleasant change so much it would be unrecognizable, but you at least knew he would give you and Keldeo a moment to relax with him despite how cross he was with you. Besides, you had to trust him. He wanted you to trust him, then you would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Cobalions around you shoved a bag and a stick at you, while the one you had been talking to signaled with his head. \"You may start. Don't leave any trash untouched, human. Hard work is pivotal for learning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasy for you to say because you're not the one picking up the trash you yourself make. You thought, but started walking nonetheless, carrying the stick with you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMy representation over here will be supervising you through your community service,\u201d Cobalion said as he recovered his usual sternness, \"Do not think about slacking off while I'm away. Should I receive any reports of noncompliance, it will be the jail cell for you. Have I made myself clear, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded quietly without hesitation. Something within those eyes compelled you to answer in the affirmative regardless of how you really felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. I will be checking on Keldeo. I am expecting you not to disappoint me any further.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cobalion began making his way back to the Remediation Center, leaving you to the device of his clone beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like I have to take care of you at this point. Let's get started with the first thing on our list here,\u201d the representation said as he produced a checklist. In contrast to your host himself, this Cobalion spoke with a melodic Hoenn accent. Never have you imagined the stern and authoritative Cobalion could speak with such uncharacteristically posh voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where do you want me to start cleaning?... umm...\" you wondered how to address your new chaperone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Coby for distinction's sake,\" Coby gave you a slightly annoyed look, \"Come along now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are soon led by Coby to a part of the city that looked as though a storm went through it. The sidewalks were strewn with newspapers, bits and pieces of plastics, soda cans, and food containers. To add insult to the injury, there are also overturned garbage bins as well. Thankfully though, there isn\u2019t any rotting food or worse in the spilled contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a crowd of Cobalions standing by the sidewalk, frowning and whispering among themselves at the hideous sight. When those representations noticed you making your way through, their expressions only darkened and their hushed tone grew louder. You can hear the contempt and anger through their snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you the human who lied to our leader?\u2026,\" you heard one of them said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing here? Haven't this town been through enough?\" another growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't trust these so-called trainers, let alone a human! Why is our leader allowing him to stay?\" a dark red Cobalion gritted forcefully, \"If it were up to me, that human would have been long gone from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those remarks only made you even more uneasy about your community service, especially when you know that you will be working with these Pokemons at some point in the future. Coby did his best to ignore the crowd's animus and took you right into the worst part of the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, this should be a good place to start cleaning,\u201d Coby said while handing you a pair of protective gloves, \"If you do a decent job here, it might be a start to repairing your standing in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Coby sounded polite in contrast with the unwelcoming jeers from the crowd, you could tell that he more than likely agreed with their sentiments based on the tone of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly put on the gloves that Coby gave you and got to work. It wasn't particularly difficult but it was as monotonous as you imagined it would be. Using the spiked stick, you began piercing the paper wrappers and depositing them into the bag. Once a bag has been filled, you simply drop it off at the corner of the street. Every now and then, when you picked up a piece of those newspapers called the \"Icirrus Justice Press\", you would catch glimpses of the day's headline: <b>\"Human Guest on Probation. Ordered to Community Service. All Residents 'Encouraged' to Give Him Work.\"<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nFrom the snippets you managed to read as you toss the papers into your trash bag, the entire town has been ordered to assign work for you, whether it was in stores, restaurants, and other necessary miscellaneous tasks. But whoever wrote that article didn't agree with Cobalion's decision and presented you as dangerous being who is a threat to the well-being of the \"Swords of Justice\" and a bad influence on the upstart Keldeo. Even more upsetting and absurd, the article alleged that you are working for Dialga and other nefarious forces in a quest to usurp Arceus and get power for yourself. <i>No wonder the welcoming party I got here.</i> you thought as your picked through more trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, Coby silently watched you to ensure that you didn't slack off. The other representations watched on with hostility even when seeing how much you are working to improve their city and to make things right again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 40 minutes, you are drenched in sweat from collecting the countless cans and styrofoam boxes. There's already 3 large bags worth of trash and yet you barely cleaned up about \u00bc of the city block. It's only now that you noticed the artificial sun that hang high above the artificial sky. The scorching heat snugly hugged your body like a thick coat, worse than any windless summer day you can remember. If Cobalion wanted to make your community service as hard as it was memorable, then he has done a superb job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Coby's throat clearing behind you, causing to realize that your thoughts about the heat has stopped your from working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to get this wrapped up sooner, I suggest that you get back to doing your designated assignment,\" the representation chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope that Cobalion won't be too hard on Keldeo.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back to the center, Cobalion\u2019s expression turned into a frown as he mentally read through the colt\u2019s story. Although Keldeo has provided a fairly detailed summary about his initial interaction with the human, Cobalion found several gaping holes in the story, especially when it comes to Dialga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Keldeo, he was wandering through a nearby valley, anxious about an upcoming Swords of Justice training session. It was the same valley that Keldeo always stroll through when he felt overwhelmed by his practice. While he was trying to clear his mind, Dialga suddenly contacted him through Pokechat and introduced him to the human. While the exchange is mostly pleasantries and compliments, the familiarity indicates that it wasn't first time that Keldeo has spoken with him. The idea that his adoptive son has been in touch with the Temporal Pokemon without him knowing doesn't sit well with the stag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the same manic Pokemon that has threatened to find this human and subject him to who knows what. What have you gotten yourself into this time, Keldeo?</i> the stag sighed as he paced toward the Remediation Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo sat quietly at his desk as he waited for Cobalion to return. He heaved a sigh and looked at his screen and through the text he composed. Hopefully, his uncle will find his explanation to be sufficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the unmistakable sound of hoofsteps echoed down the hall, heading in the direction of the meeting room. Keldeo's heart began to pound faster as it came closer, dreading all the scenarios that could play out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion emerged through the doorway and turned his attention to Keldeo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have read through your story, Keldeo,\u201d the stag said as he walked into the room and approached the colt and sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wrote down everything the best I could remember, uncle,\u201d the colt answered as he felt Cobalion placed one of his large hooves on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\" Cobalion asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo could feel the thinly-concealed doubt in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yes\u2026...so\u2026 How's the human doing?\" Keldeo asked in an attempt to momentarily distract from the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display screen on the wall to switch to a surveillance camera of the town. Keldeo saw the human busy cleaning all the trash that has been left on the street while being closely supervised by one of his uncle's representations nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is doing a fine job\u2026 as I expected,\" Cobalion answered before switching the screen back to the bullet points he used earlier, \"But let's not stray from our topic now. I've read what you've written. There is something you are not telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked up and saw his uncle looking at him disapprovingly. He is not sure if it was his imagination playing with him, but Cobalion towered over him twice as much as he remembered. The Pokemon already felt the rivers of sweat forming beneath his coat and his legs trembling involuntarily. The discomfort he felt was skyrocketing to an unbearable level. Keldeo gulped and did the best he could and looked back with confidence (or what he thought it was) deeply into Cobalion's golden eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny reflections of his own face within them looked back with a mixture of hesitation and fear. Keldeo felt overwhelmed like an inexperienced foal rather than the Sword of Justice member he wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the first time you have been talking with Dialga, am I right?,\" the stag said calmly, noting how apprehensive Keldeo looked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo only nodded, uncertain about how he should tell his uncle about his first encounter with Dialga and what they talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo...if there is anything that you wanted to tell me, now is the time,\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cobalion knew he was known for being stern. Right now, he raelly wanted to dial that down, so Keldeo would tell him everything. Keldeo trusted him, that much was for certain, but the colt was still just, well, an inexperienced legendary Pokemon among beings that were hundreds, thousands of times his seniors. Intentionally or not, they may use Keldeo for their own goals and machinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga may have been one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'm not judging you. I simply want to know as much as possible about what's going on,\" Cobalion assured. It didn't seem like Keldeo felt reassured by that at all, but he could see in his nervous face that he was glad Cobalion was trying to be understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to do something about Dialga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet if I should,\" Cobalion admitted. \"For the time being just tell me how you met him. How long ago was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo sat down, recalling that moment. \"It was just a few months ago. I had gone exploring, trying to find someone to train with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe they had been a tad too permissive with Keldeo wandering around. Still, this wasn't the time for hindsight. Since there hadn't been any interruptions, Keldeo continued. The more he talked, the calmer he felt, like he was finally getting a weight off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing a rock wall was good exercise, and Keldeo was lucky he had agility and strength. The colt leaped from a small platform to another, slowly getting up the wall, towards a hill from where he'd be able to see everything in a range of miles! Maybe he should ask everyone to come and spend the day here. It'd be great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the hill wasn't as barren as he expected, though. Instead of rocks and dust, like he thought he'd find, there was a flat stone surface, clearly built from many stone blocks. Status flanked the edges of the plateau, looking towards places far away, and there even was a strange square structure on the far end of the plateau. Obviously Keldeo hadn't been the first Pokemon to reach this place, someone had come before and built some sort of temple. Curious, Keldeo trotted on the plateau, inching closer to the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a large block, nothing worth writing home about. Disappointed by how mundane that turned out to be, Keldeo turned around to leave, already thinking of how to bring up the existence of this structure to Cobalion, when he noticed he wasn't alone anymore. Instead, standing right on the center, was a rather large dragon. Metallic protrusions and shapes covered the dragon's body, giving it a rather impossing appearance, bringing to mind armors. Keldeo stared up at the dragon's head, trying to recall what this Pokemon was called. He was sure he had once been told who this was, but the name simply eluded him right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew times in his life Keldeo felt so small, and now this dragon bending its neck to take a closer look was going to get added to that list. Keldeo stepped back, nervous. \"I'm sorry if I'm trespassing. I had never been here before--!\" Keldeo hurried to apologize, hoping that'd be the end of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon seemed to have felt his unease, because he chuckled. It seemed like it was trying to be friendly. \"You're worrying too much. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Keldeo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dialga, the Pokemon who rules over time. You would do well in remembering my name,\" he said. Had he realized Keldeo hadn't known who he was. No, it had to be a coincidence, Keldeo hoped. Otherwise this was almost humiliating. \"I can see it -- your power, the unique life you'll have. You're a legendary Pokemon, if I'm not mistaken\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That's right,\" Keldeo sounded prouder about that. \"I'll join the Swords of Justice very soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga nodded. \"That's an excellent goal! I wish you the best of luck. If you'd like, I could help you. Would you like my help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to accept, he really did, but Keldeo was certain his elders in the Swords of Justice would be better teachers than anyone, even if it was Dialga. Still, he couldn't just say that! It'd be such a bad first impression. Instead, Keldeo bowed his head, surreptitiously keeping an eye on Dialga. \"No, thank you. I'd like to do this by myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it seemed Dialga wasn't happy, but he changed his expression quite quickly. Instead, he stepped aside, giving Keldeo space to move and leave the plateau. \"Don't worry, that's fine. Chase your dream by yourself, you'll do well. I just have one request, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo stopped, ready to listen to said request. Once Dialga was sure the colt was listening, he said, persuasive: \"Let's stay in contact. You show a lot of promise, and I'd like to see how you chase your dream. We can be friends, I can give you advice, and if you ever change your mind and you'd like me to help, then I'll be available anytime. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't too strange, lots of Pokemon had asked Keldeo and the other Swords of Justice to stay in contact. Once it was certain they'd be in contact, Keldeo finally was able to leave the plateau, returning to his day. Dialga stayed behind, impassive. Had Keldeo handled that well? He didn't know, and he sure didn't want to find out if he had offended Dialga at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the surface it seemed like a rather normal interaction. It was common for legendary Pokemon to help each other and be in contact, and had it been any other situation, Cobalion wouldn't have minded much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat bothered him was that, if Keldeo and the human were telling the truth, nobody should accept Dialga's help at all. Keldeo may have dodged a bullet back then. Putting a hoof on Keldeo's shoulder, he said: \"You did well in not accepting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the human may have accepted and all that happened to them is because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a possibility,\" Cobalion said. More like that was likely what happened! And in that case, then the human wasn't nearly as malicious as he thought they'd be. Perhaps they had misjudged everything...because he thought the human had to been hiding something? Cobalion knew he had to reevaluate his stance about the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo looked at Cobalion with assertiveness. It wasn't common for him to look so ready to confront anyone. \"You'll help the human, right? Uncle Cobalion, please, you have to help the human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sheltering them already. I can promise you I'll do my best to keep them safe,\" and he could do plenty, that much was for sure. Cobalion nudged Keldeo. \"Go, take a break. For the time being let's continue our scheduled plans. Then I'll evaluate if I should change my stance about the human and their problems\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to spend some 'quality time' with them. The real me, not copies I made to make them work. I'm sure they'll be grateful for that.\" they better be grateful. \"Go rest, tomorrow you and the human are going to have quite the adventure. You're going to need as much energy as possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what should he do with the human...? Cobalion had bragged about having the utmost control of his insides. That could be the way for him to impress the human and make them admit Cobalion was the best choice of host they could hope for -- and they wouldn't want to be inside anyone else until it was all over. And for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I need is to subvert their expectations,\" he decided. Cobalion had said he could make even unpleasant places inside him be so appealing the human would want to stick around, and now he was going to prove it. Evaluating his options, soon Cobalion focused on one of his stomachs. Being a stag, he had four stomachs to process his food, and usually a couple of them were organs he wouldn't want someone to visit. Not many would like to walk around in half-digested plants! That was it,  he was going to use one of his stomachs to impress the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should he do in there? He already had received the human with a lake when they entered his body. Perhaps an island, then? Tropical-looking, completely out of place inside a body? Cobalion felt a tad giddy at that thought. For some reason, he was looking forward to the human's reaction. He even felt tempted to make them witness how he finished the island, so they could be impressed properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really needed to stop being so proud of his internal skills, but he just couldn't!</span></div></div>",

He lowers his paw and waits for you to walk inside. You turn back to look at Keldeo one last time, He looks at you with a slight smile, You smile back and walk inside. Cobalion closes his mouth, and the sunlight disappears. You head for his throat and look down. This will be the 4th one you've jumped down.. and you hope it won't happen much more. \"Welcome to my body\" Cobalion said telepathically. You nod and are about to jump down when your new host interrupts you \"Theres an easier way\" he said. his throat vibrated a bit and fleshy steps formed a large spiral staircase. \"Thanks\" you say \"But jumping will be faster.\" Cobalion retracts them \"Ok, if you want.\" You took a deep breath and leapt into cobalions throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion looked down at Keldeo, who was looking up at his uncle worried. \"You needn't be afraid\" he said \"your friend will return when you are able to control your internal modification powers better.\" Cobalion turned \"Now come with me.\" Keldeo nodded as the colt walked along side his uncle, back towards their home. As they did you slid down cobalions throat and into his stomach. You use your time powers to slow yourself to a gentle stop, and see you landed on a pier, it would have overlooked a lake, but there was nothing there. This was good, it meant less of a smell. \"Welcome\" You nearly jumped as you turned to see cobalion had formed his own copy of himself like keldeo had. To your surpise, he wasn't that much bigger than you or keldeo. \"I see you have been able to use your temporal powers.\" cobalion said looking at him. \"That is impressive.\" \"So.. can we get out of the stomach?\" you ask \"yes\" cobalio<br>\r\nn said turning \"follow me vaporeon.\" You follow him. \"So, can I still talk with keldeo?\" you ask. \"Yes\" cobalion nodded leading you down a tunnel \"I will open telepathic links that will let you talk with him. of course nothing will be private since it has to go through my head first to get to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo and Cobalion returned to their cave \"So... is mom gonna be back soon?\" Keldeo asked a bit nervous \"I don't know.\" cobalion said as he lay down. Keldeo followed. \"Vaporeon has just asked me if you can still talk with him\" \"And?\" Keldeo looked hopeful \"You can. However I shall be monitoring everything.\" Keldeo smiled, but inside he groaned annoyed \"Alright I will open a connection\" You hear a noise, and soon the 3 of you share a telepathic link \"So.. why do you call him Vaporeon even though he looks so much like a human?\" Keldeo asked hoping it wasn't too sensitive. You honestly wondered that too. \"Keldeo...\" Cobalion sighed \"It is because the poor guy was a vaporeon to start. I mean if you suddenly became human, I wouldn't call you human, i'd still call you keldeo.\" \"Point taken\" Keldeo said. You nod, sigheing a little as youll have to get used to being called that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice chat with the two of them, Which had to remain casual, Cobalion finally lead you to the end of the tunnel \"Here, this is where you will stay during your time inside me.\" He said as he stepped inside. You looked around in wonder, Its fleshy, but has some metallic bits, considering cobalion is also a steel type. You see a large comfy bed, and a desk with a lamp. \"Since I don't expect you to stay for an extremely long amount of time before going back to Keldeo I'm only doing the basics.\" You nod. \"Thanks\" You said \"It is alright. I'm sure you've been through a lot Vaporeon. I can't believe Dialga would do something this extreme... it must have been difficult inside Keldeo when hes so inexperienced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. Cobalion?\" you ask nervous \"are you mad at Keldeo?\" Cobalion frowned \"I am disappointed that he was not immediately honest with us. He should have told us about you the moment you were sent into him. And mew should have told us ahead of time.\" \"Well.. the reason they didn't is because they were afraid youd immediately refuse to help.. because I'm human.. kinda.\" Cobalion shook his head. \"I am a sword of justice. I am willing to protect all pokemon, no matter what they look like. even ones that look human. And I will protect you to the best I can\" \"I see..\" you say nodding slowly. Then you think to yourself \"what if he found out I really was human... what would he do then?\" \"Anyway\" cobalion said interrupting your thoughts \"You must be hungry. Come, I'll show you to my food storage chamber\" A new tunnel opened up, and you walked through followed by cobalion.</span></div></div>",

The pins and pricks of the chestnut deep inside him prompted Raikou groan uncomfortably. Suddenly, an unexpected cold pinch nips his innards, causing his furry belly to seize\u00e2\u0080\u0094squishing inward like a squashed pillow. He felt the prickle of the chestnut surge forward and\u00e2\u0080\u0094wait. Raikou interrupted his own thoughts. He mentally reviewed the last few seconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0094remembering\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh. Raikou definitely heard something. Felt something. Deep below his belly, he heard the hollow groan of rusted metal. And felt the distinct snap of steel. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Raikou mouthed silently. He pieced the puzzle together. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh-ho-ho-noooo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moments before, you and Suicune were making good progress. You were scrunched up against its green-brown surface, shouldering it as you pushed it forward\u00e2\u0080\u0094your feet skidding across the catwalk. Suicune stood behind you, blasting it with Ice Beam after Ice Beam. A thin layer of frost had begun to grow on the chestnut shell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, despite Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sweltering heat. Suicune grumbled between blasts. She was muttering something. You listened closer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...I wonder how that bolt-brained idiot would like it if I missed a Beam or two\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spoke up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuicune, we need to get out of here fast. If you start messing around, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to slow us down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You glanced below at the swamp of scat that had already begun to encroach up on the catwalk. You happened to catch sight of Suicune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s furious expression out of the corner of your eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you just say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The water dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words sparked a nervous sweat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuicune\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a say of what I should and shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. If I want to give Raikou a little reminder of how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling right now, then I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An Ice Beam fires off dangerously close to your head, cooling the surface of the chestnut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think this dolt is itching for a cold snap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turned around just in time to see Suicune flash you a gritted-fang leer. She reared up her head, opened her mouth, and blasted out a white-blue frigid beam of ice. It rocketed through the gag-inducing air before crashing into his dark red fetid bowels, flash freezing a lump of scat that was gooped onto the wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Immediately, Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels surged inward in retaliation. Clenching in surprised pain, the waste-filled space shrunk, causing the river of scat below to surge upward\u00e2\u0080\u0094overtaking the catwalk at last. Poop piles onto the rusty walkway as you and Suicune did a futile dance, vying to keep your feet untarnished by the Legendary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radioactive scat. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help, however, as Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels continued to cave in. Suicune hopped unsteadily on her hind legs as you watched the tiger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stool scrunch up the intestinal wall\u00e2\u0080\u0094and begun to plummet down in a feculent avalanche.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You rushed to Suicune, diving under her belly before the muddy sewage crashed onto the catwalk, burying it under a mountain of sludge. Suicune was clobbered from behind, the mass of Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old meals smashing her to the ground\u00e2\u0080\u0094pinning her to the rusty floor and smothering you in her belly fur. The groan of old metal filled your ears as the catwalk heaved. It had begun to bend under the pounds of the stuff that had cooked in Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colon. Suicune uncharacteristically whimpered as the smelly yuck buried her. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spared some of the torture. Suicune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underbelly grants you a tiny air pocket.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another pained groan of iron. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>SNAP!</b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your heart free fell as you did. The catwalk collapsed under the pressure and weight of the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waste, sending you and an avalanche of horribleness careening to the sloppy ground. The green and brown floor rapidly grew closer. Your nose burned as you approached the septic sewage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>SPLAT!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Raikou hummed nervously as he twiddled his claws. The good news: the spiky chestnut shell was dislodged! The bad: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the entire ill-maintained \u00e2\u0080\u009ccolon catwalk\u00e2\u0080\u009d had collapsed. All of it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all sinking in sludge. And that means, well...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guts gave a wet grumble. His intestines splorted and glurked as his wet waste squashed through.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...Suicune was going to kill him!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panic set in. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave them in there! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way they could continue the route! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to swim\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he meant swim\u00e2\u0080\u0094up his bowels. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assuming they could even get back on route! Because, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels rumbled again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...He felt like there was a lot more coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Half-an-hour later, you were a smelly, unhappy camper. You were still pinned to the nasty ground by Suicune, who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even lift herself up with the ridiculous amount of scat that was piled up on her back. Worst of all, you were being baked into a log. You felt Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels knead you through the waste, pounding it into shape. Your prison was a slimy, muddy hell. You guessed the only reason Suicune didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a paw and smear your face in the swampy floor was that this was entirely her fault.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sensed yourself twist around the catacombs of Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels, snaking around the last corner and settling into the end of his end. Mushy horribleness dripped down over Suicune as his refuse squelched and squeezed. Suicune (and you too) hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dared to open your mouths, lest you invite some unwelcome guests. You could only grouse and bemoan as your log was dumped into the wretched depths of the thunder cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rectum.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your squalid surroundings jumped as you felt Raikou rise to his feet. First you heard a static crackle, but then you caught Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice\u00e2\u0080\u0094speaking naturally from the outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, uh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d He clicked his tongue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll systems are down. Intercom, monitor, ...walkway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suicune seethed above you, a growl bubbling deep in her throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the game isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over yet! Once I let you two out, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll, um, \u00e2\u0080\u0098improvise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suicune grunted a confused \u00e2\u0080\u009cmmphm!?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt the pounding of Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footsteps as he began walking out of the cave. He strolled to a grassy outcropping where he normally did his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You heard him take a deep breath before you perceived his bowels crush in. His bowels tightened and loosened in a rhythmic manner as his body began to void his waste\u00e2\u0080\u0094treating this load as nothing different. His colon mashed in, compressing the log of scat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in\u00e2\u0080\u0094squeezing you and Suicune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones as scat squeezed between the space of your fingers and underarms. You moved forward slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His rectum beared down again. You thought your ribs would pop as Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muscle pushed Suicune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight atop you, sinking you deeper in the body-warm mud. The Water-type writhed above, trying to fight which she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight, unwittingly smearing you into the stuff below.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guts mashed his much once more. You heard a dull plunk and a breathless, relieved sigh. It seemed Raikou took care of his chestnut problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Squish, squash, smosh.</i> You felt yourself driven forward. A curious pressure surrounded you momentarily\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if a muscled ring encircled your waist. You quickly realized that was exactly it. You were hanging halfway out the Electric-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tailhole. The daylight couldn't even reach you through the veneer of his scat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then\u00e2\u0080\u0094falling. You splattered on the ground, the fetid shell around you broke open. Daylight stung your eyes as both you and Suicune groaned\u00e2\u0080\u0094Raikou peering from above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suicune grimaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094Am going to kill you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cW-wait!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Raikou stuttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe game isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over yet! You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is the game still going!?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh, hold on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Raikou said as he scampered away. During his absence, you picked yourself out of his dung. Suicune was washing her self off, her legendarily pure water melted off the remnants of Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s butt-stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0094leaving her sparkling in moments. She shot you a pernicious look, but sighed and gestured for you to come closer. You did so and Suicune began the process of washing you off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Raikou returned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright! I know how we can continue this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He plonked his bottom in front of you. His paws crashed to your left and right. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Gross-Out Route goes from my intestines, to my bladder, to my testicles. We can still do that, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to get creative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You look up at Raikou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crotch and you can see where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going with this. His member was on full display. And it certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t before. When he left, did he\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 stroke himself off?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you insane?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suicune was baffled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another option. You could go back up my butt and try again form there. Technically I could eat you again, but I am not putting you two in my mouth! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care how clean you look right now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></span></div></div>",

'It's like he's keep-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights slowing your decent re-appeared as your mind blanked, yet again. '...what's up with my head?' you thought as you went to the Central Chamber. 'This headache just won't go away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga noticed with a tinge of worry the thought line you started going through, before blanking your mind. <i>It's happened again. That thought doesn't seem to want to leave. I can't keep altering his mind, especially if his subconscious is starting to notice the effect. How can I keep him from that trail of thinking?

I was fine a moment ago until...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's odd. Your thoughts just...stopped. Palkia said he wasn't able to return you to your normal size, you started feeling depressed, then...nothing. After that the headache started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I'm actually ill.' you think as you settle into your seat and resume watching the monitors. 'It would make sense, sort of. Me getting shrunk could have done something to me.' You rubbed your eyes as the throbbing intensified again. 'Seriously, I should go and see if there's something wrong. Aside from not being able to go back and meet them again...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes wavered from the monitor for a moment as Palkia's words re-entered your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this happened because of Palkia's misuse of it's power.

You've never had such awful headache before, at least not before you entered Dialga. Did this had something to do with that scanning that the Pokemon had perform when you first entered him? If so, why would he do this? There's nothing to gain from this... Or perhaps it's just an effect of you being stressed out by this dramatic change in your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm probably just over thinking and making connections where there are none, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting upright for the first time in half an hour, you are glad that the migraine did not return. You wanted to do exploring but the aftereffects of the headache took a big chunk of your energy out of you. There's pretty much nothing you could do except perhaps going back to the bedroom for some rest. But before that, you decided to ask Dialga about your headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dialga, I've been having this awful headache several times. I never had this before. I was wondering if you can do a checkup for me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah sure, why don't you head for the examination room. I can perform a health check for you,\" Dialga said telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The strange thing is, whenever these headaches occurred my mind was filled with weird thoughts that interfered with my thinking. And there's this feeling as if my mind is being drained. Do you know what could possibly cause such symptoms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga is getting a bit worried. The human is starting to question things. At this rate the human would figure out that he had been monitoring him the whole time. <i>How would he react if he knows the truth?</i>, Dialga thought. <i>He's gonna leave me and it'll all be ruined. My plan, the experiment, all down the drain.</i> Dialga mentally collected himself before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....not sure about that that,\" Dialga answered as naturally as possible, \"I'm not that knowledgeable about human physiology. But I can check if any 'time dilation' is interfering with the neurons of your brain. Lots of my organs generate temporal distort ions and they might have affected your brainwave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand a lot about all that but please do a checkup for me, will ya?\" you sighed, \"Where's this Examination Room you're talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow the blue glowing line I made, it'll take you there without you getting lost in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue line lit up on the metallic floor, directing you toward a doorway then a large hallway. You followed the line, hoping whatever is causing this throbbing pain can be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whew. That'll keep him distracted for some time. But the surveillance thing will still be exposed if no preventive measures are taken. I guess it's time to take mind surveillance to a new level. New program will include the ability to delete and implement memories, alter emotions, induce suggestions, and the ability to assume full body control of the human. Sorry trainer, but the interest of the Pokemon and my experiment still trumps your privacy.</i></span></div></div>",

You cannot even see it in its entirety due to its sheer size, possibly 300 feet high, completely obstructing your field of vision. The shady creature comes closer to you, seemingly hovering above the forest floor. That voice you heard a while ago has you startled. Without thinking, you cowered in fear, shutting your eyes tight, preparing for what about to come.To your surprise, your surrounding seem to brighten a little...maybe the behemoth creature before has left you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your eyes to see what has happened. Instead of seeing the forest, you saw flashes of 'red and white' markings in front of you. Bizarrely enough, in between all these colorful markings is a GIANT golden 'mirror'. It is highly polished and reflective, you can see yourself and the surrounding forest behind you in it. It is a beautiful sight. The mirror has a strange glowing and radiant pattern to it, alternating from brown to bright gold around a dark hole. The more you looked at it, the more you're mesmerized by it...How in the world can such majestic thing be in existence?, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my pretty eyes, don't you?\", a young female voice suddenly said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice made you fell off your feet. You take a good look again at that 'mirror' only to realize that it's actually an eye and it belongs to.....you can't believe it.......it's Latias, a rare legendary Pokemon that you've only heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there\", said Latias with a beaming face, \"You seem to enjoy my presence here, little creature. You look so lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm.... actually, I'm a human.\", you managed to blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look kinda.....small... for a human.\", said Latias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was shrunk in this forest, no idea what happened to me, I just randomly walked around here. Do you know anything going around here, Latias?\", you asked, \"Wait, I'm talking to a Pokemon. You can actually speak to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latias gave a another playful giggle and a big nudge on your small body: \"Actually, I have the ability to communicate with anything here, be it living things or inanimate objects. I just learned to read off your mind and use your knowledge to facilitate communication. And unfortunately, I don't know what happened to you, but I can offer my help since you have no idea of why you shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Latias' offer of help brightened you up almost immediately. Your ask Latias what kind of help can she offer you right now. The Latias gave you an even wider smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can learn to live within me...\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean 'within you?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently you don't know, legendary Pokemons have a long-kept secret: they all have an obsession with having something living within them, including me. If you ever wanted to enter me, you won't be affected by anything in my body. It'll be extremely comfortable and safe in there. And a plus, legendary Pokemons like to make their interior other-worldly, filled with stuffs that you won't find in an ordinary body system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to enter me and try it out?\", said Latias with a slight seductive tone.</span></div></div>",

I promise.\", said Latias, \"From this point on, you'll have to live in me until we can figure out how to make you normal again. During this time, you're free to do whatever you want in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it seems that you finally found some kind of \"shelter\" to stay in, you are still confused as to why are you caught in this situation? Something tells you that there must be something behind your shrinking, be it some supernatural forces or unexplained phenomenon. But, there is nothing you can do about it for now. You went on and on, thinking about what this whole shrinking event means for you. Suddenly, you heard Latias speaking to again and you snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well......What are you waiting for? Don't you want to get started and to fulfill my little fantasy?\", Latias asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm..yeah, I want to. It just that I'm still...unable to process this whole....turn of event. My mind is kinda 'exploding' from all the new information\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. But pondering isn't not going to solve your problem anytime soon. Plus, you're vulnerable at this size. So, why don't you just enter me and we'll figure out the rest later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Latias' assurance, you managed to give her a faint smile. Seeing that as a sign that you're ready, the Pokemon landed onto the ground and placed her head several feet in front of you. Then Latias opened her huge cavernous mouth and you are immediately greeted by humid air emanating from the her body. The Pokemon slowly stuck out her tongue for you to step on. You promptly stepped onto Latias' tongue, which is soft and moist when you touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eon Pokemon seems to sense you on her tongue so she gradually withdrew it back into her mouth. Latias closed her mouth and began to tilt her head. The interior of her mouth has become dark save for a few rays of light that shine through a narrow gap near her teeth. You felt Latias moving her tongues around you as if she is tasting you. You began to feel yourself slipping toward her gullet. Eventually, you went down toward her esophagus. You felt Latias' esophagus pushing you down toward your new home, the stomach. The expanding and contracting muscles around you provide you with a steady and comfortable movement downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, you landed in what could only be Latias' stomach. The stomach walls and floors around you are light pink. As you survey your new surrounding, you couldn't help but look at the massive size of her stomach. The huge size is most likely due to your shrunken state or did Latias has some kind of special power to make herself larger on the inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my stomach.\", you heard Latias said as she patted her belly in delight, \"You'll be safe in there and feel free to look around my body. I'll be flying up in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the soft floor of the stomach, thinking about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, What are you thinking about doing?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The windows, you could see a forest enviroment.  \"That is my \"Window vision\"  Latias said.  \"It allows you to see outside my body from any area of my body, just in case you want a view from high above.\"  She added.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look around your new environment curiously. You never know that such places could exist in Latias. Despite it being a little bizarre, you immediately took a strong liking to Latias' interior. You sit on your seat for several more minutes, blankly staring out the windows at the clouds and the sun. Then, you decided that you wanted to know even more about Latias, so you leave your comfy flesh seat and head toward the \"front.\" As you walked, you counted that there are a total of 5 rows of seats in this \"Viewing Room\" and each row can seat up to four people. It reminds you of a trans-ocean airship you took to get to Sinnoh about a year ago. 'I wonder why Latias would have such a place in her body.', you thought as you continue to explore your surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a minute or two, the room comes to an end and a sphincter opening is blocking your way forward. You noticed that there is a directional sign up front on the ceiling. The sign reads: <i>Flight Control</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's interesting', you thought, 'Might as well check out what that is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward to touch the constricted opening to see if there is a way of making it give way. The muscle feels soft to your touch. Then; as if Latias senses your presence, the opening gradually loosens and become large enough for you to pass through. You passed through the opening and find yourself about to go up an inclined passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make you way up the steep tunnel which is kind of exhausting. Eventually, you arrived at another closed opening. Just as you did with the first one, you touched it to let Latias know that you've arrived at your destination. As expected, the opening loosens up and you pass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in a small room. You notice that the room has an oval shape to it. Up front in the room, you found a seat made of soft tissues situated in between two large elliptical windows. From the windows, you can see that Latias is flying over the ocean, islands randomly dotting the seemingly calm waters. 'It looks like I'm in some kind of advanced cockpits.', you thought. You walked toward the seat and sit down on it. On the armrests of your seat, you spot two joystick-like controllers, presumably for controlling Latias. They are made of some flexible organic material. In the front of you, there is a small display showing the current speed and height. 'This is amazing', you thought, \"I wonder where am I in her body. But anyway, I can't wait to \"play\" with Latias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. This is the \"Flight Control\" room.\", you heard Latias said, \"This room is located in my head and My eyes will act as your windows here. In this room, you can try to fly me around as you wish. Before I can allow you to try out, let me give you a quick flight lesson. The two controllers on your seat controls the altitude and speed of my flight. Pushing down will bring you lower while pulling up will sent you higher. To make a turn, you just have to pull or push the controllers in opposite directions to the desired way. You will also have to keep an eye on the screen to maintain a safe flying height. If you need to leave the control for a while, please lock the controls and press the \"Self-operate\" icon on the display to give control of flying back to me. Then, you can just sit back and enjoy the sceneries I'm seeing. Well, that's about all. Hope you'll enjoy the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Latias gave you a playful giggle. You blushed a little, never really met a \"girl\" so enthusiastic and curious for you. 'Who wouldn't like such a lovely 'girl', and a legendary Pokemon at that.', you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look for a while at the control layout to familiarize yourself with the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only difference is that everything is made from flesh and the two round windows (her eyes) because you're in Latias. The small display before you has the height indicator, which reads 1,000 feet.  The speed indicator reads 85 Mph.  You also see that attitude of Latias is level. You grab a hold of the controller that controls Latias height.  You  push down and like Latias said, she started to descend.  You then pulled it back up and Latias leveled out.  You then pull up on the controller and again, like Latias said, she started to climb.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\"  You said to Latias.  Latias only giggled and said.  \"I though you would like it.\"  You then try your hand at the directional controller.  You turn left, but Latias goes right.  You then remembered, turn the controller in the opposite direction you want to go.  So you pulled left and sure enough, Latias turned right.  Then you saw something that caught your eye, and option that read \"Latias co-pilot.\"  You pondered for a moment and asked Latias what it was.  \"That allows me to project a hologram to fly with you.  It is one of many ways we can \"Personally\"  interact with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment, you finally decide to...</span></div></div>",

Looks like it's worth trying out.\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activated the \"Latias co-pilot\" by tapping on the option on the display. Immediately, an aura began to form on your right side and gradually, the shape of a virtual Latias appears. The virtual Pokemon gave a lovely smile and began to speak. She looks exactly like her real self but with a semi-transparent body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again, trainer. It seems that you like me to accompany you on my \"flight\", the holographic Latias said, This is a virtual representation of me created by my psychic power as an interface to interact with you when you are physically within me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", you said, \"I just want to talk to you more often and that flying with you is an life-changing experience for me. I never knew that you could have control mechanism in your body. I've read all about Pokemons and yet I never seen a book mention this kind of secrets. Is this some kind of hidden powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something similar. That's because each Pokemon has a well-kept secret: our bodies can be easily altered to accommodate our needs. In my case, I changed some parts of my body to allow you to live in me. This means that you can eat and sleep in here until we find out the reason to your shrinking.\", Latias explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hear the virtual Latias explaining things, you continue to pilot her, occasionally lowering her altitude and making turns left and right to have a closer look at mountains or the cities along the routes. You have absolutely no experience in flying, but yet, it seems so easy to control Latias. You feel Latias smoothly gliding through the clouds, listening to the turbulent 'whooshing' sounds of wind forces that envelops her body. From high above, everything below you looks significantly smaller; the land looks more like model maps you saw at the Sinnoh Museum. You  remained quiet for a least 10 minutes already. The quietness in the Flight Control room is further intensified by a silent Latias floating besides you. Then sensing the stiffness in the air, the Pokemon began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it beautiful?\", Latias asked softly, \"To be able to fly so freely up in the skies is probably something that you can only dream of. You don't get to see this kind of 'point-of-view' very often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...until I met you and started to pilot you around\", you said playfully, \"Just one question, do you get to see this everyday when you fly around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on the location or region I'm flying through. If I'm flying through Kanto or the Hoenn region, the views are quite spectacular there. The islands, the beaches, the forests....they all seem so welcoming. On the other hand, if you're going through areas with poor weather, that wouldn't be a pleasant experience in my opinion. Plus, my older brother <i>Latios</i> is currently living, or should I say 'patrolling', the Hoenn region, so I get to travel a lot with him sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement with her. Then, you feel the need to tell her something that you've been feeling since you met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latias, I don't know how should I say this to you.\", you said as you look toward the curious Pokemon, \"Since meeting you at the forest, I got a strange feeling for you. I.... can't quite..... put it. I'm always fascinated by Pokemons; I always admire their majestic appearances and qualities. Out of all the Pokemons I've encountered so far, I find you the most beautiful, admirable, and, frankly..... cutest of all. I think.... I'm about to have...... a 'crush' on you. Maybe being shrunk by some unknown power isn't such a bad thing after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that Latias blushed a little and made some adorable expressions while covering her mouth: \"Ohh...You're so nice. It's been some time since I saw a human like you. Because I never really come to a human up close, this will probably be my first chance at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw the virtual Latias coming closer toward the seat you're in, holding your hands and gently nudging on your face. Despite the fact that its body is translucent, you can actually feel her touch. The feeling you got when she brushes against you is similar to rubbing against that velvet Shinx Pokedoll you have in your bedroom since you were a kid. Your blushed as Latias continue to brush you with her face. After a minute or so, Latias finally stopped and remove herself from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's such a wonderful feeling I got in me.\", Latias exclaimed, \"If I ever had the chance to introduce you to my older brother (Latios), it'll definitely change his mind about humans.\", Latias said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to chat with the virtual Latias as you randomly control her flight from your seat. After an hour of aimless flying, you decided that you probably have enough flying for the day. The virtual Latias instructs you to press a red triangular icon on the display to return control to her. You pressed the icon and a \"Control returned to Latias\" confirmed its activation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what can we do now, Latias?\", you asked the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can either stay in here to watch the places I'm flying by or you can explore other places in my together with my virtual representation.\", Latias replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what option do you choose?\"</span></div></div>",

The best part, And I think you'll like, Is that I have got an comprehensive collection of games for you to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are not all the destinations I assure you.\"  Latias said.  \"I just thought you could start with one of those two.\"  She added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a few moments.  You really can't decide what to do.  There is just so many things to do in Latias.  Not only her brain and Computer room, but only Latias knows what else awaits you.  \"So, what will you do next?\"  Latias asked.

Take it up and your should be there in no time.\", Latias replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as Latias instructed, moving your way to the front of the \"Viewing Window\" chamber. You made it back to the \"Flight Control\" entrance. To the left of it, you find another hole that takes you up toward the brain. The fact is further confirmed by a sign saying \"Brain\" and an arrow pointing in the direction of the passage. Without any hesitation, you made your way up the tunnel which is so soft that you have to occasionally crawl to move. The tunnel seems rather short as you reached the end of it within 2 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've arrived in the chamber that houses the Pokemon's brain. The circular room has a diameter of of more than 200 ft and Latias' brain occupied the center of the room, taking up at least 80 percent of the space in the chamber. The brain is connected by a thick stem that leads to the floor of the chamber; it resembles a thick bundle of colorful wirings which you find rather other-worldly considering the fact that you're in an organic life form. You guess that it must be the <i>medulla</i>, which allows brain signals to be sent out to the entire body. You slowly approached the pink, crinkled brain before you, and you walked around the entire brain to see if you'll find anything special. To your surprise, there is an elevated walkway that leads directly to the center of the brain. The walkway is made of a mix of veins and soft tissues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go in and have a look at what I've got. You'll be amazed.\", Latias tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to delay you exploration no further, you walked onto the walkway and entered Latias' brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin it, you discover that you're in a room with countless colorful rows of building block-like structures. You are overlooking the chamber on some type of balcony. The interior of Latias' brain resembles a huge computer-server room but much more massive and the blocks are also larger. You assume that the block contains 'information' about Latias' memories. From your perspective, you see that there are blue, red, green, yellow, violet, and orange blocks neatly arranged in rows. You went down a flight of stairs that you find at the left-hand side of the balcony and made you way down to the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached the ground floor, you discovered that there is a raised platform at front end of the room containing some sort of command center that overlooks all of the \"blocks.\" You wasted no time in getting onto the platform. You find a seat like the one in the \"Flight Control\" so you sit on it. The controls laid out before you are entirely different. There is a single large screen before you displaying a rough map of the blocks in the brain chamber that are colored accordingly. A legend provided at the bottom of the screen explains the significance of the colors:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\">Blue= Contacts with Latios</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Red= Latias' Memories</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">Green= Secrets</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">Yellow= Emotions</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Violet= Personal Fantasies</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">Orange= Latias' Pokedex</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Latias promised you, you are indeed very fascinated by this surprise within her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the screen before you instructs you to press one of the colored block areas on the screen to access the desired information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one would you choose?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You press the region on the display that is marked with blue. You immediately saw the blue blocks in the chamber began to glow and generate electrostatic sounds. The screen refreshes and present you with a list of the most recent interactions that Latias has with her brother Latios. Although this is amazing, one question puzzles you: Why does Latias need to create a separate area in her brain just exclusively for encounters with Latios. Does this means something for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you like to know more about my relationship with my brother.\", Latias said playfully, \"The reason I have a separate region in my brain for my memories with my brother Latios is mainly because we don't meet each other very often. Being in different faraway regions make contacts rare so I often firmly remember everything about my meetings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sounds like a good thing and a sign of a good mind.\", you tell the Pokemon, \"It's probably because you really like to be with Latios. He's probably just as nice and majestic as you. But I'm curious, what do you two talk about during those rare meetings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you'll have to take a look at it yourself to know.\", Latias replies, \"Plus, my brother is still a little wary of humans in general because he nearly got caught by one. If we ever meet him, it's best to keep your status as a trainer a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry, I'll take note of that.\", you assure Latias, \"In the mean time, do you mind if look at your memories of Latios? Just asking before I \"browse\" over you thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problem with that since you'll be the only one to know it for now.\", the Pokemon replied approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the green light from Latias, you started \"browsing\" through the lists of meeting the Pokemon had with her brother. Each of the individual item is marked with a short title. Some are casual conversations about current things in the Pokemon world while others are more about personal relationship. You saw one labeled <i>Looking After Hoenn</i> that looks particularly interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tapped on the choice on the display. The screen instructs you to proceed to two specific blocks in the blue area; to simplify matters, it provides you with a flashing dots diagram about the location of the blocks with the information. It also instructs you to enter the block once you find the one you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the command center for the millions of \"blocks\" before you. You walked over to the blue area and began to search for the right one to access. After a 5 minute search, you located the blocks with the corresponding coordinates. The block is huge, resembling an extremely over-sized refrigerator. You decided to enter the one about<i> Looking After Hoenn</i>. Despite resembling solid materials, the blocks are extremely soft and slimy. You walked into one with relative ease, like passing through a fine net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're fully inside, the surrounding is initially dark. You wonder about how Latias is going to show you about her brother Latios. Then, the room started to brighten up and you began to hear voices. Things started to materialize around you. Initially a messy blur, a grassy ground began to take shape, sounds of Bug Pokemons began to waft through your ears. Studying your surrounding, you see that you're in a forest, much like the one you're shrunken in, but based on the bright red and yellow of the leaves, it most likely took place during fall. When you are just amazed about how realistic the memory is, you heard a melodious male voice coming from you're right side. When you turned you're head, you realized that you're looking at none other than Latios. He is slowly hovering through the woods accompanying 'you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Latias, looking after Hoenn is a really important job for me.\", Latios said, \"Look at this vast natural wonder before us. This is all possible because a balance exists here. That balance needs to be maintained here, a balance between Pokemons and the........humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Latios as he continues speaking. Then you heard Latias' voice but she was nowhere in sight. Then, it strikes you that you're experiencing the memory from Latias' POV (point-of-view). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it sure is a beautiful and harmonious place.\", you heard Latias said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I flew over this land, I see the countless cities that dotted Hoenn. Although I kept myself away from places with humans, I feel that they may have a similar idea about balance despite what happened at Mt. Pyre.\", Latios said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Latios more carefully. You realized that he is somehow traumatized by that event. You continue to listen to get a better understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still over that trainer?\", Latias asked, \"It has already been a long time and not all trainers are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't quite understand. The main goal of trainers is to catch as many Pokemons as possible. Severely weakened, I almost became one of them; I was only saved from that fate when you came and defeated that awful Ghastly after a hard battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latios, I also saw that trainer myself. He doesn't look like he belongs to any of those typical trainer I've seen before; he was dressed entirely in black with dark glasses. There's also a strange red marking on that black cloth but I can't quite put it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true but just remember these words: Make as little contact with humans as possible. You never know when you'll run into ones like the one who nearly caught me. The humans may appear friendly but some could do the most horrible things to Pokemons. I don't want you to end up like that. Do you understand?\", Latios said with a slightly melancholic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I...understand\", Latias replied, \"I'll be more careful........<br>\r\n </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your surrounding began to get blurry again and eventually got dark with a message: <i>End of Memory</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the block and returned to the command center, fresh with what you saw about Latias' encounter with her brother and the reason for his distrust of humans. You went back to see the other options on that control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What options would up try next?\"</span></div></div>",

The computer cycles the pokemon for about 30 seconds before choosing Latios.  \"Latios is my brother, he is like me, a duel Dragon-flying type pokemon.  He has many of the same abuilitys as I do and is slightly larger then me.  He is also a different color then me.  I am red, while my brother is blue.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished reading, you discovered that Latios also had the ability to make his body \"other-worldly.\"  After browsing a few more pokemon, you decided to do something else, you decide to check out.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The word \"Secret Fantasies\" on the display has caught your attention. What kind of fantasies could Latias possibly? Reminding yourself that your currently in some kind of databank in the Pokemon's brain, you guess that anything is possible with Latias. It has gradually become apparent to you that Latias inner features is going to be a lot more \"interesting\" than you previously thought it would be; probably, you thought, Latias may even contain more secret powers ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you tapped on the section market \"Latias' Fantasies\" on the display. Without any delays, the screen immediately refreshes to a new selection menu. There is only one icon telling to touch it to look at the fantasy world of Latias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm......Before you look at my fantasies, promise me you won't tell anyone, not even my brother, Latios. It's more of a personal thought Let's just keep this between you and me. Okay?\", Latias asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you, I won't tell anyone. Besides, how can I tell someone if I were in you?\", you tell the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\", Latias said, \"Be prepared to encounter my vivid little world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you pressed it the icon on the screen. An instruction appeared and instructed you to enter a room directly behind the Control Center. You looked toward your back and discovered that there is an additional chamber. You head toward it and enter the room. The room is quite small but big enough for you to stand comfortably. The muscle valve behind you tightened and closed, sealing you within the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask Latias what has happened, you began to see some images. You realized that you're in a vast landscape comprised of red and white among a light blue sky. The scene is dotted with red trees,numerous other random items, and some strange clouds floating around the environment. At first, it looks quite startling but then you realized that Latias has literally allowed you to enter her own fantasies. The ground feels bouncy like a mattress as you seek out the bizarre 'world' before you. You come toward a sign: <i>This is the realm of Latias' Fantasy. This is the place where she keeps her most imaginative thoughts alive.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen you take a look around, you saw countless blobs of images floating in the air. Each of the blob can be fitted into your own hand. You absentmindedly grabbed one one and take a look. There is something that surprises you: not only does the blob depicts pictures, it also presents itself as a short film. As you dig through the blobs, you saw 'films' of Latias engaging in battles, playing in the woods, kissing with some unknown Pokemons, and all sorts of random things. Some of the contents looks like they are straight from some drama movies or tales. You think that Latias probably often daydreamed about being a powerful Pokemon fighter or involved in some romantic situation. But, there also seems to be a lot of 'films' of Latias playing or conversing with her brother. You surmise those are probably a result of her imagination of being together with Latios more often. You take your time to enjoy many of the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only been an hour and you have probably only gone through 1/6 of Latias' fantasies. But you got bored already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are my fantasies going for you?\", Latias asked you eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're are fantastic! It's truly an eye-opening experience. I never knew that a Pokemon could also have a lot of fantasies like a human.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Keep on exploring me if you want more surprises, trainer.\", Latias said in a strangely seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the chamber and returned to the chamber with the command control. You're trying to decide whether to explore another location in Latias or remain in the brain to probe other data you can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get out of her fantasies, and the first thing you see is the list, along with \"Secrets\" on top. You, being the unhealthily curious person you are, decide to stay in the brain just to know her better, even if you feel like you should leave her some privacy. \"But if she weren't going to let you take a look at them, she wouldn't have that option in the display!\" you think. Without more hesitation, you select the option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find yourself in a big room, full of lockers. Each locker is marked with a theme. You open one randomly and find tiles of an strange iridescent material. You grab one, and instantly your mind is filled with images and some kind of narration from Latias. After it ends, you grab another tile and the same thing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around, opening the lockers that appealed to your curiosity and learning stuff you had never thought Latias would know or do, but very few of them are bad for her or others. Then you find a locker you thought was strange. \"Endo moments\". You open the locker and find two smaller ones. The top one is labeled \"Inside me\". You open it and find only one tile. You grab it, and see Latias finding you and letting you inside her, all from her point of view. Then (from a point of view that didn't belong to anyone) it changes to your journey inside her, looking at yourself while you pilot her and later when you enter her brain. The images ends when you enter her secrets, so you leave the tile in its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second locker was labeled \"My own moments\". You suppose that it is her comments about your adventure or something, but after opening it you find too many tiles. You count eight tiles, and grab a random one. You are stunned with what you see. You're watching from Latias' point of view,  and she is in front of a large Pok\u00e9mon you don't remember. She seems to be waiting for something, and the Pok\u00e9mon in front of her seems to be unaware of her presence. When the stranger opens its mouth, Latias flies inside it. You manage to stop the images and grab another tile. It is the same thing, and soon find out that each of those tiles are different sessions. You're shocked. You decide to exit the brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're looking for a way out, Latias contacts you. \"I see you found out many things about me. Any questions?\" You ask her to explain a little about the last things you saw. \"Every once in a while I use some of my powers...I want to see the insides of a Pok\u00e9mon of each type. You can come with me the next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what do you do exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I explore! I always go for the full experience. I visit the usual places...and look for new places...and places of a more private type. Then I exit their bodies...I won't describe how, but you may find it disgusting...if you choose to got with me I won't force you to experience that unless you do want it.\" -Latias finishes her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll think about it\" -you say, since you don't know what else to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally find a way to another place in Latias' body, and start your trek. After five minutes, you find a sphincter blocking the path. Your host's heartbeat feels very strong. You enter and look around. You're in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tunnel is at least 20 feet in diameter with ring-like patterns along the walls. The breeze in here is freezing as if you're on the tallest mountain peak in the world. The ground on which you stand has a solid feel to it, with structures resembling a wide catwalk leading in both directions. Here, Latias' heartbeats sound even louder. You see two arrows painted on the wall of the tunnel. The one pointing left is marked \"INTAKE\" while the one to the right is marked \"AIR REDIRECT\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the left hand path to check out what lies ahead. Some times later, you encountered several layers of \u00a0net-like\u00a0structures that have varying porosities along the way. These must be some kind of filtered, you thought, because you see all sorts of debris stuck on them. The path ended at an opening with a steel-mesh chute the same size as the tunnel. The wind here is even more intense than back down there. Squinting your eyes, you can see a vast expanse of clouds beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wondering about the purpose of the tunnel, are you?\", Latias asked, \"This tunnel serves as my respiratory system while it also doubles as the propulsion for my flight. I take in air through two openings near my chest and it goes through countless filters to make it cleaner for me to breath. Once the air is clean enough, it will be directed to my lungs where I take in much needed oxygen at this altitude. After that, the waste air will be redirected to air vents on my rear air fins, providing a very strong boost for my flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded intently at Latias' explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to see more stuffs, try running the entire length of the wind tunnel.\", Latias said.</span></div></div>",

The thought of you running back where you can and to the end of the tunnel seemed like a stupid suggestion. However, you want to see more about this system, as you had never heard of something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus your energy,  just looking throught the opening (you had deducted it is one of the openings) until you feel ready for the trek. You start walking, then speed up until you're running. You're happy to see that the wind coming from behind helps you to be faster, without requiring more energy from you. You soon go pat the point you had used to enter the wind tube, and keep running, almost flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of enjoyable pseudo-flying you arrive to a larger chamber, one of the lungs. There is a lot of space, and there are many currents of air. You stop before you're launched around, and look around. The lung doesn't have anything you had not seen before or imagined, besides the fact that the respiratory system was one you had never heard of before. You could see another tunnel at the other side, and remembering Latias' explanation, you know what lies ahead. You walk closer to it and feel the wind carrying you again, until you grab some odd sprouts growing near the tunnel, and see many more going through the rest of the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it dangerous to continue from here?\" you ask. \"There is protection at the end so you don't fall, so nothing will hurt you. You should be fine as long as you keep grabbing those sprouts, you won't be lifted by the air. But if you feel unsafe, you can take the exit you'll see not far from you.\" Latias replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now you're almost in the exact half of my body. But if you continue through the path, you'll have other possibilities in a different part of my body, as I said before, the air vents are in my rear air fins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to...</span></div></div>",

What are you doing here, human?\" You hear it say, and you can't avoid looking away of its red eyes. You had always hated Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, due to a traumatizing experience when you was just a small child. Yet now, when you was in trouble, to you it seems it got worse, since now there was a giant ghost looking at you. You gather courage and try to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I was\" the Gengar must have noticed your fear, because you see its smile getting wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid of me, human? Ah, what a curious thing. I know how you feel towards me, and although i don't know what are you doing here or why you're so small, but it is kind of annoying to see you almost passing out just because I'm in front of you. Or maybe it is amusing.\" It then laughs, making you fall down. \"I'll tell you what, little human. Come with me, live with me for a while. I'll show you that ghosts aren't that bad as you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well, I don't know if you have noticed, but I shrunk. i would rather to be back to my normal size, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How unlucky of you, I have no idea how to help you. But...you won't last long. And then you may be a human ghost, you may see\". It laughs again, and you feel frustrated that the Gengar has been making you feel like a coward. \"i'll help you to survive. You'll live inside me for who knows how long. And don't say a word, you and I know you'll <i>have</i> to accept And while you're inside me, you'll learn that all ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon aren't as bad as you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at the Gengar's eyes, and behind the obvious pleasure of messing with you, you can actually see that it cares, even if it is in a very distorted way. And you didn't want to be alone on the forest, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I accept. I'll trust you blindly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" It says, picking you up. \"Inside me you'll find everything you need, and if you don't, just ask. 2 It opens its mouth and puts you on its huge tongue and closes its mouth. You almost pass out when you realize it was eating you, and you regret of your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still afraid, ah? Stop worrying, human. What could I do to make you feel better? I think letting you take your own decisions is the key to that. How do you want to go inside me? Want me to swallow you and make it fast? Or would you rather to walk down by yourself? Just trust me, as you said you would do.\" And once again it laughs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You want to have the control of the situation, or at least as much control as you can have while you're shrunken and possibly under the control of a ghost. Even if your newfound host has assured you that nothing will happen, your past experiences are still haunting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking, and try to measure how small you are. You have the impression that you're no more than five millimeters tall, because everything around you is huge! You keep walking, but the throat still seems to be far away, the tongue seems to extend infinitely and the teeth around you are as tall as skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep walking for thirty minutes until you finally reach the throat. You look down to the abyss in front of you, and you almost faint. While you try to regain your balance, you stumble towards the throat, and much to your surprise your feet cling to the wall of the throat. You walk a little bit more, and although you're in a vertical path, you're still standing as if you were on solid ground. Your best guess is that it is related to the nature of your host, maybe the inside of the Gengar works differently than the insides of any other living being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're disorientated, and the only thing you're able to do is to keep walking, until you're going down the esophagus. The natural movements keep impulsing you down, even if you are still walking on the wall. Soon you can see the sphincter that marks the entrance to what you guess is the stomach of the Gengar. When you approach it, the gravity seems to change, and you fall a few meters before it opens, and you fall directly inside the stomach. You sit, and try to observe your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never seen something like this before, nor this is how you had pictured a stomach. It is a pretty large organ, and it is filled with a strange light purple fog. You walk around, and you clearly can see various puddles of a darker purple, and you don't dare to approach to them. The deeper you go in the stomach, you find more puddles until you realize that you have walked straight into one. Much to your relief, nothing is happening to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good human and don't be uncomfortable. I'm your home now, and who knows for how long I'll be. You're free to go anywhere in my body, and I assure you that it will be a great experience. Walk a bit further and you'll see something that will tell you what I'm talking about\" - the Gengar says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the puddle until you're out of it, and you find out you're on the other side of the stomach. In front of you there are three large tunnels, two of them with the normal flesh color, and the one in the middle with a purple tint. You ask for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you start. The tunnel on the left goes deeper inside my body, while the one to your right goes higher. You'll see many possibilities along the way, but it is a long path. The one in the middle is what you might call \"my intestines\". It doesn't work like that, though. Digestion ends in my stomach, the rest is never used. Inside you'll see many \"stations\", and you'll never find out how they work. When you enter one, you'll be transported to a different part of my body, you'll never know where you'll appear! I mean, you could take one and end inside my head, that is an example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it is...a slide? No more?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a slide, that is it. But as you may suppose, if you keep sliding soon you'll arrive to a part where walking is necessary, and then there is an exit of my body. I'm not imprisoning you, you're free to get out of my body if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and decide where to start.</span></div></div>",

Well, it's not a real window,\" Lopunny explained, \"What's going on there is that my belly button skin is transparent from the inside, so I figured it would be the perfect spot for you to be!\" Emphasizing this, she rubbed her tummy, briefly casting you in darkness when her hand covered her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. I never figured Pokemon biology would be so... odd.\" You walk over to the bed, lie down, and sigh. \"Man, I'm thirsty. I could go for some milk right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to see my breasts? You can take all the milk you want from there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Without a second thought, you rush to the elevator as your window gives a view of her entering a building. You press the button for the upper chest, and have a somewhat smooth ride up the spine of your bunny girl. But you're perplexed, and express it with a \"wha-?\", when the floor briefly tips backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Lopunny giggled, \"That was just me stretching. A dancer like me's gotta stay limber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I'm pretty good at it, too- people come from all around to see me perfrom! In fact, I get so much stuff from it that I needed the storeroom you passed by!\" You're confused as to how being a good dancer can earn you lots of gifts, but you shrug it off as the elevator doors open. Right ahead of you are Lopunny's perky, milk filled breasts, but there are plenty of other things you find interesting, too...</span></div></div>",

Some sort of massive control panel stood before you, with buttons labeled with all sorts of bodily functions and a map showing what was happening in her body. To each side was an oval hole, which you assumed from basic anatomy was the ends of her ears. The absolute front had two hazel domes, which were obviously the back of her eyes. But what took up the center surprised you the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lifelike hologram of Lopunny appeared in the center of the room, apparently mimicking her actual movements. Surrounding her was a simulated landscape, with you presuming that the solid parts were what she saw and the wireframes what she extrapolated from other senses. And as for what she was focused around right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that a pole!?\" You ask, as she leaps up and twirls down it with her rear sticking out. \"So, you... you're a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, I won't be upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a pole dancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, I am.\" Lopunny took on a tone like she didn't care about what she was doing, even as she leaned out over her audience with her breasts dangling down. \"I did mention the dancing I did required some undressing, too. Oh, these guys just love a girl who ends with less than she started with. Like so!\" Her hologram tore off her bikini bottom, and you heard the crowd's cheers as she rubbed her loins deeply against the pole, her body map indicating an increase in pleasure as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're also a... a...\" Your flustered mind almost didn't want to say the next word. \"A stripper!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it so negatively, trainer, you're acting like you don't know how much I LOVE this job!\" She sat down on stage, legs spread far apart to reveal her slit, and slowly removed her top as the front row tossed wads of money onto her stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I figured that being one of those was only as a, er, last resort!\" You weakly retort, watching her simulation do a handstand from the pole with her boobs dangling downward in front of her face - dimming the light from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For humans, maybe.\" Lopunny toppled forward and lifted her legs as she landed, giving everyone an up-close-and-personal shot of her ass and vagina. As she no doubt expected, people started stroking down it, her giving off a pleasured coo as she shifted for more people to feel her, \"But, oh~ I figured, I have a natural figure that most people would buy magazines to fap to, my most enjoyable bits, oh~ bounce like rubber-\" she stood up suddenly with a scream of love, her butt indeed bouncing as people cheered her on in lust- \"and I just love being around humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twirled and started her breasts swaying as the music you noticed had accompanied her died down. Her performance was over, and the crowd was cheering wildly as she gave them their last views of her touching her tits and slit. She then pointed at someone at the back row, and motioned with a finger to come forward. Finally, the curtain closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, what was that last bit there?\" You asked as she stuffed her money and bikini up her ass, presumably to be sent to her storeroom. \"Why did you wave to that guy at the back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with every show I do, whether night or day,\" Lopunny explained as she strolled down a back hall, \"I like to make sure one person gets a REALLY special experience. So, I choose who I think is the best member of the audience, and they get to see my workroom and have sex with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went blank at the last part. \"S-sex!? So, you're a whore, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" She chirped, cheery despite your question being in a frightened tone. \"I mean, they can't get me pregnant, I can't give them diseases, and I get more enjoyment than I do with most pokemon, why wouldn't I be a whore?\" She entered her workroom, which was somewhat barren beyond a well-worn bed, a door to a washroom, and a window. \"So, would you like to help me get ready for my 'date'? Or would you just like to head back to your room and get some sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

Black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black it is!\" She reached into her ass and pulled something out. At first glance it looked like a black bikini, but then you noticed how... see-through it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Lingerie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is!\" Lopunny quickly put on the bra, her breasts shaking once she let go of the string. \"In fact, this pair is perhaps the laciest pair of underwear I could find. So lacy, in fact, that I've heard human women aren't allowed to wear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she admires herself in a mirror, you have to agree with her. The nearly-nonexistent brassiere actually seems to make her nipples more visible than when she was naked. But you can't help but ask questions when, instead of pulling on the panties, she runs her finger down her ass-crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just pulling down my colon so that the exit covers my whole butt.\" She answers as she walks to the washroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that if he decides to love me there, he can't ruin the delicate inner-space that you're in right now.\" She grabbed some sort of brush and stuck it in her ass, which showed up on the body map as it caught bits of waste. She moved it as far in as she could, clearly enjoying it, and then pulled it out, waste-covered, to put it in a slot on the toilet. She walked back to the main room and started to pull on her panties, but paused. \"Wait, could you press that pink button there? Three times should be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Looking over the control panel, you spotted a pink button labelled \"HORMONAL BLISS.\" You press it three times, and Lopunny kneels down as three burst of pink mist come out of her ass. \"I'm afraid to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be!\" Lopunny giggles as the mist dissipates into the air. \"That's just one of the many scents that my body can produce. I release those to mark territory, indicate danger, calm myself down, or, in this case, 'sex it up'!\" She puts on her panties as she says the last part, and looks at herself in the mirror again. As with her bra, her nigh-invisible panties do a better job revealing her ass and vagina than concealing them. She lounged down on the bed, one leg up as she fingered herself. Suddenly, you heard footsteps, and the wireframe portion of Lopunny's hologram showed a man waking down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's here!\"</span></div></div>",

Lopunny stood up from her place on the bed, walking sexily over as the met in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, beautiful,\" she said, winking at him with a dreamy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not talking about yourself?\" He replied, idly running a finger down one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only in front of a mirror.\" Lopunny replied, stroking the man's chin as she undid his belt. She dropped his pants down, exposing his erect manhood, as she leaned inwards to him. \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than ready!\" And the two started as if they were in sync. The man undid Lopunny's bra and poked her nipples, while she kneeled down and stuck his penis in her mouth. As she gave him a blowjob, you noticed windows appearing on her body map indicating the sweet taste of his dick and, when he eventually released, the salty taste of his semen. When she finished and stood up, the man took off her panties, turning her around as he stuck his shaft up her ass. He clutched at Lopunny's breasts with both hands, squeezing them so tightly that Lopunny moaned at a high volume. Watching the pleasure build up from her rear, you were glad she blocked off her inner-space from his intrusion, especially as he ejaculated again and painted an eighth of her colon with his cum. After that, the two lovers tossed themselves onto the bed, as he finally stuck his dick into her pussy. As he thrusted in and out, you noticed her pleasure increasing exponentially as she started gasping in lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with once final burst, she let out a scream of joy. The lights in the control room dimmed, and the hologram changed from having solid color to only a wireframe. Her control panel dimmed, and you saw her body map indicating a \"pleasure overload\" had ocurred. Confused, you called out, \"...Lopunny? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, yep, I'm alright. Just unconscious.\" Her wireframe continued to be done by the man's, and muffled sounds of pleasure could still be heard through her ears. \"That last burst really took a lot from me, but, oh~ at least I don't mind him using my body for the, oh~ next hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really okay with him having sex with your unconscious body? For an hour?\" You ask incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~ yeah. After all, I can still feel him doing it, and, oh~ he'll leave a gift for me once he's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about 5 minutes before I wake up.\" You glance back towards the hologram, where the man has moved to rubbing and twerking Lopunny's nipples. This may take a while.</span></div></div>",

He left something on a small desk, as the bunny girl slowly stirred - and the hologram you viewed this from inside her head gradually became solid color again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...\" Lopunny yawned, \"That was a nice hour.\" She picked up what the man had left. It was clearly a pearl, but judging from the jagged edges it had been shattered at some point. \"Strange, usually people leave completed gems for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She was about to stuff it up her ass (after pulling her colon back up) when you realized something. \"There's some sort of... energy coming off that pearl shard.

On top of that, she pulled out a jacket that didn't reach the sides of her bra, and a skirt that reached only the top fourth of her panties. unconcerned with how revealed she was, she walked out of the building to lustful stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going first, Lopunny?\" You ask, as she teases a man by pushing up her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going...\"</span></div></div>",

You're confused at first, and then you assume her friend was something like a Geodude, but then you noticed a small yellow speck on the rock... And what friend Lopunny had already told you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lops! My ol' gal! How're you doing?\" Called out the Joltik, who jumped up an amazing distance to land inside her panties. \"I must say, you look lovely with this lacy underwear o' yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you love it,\" Lopunny replied, giggling as her tiny friend climbed up her chest, \"Although what I've been doing isn't so lovely. You see, I ran across this human in the forest-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal, I've seen you run across dozens 'a humans!\" Joltik interrupted, trying to lift up her girlfriend's brassiere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the thing though - this human was super tiny; he was a little bit smaller than you, even!\" Lopunny elaborated, glancing down at the bug who was now sucking on one of her nipples. \"And he needs to find all these fragments of a pearl so he can return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot dang!\" Joltik exclaimed, stopping his milk feast at that last part, \"Now THERE\"S something I can help with! Where is 'e?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in my head right now, he was very good with preparing for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, say no more!\" You saw Joltik climg the rest of the way up Lopunny's curvy body, and went inside her ear. A few seconds later, you saw that same Joltik somehow phase through her eardrum, landing on the floor and rushing towards you upon his notice. \"Well now, you the human that my gal Lops be helpin'? Call me Joltik; Jolt fo' short, if you prefer nicknames.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out one of his legs for you to shake, and you did so apprehensively. Like Lopunny had told him, Joltik was a little bit bigger than you were, and his multiple pairs of eyes and pincers couldn't help but fill you with a bit of fear. \"S-so, you know where to find those pearl shards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not 'cifically THOSE, but let it be known there ain't one thing I haven't found fo' my big babe!

Help...\" The Machamp groaned, acknowledging Lopunny's presence. \"Something... Balls... Stuck... Too... Horny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something lodged in your testicles?\" She repeated, earning a confirming moan, \"Let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her lean downward towards the fighting-types's crotch, as he momentarily took his hand away from his throbbing cock. Sure enough, one of his balls appeared to be incredibly swollen, and Joltik nearly jumped out of his seat. \"There's it! That's the pearl piece I tracked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Lopunny acknowledged, and she stood back up to face the Machamp. \"Don't worry, I have... experience (\"Not really.\") with this sort of stuff.\" She took off her jacket and skirt, liking the unwillingly horny Machamp's drooling as the panties and bra went with them up her ass. \"Just hang on for a few moments, and I'll be able to get it out.\" Internally, she added, \"Press the tan button!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joltik looked over her control panel, until you spotted a tan button labelled \"MEGA EVOLUTION\" on the main console. You pressed it, and the room gained a momentary glow as your mistress transformed into Mega Lopunny. Her breasts now had a black pattern like a too-tiny nightshirt, and her legs had a pantyhose design that drew the Machamp's attention to her loins. \"There, now I should be able to handle you,\" she teased, feeling her body for a bit before stretching out her arms. \"So... come and get me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machamp did not hesitate, immediately bullrushing her and tackling her to the ground, his straining penis deep within her vagina. You saw the pleasure levels begin to rise, at a far slower rate than it did with the human man, and he groaned in delight as he squeezed her ass with his lower hands and her tits with his upper hands. Lopunny, on the other hand, focused both her hands on the swollen testicle, trying to get the pearl shard unlodged and up his spermatic cord. You take a brief break from the hologram display of this roughhousing, and turn to Joltik. \"I'm guessing you've seen this a lot, practically living inside this girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea', quite a bit,\" he said, \"Most're not that good, though, and while I'm not to brag I've given many an equal pleasu' to her, with my full bod', even!\" Sudden;y, you noticed on the body map something flying out of the Machamp's penis, and into Lopunny's pussy, with a recognizable shape. \"Lops, you got it!\" Joltik shouted, \"You got the pearl piece! You can stop now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two began to relax, slowly disentangling themselves as Lopunny's mega evolution vanished. \"Don't worry,\" she said to the gasping Machamp, stroking his dick like a pet cat, \"I got that thing out of you. You can work yourself easy, now.\" On the body map, Lopunney's pleasure dropped back to zero as the shard somehow moved to her storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machamp stood up, his penis still erect as he grabbed his shorts to put them on. \"Th-thank you so much,\" he said, \"What can I do to repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" she chuckled, sticking out her bare bottom in his direction, \"You've already repaid me enough with what was stuck inside you. It's something... important to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gave their final goodbyes, and Lopunny went back into the forest, sighing with relief. \"Well, I suppose getting two of what we need is enough for one day,\" she said, rubbing around where in her chest the storeroom was, \"Why don't you two relax for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfec' idea, Lops!\" Joltik exclaimed, \"C'mon, trainer, I know two good places to be.\" Putting you on his back, he carried you...</span></div></div>",

It's pretty neat.\" He lets you off at the end of the road, which is obviously her hand, although you notice that you can't enter her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what else is neat?\" Lopunny says, gazing at your position within her palm. \"You two get front row seats to my newest show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it, 'Alone Time'!\" She crooned, as she lowered her hand to her bare breast. You feel yourself harden as she gives an up-close-and-personal view of her tit, rubbing it around in an undulating circle. You can't help yourself when she moves onto the other nipple, and you pull down your pants to start rubbing your excited penis. And glancing over, you can see that Joltik is doing the same thing. \"Oh ho,\" Lopunny giggled, \"I guess you two are ready for the grand finale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she lowered her hand down to her crotch, and stuck it inside her vagina. Your cock began to throb even harder as she herself masturbates, rubbing her hand along the walls with an echoing moan. Eventually, your horniness is too great - A large gob of white bursts from your dick (with a smaller one from Joltik's), covering most of the inside of her palm with a sticky semen repaint. Once her body absorbed it, she took her hand out with a joyful yell, and you notice that she's left a puddle of her own cum, with some still dripping out. \"So... So, how... Was it?\" She pants, bringing her hand back to her face to lick it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...\" You say, stumbling in putting your pants back around your still-stiff cock, \"I'd, er, say, er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRILLIANT!\" Jolitk shouts, running around with blush on his 'cheeks,' \"You've outdone yourself Lops!

Although it was obvious why, given that the poor giant had his stubby hands grasping at his chest, as though he was in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" she called out, looking up at the poor dinosaur pokemon's face, \"what's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oog... It's my stomach...\" The Tyrantrum said weakly, doubling over a little from the pain, \"I ate something earlier today and it's gotten lodged at the back of it... Oog, and now my stomach's too full to really move anywhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too full, you say?\" Lopunny teased, stripping herself naked and facing her rear towards him, \"Are you sure there isn't room for a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last word, the Tyrantrum gave in and gently clamped his jaws around Lopunny's waist. He pleasured her with a weak crotch-licking before swallowing more and continuing with her breasts. Finally, she was entirely in his cavernous mouth, and she wasted no time in diving down the esophagus to his stomach, which the three of you saw was painfully convulsing from a mass of chyme clumped at his pyloric sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Lopunny said, \"the pearl shard must be what's causing this big guy such pain, so I'll have to shove the stuff he's digested out of the way to grab it.\" She started moving globs of eaten berries out of the way, slower than if was doing this in <i>water</i>. \"Joltik, can you try and speed things up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob'em, Lops!\" Joltik began working her control panel so fast that you only saw his tiny bug legs as a blur. On the hologram, Lopunny's arms seemed to start working overtime, clearing chyme from her path like she was a leafblower. Eventually she made it to the sphincter, and Joltik slowed her down to normal. Not one to pause, she gently and deliberately pulled the shard out of the hole. All of a sudden, she was sucked into the duodenum along with all the digested berries as the Tyrantrum's digestive tract resumed normal operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much, Doctor Lopunny!\" he called out, clearly relieved from his lack of stomach pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really a doctor, I just look the part,\" she replied, stuffing the shard up her ass to send it to the storeroom. \"Any chance of letting me out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well,\" the Tyrantrum stammered, \"you're kind of too far in to be upchucked. You'll have to take the... scenic route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew as well as anyone what that meant. But Lopunny chose her own exit, and it was...</span></div></div>",

You're confused as she moves around inside the plasma, with his various body systems and giggling coming and going, but when she left it to land in a small, tight, orb like space, you figured it out;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny was going to exit through the Tyrantrum's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn't go unnoticed - as soon as she landed in his semen, the whole place began to sway as he tried and failed to rubbed his aroused manhood. \"Ooh~ Wow~ How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been inside many a big guy like you, I know how their bodies are built.\" She began rubbing the testicle walls gently, as the owner's voice gave off a pleasing moan. \"Now, somewhere in that direction is my den, and I would really like it if you brought me over there before you launched me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh~ Okay, lovely.\" The Tyrantrum began to take clumsy (but safe) steps through the forest, clearly distracted and blushing from the pleasure radiating from his dripping manhood. Meanwhile, you and Joltik watched Lopunny rub every inch of her along his balls, with you only taking your eyes off to ask the bug, \"Isn't it kind of sad for you, seeing her get this satisfaction from another pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I've seen 'er do this many times with peop' not named Jolt.\" he shrugged, seemingly leaning back. \"But you shoul' know tha' I know mor' than anyone how to get her screamin' with my whol' body inside her pussy.\" You pondered that for a few moments, and all around you the sounds of thudding footsteps ended. \"Ooh~ I made it ma'am~\" crooned the Tyrantrum, \"It's ooh~ so tiny~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now stick your cock in the entrance, I won't mind.\" Lopunny climbed out of his testicles, crawling slowly through his dick as he stuck it deep inside her den and began moving it slowly. She was barely an eighth along his massive member's length when the Tyrantrum couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Ooh~ I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm gonna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad Lopunny pulled down her anus to protect her inner-space at the inarticulate warning, as around a gallon of semem surged up the tube only to go up both her colon and her crotch. Her body map indicated a quick increase in pleasure, and the force had brought her to the halfway point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes~!\" She called out, wriggling her body, \"Do it again!\" More moans resounded, and the outside world came into view as her head stuck out of his cock. \"And again!\" Another burst, and now her boobs hung unrestrained by Tyrantrum manhood. \"Once more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound you heard from the Tyrantrum ejaculating was like that of a high-caliber cannon, and you watched amazed as Lopunny turned herself around, pushed off the wall, and cushioned herself against the ball sac she was in mere moments ago. The cavern wall was spotless, but her crotch was practically painted white, and the dinosaur pokemon pulled his penis out of her den to move his stunned head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you for that experience.\" He stammered with arousal, licking her loins with more fervor than when the pearl shard was lodged in his stomach. \"Th-that was... J-just amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back anytime if you want more!\" She teased, stuffing the shard into her tongue-washed ass while the Tyrantrum clumsily strolled off. She went towards a deeper cave, where you couldn't help but feel aroused youself as she washed her sexy form in a natural hot spring. \"We still have more pearl shards to find,\" she said, scrubbing her crotch deeply with a sponge, \"And luckily I have a machine here that should help with tracking their energy signatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lops!\" Joltik responded, \"I'll start workin' on calibratin' the signal earl' tomorrow!\" With that the bug stormed off into the elevator, and a few moments later you saw him on the hologram, crawling up Lopunny's chest and stopping atop on of her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you,\" she said while stroking her tiny boyfriend's bug body, \"you should probably head to your room now. But I have a surpise for you when you get there~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you respond, and you head back down the elevator to return to the living quarters she had prepared for you in her belly button. What she had there was indeed a surprise to you; a holographic Lopunny, identical to the one in her control room, mimicing her every action as she finished washing her waterlined body. \"Wow, this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexy?\" She took the words right out of your mouth. \"I figured you would want to enjoy more of me, and I figured why not put my figure in your room? Oh, and feel free to fap to me - my body can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the confortable bed, you make good on her request as you pull down your pants, stroking your member as Lopunny places Joltick onto her table with her ass in the air, all her goodies clear to see. She spent the next half-hour doing some aerobics, stretching and squeezing herself every which way with utmost lust, causing you to blow you load into the wall, which quickly absorbed it without further effect. Eventually you felt tuckered out from how aroused you were and fell asleep, eyes glued to the breasts of the drowsy, sexy bunny babe.</span></div></div>",

You're initially confused, but then you remembered what had happened to you yesterday... Being shrunk, Lopunny's body, her dancing, her pervy Joltik friend, being inside a Tyrantrum...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally awake, you stretch out and get out of bed - but fall back down blushing upon seeing the hologram of Lopunny, rubbing soap deep into her fur as she washed herself in her den's hot spring. \"Ah, good to see you awake,\" she said unconcernedly, sticking a loofah in her ass to scrub it clean, \"I was wondering if you'd sleep most of the day, thanks to how much you enjoyed my show last night.\" You blushed redder as you though of what Lopunny had done the night before, all that stretching provocatively and arousingly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joltik's off in the main room,\" she said, snapping you out of your daydream, \"working on what we need to really track down those pearl shards.\" She stepped out of the hot spring, her wet body showing her breasts and crotch clear as day while she drip-dried. \"Head up to my head, there's some stairs you can take to exit through my cheek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" you say, embarrased as you fail to avert your eyes from Lopunny's shapely rear. Eventually, you fumble out of the room and up her spinal cord elevator, arriving up in the control room that filled her head. To your left, you notice a small flight of stairs, and you quickly go down them to see Lopunny's open mouth, with a view of a worktable that Joltik was sitting on. With a running start, you leapt off of her tongue and onto her boobs, sliding down them to land safely on the wood surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that supposed to be?\" you ask, gazing up at the blocky device a head taller than you were. \"Well, Lops is grea' at findin' things, but only within a shor' radius,\" Joltik answered in his odd accent, \"This tracker'll read various scents 'n' stuff she finds, and use GPS to trac' 'em down across the world fo' her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good as always, Joltik!\" Lopunny cheered, stroking her boyfriend's tiny body as he cooed, \"This should make getting our friend back to normal a lot easier. Now then, who wants breakfast?\" She squeezed her tits together, and you understood immediately what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joltik each took one of her hardened nipples in her mouths, and sucked on them as if they were lolipops. Her delicious milk flowed into your stomach, as delicious and filling as any three-course breakfast you've ever had before. Her sighs and giggles as she massaged her mammaries made the situation even better, which made it sadder when you felt your stomach get too full, and she pushed your mouths off her tits. Then she stood up, turned around, and sat down atop the table, her butt facing towards you in all its curvy glory. \"Alright you two,\" she said, slapping her bottom, \"Now you should carry the tracker into my ass, bring it up the elevator, and install it into my control panel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" you interject as she spread open her butt cheeks, \"Can't we just use the stairs I used, in your mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the sad thing is that my mouth is not a safe place for any sort of electronics,\" she sighed, massaging her ass while she waited, \"And the stairs are narrow enough that you couldn't get it up them without causing me irreversible harm. Trust me, this is the safest option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, trainer,\" Joltik called, hoisting the device on his back for you to steady it, \"Unless you prefe' bein' as small as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you carefully pushed the tracker through Lopunny's ass crack, then climbed above it to carry it through her elevator. Upon reaching her control room, Joltik takes the machine over near the main panel, and connects a few wires between the two devices. Once he's finished, you notice her body map helpfully indicate that \"GPS TRACKING INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Lopunny said, slapping her breasts, \"Now let's see where on Earth those pearl shards are.\" She focused on the gem's radiant energy and ran it through her new GPS, which gave her the location of one in...</span></div></div>",

The sight of it made you blush - her strapless top held only the center of her large rack, and you were partially sure that it was only her hardened nipples that were keeping it from slipping off. Her bottoms were no better, as they also lacked the straps they needed to stay up, and the rear was so small that it exposed ninety percent of her ass. \"Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" is all you can say, focused on how skimpy her ensemble was. \"It's kind of... revealing.\" Lopunny blushed and bent over, no doubt testing to see if her bra wouldn't fall off at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea',\" Joltik added, \"you're gonna make all th' men think wit' the lowe' head once you ente' their sight,\" and he began to rub his abdomen on the control room floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" She responded, and she started walking off towards the beach with a bit of conversation. \"Did you know I got this back when I was a young Buneary? It was too big for me then - I relied on luck to keep my top over my boobs, and on Joltik to grip the bottom from inside my butt. But now-\" she lifted the rear briefly and put it back in place- \"I fit into it perfectly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too... Perfectly...\" you moan, feeling yourself growing hard as she redefines the phrase 'scantily-clad.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, if you really must do that,\" Lopunny said as she rubbed beneath her top, \"I'd be willing to taste it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly ran down the stairs and sat down on the bottom step, pants down, facing towards Lopunny's throat. You thought of her bikini; the tiny top, the nigh-pointless bottoms, how easily it could slip off, exposing her hard tits and soft slit to your adoring eyes-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't hold it in anymore, and you ejaculated a sticky white mess all over Lopunny's bumpy tongue. She immediately sloshed the cum around her mouth, before swallowing it down with a loud gulp. '''Mmmm,\" she says, \"you provide a nice, salty taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks,\" you respond, continuing to masturbate and please her palate with your delectable semen. After around an hour or so, you hear her cheerfully announce \"We're here! Come and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush back up the stairs, meeting with Joltik at the control panel (\"Guess she won' need to eat fo' a while, huh?\") to view the hologram of Lopunny, taking all the stares as her barely bikini-clad body bounces onto the beach. You see plenty of other people, mostly men, lounging on the sand, some embarrassedly trying to cover up the tents her presence has pitched in their swimsuits. \"Alright then,\" Lopunny said, lifting parts of her ensemble to air them out teasingly,\"that GPS said the shard was somewhere here, but it's not detailed enough to pinpoint exactly where.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me!\" Joltik called out, as another lift of her top gave way to some wolf whistles. He ran towards the machine and twisted a few dials, causing the device's screen to zoom in. \"There we are!\" he cheered, as the GPS gave a more accurate location as...</span></div></div>",

With a teasing chirp and a stroke of her crotch, she dived down deep, with a lung capacity that absolutely amazed you. \"Okay, you two,\" She said, pausing a few meters below the surface, \"I'm going to need you to control my swimming for a little bit, so I can find that shard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" You replied, and you and Joltik each took your own set of controls. When you activated yours, Lopunny's legs flashed green, and you tested it out by making her do underwater splits (\"Whoa, that feels weird.\"). Joltik, on the other hand, took over her arms, and had her fondle her own breasts a little bit (\"Hey, that tickles!\"). Eventually, the two of you stopped fooling around and got her swimming, while she kept control of her head to keep looking around. The search went on for around an hour with no results, until... \"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny looked towards a shadowy cave, and regained control of her body to swim towards it. Sure enough, within the mouth of the undersea cavern was a shiny pearl shard, which she gladly pushed up her naked rear to join the rest in her storeroom. \"One down,\" she said in triumph, \"Er... The rest to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guess we coul' celebrate then, huh?\" Joltik replied, and without waiting for Lopunny's answer he pushed a button labelled \"PELVIC PERSUASION.\" Immediately, her hips began swaying, and her face took on a look of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, yes...\" She said, gently rubbing her gyrating loins with both hands, \"I suppose a little celebration... Won't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you started pushing all her buttons, causing Lopunny to begin shaking everything her mama gave her. She shimmied, stretched, and contorted to your demands, eventually getting to the point where she twisted herself up like a pretzel. The festivities were cut short, however, when the cave entrance suddenly darkened. \"What was that?\" You asked. The answer came quickly...</span></div></div>",

As she passed into the dryer (if dirtier) colon, you posed a question; \"Why is this Tyrantrum's body like a normal animal's, while yours is so... I dunno... Unique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having an inner-space isn't exactly something that appears,\" Lopunny answered, pushing a lump of waste away without dirtying her paw, \"Some are born with it, some don't have it. Having it is nice when you're a large pokemon, though... So much room for others to enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the Tyrantrum's anus, and gently opened up the anal sphincter to look at the ground below her. It showed the grassy landscape briefly, but a moan from the dinosaur pokemon caused him to lift his tail, giving more of a view of the trees. Undeterred, she stuck her hands out of his ass, and grasped something tightly to his shock. She then swung quickly out of his butt, using the blushing giant's ball sac as a makeshift trapeze as she stuck the landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" the Tyrantrum said, nuzzling Lopunny's tiny face with his large snout, \"Even if you're not a doctor, you still helped me feel so much better. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some waste management to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked off with thudding footsteps, tail swinging in the breexe, and Lopunny turned in a different direction to reenter the forest. \"Alright, we've got two out of... whatever amount of pearl shards there are,\" she affirmed, \"and we'll need stuff from my den if we really want to track them down.\" She stretched a bit, letting you gaze at her sexy body, still shining from the Tyrantum's digestive juices. \"So I suggest, Joltik, that you take this time to give our human guest a bit of a tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Right, then!\" Joltik said, flinging you onto his back, \"come alon', trainer, and I'll show you ever' last bit of my babe's bunny bod!\"</span></div></div>",

But first, I must be dressed for it!\" She pulled her hand out, taking some fabricy thing with her, and you felt her do a few hops as though she was putting something on. With a snap, the lights dimmed, with both her ass and vagina covered by blue fabric. It was obvious to you what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you just put on a bikini?\" you ask, hearing a similar snap up near what you assumed to be her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" she answered. \"It's my smallest and tightest bikini, so that my sexy bod can shake more arousingly.\" She slapped her rear to prove her point, and you saw her butt cheeks shake every which-way for about a minute. \"No human can resist me in this tight old thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then how will I be able to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've prepared a room for you to use, just take the elevator to my waist!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice her spinal cord at the backside of her pelvis, with some sort of odd door- an elevator door. You climb inside and press the right button, and you arrive at her waist surprisingly quickly. Following the signs, you end up in a small, nicely-furnished room, with a window you assumed to be Lopunny's belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" she said, as a sign advertising the hot springs came into view. \"If you want, I could turn on a hologram for you to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Just like that, a three-dimensional image of your busty bunny appeared, flirting with the guard before entering. Seeing her whole body swaying as it did made you feel aroused, and you looked down, kind of concerned about what she would think about you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jerk off all you want~\" She said teasingly, as she fluffed her bikini top, \"My insides will clean themselves and you're not the first to be attracted to me!\" Smiling at this, you pulled down your pants as you sat on the provided bed, rubbing your dick intensely as you watched Lopunny move exhibitionistly through the hot springs to many a lustful gaze. She finally found an empty spring, lined with gems of every kind, and walked in, sighing as the warmth of the water washed over her. Your navel window now gave only a foggy underwater view, but the hologram provided both under-and-above as she lifted her bra slightly to let water over her tits. Unable to hold it in anymore, you ejaculate, causing a wall to be briefly coated in your cum before it's quickly absorbed. \"Couldn't hold it in any longer, eh, big boy?\" She says, now lifting her bottoms slightly to feel the water on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" you sighed in the afterglow, and after it fades you focus on the gemstones on the other edge of the hot spring. \"Wait, can you see if a pearl piece is among all those other gems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said, slowly sidling along the edge of the spring, her breasts floating along the water, \"but don't surprised if a man shows up to pique my interest...\"</span></div></div>",

You were still wearing clothes, thankfully, but you felt like you were being gripped by your shirt collar, lifted above the ground. Was it a crane? It certainly didn't feel like one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your eyes finally adjusted to the light. Then immediately widened at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you was what appeared to be the face of an enormous Machamp, one who was holding you aloft in one of its- no, his- equally massive hands. As you flailed helplessly for a brief moment, his face began to show an expression of relief. \"Phew, you're awake,\" he said, setting you down on the palm of another hand. \"I thought you had been dead this whole time, thank goodness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" You say incredulously, standing up and looking at Machamp's palm. \"How am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're about to ask, and sadly, I have no answers,\" Machamp preempted, \"I found you on the side of a mountain pass, already this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the massive pokemon. Shrunken, in the middle of nowhere, at the mercy of what was right to be called the superpower pokemon, you started to cry. \"I-I want to go home... I want to go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry,\" Machamp said, lifting you up with a third hand while speaking in a comforting tone. \"If it's any consolation, I'll try and do everything in my power- and trust me, I have a lot of it- to fix your predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" He said in a tone of absolute confidence. \"Although, there is a slight problem in where I'm going to keep you... Oh, I know!\" And to your surprise, Machamp went to drop you...</span></div></div>",

But right now, you just feel like looking on the bright side - that you've got (what is most likely) a friend right in front of you. She looked stunning - her soft green hair flowed past even her feet, and her black dress was knee-length on her left, and hip-length on her right. Her chest most hypnotized you - she was not lacking in that department, with two plump breasts that seemed to match her head's size. And from how the light shined off the \"fabric,\" you guessed that this Meloetta had decided to go without any... support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped singing, and as though she was psychic - oh wait, she is - she turned right in your direction. \"Hello, little one,\" she said, in a voice that sounded both youthful and experienced, \"were you admiring my song?

What do you mean?\" \"Well, I maked my insides more livable for you. I suggest you to start with your 'bedroom', I'm sure you'll like it. There are also some rooms where you can spend your time if you get bored\" she says \"How can you do that?\" you ask \"Well, legendaries can remodel their insides as they wish\" she replies \"Thanks, but how do I know where to go?\" \"Well, if you need a guide...\" she says as her image appears in front of you. You jump back; it looks like a normal Meloetta, smaller than you \"Here you go\" the projection finishes, flying in your arms and hugging you. The image then speaks \"Where to go first?\" she asks \"Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry for repeating the chapter as there were way too much errors in it. Again, sorry)</span></div></div>",

Slowly you crawl out of her dress and go sit on her pillow, next to her face. You look at her: she really is beautiful. She snores softly. You smile and walk down the bed. You stop just under her breasts and hug her. But she catches with her arms in her sleep and hugs you. You are pressed against her breasts. You try to free yourself, but she has you in a tight embrace. You eventually give up struggling and relax. You close your eyes and soon you dooze off, listening to the sweet lullaby of her heartbeat. Eventually morning come. You wake up on a pillow and Meloetta is looking at you smiling \"Good morning, my little one\" she says in a singsong voice \"Slept well?\" \"Yeah\" you reply. She smiles and picks you up \"Well, time for some breakfast\" she says. She carries you over the table, puts you down on it and grabs some fruit. She then slices it with psychic and sets it down to you \"Eat up, little guy\" she says cherefully. You eat your breakfast and notice that Meloetta is giggling \"What's so funny?\" you ask.

Meloetta gives out a smile of sincere appreciation. You're pretty sure she's looking right at you, so you just smile right back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, starting to sing again, Meloetta begins to dance, every little movement her cute body did, along with the lovely tune she is singing, leaves you completely unable to look elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show goes on for quite a while. Until Meloetta stops. <br>\r\n\"That's all for today people, I hope to see you all again!\" she declares, before disappearing. You get up.

Sighing, you start making your way up the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside world, Meloetta arrives to a forest, where Mew is supposed to be. She starts searching around for any possible sign of her pink friend. She sighs loudly<br>\r\n How in the world is she going to find Mew in this dense forest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ready or not, here I come...

Meloetta breathes deeply, before finally talking.<br>\r\n\"You see...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the room within Meloetta's head, you had been resting for a while. You tried to figure out how the heck you suddenly shrunk and, most of all, why. But, obviously, you weren't able to answer to any of your questions, so you just shook them off and decided to catch a nap. You woke up a few minutes ago and you're bored out of your skull.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta.\" you call out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the green headed pokemon appears in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your stay?\" she asks in a singsong voice.<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said that you made your whole body livable for me, right?\" it's now her turn to nod.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering, is there any place I haven't seen yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta smiles.<br>\r\n\"Yes. A lot of places actually. Why, do you want to go exploring?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Sure... why not?\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Then let's go. Follow me.\" she says, grabbing your hand and literally dragging you out of the entrance of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you into a big chamber. Everything is quite dark around you, you barely manage to see.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta, where are we?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"In my Memory Chamber. Look there.\" she points to a large mirror. You curiously get near. Weirdly, you can't see your reflection in it; instead, you're staring at Meloetta, who is sitting on tree, singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to read your mind, Meloetta giggles.<br>\r\n\"That isn't a normal mirror.\" she says you.<br>\r\n\"If you look in it, you'll be able to see my memories.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That's quite an interesting story.\" Mew says. Meloetta nods.<br>\r\n\"But I'd like to share a few words with this little guy you're talking about. May I?\" she asks, with a hint of hope in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Sure, go ahead.\" Meloetta replies. Nodding, Mew places a hand on her friend's forehead and focuses, trying to find the little guy within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning Meloetta's aura, she detects your little body inside hers. <br>\r\n'So she wasn't lying.' Mew thinks with a giggle. <br>\r\n'Okay, here I come.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi there.' a voice suddenly rings inside the chamber. You turn your back to the mirror, trying to spot the source of the voice. Meloetta disappeared from the chamber, you notice, and, aside you, there's no one here.<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n'I'm Mew, Meloetta's friend. I'm talking to you through your aura. Meloetta wants me to help you. Can I talk with you for a little while?' Mew asks.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" you try, but another, familiar, voice is heard.<br>\r\n'Go on little guy. She's our friend.' your recognize it as Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to yourself, you speak up.<br>\r\n\"Sure, we can talk for a bit.\" you reply.<br>\r\n'Good.' Mew's voice says.<br>\r\n'But, do you mind coming out? I'd like to see you.' she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Meloetta's psychic projection appears once again.<br>\r\n\"Follow me, I'll lead you outside.\" she says with a warm smile. Shrugging, you follow her out of the Memory Chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you into a tunnel. You notice the passage getting more slippery each step you take. And then... light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself standing on a large, black paw. You look up to see Meloetta's smiling face and another pokemon, pink in color, which you assume is Mew. Looking around, you notice the three of you are in an enlightened clearing.<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" Mew says cheerfully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I fainted and, when I woke up...\"<br>\r\n\"...He followed my song and found me. He asked for my help and I decided to let him stay inside my body.\" Meloetta finishes your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew just looks at you two silently, seeming to be pondering something, before speaking up.<br>\r\n\"Well, as I said, that's really a really amusing story. Little one, I seem to understand that you don't have any clue of how you got so tiny, and nor do you Meloetta.\" she says, both of you nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't have any idea of how to change you back.\" Mew says with a sorrowful look.<br>\r\n\"But I may have an idea.\" she adds.<br>\r\n\"We're listening.\" Meloetta says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we should split up for a while. I'll try and find a way to grow the little human back, while you, Meloetta, keep him safe in the meantime... Although I really wouldn't mind staying with this little guy for some time. It can get very lonely in this forest. Anyway I'll let you know if I discover anything.\" Mew explains. You look up to Meloetta, who returns your gaze.<br>\r\n\"Just a minute, Mew...\" she says, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do?\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems a good idea to me. And, then again, what other choice do we have? Might as well stick to this idea.\" she whispers back. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta turns around again.<br>\r\n\"Well, Mew, we think it's a good idea... if it's not a problem that is...\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? It'll be the perfect excuse to leave this forest for a while. It gets incredibly boring around here, and this adventure seems like lots of fun!\" the pink pokemon cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's decided then. I'll contact you if I find anything interesting. See you later!\" Mew beams, before disappearing in a flash of light.<br>\r\n\"She teleported.\" Meloetta explains upon seeing your confused look.<br>\r\n\"And I think we don't have anything else to do here.\" she adds, starting to float toward the exit of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly, she is out of the forest, the midday sun shining in the sky. Meloetta looks at you, who are still sitting on her black paw.<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy.\" she calls out.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Ready to go back in?\" she asks, opening her mouth to empathize the sentence. You nod as the green haired pokemon lifts her paw to her face and drops you inside her mouth, before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you get to experience the descent into her stomach. But, this time, you know what awaits you, so you land on your feet on the bone floor, Meloetta's psychic projection waiting for you.<br>\r\n\"Welcome back trainer.\" she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Say Meloetta, where could I explore now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, there are lot of places you haven't seen yet.\" she says, telling you some places such as 'Singing Room' or 'Dance Simulator'.<br>\r\n\"So, where would you like to start?\" she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, though, your stomach growls, asking for food. You rub your head.<br>\r\n\"Um... Maybe some place where I can eat something?\" you ask, making Meloetta giggle.<br>\r\n\"Of course. Follow me.\" she says, floating off, you following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she stops right before a fleshy sphincter.<br>\r\n\"Go through this hole.\" she says. You do as instructed and walk toward the hole. You touch it, and it opens at your contact. You walk through it and find yourself in a large, spherical room. You see large folds of flesh resembling a table with some chairs around it, while some tubes hang from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on a chair as Meloetta comes in.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my Food Store. You'll be getting your meals here.\" she explains. Just then, trays of food come out of the many tubes. Nuts, berries and much more food land on the table along with water, berry juice and what seems to be wine, judging by the strong aroma. Your stomach growls impatiently, waiting to be satisfied. Meloetta sits down on your lap.<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Eat up!\" she giggles.<br>\r\nShe doesn't have to tell twice, as you immediately start digging in, enjoying the great sensation of having your belly filling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta patiently waits for you to stop eating, before lifting herself as you get up.<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" she asks with a smile. A satisfied sigh seems to please her.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, how about we resume our tour?\" you nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next hours exploring the various places within Meloetta's body as she guides through new rooms. But in the end, she guides you back in your room before disappearing. And her booming voice is heard, making you assume it's the real Meloetta speaking.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to sleep human. If you want to keep exploring, you're free to do it. Or you can go to sleep, it's pretty late.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch. And true to her word, it's 11:30 PM.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, time really flies. I think I'm going to bed as well.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight then.\" comes her voice, before everything goes quiet. You are about to lay down on the bed, before you you look at the twin 'windows' that are her eyes. You get an idea and go look through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, you manage to see where Meloetta currently is, even though it's really dark outside; she's in some kind of cave. Yawning, you decide it's time to hit the hay and lay on the bed. <br>\r\n'This day sure has been pretty eventful.' you think, before slowly drifting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You open your eyes. Nearly a week has passed since you've met Meloetta and you have been living inside her body since then. You know almost every part of her body now. Though you are still wondering about a small, mysterious hole that frequently appeared during your exploration. You though about going through it a few times, but if you just looked at it, it would simply shut close and disappear. So you decided to forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, trainer.\" Meloetta's usual cheerful voice greets you as you get up.<br>\r\n\"Slept well?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes... as always though.\" you reply, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the personal bathroom right next your bedroom and decide to take a quick shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're done, you step out, dry yourself and get dressed, before heading out of the bathroom, where Meloetta is waiting for you.<br>\r\n\"Say human.\" she says looking at you.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do today?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, the usual things I guess. Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing important. But I think I'm going to show some new places today.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What are they?\" you ask curiously. Meloetta giggles.<br>\r\n\"You'll find out in due time. Now go get breakfast. I think you know the way.\" she replies, fading away. You nod to yourself and exit your room, passing through the tunnel that leads into the Food Store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch a quick breakfast and get up. Shortly after, Meloetta appears again.<br>\r\n\"Okay human, I think I can show one of the new places now. Meet me at Memory Chamber.\" she tells you, fading once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as instructed and, within five minutes, you get to the familiar dark room where Meloetta's Memory Mirror is placed. She's waiting for you next to it.<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you came.\" she says, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Now, here.\" she gets behind the mirror. You follow her and notice a hole, similar to the mysterious one, but much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Meloetta, who nods. You touch the sphincter, which opens itself, revealing what seems a cliff, a deep blue sea roaring downwards.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my Imagination Lounge.\" the green headed pokemon says, entering after you.<br>\r\n\"Imagination? You mean...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"That's right. Everything I imagine can be seen here. And about the cliff... I thought it would be a great playground.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playground?\" you parrot back. Meloetta giggles.<br>\r\n\"Yes human. Playground. I want to play with you for a bit.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Do I have a choice?\" you ask. The green haired pokemon shakes her head.  And then... she suddenly starts growing before your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta... what... why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well trainer, I think we can have some real fun if I'm bigger than you.\" she replies, empathizing the word 'real' .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, without adding any other word, she flies toward you, her paw wrapping around your torso and scooping you up like you were a doll. Meloetta quickly lifts her paw to the white landscape of her head and drops you on it.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let the fun begin!\" she beams, starting to fly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Meloetta's idea of fun is very different from yours, as she just spent the successive hours flying around while singing or, eventually, shifting into Pirouette Form and starting to dance while you were still on her head. But you're actually having fun. In fact, you completely lose the track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the now redheaded pokemon stops her dance and lets you down on the ground, you have a chance to look at your watch. It's 8 PM.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's already that late?\" Meloetta asks, while slowly returning to her normal size.<br>\r\n\"Very well, trainer, I think you should have dinner now.\" she says. Maybe you're just seeing things, but you're sure a small smirk just appeared on her face, right before she fades, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug it off and walk out of Imagination Lounge, heading to the Food Store. You have dinner - daring to try berries you didn't even know that existed, assuming they are very rare, and some of the strong berry juice Meloetta provided you, which tasted surprisingly sweet - before deciding to head back to your bedroom inside her head. As you walk through the fleshy tunnel, though, you once again notice the sphincter that leads to unknown places within Meloetta's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. There's no sign of Meloetta, and the passage is still here. So you reluctantly extend a hand to touch it. Surprisingly, it doesn't disappear like the other time you tried to get it to open, this time it actually opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare inside it. The passage is really dark, and it's impossible for you to see where it leads. You can just go through it and find out what Meloetta is hiding from you from a whole week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird. You had been trying to discover what is on the other side of his hole for a week, yet now you feel you shouldn't explore this part, unless Meloetta tells you so. But you're extremely curious, and you have the chance to satiate your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a few minutes, trying to decide if you should go across this dark tunnel or just forget it and wait for Meloetta to tell you to explore it. You linger about what to do for still a few seconds, before finally deciding yourself...</span></div></div>",

You want - no, you have! - to find out what's on the other side of this tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you slip inside. It's very dark, you barely manage to see. You walk further in, your curiosity raising each step you take. You keep walking, thinking about what you're going to find when you reach the end of this passage. And you get completely lost in your own mind, since you completely lose the track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk for a hour or so, before you finally manage to see the sphincter that is probably the end of the passage. Your heart begins to race. Whatever is outside this hole, you're going to find out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally preparing yourself, you step out of the sphincter, which seals shut behind you. You take a look around. It seems that you just entered a cave situated near a cliff. The walls around you are rocky, and you can distinctly hear the sea roaring, but it is covered by another sound. A familiar, enchanting sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow it, even more curious than before. And then, you come come to an end. A bed - black and green like the one in your room, just much bigger - is placed against one of the rocky walls. Floating in midair just above it, there's Meloetta, singing, her eyes closed. But, as you get closer, they open up a bit, a smile growing on her face.<br>\r\n\"So you came after all.\" she says, almost in a whisper, but with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was expecting you!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your shock, you don't notice Meloetta gracefully descending on the bed.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my Emotional Room my dear human. Or, as I like to call it, my Private Room.\" she explains. You take in the information, figuring out that this was the other place that Meloetta wanted to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up trainer, I'd like to share a few words with you. So, I suggest you sit down.\" she says. You obey and sit on the bed, while Meloetta sits right next to you.<br>\r\n\"Listen, as you maybe noticed, this chamber was inaccessible to you over the last week.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"But tonight, I led you here for a reason.\" she looks at you very softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Well, having you explore my insides over the last week felt amazing. Not many pokemon like to be near me, because of my power, and thanks to you, I felt... really good, like I had someone to keep me company. But then, I realized something.\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you encourage her to continue her story.<br>\r\n\"Well, I realized I've grown affection for you. And not an affection like between best friends, brothers and sisters or pokemon and trainer. No, it's more than that.\" she says, now blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get where this is going, a blush starts spreading on your face.<br>\r\n\"So, you're trying to say...\" you try, but Meloetta cuts you off.<br>\r\n\"... I really like you.\" she ends the sentence, while flying up to your head. And then, she does something you never thought that would have happened in your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places a kiss on your forehead. Your eyes widen in shock, your heart starts galloping inside your chest, your blush grows. Meloetta returns to her original position next to you, smiling.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I had to do that. It's just... you're really the nicest creature I've ever met and...\" she stops herself, not able to finish the phrase.<br>\r\n\"I understand. I really like you too...\" you admit. Meloetta's smile brightens as she hugs you. You hug back, enjoying the moment. The hug lasts a few minutes, before she finally breaks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you may have guessed,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"This chamber is situated within my heart. And it's where, my dear human, we are going to sleep together. If you don't mind, of course.\" she says very softly.</span></div></div>",

Obviously with little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta doesn't seem to notice though.<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have any questions for me?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou quickly think of something.<br>\r\n\"I've been inside you for a week. You know about my life...\" you say, recalling the moments you spent talking with Meloetta about your life as a pokemon trainer. Meloetta nods, clearly telling you to go on.<br>\r\n\"... well, as I was saying, you know about my life, but I don't quite know about yours. I mean, you lived for centuries, right? Can you tell me something about yourself?\" you ask. Meloetta smiles warmly.<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany hours pass as Meloetta talks about her life, telling you about stories and ancient legends. She literally had your full attention after a minute of talking. You just lay there the whole time, the small pokemon... the small projection of the pokemon snuggled in your arms, telling you about how the Abyssal Ruins. You know about them, they are the remains of an ancient construction that somehow sank into the depths of the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta reveals you that it was her to sink the Ruins because of foolish men trying to catch her and use her powers. She keeps talking until you let out a deep yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your watch, you notice it's midnight. You look at Meloetta, who smiles.<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need your sleep for tonight trainer.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Sleep. I'll continue my tale tomorrow.\" she says. Even though you are really curious and want to hear more,  you decide you'll better sleep for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you close your eyes. You feel Meloetta snuggling closer to you.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight trainer. Sleep well.\" she says, before starting to sing. Her sweet song does a good job in soothing you. Your body feels more and more relaxed until you fall dead asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you are awake by the sound of Meloetta's voice.<br>\r\n\"Human...

I shouldn't have sang you to sleep.\" she says, rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you're awake now, can I tell you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Go ahead...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta breathes in, as if trying to say something big, before speaking.<br>\r\n\"Well, you see...</span></div></div>",

Though this time, it doesn't disappear.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta?\" you call out, expecting her to appear behind you. <br>\r\n\"Mh?' her booming voice asks instead.<br>\r\n\"This hole didn't disappear this time, why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, now you know what's inside, what's the use of keeping you out? You're free to enter it whenever you want.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to yourself,  walking in your bedroom. You step into the bathroom right next it. Ten minutes later, you step out, fully clean and dressed.<br>\r\n\"Ready, human?\" Meloetta asks again.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm coming out now.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head toward the passage that leads to her mouth. She opens it, letting you slide down on her paws. You are greeted to the outside world by warm sunlight, the spectacular sight of the crystalline sea and the nice, cool breeze... and the next second, Meloetta squeezes your body in a bone crushing hug.<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy about last night.\" she cheers, softening her grip a bit, enough to let you breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whe-where are we?\" you ask after catching your breath.<br>\r\n\"On a island I know. Quiet, peaceful and relaxing. That's why I like coming here. Anyway, we have important things to talk about.\" she suddenly looks very serious. You just nod.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's clear we really like each other. But I wanted to talk to you because I'm unsure about future. I mean, can we still be with each other when you're back to your normal size?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF I return to my normal size. And, telling the truth, I'm not sure. I don't even know how it works.\" you state, blushing. Meloetta doesn't seem to have understood though.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, will we have to... you know... mate?\" you explain. She flushes red as well. But she gives a playful smile.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You can't possibly give me eggs. And, even if it happens someday, I can assure you it'll be in a long time.\" she playfully wags her free paw, empathizing the word 'long'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent for a while, not finding anything else to say. Neither she does, you guess, since she's being silent as well. The only noise is now the occasional wave crashing on the sand.<br>\r\n\"Well... I'll have to go back in now... right?\" you suddenly ask. Meloetta thinks about it.<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd like you to be outside.\" she admits.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Just for today. Look around, this place is beautiful. You don't mind staying out with the real me, instead of being inside my body with a mere fake, right?\" she winks.<br>\r\n\"You do have a point. I can't compare that projection to the real you.\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smooch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon those words escaped your mouth, Meloetta leaned forward, pressing her lips on your forehead. You feel like you're going on fire right now. Each inch of your body burns while Meloetta's warm and soft lips smooch your forehead. She pulls off, laughing merrily. You feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what are we going to do here?\"you ask upon recomposing yourself. Meloetta smiles warmly.<br>\r\n\"Well, the first I can suggest is that we explore around for a bit. What do you think?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\".</span></div></div>",

She lets you sit on her large paw as she starts to float around, more accurately, into a small forest nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we exactly going?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"It's a surprise, silly. You'll see when we get there.\" Meloetta replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes pass. Twenty. Half and an hour. But Meloetta keeps flying silently. You're bored out of your skull, and your curiosity for wherever the green haired pokemon is taking you surely doesn't help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you lay down on her paw. She stops.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" she asks, looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm just bored.\" you reply.<br>\r\nMeloetta smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\"Well, you might just think otherwise. Look.\" she points somewhere in front of her with her free paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting upright, you notice what she's pointing to: a huge clearing. In the middle of it is a lake; behind it, a  roaring waterfall streams down a rocky wall.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Meloetta says, flying over a large rock and sitting down on it, placing you down on her lap in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes silent, closing her eyes. Probably meditating, you think, closing your eyes as well. You get to enjoy the soothing sound of the waterfall from the comfy 'seat' made out of Meloetta's black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a while passes when she finally speaks up again.<br>\r\n\"There we go. It's really nice around here, isn't it?\" she whispers as if she doesn't want to break the silence.<br>\r\n\"Mhhh.\" you reply distractedly. The green headed pokemon smiles.<br>\r\n\"You comfy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"You like it here?\" she asks again.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"Can I pet you?\".<br>\r\n\"Sure... wait wh-\" before you can add anything else, Meloetta's paw gently comes down on your head, gently stroking your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a sigh of pure happiness as the gentle paw keeps rubbing your head. Meloetta giggles her signature, melodious giggle. And then, she starts singing, not stopping, though, her paw from rubbing your head. You got used to the hypnotic sensation you feel everytime Meloetta starts singing, yet, as always, you can't fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now , completely under her spell, you barely move at all, 'trapped' between the sweet song and the soothing, gentle stroking on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some cute little human you are.\" Meloetta comments softly, stopping her song after a few minutes.<br>\r\n\"I knew you like staying in my body, but know I can tell you don't mind staying out either, right?\" she asks in a singsong tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou murr in response, too relaxed to even talk. Meloetta smiles happily.<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a 'yes'.\" she states.</span></div></div>",

If the other places are like this, I can't wait to see them.\" you see energetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delighted smile quickly appears on the green headed pokemon's face.<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, you'll love them.\" she says, floating up in midair and starting to fly over the forest once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta was right. You really enjoyed each place she carried you to. You got to see many beautiful things, such as huge - and not just from your point of view- trees with their leaves dancing along the wind; the beautiful show of thousands of different colored berries that formed literal rainbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, now, all snuggled up to Meloetta, who is sitting on a tree, you are seeing the best sunset ever: the sun, descending over the horizon, is in fact painting reddish yellow shades on the deep blue sea, with the effect of making it shine brightly.<br>\r\n\"Well, this sure has been one good day, wouldn't you agree?\" Meloetta asks you.<br>\r\n\"Yep. I have to admit, I got used to exploring the insides of your body, but taking this... 'free day' and see this place with you was really a great idea. Thank you Meloetta.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta brings you to her face and pushes you into her white cheek.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you just a sweetie?\" she says, happily nuzzling you. You gladly let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally pulls off, the sun has settled down. The sky is now enlightened by a beautiful, full moon. Smiling brightly, Meloetta plucks two berries from a near branch and hands one to you.<br>\r\n\"It should be enough to fill you up.\" she says. In fact, the berry is as big as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite on it, savoring its sweet taste, enjoying each bite you take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally finish your meal, Meloetta had already eaten her berry long ago.<br>\r\n\"So, I think we should rest now. It has been a long day.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Yep, long and exciting.\" you point out.<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed your time outside me. Though we're not done yet.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it would be nice if you slept outside, with me.\" Meloetta admits. You flush red.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" <br>\r\n\"Just for tonight. I'll let you back inside me tomorrow morning, before we start traveling again. Alright?\" she asks. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta smiles as she lies you down on her belly, before laying down herself, covering your body with her paws.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight trainer. See you in the morning.\" she says. You close your eyes, snuggling up to Meloetta, enjoying the soft texture of her dress and the warmth provided by her paws. Soon, your mind drifts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up... Trainer?\" Meloetta calls out. You keep on sleeping. The green haired giantess sighs. <br>\r\n\"You asked for it.\" she says, pressing her lips on your cheek. You instantly wake up and bolt upwards. The first thing you notice is that is morning now. And then, you notice Meloetta laughing like crazy.<br>\r\n\"And I thought princesses needed kisses to wake up!\" she laughs, making you blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheds a tear before recomposing herself.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I didn't laugh like that in ages.\" she says happily.<br>\r\n\"But, anyway, ready to go back in?\" she asks.<br>\r\nShaking off your blush, you nod.</span></div></div>",

Gently, Meloetta places you inside. Her lips seal behind you. The green headed pokemon playfully moves you around.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she then asks in a cheerful voice.<br>\r\n\"Yes, swallow.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the tongue beneath you gently pushes you to her throat. Her muscles get a grip on your legs and slowly pull you down as Meloetta swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you travel down her esophagus, landing into her stomach. And, knowing what awaits you, you successfully land on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Meloetta rubs her belly, satisfied. She's done this a few times, yet she can't get tired of the little guy's taste.<br>\r\n\"Say trainer,\" she says at some point.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do in there?\" the question takes you aback. You didn't think about that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I really don't know. I already explored almost your whole body-\" you are interrupted as Meloetta bursts into laughter.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? There's still a lot of places you still don't know!\" she laughs. <br>\r\n\"Then... can I see them...?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Meloetta goes silent, remaining so for a minute.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she then responds.<br>\r\n\"I think you can see a couple of them.\" Meloetta's psychic projection appears and nods her head, gesturing you to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of following Meloetta through the usual fleshy passages, you notice her stopping in front of what seems a large building. You reach her and follow her into a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare with wide eyes at the scenario you are staring at. A literally huge store. In the middle of it is a large fountain, with a statue of Meloetta in the act of singing on top of it, water flowing from the statue's open mouth.<br>\r\n\"Dear trainer,\"  the green haired pokemon says you.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Meloetta Store. Anything you might want, you can find it here!\" she proclaims with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's... amazing...\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for? I'll show you around.\" Meloetta says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the little human is busy with exploring her insides, Meloetta had meanwhile left the island. It's a great sensation to feel the marine breeze through her hair. She always loved sea, even though she doesn't really like swimming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy smile on her white face, the green headed pokemon starts singing happily as she keeps floating a few meters away from the seawater.<br>\r\n\u2018Yes, this is going to be another wonderful day.\u2019 she thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, you step into your bedroom, exhausted. For half the day, Meloetta had been dragging you around her Store, showing you lots of stuff, such as note-shaped necklaces, plushies of her and other pokemon, even photos of her and other legendaries and gifts, according to what she said, that she received from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place everything you took from the Store on a nightstand, before laying on the bed. You had lunch shortly ago. And, with a full stomach, your drowsiness just rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta comes in, sitting down on the bed.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you tired already?\" she asks. You nod.<br>\r\n\"I need to rest for a bit. Mind if I...?\" you ask. Meloetta shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, take your nap. Just call me when you wake up, I've got something else to show you.\" she sings, before disappearing, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a yawn, you close your eyes, quickly taken away in the realm of dreams by the mix of your tiredness and the softness of your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up hours later. Getting up, you rub your eyes, quickly remembering where you are.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta.\" you call out. The psychic type appears in front of you.<br>\r\n\"About time you woke up.\" she says cheerfully. You look at your watch, taking notice that's it's 6 PM. You turn your attention back to Meloetta.<br>\r\n\"You said you have something else to show me?\" you ask. She smiles.<br>\r\n\"Of course, just follow me.\" she replies, starting to float away, you walking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" you ask. Again. Meloetta had been floating in front of you for two hours and more. Your legs hurt, and you're bored out of your skull. Meloetta giggles.<br>\r\n\"Silly human, it's like the fifth time you ask that. Still a bit.\" she replies you.<br>\r\n\"But I walked for hours! Where is this place?\" <br>\r\n\"Right there.\" Meloetta stops in front of a sphincter.<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" you mutter as she lets you touch the hole, which opens up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter in a large, circular room. And what you see is enough to take the breath from your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGemstones. A lot of gemstones. Of all colors and shapes. Laying around in the room.<br>\r\n\"What...\" you mutter in disbelief. <br>\r\n\"Like them, uh? This is the most secret place in my body. My Treasure Room.\" Meloetta states. Then, noticing the shocked look on your face, she starts to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always liked collecting gemstones. I used to keep them in a secluded cave, but, when other pokemon tried to steal them, I decided to find a safer place. So, I picked the safest place: my body. Nobody can possibly steal them here.\" she says, picking a few gems, staring at them with affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she looks at you, who still can't find nothing to say. The green haired pokemon smiles, floating over a small pile of gems, digging through them. She then returns to you, holding something.<br>\r\n\"Take this.\" she just says, extending her paw to show you what she is holding. A black ruby. The size of a walnut.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, not sure of having heard good.<br>\r\n\"I said, take it. I want you to have it.\" Meloetta repeats, placing the ruby in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the gem, not sure of how to reply to this display of kindness.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Meloetta...\" you say after a bit.<br>\r\n\"Don't even say that. Take it as a gift. So, when you look at it, you'll be thinking of me.\" she replies, flying over the sphincter again.<br>\r\n\"Let's go... I'm sure you're hungry.\" she says. Just then, your stomach growls in confirmation of her words. Laughing along her, you place the black ruby in your pocket and exit the room, the entrance sealing tight behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost midnight when you decide to go to bed. You bring your tired body into your personal bedroom. You lay down on your bed.<br>\r\n\"Hey trainer,\" you hear Meloetta's booming voice.<br>\r\n\"Listen up.\" she says, starting to sing, the sweet melody quickly getting to your ears, keeping you under her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in a matter of minutes, you fall asleep without even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside her body, Meloetta stops singing, feeling no more activity from the human inside her.<br>\r\n\"Good night, small one. Sweet dreams.\" she whispers as she lies on a tree, shelter she found for the night. Slowly, she falls asleep as well, ending the day for both her and you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another few weeks pass. You kept living inside Meloetta's body for the whole time, sticking to the amusing habit of exploring her body, while your relationship with her blossomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green headed pokemon always took great care of you, often following you as you enjoyed your time exploring her insides, which you now consider as your own home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, since that day on the island, you and Meloetta accorded that you would've come out of her at least once a week. On a casual day, Meloetta would stop in a different place, letting you out of her body to enjoy some 'quality time', as she calls it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, at night, you would take a detour and head into her Emotional Chamber, snuggling up to Meloetta as she tells you incredible stories about her past life, or simply sings you to sleep, her sweet songs always having a great effect on your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can surely tell, life has never been so great... if it wasn't for the fact that you're still shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mew, she has contacted Meloetta a few times, to make sure you were alright. Each time she contacted, your heart would fill with hope. Hope that she found something. Hope you would return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you were constantly deluded. Mew still didn't find anything that could tell how you shrunk or how you could return to your original size. But Mew assured you she isn't going to give up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, at least, is a consolation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, trainer!\" you sit up, and slowly open your eyes, finding yourself in the huge bed of the Emotional Chamber, Meloetta floating beside the bed. You recall going to sleep quite late, busy with listening Meloetta's stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haired pokemon giggles.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, human. I assume you slept well.\" she says. You give out a small smile.<br>\r\n\"As always, though.\" you reply, getting up. You walk out of the room, toward your bedroom. More specifically, toward your bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing yourself, you slip into the clothes Meloetta provided you and exit the bathroom, finding the pokemon sitting on your bed. She gives you brief smile, which you return, before walking toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your room, you head to the Food Store, Meloetta floating behind you.<br>\r\n\"Say,\" she talks while you walk.<br>\r\n\"Have you planned your day yet?\" you shrug.<br>\r\n\"Not really. Why?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Well, silly, today you're coming out, remember?\" she says between giggles.<br>\r\n\"Already?\" you ask, stepping into the Food Store.<br>\r\n\"Yup. Ready for another awesome day?\" she asks. <br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you reply, sitting down at the table in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to come out?\" she asks you as you gulp down the last bite. You nod your head as you get up, starting to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you reach her mouth. She opens up, letting you slide out, right into her open paws.<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" she chimes playfully. You take a look around, noticing that Meloetta is on a rocky mountain.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta, why are we on a mountain?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"You'll see. I wanted to try something...\" she replies, floating off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries you in a circular area surrounded by giant, rocky walls.<br>\r\n\"Here we are...\"  she mutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask why she carried you here, she starts singing what you recognize as Relic Song. You watch as she shifts into her Pirouette Form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stops singing, she gazed down at you with her now crimson eyes and a smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"You see, I thought this would be the best place for a dance.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Wait, \u2018A dance\u2019? What do you mean?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Well, I do that sometimes. You should know it far too well.\" she winks. You nod slowly, remembering the first time you met Meloetta and how she almost she crushed you in your first day as as shrunken human.<br>\r\n\"Well, ready?\" she asks. You nod as she starts singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before she can begin, she suddenly closes her eyes and brings her free paw to her forehead.<br>\r\n\"Something's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stays silent for a few minutes, before reopening her eyes. She looks down at you, opening her mouth to reply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You imagine your own face if it is nothing more than a shining rock or something like that.<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least we'll be together,\" you say, trying to cheer her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta looks down at you with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Sweet little one.\" she says, lightly caressing your head with her free, before her mind travels back to her task: finding Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you in both her black paws for safekeeping, Meloetta hovers upwards and in direction of the sea, soon leaving the mountain behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Meloetta soars the skies, you try to make casual conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm, so... is Mew always that... uh...\" <br>\r\n\"Childish? Yes. Yes, she is,\" your green headed host replies with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"Don't misunderstand me, she's a good friend and all, but she can be a little... noisy at times.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Oh. But she seems pretty nice to both people and pokemon,\" you remark.<br>\r\n\"She is. One of the sweetest legendaries you'll ever find, trust me,\" Meloetta replies with a smile.<br>\r\n\"I already met one.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour remark is greeted by a pair of white lips briefly smooching your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass before finally Meloetta arrives to what appears to be a normal cave; a certain pink pokemon with a long tail waits outside of it. And her excited expression tells you that this cave is nothing near normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" Mew cries excitedly as Meloetta approaches her.<br>\r\n\"Hi Mew!\" she replies, showing her brightest smile.<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\" you timidly greet the pink pokemon, who seems to just notice you as her gaze fixes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've been protecting our tiny friend well, Meloetta,\" Mew says cheerfully, gently patting your head with a paw.<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" Meloetta proudly replies.<br>\r\n\"Did you expect otherwise?\" Mew giggles.<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, somehow this reminds me of your rivalry with Celebi,\" she laughs. Meloetta flushes red.<br>\r\n\"It isn't rivalry! It's... friendly competition!\" she cries, momentarily forgetting about you.<br>\r\n\"That's what you both say!\" Mew chimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid them starting a fight, you quickly speak up:<br>\r\n\"Mew, you talked about something special?\" you ask, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon suddenly remembers the reason of why she bothered Meloetta, although she couldn't know that.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, it's something really cool!\" she chimes excitedly, her sapphire eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... is it something related to my shrinking?\" you ask. Mew's cheerfulness fades to a somewhat sad smile.<br>\r\n\"Er... I don't think so.\" then, seeing your dejected look, she quickly adds:<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. But look at the bright side! You're not alone!\" she chimes, her smile returning on her face in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo empathize her friend's words, Meloetta starts petting you. You give a grateful smile to both of them.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's this cool thing you were talking about earlier?\" you ask, trying to change topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew flutters out of the cavern. As soon as she heard your question, she just flew inside; and now, you notice her holding a spherical, black object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't recall having seen anything like that before - although it just seems like a black rock. But Meloetta suddenly looks surprised.<br>\r\n\"The... the dark stone, Mew?\" she says, before muttering under her breath:<br>\r\n\"Zekrom...\" Mew nods her head in a cheerful manner, confirming Meloetta's concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" you ask. Meloetta shakes her head, as if wanting to shake off bad memories.<br>\r\n\"The dark stone. Zekrom.\" Meloetta repeats. You don't quite understand the meaning of her words, and shot her an inquisitive gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green headed pokemon sighs.<br>\r\n\"This stone is in reality Zekrom, the dragon type who protects ideals.\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Just imagine, we could revive him into his true form!\" Mew chimes. But Meloetta suddenly looks worried.<br>\r\n\"Mew, please don't. Zekrom wasn't exactly find of humans, and...\" she holds you out for better explanation.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, suddenly dreading that black stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, this little one is harmless. Zekrom would never attack him, would he?\" Mew asks. A look at Meloetta's face answers to her question.<br>\r\n\"It was just an idea...\" she says dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the dark stone and Zekrom aside, Mew and Meloetta accorded that you and them could spend the rest of the day together, then part the next morning on your own paths, Meloetta still keeping you safe while Mew would keep searching for a remedy for your shrinking problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the sun completely sets down, you're completely tired out because of the many games Mew insisted to play with both you and Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after a quick dinner made out of berries, the two legendaries declare their intentions to rest. The two find shelter inside of the same cavern where Mew found the dark stone. The pink pokemon sets it apart on a rock, before laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Meloetta closes you in an embrace as she lays down next to her friend.<br>\r\n\"Hey, seems like you two are more than just friends!\" Mew jokes.<br>\r\n\"Stop saying silly things, Mew,\" Meloetta says, blushing along you, while Mew giggles, ignoring the fact that she just  spoke the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her giggling dies down as she wraps her elongated tail around her body and gets ready to sleep, joined by Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two giantesses are fast asleep, while you have some troubles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hoped that you would have returned to your original size today. You really did. But you didn't return to your size. Mew found a rock which is a pokemon that, according to Meloetta, is hostile to humans. Nothing related to your mysterious shrinking, and something possibly lethal for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you have to give up and stay tiny for more time. But if there's a bright side, is that you get to spend more time with Meloetta. The thought makes you smile. You really don't mind that part of your shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving inside Meloetta's body, constantly discovering new places and hearing new stories from your host is something awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you dig your hand in your pocket: you feel the hard surface of the black ruby she gave you many weeks ago because 'Every time you'll look at it, you'll be thinking about me'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsiness starting to claim you, you mutter one last sentence:<br>\r\n\"I wish to return to my size again.\" with that, darkness claims you, and you're soon led to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are rudely awoken from your slumber as a bright light suddenly shines in the darkness of the cavern. You desperately cling to the last remains of your sleep, trying to get asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have little success as you are forced back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and yawning, you open your eyes to check whatever made you wake up. You only take notice of Meloetta still cuddling you, Mew laying on one side, the dark stone glowing and both pokemon still slee-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, the dark stone glowing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fix a tired gaze on the black, spherical object, noticing that it is indeed glowing of a blinding light, forcing you to narrow your eyes to see. You also notice a few sparks of electricity coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you notice is one of Meloetta's black paws leaving you as it travels up to her left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the giantess moving as she sits up.<br>\r\n\"Mhh... what is happening...?\" she asks, yawning. The time you had spent with her told you that if there is one thing Meloetta hates, that is being awoken from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming that she's talking to you, you hurry to reply:<br>\r\n\"Uh... the dark stone is kinda glowing...\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Mh... the dark stone glowing...\" she drowsily parrots back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to fully regain consciousness as your words sink in her mind.<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks again, opening her eyes to see the stone, that is Zekrom, gleaming with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! How can this be happening?\" Meloetta exclaims, startling you.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... what's happening...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green headed giantess pays you no attention as she moves to Mew.<br>\r\n\"Mew! Wake up!\" she cries while shaking the pink legendary with one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response she gets is a light shift of position.<br>\r\n\"Mew! You need to wake up! Zekrom is-\" she is interrupted as the dark stone glows even more brightly, the light becoming too much for your eyes to bear, forcing you to close them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, what appears to be an explosion echoes inside of the cavern, succeeding in waking Mew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the light finally dies down.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta?\" you ask, reluctant to open your eyes. Slowly, your eyelids part and the first things you see are Meloetta and Mew, both agitatedly staring at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing their gazes, you fix your own gaze on a particular spot, which seems even darker than the rest of the cave. Suddenly, something briefly glows of an azure color, much like the dark stone was doing earlier. In the instant before the glow dies down, you manage to spot a dark, gigantic figure that towers above Meloetta and Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly look upwards, discovering a pair of bloody red eyes staring at the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou distinctly hear the voice of Meloetta in the back of your mind:<br>\r\n\u2018<i>The stone is in reality Zekrom, the dragon type who protects ideals,</i>\u2019 you stare at the creature again, noticing that it has in fact a draconic figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this Zekrom? The dragon of ideals?... The dragon that didn't like humans too much...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the creature breaks the silence that formed in the cave.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta... Mew...\" much like his looks suggest, he has a deep, powerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you feel his red eyes fixing on your small form.<br>\r\n\"... H-Hi?\" you squeak. Only to feel a surface of some sort being pressed on your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilenced, you look up at Meloetta, noticing her looking back at you, shaking her head lightly while keeping you from talking by pressing her own paw on your mouth, silently telling you to be as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Zekrom!\" Mew cries, having regained her usual cheerful behavior. You see her waving her paws at the huge dragon, while Meloetta limits herself to muttering:<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" while gazing at the floor, the paw holding you against her chest pushing you deeper. The giantess only wishes that you would simply slip up inside her dress somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta internally sighs. That's just impossible. She'd have to slip you inside her skirt to accomplish such task, and it is out of question. Not that she's embarrassed by the idea... well, maybe a bit, but you and her spent so much time together that she discovers she doesn't feel too bad thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the real problem is that any wrong movement and Zekrom would notice Meloetta's tiny guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad, Zekrom apparently already spotted you.<br>\r\n\"A human...\" you hear him growl. If you weren't firmly held by Meloetta, you would have cowered. Still, her paws don't manage to keep you from trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta takes notice of you shaking with fear and smiles a little.<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine.\" she whispers sweetly, her sweet voice betraying her agitation. In reality, she doesn't really know what is going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meloetta...\" Zekrom speaks again.<br>\r\n\"Why are you holding a human? And why is he so small?\" he asks with a grumbly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta frowns.<br>\r\n\"That was exactly what me and Mew were trying to find out. I found this little guy one day, and he was like this, alone and helpless. So I... we decided to lend him a paw,\" Meloetta explains truthfully.<br>\r\n\"True!\" Mew confirms, not dropping her cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom growls, showing a pearly set of razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n\"You're <i>helping</i> a human?\" he says, sounding disgusted.<br>\r\n\"How can you trust that creature? You don't know what he could do to you! You mustn't trust humans, did you forgot that?\" Meloetta pouts indignantly.<br>\r\n\"Well, I trust <i>this</i> human. And I do have pretty good reasons to do so,\" Meloetta retorts.<br>\r\n\"Also, Zekrom, this human would never do anything to me or Mew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, who are watching the scene still unable to talk, notice the dragon's mouth shifting into a smirk, showing his fangs again. Is it you or are they shining sinisterly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? And how can you tell that?\" he asks, comprehensibly clueless about the time you and Meloetta had spent together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the green headed pokemon has the intention to make it bright to the dragon of ideals.<br>\r\n\"Me and this little human have been spending weeks together. Not days, Zekrom, weeks. I simply know that her would never do anything against me!\" Meloetta cries, starting to get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zekrom seems to be focused on one particular. You, Meloetta and Mew watch the dragon ponder to himself. Even Mew understood the seriousness of the moment, you can tell by the fact that she dropped her smile, and is glancing at Meloetta and you worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeks?\" Zekrom breaks the silence.<br>\r\n\"I have heard enough.\" he says, one of his paws descending towards Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you can only watch with terror as...</span></div></div>",

Zekrom looks at the green headed legendary, who is glaring daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon growls at the small legendary.<br>\r\n\"Hand him over, Meloetta,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna deal with this human from now on.\" he adds, his growly voice scaring you even more, while giving you an accurate idea of what he wants to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands scenarios of your dead body flash across your mind, and your face suddenly pales as blood is drained from it. However, your frightening thoughts are interrupted by a much more sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'll give this human to you,\" Meloetta says, grasping you even more tightly.<br>\r\n\"Then I say that you've gone crazy!\" she spits venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew remains in between the dragon and the small legendary, looking at the two with an unusual worried expression.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" she says, but whatever she meant to say is soon interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to hand him over, Meloetta. Or you'll be forced to.\" Zekrom growls. Meloetta stares at him defiantly.<br>\r\n\"Bring it on.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words said, Meloetta abruptly loses her grip on you and lets you sit on her black paw, which she then brings up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, you look at her, but she gives a reassuring look.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. He's not getting his hands anywhere near you,\" she says in a sweet whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a matter of seconds, Meloetta opens her mouth, roughly pushing you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to react, the giant tongue beneath you shoves you in a familiar abyss: Meloetta's throat. You initially scream out in terror, before remembering whose throat is this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tranquilize a bit as you fall down, landing on your feet on the bone floor of the town within Meloetta's belly. Though, it's completely deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta is probably too busy to craft her psychic projection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your hypothesis is confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the yelling just begun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?!\" Zekrom growls as he takes a step forward.<br>\r\n\"You're not getting your hands on him, Zekrom!\" Meloetta snaps back, Mew floating beside the green headed legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zekrom, calm down,\" Mew chimes in.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta is right - the human is harmless!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon of ideals huffs, while his tail sparks menacingly.<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" he begins.<br>\r\n\"Humans are ALL but harmless! I'm only trying to protect you two!\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta frowns, indignant.<br>\r\n\"We don't need your protection. If the human was a threat to me, I would have noticed, and I would have left him by himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her body, you hear the last remark. And you're glad that Meloetta didn't consider you a threat when you first met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't simply fly around and house humans in your body!\" Zekrom cries.<br>\r\n\"And you can't simply fly around and menace shrunken humans for no reason!\" Meloetta retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon growls. And his tail suddenly lets out a violent spark of electricity, directed straight at Meloetta, who promptly dodges and glares at Zekrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last warning, Meloetta. Be reasonable and hand the human. Or I'll attack you.\" Zekrom slowly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mew and Meloetta look at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth know that Zekrom is more powerful than they are. And not only because of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only chance they got is running. And, while it wouldn't exactly be the best display of courage, Meloetta doesn't even think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thought occupying her mind is the task she must focus on: protect the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Meloetta says.<br>\r\n\"We're leaving.\" Mew says, preparing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth legendaries turn around, starting to float in direction of the only way out of the cave, which is luckily on the opposite side of where Zekrom currently is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon growls again as he glows of an azure color, before letting out a thunderbolt, in direction of Mew and Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for him, they expected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second, both petite legendaries separate, dodging the electricity, before Meloetta turns around, opening her mouth as she lets out a deep cry, using Hyper Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow her vocal chords, you are taken aback from the sudden, loud sound and are forced to cover your ears.<br>\r\n\"What is going on!?\" you shout, unable to imagine what's happening out of Meloetta's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you have a pretty close idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by surprise by the sudden attack, Zekrom growls in pain as he feels like his head is about to burst. He's pretty sure that his ears are bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave of sound eventually dies down. Mew, who had been covering her ears, suddenly removes her paws and crafts a blue sphere in her paws, before throwing it at Zekrom, hitting him in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphere explodes, and the black dragon cries in pain as a cloud of smoke spreads inside the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the smoke starts to dissolve, Zekrom notices that Meloetta and Mew are no longer in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Mew exclaims as she and Meloetta fly up in midair, getting away from the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they don't get too far as an explosion suddenly bothers the quietness of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, both legendaries look back, noticing that Zekrom completely destroyed the cavern with an attack. The dragon looks up, spotting the two up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting away!\" he growls as he starts to float upwards, towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Mew repeats again. She doesn't need to say it a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two small legendaries start to fly away at full speed, while Zekrom gives chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Meloetta's belly, you understand that the green headed giantess and Mew are running from Zekrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hope that they make it unharmed...</span></div></div>",

And dragon-types were notoriously weak against ice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon of Ideals slowed down, but kept chasing Mew and Meloetta, wanting nothing more than to grab a hold of the second, squeeze her until the human came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be reasonable you two!

The dragon snarled furiously upon noticing that the two petite pokemon weren't there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily, he flew up in the air again, his tail sparking with electricity as it enlightened the dark sky with an azure light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom looked around to find his two opponents, but no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta and Mew had disappeared into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge dragon roared, angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to find them. The shrunken human Meloetta was housing couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two pokemon finally stopped, dawn was rising over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted and drowsy, Meloetta and Mew flew down in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was improbable Zekrom was going to find them soon, he had lost their tracks, but they couldn't risk exposing themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.\" Meloetta stated as she and Mew took a seat at the foot of a tree. The pink legendary sighed.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I wasn't the one who restoring Zekrom... speaking of, how did it happen?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm clueless...\" Meloetta admitted, before placing a paw on her belly. Her worry momentarily waning, the green-headed pokemon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... He's gone, human, you can come out,\" she said, feeling a tingle in her eye. She assumed that you were in what had been your bedroom for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her voice, but didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Meloetta felt your tiny body entering her mouth. Gently, she placed a paw over her oral cavity as her lips parted, letting you leap out of the mouth and onto the black paw waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there...\" she said, her paw moving towards her chest as she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Where's Zekrom?\" you asked, dreading the fact that the dragon might just appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're safe,\" Mew chimed in, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot a skeptical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lost us,\" Meloetta reassured, gently petting you with a paw. A warm feeling spread throughout your whole being as you relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But... he wanted me, no? I don't think he gave up so easily...\" you continued after a moment of silence, fear once again overwhelming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta nodded with a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... he'll probably hunt us down...\" she said. One paw left you as the green-headed giantess placed it on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid me... I told him that you've been living with me for weeks... now he'll search for me when we part...\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly - or very expectedly - Mew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... that might be. But... he can believe it, no?\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her,<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess giggled.<br>\r\n\"Well... he knows you're with Meloetta, no? He can chase her, find her, but you won't be with her...\" she continued, Meloetta adopting a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich suddenly became one of realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta's blue eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\" she considered the idea, discovering that she didn't agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nodded.<br>\r\n\"He can come with me for a while!\" she chimed, looking at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, he'd be safe for a while... and when Zekrom discovers that he isn't with you and comes searching for me, we'll meet again and I'll give him back, so he'll chase me when I don't actually have the human! It's perfect!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air left your lungs... going with Mew would mean leaving Meloetta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...\" you looked at the green-headed pokemon holding you; she answered to your questioning look with a sad one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What if Zekrom comes searching for you first Mew? He'd find the human...\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if he finds me - and he won't - I'll be able to escape... y'know, knowing all the moves is quite useful...\" she remarked. Meloetta sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, we're all jealous of that Mew...\" she intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi isn't...\" Mew snickered, ready to enjoy Meloetta's reaction,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop bringing up Celebi!\" Meloetta cried, cheeks burning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggled, before looking at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say? Do you want to come with me? For some time at least...\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrible idea found its way in your thoughts before you could reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... what if Zekrom finds Meloetta... and makes her tell him where we are?\" you wondered, shivering at the perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Meloetta's turn to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're underestimating me, human,\" she said with a half-giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, recalling how powerful her Hyper Voice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What are you going to do?\" Mew inquired again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Meloetta questioningly; she smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's up to you human... I'll accept whatever choice you make, whether you want to stay with me or go with Mew...\" she said with a hint of hope in her voice.</span></div></div>",

I'm going with Mew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head, so that you couldn't see Meloetta's fading away; it looked like it was added to Mew's face, because her smile grew impossibly big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Meloetta muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paws holding you moved forward, gently pressing you into a black surface: her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged back, an aura of sadness forming around the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" you whispered, looking up. You could swear you saw something sparkling under Meloetta's eye, but she quickly shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" she said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are so cute,\" she chimed, her tail coiling around you.<br>\r\n\"Can we go, now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" she said, gently untangling her friend's tail from you.<br>\r\n\"Can you give us an hour or two?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink legendary looked first at you, then at her friend, before smiling and waving a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back, Meloetta flew back, to the other side of the tree and sat down at its foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without saying a word, she hugged you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sadly looked up; now, her tears were free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... I think it's time...\" Meloetta sniffled after crying in silence for an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess wiped her eyes, took a few deep breaths and got up, before flying back to Mew. But she wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything though, her familiar voice rang from above,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you two done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, Mew was staring at you and Meloetta from a branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" the green-headed giantess said as the pink one came down, wearing a solemn expression mixed with an unwell hidden cheerfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, pink paw came forward, expectant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta looked at you, her lips shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without any embarrassment, she pressed them on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt it growing red, but you didn't fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw!\" Mew chimed while Meloetta finally pulled off, shooting one last, sad look, before finally placing you on Mew's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good-bye...\" she whispered, apparently heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you had second thoughts, but you couldn't go back now: if Zekrom ever found you, there would be no more you for Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there would be no more Meloetta for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing with Mew meant safety... for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good-bye...\" you parroted back, sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of yourself,\" Meloetta continued, before looking at Mew,<br>\r\n\"And you take care of him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Mew smiled, extending her free paw, which was grabbed by Meloetta's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two broke and, with one last salute, they flew in opposite directions, much like they had done when you first met Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, this time Mew was the one holding you, and Meloetta was the one leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot the green-headed pokemon one last look full of sadness, before she was engulfed by the vegetation, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... so...\" Mew began as she stared at you. You didn't even register her words.<br>\r\n\"You've been living inside Meloetta for... y'know... right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back, offering a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nodded too. She understood your situation, so she was being careful with words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I can let you do that too... if you'd like?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew could change her insides like Meloetta did? You enjoyed spending time inside Meloetta, so... why not, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... fine...\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, unexpectedly, Mew hugged you.<br>\r\n\"I promise Zekrom isn't going to find you! Me and Meloetta will do our best!\" she chimed, before pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blushing. Mew was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll provide you with a bedroom for now. Then... I'll see what I can do for your entertainment.\" she said, opening her mouth and holding you close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your world became pink and fleshy and soft as the lips fell back in place, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew licked you a few times and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do taste good!\" she chimed, causing you to hold your ears in pain due you being just above her vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the tongue gently moved you towards the abyss that was her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid down her throat. In every other circumstance, you would have screamed in terror, but this time you knew what awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity outweighed sadness a bit as you finally slid into a tight, soft chamber, which was roughly twice your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's stomach, deprived of gastric acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked - was this only a stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, someone giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, noticing a small Mew looking at you cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were used to psychic projections, so you didn't mind the sudden presence aside from you in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry for this, but I didn't have much time to remodel... but don't worry!\" Mew chimed, a tunnel opening beside her.<br>\r\n\"I have your bedroom ready! Wanna see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as the pink pokemon flew to the hole that led, according to Mew, to your new bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the legendary through the passage for a few minutes, before Mew flew into a spherical room, letting you enter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was simple: a completely pink bed, two windows made of sapphire glass and a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can decorate it with anything you want, you just tell me!\" Mew offered, smiling. Clearly, she wasn't an expert when it came to human culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, thanks...\" you distractedly replied, automatically walking to the bed and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But I'd like to be alone for now... d'you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew just smiled, then disappeared, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, you fell on the bed, back-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you felt a sting in your leg, and realized that something was in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for it, pulling out a black ruby you recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta gave it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, sad, as you stared at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Meloetta...</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been staring at that thing for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up, Mew suddenly appeared in your room, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a smile, but it was evident that she was worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry,\" you sighed,<br>\r\n\"But I don't feel like I want to do anything right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled, comprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew closer to your bed, sitting next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you miss her.\" she simply said, causing you to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need to cheer up! I mean, it's not like you won't see her again! I can even let you talk to her!\" Mew reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Can I?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew blushed, and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... maybe not right now... I've tried to contact her, but she didn't respond...\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the legendary smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Meloetta told me that you liked to explore her body - we talked back then,\" she said, noticing your confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to... explore a bit?\" Mew offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that exploring Mew's body could be a good way to keep the your mind off things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you weren't feeling like doing anything right now.</span></div></div>",

With a low grunt you massage your temples with eyes clenched close hoping to ease the pain. \"what happened?\" you mutter to yourself as you slowly attempt to open your eyes only to have the sun momentarily blind your vision. After a second attempt you soon find yourself gazing upwards at the clear blue sky looming high above. \"h-huh!?\" you mutter in complete confusion as you get up in a sitting position. Just how on earth did you make it outside of all places? The last you remembered you were fast asleep at home on your comfy bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling well?\" a soft female voice with a hint of English accent asks out of nowhere. Immediately, you jolt up and turn your head about in an attempt to find the speaker. Just who was it that was with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind you.\" The voice spoke once again. Taking her advice you quickly turn your body around only to gaze upon a completely shocking if not magnificent sight. Looming before you was what could only be classified as a Gardevoir, a ginormous one at that. Her green like hair adorned the top of her head as her crimson eyes were glued down upon your tiny form in a rather calm gaze. Unlike normal pokemon however, she carried a much more human like appearance, as hinted by the rather feminine figure and chest. \"are you unharmed?\" she asks in a soft tone as her head gently tilts to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth was sent agape by the sight of the ginormous pokemon, but not wanting to seem rude you try your best to regain a rather calm composure. \"I-I-i'm fine.\" you reply while clearing your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that is a relief to here.\" she says giving a long sigh as her right hand moves slightly below her neck. You were more confused than shocked by her reply overall. Just why would some strange pokemon, especially one that towers dozens of stories above, you be so concerned about your well being?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"err...no offense Mrs...?\" now that you think about it, you really didn't know what her name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may simply call me Gardevoir.\" she says before slowly getting up and giving a curtsy with her dress. As she does this, a blush and rather confused expression draws upon your face. Well it certainly does seem like she is eloquent both in speech and attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you Gardevoir.\" you reply unsure of just how to present yourself to the gargantuan pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"the pleasure is all mine.\" she says before ceasing her curtsy and returning to her kneeling position. \"It seems you are generally curious as to how you ended up this size, but more importantly...why I was watching you.\" she replies as your eyes widen in surprise by her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-how did you know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have very keen psychic abilities.\" She replies as a warm smile begins to form upon her face. \"and to answer the question about why I was watching over you. Well...I just felt inclined to.\" she replies as a small shade of red began to appear on where her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inclined?\" you say as your brow raises slightly in confusion. \"you mean, you just felt like you needed to watch over me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she nods her head. \"In open fields like this, there are plenty of dangers about.\" She states. \"other pokemon can be wandering about, some that could easily trample or harm you.\" News of this easily send a nervous shudder running up your spine. She was absolutely, one hundred percent correct. If she wasn't here for you then there was no telling just how much longer you would have lasted all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Gardevoir.\" you say with complete honesty. \"If you weren't here, well...I don't know what would happen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem little one.\" she replies giving a small giggle to follow. Her smile soon began to fade away though as her warm gaze turns into something of slight worry. \"But...I'm afraid you being all by yourself would only put yourself in more danger.\" she says whole heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...you do have a point...but...what do you suggest?\" you ask curiously as a blush began to form on Gardevoir's face by the question. awkwardly, she raises her hands on her knees as she began to twiddle her thumbs back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well...\" she stammers. \"y-y-you're more than welcome to stay with me.\" she says as her eyes avert to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you blush slightly from the request as your head simply nods in response. It did seem like the safest choice overall. \"alright then.\" you reply. \"so...are you going to carry me the whole time, I mean I don't want to be a burden or anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir nods her head in response to your question. \"oh! but of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well then, how are you going to carry me?\" you ask curiously. \"hands? shoulder?....top of head?\" you reply as your fingers gestured to each mentioned area. Gardevoir's eyes gaze down upon your form as her blush only seemed to grow deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n-not exactly.\" she says only to confuse you by the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh? what do you mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...I-if I was to carry you by say my hand or head, there could be a high chance that you will get injured if I encountered another vicious pokemon.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...what do you suggest?\" you ask curiously as her blush was now a deep shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well...rather than outside...h-h-how about...\" she stammers as her shoulders began to hunch up slightly. \"..the inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside?\" you repeat only to finally get what she was saying. \"w-wait! y-you want me to go in your body!?\" You couldn't believe it. was she planning on eating you alive!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"p-please don't worry!\" she pleads extending her hand out slightly in hopes of calming your nerves. \"I promise you will be safe inside me!\" she says soon getting down on her knees and hands to have her huge head loom right above you. \"With my psychic abilities, I insure that you'll be unharmed so please....trust me.\" she asks in a pleading tone, almost as if she was begging you to let her do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs confusing and awkward as this request was, you were reluctant to agree with her words. On the other hand though, she was the one who insured you were safe while lying unconscious. After weighing down the choices, as well as feeling a twinge of guilt by her expression, you soon nod your head. \"a-alright then.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a great smile forms on Gardevoir's face as she nods her head. \"thank you.\" Within seconds, she soon stands up giving you a chance to gaze up at her full form in awe. \"now then...how will you enter?\" she asks while still gazing at your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"e-enter?\" you repeat confused by her question.</span></div></div>",

Even in a knelt position, you couldn't help but gaze up in awe at Gardevoir's massive form. While she was the equivalent of a sky-scraping tower at full height, even knelt down her height was comparable to that of a multi-storied building. As you gaze upwards at the huge shadow cast over you, you see a amiable smile quickly forming upon the pokemon's gargantuan face. \"Are you prepared to enter me little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question did seem nerve wracking upon first hearing it, but after heeding her words earlier you slowly begin to nod your head in reply. \"r-right.\" you speak in a loud enough voice for her to hear you. \"but...just how exactly am I going to...well go in through your mouth?\" you curiously question her. As if in reply, Gardevoir lets out a small chuckle before you suddenly find your form being raised upwards from the ground. Immediately, you turn to investigate the cause of your ascension, only to discover Gardevoir's immense green fingers plucking you from the back of your shirt. In only a matter of seconds, you soon find your miniscule form before the presence of her vast face. \"w-well...I guess this will do.\" you announce as if answering your question from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Gardevoir does nothing more but stare at your body with her crimson eyes. After what seemed like a half a minute, she finally spoke. \"I can sense you are nervous about this.\" She states as your body gave a small shudder by the accusation. While you were indeed a bit edgy about the upcoming event, you honestly hoped she wouldn't sense it so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well...I'm a little jumpy.\" you admit wholeheartedly. \"To be honest though...this whole thing is kind of like...well, an amusement park ride.\" you reply finding the whole situation easily comparable to an attraction at a theme park back on earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An...amusement park ride?\" Gardevoir repeats your statement with a confused expression overtaking her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" You reply once again. \"whenever there's some huge attraction...especially one that looks terrifying, people will normally have a huge nervous reaction when waiting to go in. Though usually that nervousness quickly dies down once they actually get on the ride.\" You proclaim while still gazing at her huge red orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir continued to stare at you still quite bewildered by the explanation before finally breaking out in a fit of giggles. \"I see.\" she says with an acknowledging nod. \"so you're afraid of entering me because of my daunting appearance?\" She asks with a slightly cocked head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? n-no!\" You quickly retort while shaking your head side to side. \"what I mean to say is-\" Before even finishing your explanation, Gardevoir's giggles soon turn into a fit of laughter, as if she was planning out the whole reaction outcome of this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a joke Little one.\" she says while gently covering her mouth daintily with her free hand. A shade of red began to fill your face as you too couldn't help but chuckle at her successful ploy. Once the small outburst concluded, Gardevoir soon begins to slowly raise you closer to her face. \"Are you prepared to enter me?\" she asks once again to which you reply with a simple nod. Acknowledging the answer, Gardevoir soon began to open her mouth only to reveal the pink cavern that resided within. From your perspective, you get a perfect view of her slimy pink tongue adorned on the bottom of her mouth like an odd carpet. Surrounding it was a row of pure white teeth similar to that of a human beings very own maw. Deeper within, you easily notice the fleshy reddish walls that made up the furthest reaches of her mouth, as well as the large gaping hole that was the opening to her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you manage to get a good view of the entrails of Gardevoir's gaping maw, You suddenly find yourself getting shoved into the slimy confines. Upon making contact with the massive tongue, a shudder immediately courses down your spine by the odd sensation of the surface. It was a mixture of slimy, warm and soft all in one, something that you never once experienced touching the whole front of your body. Within a matter of moments, the light from outside was soon sealed off as Gardevoir began to close her maw encasing you in complete darkness. Just as darkness filled your whole vision, you soon found your body getting moved all about, coming into contact with several slimy surfaces as the huge tongue you rested on shifted you virtually everywhere. It was clear that Gardevoir was tasting you, and judging by what could only be considered small moans emanating about, she was enjoying it. After mere seconds of getting sloshed about, drenched to the bone with her saliva, you soon find your position shifting once again. This time however, you fell the top of your body quickly sliding down a large fleshy passage before ultimately traversing down a large tunnel. As you began your descent down her huge throat, the slimy walls gently pulsate around you as if eagerly anticipating your arrival into her stomach. After just a matter of seconds, you soon feel your body come into contact with a strange squishy orifice before getting sent straight into Gardevoir's belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, it was squishy, slightly damp, and odd to the touch, but you weren't immediately greeted with a growing pool of acid there to seal your fate. You had trusted her, wholeheartedly, but it was still unnerving going down into another living being's <i>stomach</i>, you had your doubts and would've had them regardless of the Pokemon species. Instead of hearing Gardevoir's voice booming all around you, her voice, now slightly reverberating, echoed around in your head, \"Are you okay, human?\" The sudden voice in your head induced a jump of surprise as you looked around for the source of the voice. Giggling, she continued, \"It's telepathy, silly. I am a psychic-type, remember?\" Right, you thought to yourself, a psychic with telepathy is like a fire-type Pokemon with flames, it's obvious. Before she spoke again, you slowly rose to your feet, unsteadily, and looked around the stomach. It was, far different than what you had imagined, in terms of its lightning and a few of the things in here with you. While it was slightly fleshy and stomach-y, it was also brightly lit by some unknown light source. Using this, you were able to spot the other weird thing about her stomach, these odd ring-shaped platforms dotting the flat-side of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir,\" you curiously asked, \"What are these...things?\" Assuming you meant the rings, she began, \"Teleporters, of a sort. Expecting you wouldn't want to be slowly pushed around my insides through compact and weird tubes in my body, so I set up a little system that allows you to go from place to place. Just walk up to one of the rings, and it'll show you where it leads.\" Deciding to try this out, you walked over to the closest ring and stood in front of it. Recognizing a presence, it glowed softly with blue light and above it, in holographic letters, it read...</span></div></div>",

Immediately, light filled your eyes and you were blinded for a few seconds. A powerful whoosh of wind went around your entire body for a second and when you could see again, you saw what looked to be a master bedroom. It was a big space, considering how small and thin the Pokemon it resided inside of was, being to your size fourteen feet from one wall to another and eighteen in width. This room had little sphincters on both sides of the wall, and she explained, \"This is where you'll spend your nights within my body. The two sphincters lead to a bathroom and a rec room, heated water will be provided for you while you stay inside, so don't worry about that.\" Looking around some more, it came to your attention the room was a little sparse with decor. There was what looked to be a painting of Mt. Coronet, and a few other curious things, but the walls were still void of things. \"Sorry about that,\" She interrupted your thoughts, probably because she read them, \"My body is still currently constructing things for you, so some rooms, such as this one, are missing decorations and the like. Give it some time, when you come back everything should be finished.\" As she spoke, you approached the enormous king-sized bed that sat at the end of the room, placing your hand on it. Though fleshy looking, like the rest of the room, it felt like soft, warm fabric. Deciding to test it further, you leaped into the bed and let out a groan of delight as it sank around you and conformed to your shape. Being a trainer, you had to stay in hotels and motels often, and this bed felt far better than any of those cheap things you slept in, it felt like a fleecy cloud. You'd hardly been inside her for very long, but you were beginning to think you were going to <i><u>love</u></i> your stay inside of Gardevoir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of laying on that incredibly plush bed, you slowly, reluctantly, rose off of it and headed to the teleporter. Returning to the stomach, you looked around for other places to go inside, you had a sudden urge to adventure through your gracious host!</span></div></div>",

A quick whoosh of air, and you were in what seemed to be a long hallway. It seemed to be made of bone, except for where you were standing. You were really floating, in a way, on a psychic platform that trailed on far past your ability to see into wherever this was exactly. Regardless of your odd location, you decided to venture southward, seeing what the long tunnel had to offer. There were teleporters branching off to the left and right every ten feet (at your size) or so, and they had no real definitive way of letting you, the adventurer, know where they went. While you weren't much of the kid for wandering all over the place, you didn't seem to mind being lost and wandering aimlessly throughout your host. It was truly odd, especially considering that content feeling seemed to be growing stronger the further you went. Suddenly, the feeling became overwhelming, and you stopped to turn and look at one entrance, to find that it was a sphincter, and that above, it read '________.' Your interest was peaked now, how was it that this one entrance, amongst all of the other futuristic teleports leading you other places, was making you feel so calm. Deciding to check, you entered through the tiny opening and began walking down a warm, dark tunnel. It was hard to see anything, so you just kept going, closing your eyes as you let that serenity pull you deeper and deeper into this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere exactly are you going?</span></div></div>",

It's making me feel oddly calm, I don't think something bad is on the other side.\" Silently, still nervous, you pushed your arms into the sphincter and began to enter into the fleshy passageway. Once completely in, you felt a light tug and realized the fleshy tunnel was now pulling you along at a decent pace. Oddly enough, the feeling was somewhat pleasant, if slightly unnerving. It was very warm, like a squishy embrace that clung to your small body. After about a minute of travelling up, down, sideways, and every which way, another sphincter opened up and gently pushed you out into a dark chamber. Noticing where her little guest was, she began to speak, \"Ah, I see you've found the chamber where I generate my power to sense emotions. This is the Emotion Core, located directly behind my frontal spike.\" You tried to look around to see anything, but the room was practically pitch-black. All you could feel was warmth, content, happiness. Maybe the point of being in here wasn't to see, it was to <i>feel.</i> \"It feels so, peaceful in here,\" You mumbled, stepping forward into the darkness, \"Is this what you're feeling right now?\" She chuckled softly, the world around you shaking just a bit, \"Some of what you're feeling is from me, but since this power is to sense the emotions of others, and no other Pokemon or humans are nearby, I'd say 90% of what you're feeling is coming from you, and you alone.\"<br>\r\nIt was truly interesting, being able to feel all of this. You would've thought it would feel like nothing special, since it's coming from you, but this room seemed to augment that feeling, and now it was as if it were physically flowing into your body, coursing through every fiber of your being like a warm, soothing pulse. \"This room,\" Gardevoir continued, \"Is probably one of the most interesting you might find inside of me, aside from the Command Center and several other rooms. Seeing how lax it makes you, I'll leave this room open to you at all times, but will warn you if other beings are nearby, as they will interfere with the flowing you're experiencing.\" You mumbled in recognition, standing absentmindedly in the room and just letting yourself slip away, your troubles, cares, and stresses melting out of you to be swarmed with a kind of feeling that everyone should know. \"Since you seem to be enjoying this, I'll move this closer to the Living Quarters, alright?\" \"Yes,\" you quietly replied, \"Thank you, Gardevoir.\"<br>\r\nYou didn't want to move from this spot, but you knew there was more to do, sights to see, interesting and new things to learn about your host and what you'll be running into as you live inside of her. Thinking about that, it made you chuckle to yourself, if someone had told you just yesterday that you'd be standing in the Emotional Core of a Gardevoir, even living inside of her, you wouldn't have believed them, not at all. Yet, here you were, and this room just made you never want to leave your host, even if you were returned to your normal size. Suddenly, breaking you from your blissful mental wandering, your gut let out a low, quiet rumble. You realized then that you hadn't eaten a single thing since this morning when you left, which was well over several hours ago. \"Gardevoir,\" you started, \"Is there somewhere I can go to eat something?\" She quickly responded, \"Oh, yes, here, I'll guide you there!\"</span></div></div>",

To your blushing surprise, her next move was to tug at the top of her dress, pulling down the green portion to her hips. Then you get a glimpse that you knew was once-in-a-lifetime - You got to see Gardevoir's brassiere, which blanketed her breasts with a pattern like a fine bow tie, with tessellating frills on the edges. You tried to edge a little further down her shoulder, to crawl onto her chest and nuzzle onto the undergarment, but she picked you up and held you in front of her smiling face. \"I see someone's really excited about my bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" you replied awkwardly, not even trying to cover your growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose one made of the softest fabric I could find,\" She said alluringly. \"Very lightweight, very breathable... and very lovable.\" As she said the last part, her unoccupied hand reached behind her back, untied her bra strap and let it fall to the ground like a feather. Your cheeks now positively burned at the sight of Gardevoir's uncovered breasts, and she made no pause in placing you love-immobilized body close to one of them. She rubbed at her pink nipple a bit, causing it to open enough for your head to enter. \"Climb in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly took your hands and stretched her tit to fit your legs in, causing Gardevoir to giggle. As you climbed inside slowly and deliberately, you took pride in the sounds of joy and lust that she was outputting from the sensations you gave her, all the way until you were fully inside her soft breasts. They were dimly lit in a dull orange, and the walls seemed to sink at a mere touch. Outside, you felt Gardevoir reaffix her silky bra, and then do the same for her dress top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and get comfortable in there,\" she said, as your world shook slightly from every step Gardevoir took...</span></div></div>",

Above you, Gardevoir simply giggles upon your overall awkward attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"very well then.\" she says with a nod before slowly making her way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-wait! what are you doing!?\" you stammer in shear shock as her colossal feet soon begin to stride their way straight towards you. Each step she took nearly sent you airborne as you feared that you would end up as an accidental stain under her massive soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no need to worry human.\" she spoke in a calm yet dignified manner as her feet begin to close in towards your location. Taking her words to heart, you brace yourself, uncertain of just what she was planning. Within moments, her huge white dress soon towers over you, almost as if it was some sort of massive make shift tent. Underneath her massive frame, you gaze about your shadowed surroundings before slowly averting your eyes skyward. To your shocking surprise, you suddenly found yourself gazing straight upon what could only be considered a massive pair of pure white panties. Like her dignified attitude, they carried a frill like design upon the leg holes as well as a rather cute ribbon like pattern on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes were glued upon the gigantic pair of undergarments, you soon realize that they were slowly beginning to descend straight towards your location. With a sudden kick of reality snapping you out of your trance, you quickly make your way towards the backside of her elegant gown as her rear continued its course downwards. It wasn't too long before Gardevoir was soon in a sitting position, with you standing right before her panty clad rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how's the view human?\" Gardevoir's voice emanates high above in a curious yet rather teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...\" you say trying to think of the best words to describe your predicament. \"you got really cute panties?\" A loud laugh sounds above by your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well thank you.\" she giggles as she slightly wiggles her rear into what looked like a more comfortable position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so...should I just climb inside?\" you ask, uncertain as to how you will enter inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that won't be necessary.\" she replies as the sound of moving fabric suddenly catches your ears. Suddenly a small glimpse of light shines near you as you sot her huge hands enter from the sides of her dress. Carefully, they make their way towards the sides of the waistband before pulling the back fabric downwards before you. Your eyes quickly grow wide as your face becomes an even deeper shade of red as Gardevoirs now revealed rear cheeks were before you. The massive whit canyon that was her butt stood gloriously before you tiny form as you do nothing but stare upon the sight in awe. With the panties now not a problem, she soon moves her hands firmly to both sides of her cheeks before spreading out the white skin creating her crevice of a crack. Within seconds, her massive rear opening was in view. \"does this help?\" she asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"d-definitely.\" you reply as your eyes gaze upon the rather large hole in shear surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well?\" she says in a rather teasing tone. \"ready to venture into the depths of my body?\" she asks followed by a small giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"r-right.\" you nod as your feet slowly begin to make their way towards the massive pokemon's exposed rear. As you were now before her massive rear cheeks you couldn't help but extend a hand out and gently feel the surface of her mighty butt. To your surprise, the feeling of her rump was extremely soft to the touch, almost like that of a human. The warmth that radiated from her body towards your hands give you a somewhat unique feeling of relief and bliss. After a few seconds passed by, you then proceeded onwards before you were now staring face to face at Gardevoirs gigantic rear opening. Slowly, you pat the surface of the opening only to receive a small shudder from Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"o-oh my.\" she stammers in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...here goes nothing.\" With a deep breath you soon place both of your hands slightly within the gigantic fleshy hole as you slowly began to part the fleshy entrance. Above Gardevoir gasps from the strange sensations caused by your actions as you were soon gazing into the pink fleshy tunnel that was her rear hole. Inside a great warmth radiated about, and to your surprise, the scent inside seemed to be just as clear as like the one outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"pleasant travels.\" Gardevoir says with a small giggle as you soon place your foot upon the fleshy ring of her rear hole. With a good footing achieved, you soon began to clamber your way within the pokemons huge back end. Each step you made sunk down slightly upon the fleshy floors as the great opening behind you soon sealed up casting you in slight darkness.</span></div></div>",

The sultry air that was baking in the Pokemon's internals slaps you like you've stepped into a sauna. You struggle to find footing in this fleshy, alien environment. To prop yourself up, you place a hand on the intestinal wall. Your hand sinks into the surface, breaching a coating of clear slime that lines the surface. You cringe as the liquid begins to slick down your arm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel a tingle on your mind. \"Are you alright down there?\" It's Gardevoir's telepathy. \"Things haven't gone pear-shaped, have they?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\" you reply. You hope her telepathy is two-way. \"I'm fine. Things are just, uh...\" you hold your slime-soaked hand in front of you. Some of the goo begins to dribble down. \"...Things are just a little bit gross.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your cheeks flush red. But you're not embarrassed.

Groans and grumbles of her organs sound from the shadows.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly you're pulled backward as if someone pulled a string on your back. You tumble back to the exit-entrance of Gardevoir's arse as the lady-like Pokemon stands up tall. When you collide with the puckered flesh, it flutters and you feel Gardevoir's flush through your mindlink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh!\" She exclaims. \"Pardon me, small one. I'm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not accustomed to this. I'll be sure to watch my movements.\" Inside, your back is resting against Gardevoir's twitching exit. You feel as if her internals are somehow growing even warmer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Small one,\" Gardevoir says, \"please take note of your positioning\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust as I watch my own.\" For a moment, what she is saying whizzes over your head. One jittering twitter from the asshole behind you reminds of where you are. You don't waste any time before gripping the slick, slimy walls and climbing away from her sensitive exit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You clamber up and around the bend of her rectum as the world around you sways with graceful, floating motion of Gardevoir's gait. By now the heat loses some of its edge. In fact, you could almost call it cozy. With comfort comes the prick of tedium. And tedium breeds curiosity. You gaze deeper into the dark depths of her intestines and think, <i>what lies beyond?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You rise to your feet. You're going to find out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take a step forward. Bowel slime squelches underfoot. Not the most triumphant first step to an adventure, but eh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It's not going to stop you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon you find your first major obstacle. The path ventures up--straight up. The intestines bend upwards and rise overhead. If you entered from the other end, this wouldn't of even been a hiccup. You would've just slid down like the bowels, er, \"intended audience.\" But you coming from the rear entrance is making things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 difficult.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yet, unfazed you are as you grip the moist flesh and begin your ascent. The tunnel pulses slightly under your touch. Can Gardevoir feel this? Or are you deep enough and small enough so that you could get lost forever\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand she would ever know?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The existential ennui is exhilarating! But you really should be focused on not falling. Last thing you want is to go splat in butt-slime.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like Jack and the Beanstalk, you climb the metaphorical beanstalk and find yourself in a whole new world. Although your \"new\" world looks a lot like the one you left--only slightly smellier.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In addition, the drum of Gardevoir's ever-present heartbeat and the gurgle of her belly are louder than ever. It appears you're getting closer. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honestly, your adventure has been fun so far. But is it safe to continue? You're pretty sure Gardevoir doesn't know you're here. If something happens to you now, who knows how long it'd take before Gardevoir notices something amiss?<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

She motions you to step towards her, and you immediately do so, standing right between her legs in a near-instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush more at the sight; you were right up against Gardevior's panties, which were as palure white as her skin. A ribbonlike pattern was on the front, and from the frills near her legs you could see hints at the pink flesh hidden beneath them. You walk up and gently brush the soft fabric. \"Wow, you have really nice panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like my choice of underwear,\" She replies, looking down at you with a smile, \"But we both know you'll like what's underneath it more.\" And then with a quick motion, she pulls down her panties, revealing to your flustered face her vagina, which was slightly taller than you were and an incredible pink compared to the white around it. The organ's lips seemed to pulse rapidly, as though they absolutely demand that you go inside them. \"Here, let me open it for you,\" Gardevoir adds, and pulls apart her labia to provide a larger entrance. \"Like I said, no need to be shy! Just walk right in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You respond, and you take your first steps inside her vagina. As soon as your first foot lands on the soft tissue, the place starts to shudder a bit, and you hear Gardevoir giggle from the sensation you gave her. The deeper you went, the louder she crooned, as she rubbed herself to make sure you got all the way in. Once you reached her cervix, she stopped, and you felt her gingerly stand up and reaffix her panties, darkening her privates somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, but be gentle~\" She says with a giggle, and you feel her walking off to who knows where, carrying you in her most sensitive spot...</span></div></div>",

You turn left and put your hands forward to feel for anything. You take a step forward and the ground seems unusually solid and carpet like. You take another step and your hand touches a wall, strange enough its solid and feels like wall paper. Then you feel around and your hand bumps into a small object that intrudes from the wall.

How bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and face the light source, \"what the Fuck, a fireplace\" you say to yourself upon seeing the the stone fire place.

Ahead of you was an incredibly strange, grey cliff, and looking up you saw- Wait a minute...

I am anything BUT one of those stick-up-their-ass males!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" Your eyes have finally adjusted to the sunlight, and you could now clearly see the Machoke's angry face. And as you looked over its body, you saw clear signs that it was, actually, a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason, she was not wearing the standard Machoke belt, and the waistband of her boxer shorts seemed to curve away from her midriff - enough so that you could see the very top of her slit. Above that were some well-defined abs, but they were partly obscure by here greatest endowment - her breasts, each slightly larger than her head, with nipples clearly visible to you. You try not to stare at her chest, blushing. \"Sorry, s-ma'am, I just never expected a Machoke that was... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I suppose I understand,\" she said, crouching down on one knee towards you, \"We female Machokes are a bit rare, and a lot nicer. But back to my question; what's a tiny thing like you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I-I don't know,\" You answer carefully, \"I just remember falling asleep, and then this flash of pain, and now I'm here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, interesting...\" The Machoke put her hand on her chin, pondering something. \"Alright then, how about I help you out then?\" She gives you a big, friendly reptilian smile. \"The name's Macha, and I'll be giving you shelter in me until this is figured out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shelter? In you?\" You're surprised by Macha's kind offer. \"Like, you'll keep me at your house or something and take care of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" She responds, \"I mean shelter WITHIN me!\" To your surprise, Macha proceeds to...</span></div></div>",

He was a kinky little Furret,\" She elaborated, absentmindedly groping her tits, \"loved rubbing himself everywhere in there, but he ultimately made my pecs tougher and my milk tastier.\" She saw you cringe at the last part, and quickly added \"Don't worry, he survived. Actually just let him out of my breasts yesterday.

Once you fell, you found yourself right at the top of Macha's somehow illuminated stomach, which had a few digested berries scattered around. You braced yourself for a watery landing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And instead you land on dry, rubbery ground. Confused, you looked around - for some reason, there were no stomach acids in sight; those few berries you saw were somehow being absorbed into the stomach tissue. You did also notice the entrances Macha mentioned, all of them labelled with where they went, be it her head, intestines, liver, lungs, heart, or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abs?\" You say, confounded by one of the signs. \"I can climb inside some of your muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of,\" Macha replied, stretching, \"It's just a small chamber that rests just behind my abdominal muscles - my six-pack makes a great window, by the way - which I've turned into a fitness center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me!\" She giggled, slapping her chest proudly, \"Not only can you watch me work my muscles from there, but you can work out yourself! Are you interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very!\" You reply, looking towards the abs pathway from her stomach.

Interested in how a Furret managed to climb inside, you rubbed it - and to your surprise, her tit opened, allowing you to see a little bit inside of it. Overjoyed, you forced your whole body, hearing Macha croon as you stretched out her sensitive tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, her nipple closed back to the size of a pinprick, although you saw it was still erect. All around you was the soft, pillowy flesh that made up her mammaries, which seemed to give off a glow that provided decent light. Far in the back, you could see some milk dripping down to form a puddle. You jumped for joy at the feeling of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, I can tell that someone's happy!\" Macha giggled, and you felt her squeezing and shaking her boobs. \"You won't mind if I wear my sports bra, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Suddenly, you felt the ground shake and heard a snap. Looking through your tiny tit window, you saw nothing but black fabric. Then it made sense. \"What's so special about your bra, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, this!\" She started to jump in place, letting you feel her breasts practically leaping up and down, although you somehow didn't get tossed in the air with them. She then slapped them with her palms a few times, and you saw the walls rippling from the impact. \"My brassiere is two cup sizes smaller than me, which causes my boobs to move more than usual. But it helps keep them firm whenever I go topless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh, neat!\" You rested yourself on one of the walls, sinking in a little into the breast flesh. You felt Macha lift up her rack a bit, clearly unhindered by what would normally restrain a human lady's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, my little guy, what do you want to do in my prides and joys?\"</span></div></div>",

Staring up at her holes, you breathed in and cherished her musky womanhood smell, your hand drifting down to rub at your own crotch. Around three-quarters of the way up her legs, she stopped her shorts' ascent, allowing you a clear shot of her vagina and ass (with a pinprick of a urethra between them). \"Alright,\" Macha said, \"It's gonna get tight once these are back in place, so I'm gonna need you to choose your entrance now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choose from what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, you can crawl inside my vagina.\" She briefly opened her labia with two fingers, giving you a hint of the pink chamber behind it. \"It's soft and velvety, you'll give me good sensations, you can see me have sex first-hand... heck, you can check out my prized ovaries, if that tickles your fancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you respond absentmindedly, too aroused by her sex to give a proper response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, for a different experience, you can climb in my rear.\" Macha slapped her butt cheeks, showing how amazingly firm they were. \"I can give you a massage from between them, you can swim in my bladder, and climb my spinal cord...

She was right about how tight it would be - You were pressed deeply into her crotch, her hairless pussy pulsing from your sensitive touch as she walked. Risking it, you manage to climb inside to her delight, discovering a softly lit chamber that was barely able to hold you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" You say to your hostess, \"You look ravishing both inside and outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Macha croons, her liquids dripping off the vagina's walls onto you. \"Go deeper...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the small entrance to her cervix, and start crawling through it, much to her delight. At the other end of this tunnel of love was a giant dome of a room, with a fleshy floor that felt like the finest silks. An interesting organic light hung at the top of the room, and two small tubes appeared in the walls across from you. \"Whoa, your womb is incredibly pretty!\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep~\" Macha croons, stroking herself right above her boxers, \"it's a shame that my young don't spend any time inside it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you know, we Pokemon are, well, oviparous creatures~\" Macha answered, now climbing down a cliff face with a healthy blush, \"So when someone gets lucky with me, the egg forms, rolls right past my uterus, and plops right out~\" As she jumps down and lands, she clutches her crotch sadly. \"I'm disappointed in how this never gets used by anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey, I'm using it!\" You respond as you massage the tissue, \"That counts for something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacha giggles. \"How sweet of you~\" She says, continuing on down the path. A part of her wants to just take off her boxers, partake wholeheartedly in your amazing stimulation... But she knew to save that for later.

Fortunately, this wasn't as terrible as you thought. While you had expected her ass to smell absolutely rancid, Macha's rear instead had a pleasant aroma not unlike a field of fresh flowers. Her flesh itself was cleaner than expected, too - not a single hint of anything visible on her anus. As you snuggled a little more within her ass, you smiled. Maybe this whole thing won't be so bad-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time for a run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze. Was Macha really going to do that? To start running while you were in her ass, grinding you down and tormenting you like you were a mere butt plug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she actually started moving, you were more than surprised - rather than crushing you painfully, her quick-shifting cheeks felt very gentle on your body, like a high speed masseuse. You sighed as a feeling of relief washed over your body, especially in one <i>very</i> specific spot. \"Ahh... This feels so lovely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacha giggled. \"Hey, come on now, you haven't seen the rest of my ass!\" Choosing to obey her, you carefully sidle through to her rectum, and tumble in with little resistance. The sight took your breath away - rather than a smelly colon with waste all around you, you seemed to be in a spacious room situated in her pelvic girdle. In front of you, what could only be her bladder and kidneys towered above you, and behind those was what appeared to be her reproductive system. \"Impressed now?\" She said, her voice now echoing all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say...\" You weren't too sure how to say this. \"...I was expecting your ass to be more... Cramped. And dirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacha laughed again. \"You aren't the first to say that! Let's just say my body's not a standard one.\" You heard her slap her rear firmly. \"Plus, my body doesn't need much more than a few berries, which are absorbed into my stomach wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so how do you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, mostly it comes out as sweat. Or my urine, which is about as pure as fresh water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards her bladder again. Now, you felt the urge to find a way inside it and swim in it, like it was your personal swimming pool. You took a few steps forward... And then saw two odd holes in the floor, whose paths shifted in time with her running. \"Uh, Macha, what's with these holes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, those are my legs!\" She said, excited. \"I would love if you went down them sometime - I love feeling something within my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now you have a few ideas of how to pass the time here. So, what first for you...?</span></div></div>",

You tried to recall the last thing you remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be interrupted by some thudding earthquakes that nearly toppled you over. Turning towards the source, you see towering above the grass a Dragonite, covered with bright orange scales with white on the chest. And not only that, but it was plain to see that she was a lady - if not by the breasts she had, but by the teal bikini she wore to compliment her wings. With every graceful step she took, another quake resounded in the ground, sounding ever-louder as she got closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd placed her foot right on top of you, squishing you into the soil! Instinctively, you scream, causing her to pause. She backs up, lifts her foot away from you, and looks down at your indented form with worry. \"Oh my gosh!\" She says, placing a hand to her mouth, \"I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never... Better...\" To your surprise, you DID never feel better in your life. Almost like she hadn't crushed you. At those two, gasped words, the Dragonite's expression held a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Thank goodness for that,\" she said, beaming down, \"I wouldn't want to feel terrible about crushing a defenseless human, even one as small as you! Oh, silly me!\" she says, her quick motion making her breasts wiggle, \"My name's Dragonite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello, Dragonite,\" you stammer, but your attention is moreso on her bathing suit. \"Uh,  why are you wearing...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This old thing?\" She finishes your sentence, lifting one of the bra cups and putting it back, \"I'm walking down to the beach. Mostly to lounge in the sun, but also to look for people in need. Hey! Maybe you can come along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Dragonite gently lifts you into her hand, holding you up to her bright face. \"I can't just leave you here, not if some other pokemon can crush you like I can! Although, come to think of it,\" she put her other hand on her chin, as though in deep thought, \"I couldn't just leave you on my shoulder or anything... Aha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You ask, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can bring you along INSIDE my body!\" She cheers, although her smile fades a bit when she sees your look of horror. \"Oh don't worry, my body is perfectly safe. I've had many small pokemon inside me before, and they all came out perfectly fine!\" You felt better, if not totally convinced, after that last bit. \"And to make it better for you,\" Dragonite added, \"I'll let you choose where in my body you enter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean, 'choose'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple!\" She pointed to her mouth and stretched her brassiere. \"Do you want to climb inside me from up here...\" She lowered her hand down to her crotch, lifting up her bottoms a bit. \"...Or down there?\"</span></div></div>",

Your entire body feels like it was continuously prodded with nails, and it takes all the energy you can muster just to stand up. Eventually, though, the painful feeling dissipated, and you blinked a bit to take in your surroundings: You were in the middle of some dense forest, with trees and plants that seemed to tower far above you. That was certainly strange - you don't remember falling asleep in a forest! Even stranger was that all the foliage seemed to be moving, yet you could tell that the ground you were on wasn't. Speaking of the ground, you looked down at it, and were surprised. It looked a lot like a leaf-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you're awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-a leaf that suddenly shook as a female voice seemed to echo all around you. Yelping, you stumble a bit and land on your knees. \"W-where did that come from?\" You said, with an obvious tone of fear in your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look below the edge of the leaf,\" said the voice again softer, and this time the leaf's convulsions seemed more... subdued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding no reason not to disobey, you hurry over to the edge of the leaf, and look down. Beneath you is a thick pink ring, with what appear to be eyes along the base of it. Below it was what looked like a yellow bag, with dark splotches on it. It takes a moment for you realize what it is... But it hits hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holycrapholycrapholycrapyou're a GIANT VICTREEBEL!?\" You stammer out in shock, quickly scooting away from the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say it so loudly,\" she responds, moving her mouth such that you end up back in the center of the leaf, \"But at least now I know we share the same expletive usage when coming across something weird. Although, it's not me who's giant... It's you who's tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" And then it hit you. This forest didn't have giant fauna - you had merely shrunken! \"How did I- Why did- What happened to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew,\" Victreebel rumbled, stopping in a flowery clearing, \"But while you try and answer those conundrums, why don't I offer you the solace of shelter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelter? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like SO!\" She suddenly shouted, her leaf launching you up into the air like an arboreal catapult. When you looked down, you saw - to your shock and horror - that Victreebel's mouth was wide open, and she did naught but stand still as you fell screaming into her cavernous maw. You squeezed your eyes shut, waiting for the cold embrace of death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what you got instead was the rubbery embrace of Victreebel's insides. You stood up, confused; high above you, you could see what you assumed were the flycatcher pokemon's organs, resting and obscuring the sky visible through her gullet - a sky that was replaced with a dim green as her leaf moved back into position. \"I appreciate the enthusiasm you have for this, but you don't have to scream so negatively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like how YOU don't have to tell ME that I wasn't going to get DIGESTED?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry! I'd gotten ahead of myself back there!\" She said, surprisingly apologetically. \"Look, I'll sweeten the deal for you - you stay safe inside my body, and you can go anywhere in here, and do whatever you want! Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You figured you deserved more from a pokemon that launched you into her belly, but decided not to invoke her possible wrath. Instead, you turned your focus toward a treelike spiral staircase you shared the landing with. Part of it spiraled up towards Victreebel's stomach area, while the other went down to... You assumed it was her loins. But not wanting to waste the opportunity she gave you, you quickly took to the stairs and went...</span></div></div>",

You took a good look at her tail, shining from the refracted sunlight, and watched mesmerized as the same light shifted across her many pink scales. You also made note of the two shells adorning her chest... but tried not to get distracted by the large mounds beneath them. Her sleek form coils up, as she takes a large interest in a school of fish passing by. Then she lunged forward and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do nothing but watch in petrifying horror as one of the fish was stabbed by her proboscis, its convulsions becoming slower and slower as the Gorebyss became a deeper shade of pink. You're more afraid now - if this thing were to see you- And it just turned in your direction, thanks to an involuntary gasp and a release of bubbles. As her slender body slithers through the water towards you, you curl up into a shivering ball with your eyes tightly shut. \"Don't eat me! Don't eat me! For the love of Arceus PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected that any moment now, the Gorebyss would pierce your frail body and suck out your own bodily fluids to leave you a lifeless husk. But it never seemed to happen. Instead, you heard undoubtedly feminine giggling. When you cautiously opened your eyes, you were directly in front of one of her eyes - an eye as big as your whole body. \"Eat you?\" She said, still recovering from her laughing fit, \"Why would I ever want to eat something as adorable as you?\" She backed away from you, and held out her tail as though it were a hand. \"Sorry for scaring you, little guy. My name's Gabriella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" You flusteredly reply as you shook her fin, both from having just been afraid of dying, and from glancing once more at her shells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I thought humans lived up on the surface,\" she said, peering once more at you, \"and weren't normally so small... Are you lost, by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you would believe,\" and then you told Gabriella what you knew had happened to you. She nodded in understanding. \"I see... Alright then, how about this: I'll give you shelter, and I'll also help you solve what caused this to happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" You looked around the surrounding reef, slightly confused. \"So... where is this shelter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking at it!\" She said, stretching her Gorebyss body in a strangely suggestive manner. \"It's mobile, warm, soft, and has free meals, just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for it to all click. \"Wait, by shelter you mean...? So you ARE going to eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella laughed again. \"Oh come on, I did say I couldn't eat something as cute as you! Besides, my mouth is made for piercing - you'd never fit!\" She motioned her lower half towards you, drawing your eyes to a near-invisible slit. \"I could let you climb inside my cloaca... Or, since you seem to like them so much...\" She then used her fin to lower her shells like they were on a hinge, making the water around you boil as you saw her amazingly well-endowed chest. \"Oh come on, I saw your eyes keep fluttering towards my breasts, no need to be so embarrased!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" you apologized for no reason in particular. What a strange day so far - you've been shrunken underwater, and a Gorebyss is letting you use her privates as your apartment? Certainly not something you see everyday. Still blushing profusely, you decided to go inside...</span></div></div>",

Yes, it would appear that Scrafty has decided to keep you in his pants, right near not just his cock but a bunch of other thing's he's collected. Then the loose ground starts to shift a little as he begins to walk. \"It'll be nice and cool at my den, but I hope you're fine with me taking you there in my, er, junk drawer,\" he said, absentmindedly scratching his swinging balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's not so bad down here.\" Indeed, despite you still feeling the sun on your back, Scrafty's loins seem more temperate than sweltering. He chuckles, pulling his pants a bit and causing you to bounce. \"I figured such. You won't believe how many pokemon want a chance to ride in my air-conditioned crotch.\" He rubbed a hand down his gray belly, which you notice is causing his like-colored cock to stiffen a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you've had other pokemon in your pants before?\" You blush while looking at his growing manhood. \"Seems... kinda unsafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Scrafty tugs at his pants again, making you bounce once more. \"Anything in my pants, be it a fancy trinket or a cheerful drilbur, manages to stay in there no matter how I pull it around. See?\" To prove his point, he shifted the skin rapidly up past his pecs, down below his balls, and all around his waist a few times, and despite the speed at which it shifted none of its contents, including you, spilled out onto the hot desert sands. \"And if someone's really roughhousing down there, my private parts are more than sturdy enough to withstand any blow! Although I will admit, it does tickle a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine...\" You can't look away from Scrafty's testicles, especially as they sway in time with his steps. He apparently realized this, and let out another chuckle. \"You know, if you want to climb down inside my cock, it's alright by me. You wouldn't be the first one to go in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took you a little by surprise. \"Wha-? You mean you've had-? In your-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" He fondled himself again, his cock finally at full hardness, \"A surprising amount of younger pokemon enjoy swimming around in my testicles. And I don't mind - in fact, I've gotten lots of mates with their help from within my balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" You began to picture it: Scrafty, in the midst of loving another pokemon, moaning from the excited wriggling of some young pokemon deep within his crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, if you aren't a fan of splashing around in spunk,\" he added, \"You can always climb inside my ass instead.\" He wiggled it a bit to get your attention. \"Don't worry, it's cleaner than you think it is. And its quite roomy in there - I had a bayleef climb in there once, and she didn't even make a bit of a bulge in my butt!\" He slapped his rear for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour interest is piqued by this point.

Eventually though, he stopped walking, and you could tell that this time he hadn't stopped for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!

A moment later, you found yourself lying on a stone cavern floor, surrounded in a splatter of whiteness as you felt the cool evening air. You turned around and saw Scrafty, still gasping for breath, his cock hanging out over his pants as it slowly became flaccid again. \"That... Was... Great...\" he panted, pulling his pants back up and walking shakily over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" you responded, the semen falling off you as he gingerly picked you up.

Scrafty sighed and shook his head, then seemed to think of something. \"Oh, before I forget, I'd like to introduce you to someone today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" And then you heard that someone yawning from deep within the cave. \"Morning, Scrafty,\" she said, stepping into the sunlight - and you saw that she was a female scrafty. \"I'd like you to meet Scanny, my primary mate,\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanny looked no different from a regular scrafty, although her crest resembled a ponytail more than a mohawk. Her \"hood\" had a part in front that covered her breasts, with a noticeable cleavage window on top. And she apparently slept with her pants low enough for you to see a bit of slit. \"I assume this is the human you told me about?\" she asked, leaning over you and holding out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is!\" Scrafty responded, as you stepped onto Scanny's palm. \"Found him just yesterday, stranded in the middle of nowhere at that small a size. Strange, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" Scanny put you back down after examining you closely, sitting down and scratching her belly. You, meanwhile, turned to look at Scrafty. \"So, any ideas on how to unshrink me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he started, \"I remembered finding something a little while back, some sort of human invention, that sorta looks like a shrink ray. We could probably start with that, and- hang on.\" He began rummaging through his pants. \"Where is it? I know it was here last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me.\" Scanny leaned one hand on Scrafty's pecs, and put her other down his crotch, and she giggled at the resulting blush. A short while later, she pulled the shrink ray from his loins and held it up - then frowned. \"isn't this just one of those shopping scanner things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, well,\" Scrafty blushed harder as Scanny rolled her eyes, setting the scanner next to you on the table. \"I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go out to find a solution. And perhaps the human can come with one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she said, beaming with joy and cupping her rack. \"You can ride around with one of us, like you did yesterday. I guarantee it'll be better than just den-sitting for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly smiled. Now all you had to do was pick which of the two you would ride with - and in.</span></div></div>",

However, you take more note in how low her yellow garment happens to be. \"Er, any reason why your pants aren't covering your...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason,\" she rubs her crotch a bit, making it pulse. \"It's just a way of showing other 'mons that I'm... available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Available!?\" You weren't expecting her to say something like that. \"B-but I though Scrafty was your mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary,\" Scanny explained, \"He's my PRIMARY mate. We pokemon tend to settle down with one of our own, but we don't mind when we choose to meet with another. For instance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops in her walk, and you peek out over her pants to see her gazing towards a Krookdile. \"Look at that handsome hunk there. Strong jaws, muscled arms, flexible tail... and big where it matters most.\" She looks down at you, a wide blush on her face. \"Not only does Scrafty know that I've made love to him, but he wholeheartedly approves of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" You sorta understood it now - pokemon mating apparently functioned a bit like polygamy. Scanny began walking again, hips moving in a pronounced sway as she approaches the Krookodile. \"I don't suppose you'd mind me walking with him for a bit?\" She asks you, stroking her crotch again. \"I'd enjoy if you checked out one of my 'rooms,' if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured (as she probably did) that seeing you in her pants would likely make him... surprised.

I had a totodile slurp up a full bladder's worth once - according to him, it was good for both his teeth and his stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't go wrong with listening to your host, so you dunked your head in briefly to gain a mouthful. It tasted surprisingly sweet - almost like apple cider, which was that last thing you expected pokemon waste to taste like. As you felt your stomach accepting its treat, you noticed two pathways near the roof, from which the urine poured down like waterfalls. \"Are those your kidneys up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They most certainly are!\" Scrafty exclaimed. \"They're two-way, just so you know - you can climb inside them to enter my bloodstream, and who knows what you might find through there! Or, you can keep swimming around in there until we reach my den - I'll probably have to empty the tank by then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the choice you were given.

Quickly, you bring your hands up to shield yourself if they noticed you... But when they do, they respond not with attacks but with looks of bemusement. \"Well now, my queen,\" croons the Nidoking in a sultry voice, \"It seems a tiny fellow has decided to visit our secluded hot springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so one has!\" Nidoqueen walks along the edge towards you, and tenderly strokes your head with an enormous clawtip. \"And what brings you around here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...

You slowly rouse yourself from slumber, even as your whole body aches and tells you otherwise-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once your eyes open, you find yourself adrenaline-awoken by what laid before you. The only thing coming out of your mouth was a steady string of \"OhCrudOhCrudOhCrud\"s, as you tried to back away from the humoungous Tyrunt that stood before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what kind of a way is that to react to the girl who saved your life?\" Said the voice again - only now you noticed it coming from the Tyrunt's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you calmed yourself down and tried to make sense of all this. \"Wait... Wait... So... I was saved... By a giant... female... Tyrunt?\" you asked, hyperventilating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, actually, just a normal-sized, female Tyrunt,\" she replied. At your newfound look of shock, she added \"Um... I guess you aren't normally that size, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" You shout, beginning to pace, \"I don't get it! I was perfectly fine last night! Nothing weird that I can think of! And yet somehow, I've gotten stranded in the forest, at the size of a mouse, in front of a dinosaur pokemon, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, please!\" Tyrunt pleaded, holding out her tiny arms. \"L-look, how about I take you in until you figure out what happened? I can promise you a nice shelter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" At the promise of shelter, you perked up, excited at the idea of having a roof over your head. \"Really? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Well...\" Tyrunt put a claw to her chin, as if deliberating how to say what she wanted to say. Eventually, though, she decided on being blunt:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's inside my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face contorted once more into that of fear, and she quickly worked to defuse it. \"No, no! It isn't that bad! All of my friends have gone inside of me multiple times, and all of them turned out fine! I-I don't even digest food the same way you humans do! I wouldn't even offer this if it wasn't safe! Don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the massive theropod, and see tears beginning to leak out of her eyes. You figured it would be best to trust her words- after all, it didn't seem like you had any better options right now. \"Alright, I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" That seemed to cheer up Tyrunt almost instantly, judging by how she was shaking her tail. \"Okay, how about you choose where you want to... well... climb in.\"</span></div></div>",

Blue dominates its color scheme, with the exception of a few darker spot here and the cream underbelly. Its clawed foot comes crashing down next to you, emitting a quake that sends you onto your back. Looking up, you see it looking down on you, its deep red eyes meeting your own, its huge ears twitching in the afternoon breeze, seeming to focus in on you. You stare at each other for a few minutes, before finally, you hear its soft, feminine voice say, \"Are you... a tiny human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deduce that you've been discovered by a Nidorina. You nod nervously as she picks you up in her gigantic paws, examining you closely. \"What on earth happened to you, little guy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the concern in her voice, you slowly start to calm down. \"I don't know,\" you squeak. \"I felt dizzy all of a sudden and passed out, and when I woke up, bam, I was shrunk.\" You look around every which way in hopes of finding anything that could possibly relate to how you got like this, but all you see is your bag on the ground and the giant Pokemon who found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't safe out here, there are a lot of hostile Pokemon roaming around here this time of year who would love to have something like you as a snack. You're lucky I found you first. A Zangoose or something would have been a nasty surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" you say. \"What am I going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidorina rubs the little nub where her horn would be, thinking deeply about the situation, soon arriving at a possible, if not interesting solution. \"I have an idea, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perk up upon hearing those words. Did she think of a way to get you back to normal? Or at the very least, keep you safe until you find a way? Your hopes skyrocket as you eagerly ask, \"What is it, what is it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a really weird idea. You sure you want to hear it?\" You say yes, thinking nothing could be weirder than what's already happened today. \"Well... I was thinking... maybe you could... live inside of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback in surprise. Not only was this giant Pokemon friendly, but it was offering to help you after being shrunk for unknown reason. But nothing could prepared you for her ridiculous suggestion. \"You're suggesting I live... in your body?\" Her beautiful blue face slowly turned a bright red as you repeated her words. \"But won't your stomach acids digest me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she reassured. \"I'm an herbivore, my body is designed to digest plants and berries. My acids aren't strong enough to hurt you in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder the situation for several minutes while Nidorina continues to stare at your tiny body, patiently awaiting your answer. On the one hand, she's right. You're in a dangerous situation with all the wild Pokemon running around, and there is no guarantee the next one you meet will be as friendly as this one. On the other, living in a Pokemon's body? That's the weirdest thing you've ever heard! But... she is the one who offere, and it's not like you have any better options at this point... What the hey, you have nothing to lose, you decide to go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do it.\" You could almost see the joy in Nidorina's deep red eyes, making you feel good in thinking you made the right choice. \"So, do I just let you swallow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a brief moment, she answers, \"Well, there is that, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could also enter through my butt or... my... you know...\" she says while looking down at her crotch. You both blush in embarrassment at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some careful consideration, you look up at the poison giantess and say, \"Okay, I'll enter through your...\"</span></div></div>",

After all wouldn't it be rude to sneak into the Nidorina in such ways just after meeting her? Not that you weren't tempted. It was more trying to not to abuse of her trust, specially since she literally was holding your life in her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you wanted was to make her regret picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidorina nodded, relieved you accepted her proposal. \"Good. Everything will go okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt it. Thank you for protecting me\" you say with honesty. It was going to be a strange experience but you were willing to see how it'd go. Better than than dying as a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell on your back when Nidorina lifted you to her mouth, opening it to show rows of teeth and a tongue, practically throwing you on it. You fell and stood up as soon as possible, trying not to soak up in saliva. \"That was not delicate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, maybe I should have let you in by yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should swallow you, but I'll wait until you're ready. This must be complicated for you, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was. Half an hour ago you would have never imagined you'd be getting eaten by a random Pokemon. \"It is. I'm worried too because you're a Poison type and that doesn't tend to mix well with life...I won't be in contact with poisons in your stomach, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't, I have control over my poison\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat soothed your worry. Facing the throat you closed your eyes. \"Okay, let's do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidorina didn't reply, instead went ahead and swallowed you. You felt the tongue pressing you for a moment against the roof of the mouth before falling into the throat. The journey through the esophagus was dizzying and later you would realize you don't remember anything of it besides profound instinctive terror, despite knowing the poison giantess wouldn't hurt you in any way. Soon you fell into the stomach, bouncing into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting down you look at the vast empty space around you. You trusted she was right about her acids not hurting you in any way, but it was nice to see there were none. You weren't exactly willing to test it, after all. \"I'm here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll go home now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how I can return to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidorina hesitated a moment before answering. \"I don't know. Maybe I'll be able to think of something but I don't think I'll personally be able to do it. Meanwhile relax and don't worry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted Nidorina didn't have the abilities needed to help you in that way, and looked around again. There was more than enough space for you to stand up, you wouldn't be able to reach the ceiling unless there were several people of your size forming a tower. You also were interested to know more about Nidorina, too. Having lots of time to kill you decided to idly do something.</span></div></div>",

What you did find certainly warranted asking - some sort of sphincter, although it seemed clear to you that it did not seem to act like one. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see you've discovered my body travel system!\" Nidorina said, as though it was normal for her. You, on the other hand, are still incredibly confused. \"Your... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how to explain it...\" She paused briefly. \"It's sort of like my circulatory system, but for, er, 'passengers' like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've had other people inside you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually. I only know I have it because my mom told me... But I know where it can take you!\" She suddenly perked up, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can go to my upper region,\" she said, pressing her hand to her belly and rubbing it up. \"You can visit my brain, ears, eyes, nose, heart, lungs... and my, er, chest.\" You could guess from her hesitance what she meant by 'chest,' and pictured her blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. And going down...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's a bit less stuff there, but just as exciting!\" She rubbed her tummy again, this time downwards. \"There's my navel, liver, intestines, bladder, kidneys... and, um, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could again guess what she was unwilling to mention. \"So what, I just get to pass by and look at them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, there's a bit more to it than that.\" She seemed to be trying to remember something. \"If I recall my mom's words correctly, apparently all of my organs developed with various amenities to, um, 'make it more comfortable for the person inside,' I think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even your brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, I think that counts, yes.\" She sounded a bit worried, but not too much. You decided to step through into her body travel system, and saw that Nidorina's analogy was quite accurate - The physiology of the tunnel resembled a blood vessel, one that seemed to trail off both up and down her body, branching out. You felt her pat her stomach again. \"So, um, which way are you going to go?\"</span></div></div>",

After about a minute, though, her lust abated, and she stood up and started walking somewhere, causing you to stumble and land on the sensitive tissue. \"Hey, careful!\" she said with a giggle, \"I'm kinda ticklish down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" You gingerly got up again, moving slowly and deliberately away from her labia. \"Um, if I may ask, where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my home. Maybe I can find something there to help you, but I don't have full confidence in that. In the meantime, just... relax, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured Nidorina had considered saying things more... racy than relaxation. Behind you, you noticed the entrance to her cervix, which seemed to be pulsing in time with her heartbeat. Would you consider climbing in it, to see what you could find deep within this girl?

Of being shrunk wasn't terrifying enough, being in the presence of something you don't even know was sure to do the trick. Nervously, you begin to turn your head to the source of the mysterious speaker only to notice a huge orange wall of fur blocking your view. \"w-w-wha!?\" you stutter completely stupefied by the view before your eyes. Right before you was the face of an absolutely ginormous vulpix head. It's great amber eyes the size of a huge billboard were entirely focused on you as her huge black nose stood mere yards away from you. As you remain perfectly still in awe and shock of the sight, you manage to feel hot gusts of breath escape from her great nostrils as her massive right ear gently flicked against the side of her three ringed red bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, silence emanated before you two before the odd voice once again breaks the silence. \"Hi there.\" says a friendly female voice that was almost the equivalent to a young woman. To your ever growing surprise, you soon recognize that the owner of such a strange voice was non other than this gigantic vulpine pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-you...\" you stammer trying to let the words escape from your mouth. \"y-you...just talked!\" you blurt out with shock filled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpix simply cocks her head to the right upon your question and overall action as a small laugh escapes her face. \"Of course I did silly. I mean, I am a pokemon after all.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response did seem to overwhelm your mind with confusion. If she was indeed a pokemon, shouldn't she only be able to repeat her name and nothing else? Regardless, you quickly decide to shake your head throwing the question out of your mind. \"e-errr...sorry, but I'm a human.\" you say, unsure if she couldn't distinguish your odd form right off the bat. Apparently, it was clear that she had no idea as to just what you were by the confused expression and tilted head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human?\" She repeats in a stupefied tone. \"b-but...humans are much more bigger than you.\" she retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yeah.\" you nod your head in response. \"We humans are much bigger in size... But, somehow I ended up getting shrunk out here somehow.\" you explain, still wondering just how you managed to end up at such a size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you poor thing!\" Vulpix says while giving a small yet audible whimper. Her sudden response over your situation catches you off guard momentarily. You never would've expected some stray pokemon to be so thoughtful towards a human...especially a tiny one at that. As you gaze at her with slightly wide eyes, you can't help but notice a warm smile emerge upon her orangish face. \"w-well...maybe I can help?\" she insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?\" you repeat unsure by just how she could be able to assist you. Despite this uncertainty, you definitely needed whatever help you can get, especially considering the fact that there could be more pokemon out there who wouldn't see you the same way as this vulpix does. Slowly, you muster a smile before nodding your head ever so gratefully. \"thanks, I would really appreciate that.\" you reply as vulpix's smile only seemed to grow that much wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" she says with a nod. \"Now...I'll need you to trust me.\" Those words alone send a great surge of suspicion as you raise your brow in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh...what do you mean?\" you ask still not entirely not sure by just what she meant by 'trust'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix's smile soon fades slightly as her perked up ears also begin to descend downwards. \"it's not safe out here.\" she says with concern in her voice. \"but, I know a way how I could protect you from any dangers out here.\" she adds as your confusion only begins to grow much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How?\" you reluctantly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...\" She remains silent briefly before finally speaking again. \"by, keeping you inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was enough to send a great terror filled chill course down your spine. \"w-what!?\" You shout absolutely shocked. \"y-you mean, you want to eat me!?\" all previous thoughts of this pokemon being thoughtful are quickly tossed aside as you feared this vulpine would be the end of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-calm down!\" she says with a startled expression. \"My body won't hurt you.\" she quickly adds which does little to ease your tenseness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-what do you mean?\" you stammer still nerve wracked by the notion of getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I can control my body.\" she states. \"Vulpix's are able to control their bodies because of the heat we produce inside.\" she explains. Just then, you quickly begin to remember the fact that vulpixes exhale flames on hot days due to the inner flame within them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How can I trust you?\" you stammer still finding it hard to take her words for truth. With those words spoken, her huge face soon inches it's way towards you causing you to clench your eyes in terror. While you were expecting to feel the odd texture of her tongue about you, to your surprise the only thing you manage to feel is a soft warm surface rubbing against your side. Once you manage to open your eyes once more, you soon discover her huge snout gently nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" she says in an assuring tone as she continues to rub her fur against you. \"I have no reason to hurt you...so why would I do it all of a sudden?\" she asks. Now that she mentioned it, she did have a point. With a long sigh and small shudder you turn to gaze at her closest eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't...hurt will it?\" you ask finding it hard to believe that you were actually going along with this ridiculous idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpix simply retracts her head while shaking it slowly. \"Not at all.\" she says with a small smile on her face. Oddly enough, you couldn't help but return one right back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a-alright.\" you say while letting loose another long sigh. \"but...If you're tricking me, I'll make sure to give you the worst stomach ache possible.\" you threaten which only seemed to cause her to giggle. Now that you think about it, if she was indeed lying about all of this, you had absolutely no idea what you would do inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" She replies before slowly lowering her head and parting open her massive maw. As you stood before the vulpine pokemon's mouth, a huge gust of her hot breath escapes and immediately blows past your form, messing up your hair in the process. You soon find yourself gazing within the pink fleshy portal that was her massive mouth. Sharp white stalagmites and stalactites adorned the upper and lower outer edge of the organic cavern as her huge pink tongue rested patiently below. With further inspection you manage to notice strands of her saliva trailing from teeth to teeth and even globs of the liquid adorning the surface of her mighty tongue. All the way at the end stood her great gaping throat, that slowly pulsated as if awaiting your entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slight reluctance, you slowly enter your foot past the lower fangs and right onto the slimy surface of her tongue. To your surprise, your foot  sinks slightly upon the slimy squishy surface as you slowly place your other foot inside as well. Carefully, you begin to traverse the slimy surface as humidity soon begins to bombard your entire form. Right as you managed to make your way onto the center area of the huge tongue, your whole world was soon cast into darkness as the vulpix slowly closes her mouth. Shocked by the sudden darkness, you slowly try your best to ease your tension within her maw. Just then however, you suddenly begin to lose balance as you feel her head beginning to shift ever so slightly. In no time at all, you land upon the tongue's squishy surface getting drenched in her rather sticky saliva. Just as you were about to raise your head to shake off the dizziness from the fall, you immediately feel your entire form being raised up slightly before being embraced by another squishy surface. Unlike her tongue however, the surrounding walls about you feel as if they were tugging your body deeper within before the sound of an audible 'GULP' filled your ears. The only possible thing you could do now was wait for the descent down her huge throat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The descent downwards seemed to drag on for several minutes. The pulsating walls of flesh surrounding your body slowly begin to squish and compress your body as they continue to pull you even deeper down vulpix's mighty throat. In what seemed like a matter of minutes, the tunnel of flesh soon brings you upon a large fleshy ring that slowly quivered before you. With wide eyes, the ring quickly begins to part as the walls give you one final push straight through the squishy portal. Once your body was soon shoved fully through, you soon found yourself momentarily freefalling before landing with a loud splash in a pool of warm liquids. immediately, you swim up before letting out a loud long gasp of air. To your ultimate surprise, the innards of the organic chamber oddly contained fresh air, almost as if it was taken directly from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you manage to fill your lungs with a plentiful amount of air, you soon turn your heads to gaze upon the large organic pouch that was vulpix's stomach. Like her throat, the pink walls wiggled and quivered rhythmically as they adorned with a mixture of saliva and acid. All about you, the sounds of loud churning and gurgles emanate from every direction as the continuous beats of her loud heart resided right above you. As you gaze upon the ceiling and walls of the fleshy room, you soon turn your attention to the liquids in which you were floating in. Just as Vulpix said, the acids were hardly having an effect on you. In fact, it almost felt like the equivalent of an odd hot tub due to the surprisingly warm liquids and bubbles forming about the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Vulpix's voice emanates from above, though it was a bit more compressed overall. \"How is it in there?\" she asks in a curious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainly is something.\" you reply, finding it hard to describe exactly how it's like being inside of some pokemon's belly. The reply was enough to cause Vulpix to let out a small giggle which gently shook the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? nothing to worry about.\" she says while letting out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" you nod while giving a long ashamed sigh. \"Guess you won't have to worry about getting that stomach ache.\" you say humorously, despite the fact that you didn't take her word from the start. \"and...I'm sorry for not trusting you.\" you quickly add. \"It's just...when a pokemon says they want you to go inside them it's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright human.\" Vulpix says with a laugh, quickly interrupting with your reasoning. A small smile soon draws on your face seeing as how there was no hard feeling between you two from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...this is rather...odd.\" You admit while swimming your way to a much more shallower area of the stomach. \"I-in a good way though!\" you quickly add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be quite a shock to be inside a pokemon's belly huh?\" she asks above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" you mutter under your breath. \"e-errrr...well now that I'm in your body, what exactly should I do now?\" You ask curiously. \"should I just stay inside your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could do that.\" Vulpix replies. \"or~ you could go ahead and begin exploring inside.\" she adds with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you quickly raise your head up in confusion by her last statement. \"explore? what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, just wander about inside me.\" she reiterates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but...would I be safe wandering about inside you?\" you ask with a raised brow. \"I mean, you did say you can control your body, but what if I get lost somewhere inside of you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry human.\" Vulpix laughs at your sudden unease. \"Like I said, I can easily control my body. In fact, I could eve track just where you are inside me as well.\" she adds to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" you stammer in awe and surprise of this pokemon's unique ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" she replies in a cheery tone. \"now...just where would you like to head to?\" she asks as you begin to ponder your new interior course.</span></div></div>",

Upon making it a few yards down, you soon stand before the great lake of bubbling liquids that was her acid. The juices seemed nearly impossible to gaze through, as the green tint prevented much visibility down below. Not only that, but due to Vulpix's immense size, there was no telling just how deep her acid would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"err...we have a small problem here.\" you call out while kneeling before the great body of toiling juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Vulpix asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Your acid's blocking the way deeper into your stomach.\" you explain. \"and I have no clue just how deep it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! sorry about that.\" Vulpix giggles in an awkward manner. \"one sec.\" After finishing with her words, the walls about the stomach soon begin to wiggle and pulsate in a much faster pace then before. Quickly, you grip onto the squishy surface to avoid being shaken off into the acid. As you were hanging on, the loud sound of gurgles and churning fill your ears as you soon manage to spot the lake of acid beginning to descend lower within the organic chamber. Within a matter of seconds, the whole body of digestive juices soon vanishes, with the exception of small pools caught in irregular flesh forms adorned upon the stomach floor. \"there we go.\" she says while giving a small sigh. \"did that help?\" she asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup...that...helped a lot.\" you nod your head slowly both in awe and confusion over the sudden event. \"What happened to your acids?\" you ask curiously gazing about the fleshy chamber trying to find out just where they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sucked them back into my stomach walls.\" she says in a proud tone. \"that way, it will make your path to my intestines much easier.\" she chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what will happen to them?\" you ask with slight uncertainty, unsure if her action was harming the inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let them back out once you're in the intestines.\" she states. \"so no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a-alright then.\" you nod your head before carefully continuing your way further down her massive belly. As you were more than halfway down the wall of flesh, climbing proved to be quite the challenge due to the extra slipperiness caused by the acids. After a small misstep, causing you to land upon the squishy floor on your rump, you finally manage to make it to the stomach floor. Once you collected yourself from the sudden descent, you soon scan about the area, before spotting a massive fleshy ring all the way at the end of the opposite wall. \"There it is.\" you mutter under your breath as you begin your journey through the slick surface of Vulpix's belly. After a few minutes of traveling, and slipping on several occasions, you soon stood before the massive ring of flesh that was the entrance to her intestines. \"Alright Vulpix!\" you call out. \"I made it to through your stomach.\" you assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job Human!\" she roots. \"now hold on. and you might want to back a way a bit.\" she insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back away?\" you stammer. \"but why?\" your question was soon answered as a hot blast of air erupts from within the now parted opening, causing you to be blown back a few feet. With a shake of your head, you quickly turn your head towards the now open sphincter as the muscles about the fleshy ring slowly wiggled. Upon gazing inside, you notice a rather large pink tunnel with wiggling walls awaiting your arrival. Just as you were about to enter, a slight repugnant smell emerging from within soon begins to fill your nostrils. \"Eughh.\" you groan in slight disgust while using your hand to attempt and swipe the aroma away. While the smell wasn't absolutely terrible overall, it was rather unpleasant as a whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that.\" Vulpix says in an awkward tone. \"it might be a bit...well, smelly deeper inside my body.\" she warns. \"so, if you don't want to go in my intestines, then that's perfectly fine.\" </span></div></div>",

With the huge fleshy ring still wide open, you slowly begin to trek your way through the passage way. Upon making it past the muscles and into the pink tubes of Vulpix's intestines, a great surge of heat impacts the front of your body. It was almost as if you were within a huge sauna. A massive, organic sauna that just happened to be inside of a Vulpix that is. Upon taking a few more steps inside, the large opening behind you soon closes with a 'SCHLORP', as if trapping you within your desired route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful in there, okay?\" Vulpix says in a concerned voice which immediately manages to cease your movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why?\" you stammer unsure if your decision to enter deep inside her guts was a wise one or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be a bit bouncy and wiggly in there.\" she states. \"and I wouldn't want you to end up getting dizzy or bounced out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement sends a small surge of relief rushing down your body. \"*phew*...for a second I though there was something dangerous inside your intestines.\" you mutter under your breath. \"Alright then.\" you quickly reply back as you try to make your way deeper within Vulpix's fleshy innards. After taking just a few steps further within her intestines, you suddenly discover just how much of a challenge it was to get a steady balance within the moving tube. Each time you tried to set one of your feet down upon the squishy surface, it would either sink down or end up shaking due to the movements of her muscles. After about five experimental steps deeper within the intestines, an odd crease down on the floor suddenly ends up tripping you, causing you to land right upon the pink squishy surface of the walls. Luckily for you, the flesh did manage to break the fall rather easily, though upon making contact a loud giggle quickly emanates about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickles!\" Vulpix voice emanates from above as her small laughter persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sorry about that Vulpix.\" you call out while quickly returning to your previous standing position. \"I accidentally ended up tripping and ended up landing right on a wall.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright human.\" she says after managing to regain her composure. \"Just be careful like I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" you stammer before slowly starting your trek once more. After minutes of walking down the humid tunnel, you begin to wonder just how long it would take you to fully traverse Vulpix's intestines. From your vantage point, the massive pink tunnel seemed to go on forever. Just when you thought that you were nearing an exit at a turn, you were quickly greeted by another long tube to travel through. After several minutes past by, many of which you lost track of, you soon begin to notice that the overall size od the tunnels were slowly starting to diminish. At first, the height of Vulpix's intestines stood somewhere about double your size, however, after traveling deeper within her body you had to kneel a bit downwards in order to fully make your way further within her gut. \"It's like these things go on forever...\" you mutter under your breath while still trying your best to block out the aroma lingering about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue your voyage deeper within the intestines, after what seemed like forever, you soon manage to enter into a small pink chamber where two openings lied before you. \"huh?\" you mutter upon viewing the strange fork in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like you managed to make it past my intestines.\" Vulpix's voice resonates in a victorious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" you chuckle while gazing upwards at the roof of the chamber. \"I didn't tickle you too bad in there did I?\" you ask curiously only to receive a giggle from Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did snicker now and then.\" she admits past the light laughs. \"Anyways, you now have two choices to chose from human. Do you chose the larger path? or do you chose the smaller one?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, which one leads where?\" you ask curiously as your eyes constantly switch from both openings before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Vulpix stammers in a rather abashed voice. \"both will lead you out...but both go different ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a somewhat good idea of how the digestive system works a deep shade of red emerges on you cheeks realizing the choices before you. \"o-oh...\" you stammer awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So...the larger hole will lead you to the last point of my digestive system, where you could exit from my...my...\" Vulpix stammers as if too abashed to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...rear?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" she mutters with an awkward whimper to follow. \"and...you should know where the other path ends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the choices now before you, it was time to decide which opening to enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What\u2019s wrong?\u201d you quickly stammer while spreading your arms out to keep steady. \u201cn-nothing human.\u201d Vulpix replies in a rather shaky voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026well, my first time feeling such a sensation within me.\u201d She says in a wholehearted tone. \u201cWait\u2026you mean I\u2019m the only\u2026well, human who managed to make it this far inside you?\u201d you ask surprised by the reveal. \u201cThe one and only.\u201d Vulpix adds with a small nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rapid movements about you begin to die down, you slowly continue your way deeper, making sure not to apply too much movement in your surroundings. After a few more seconds of traversing, you soon manage to find yourself in a huge spacious chamber with light pink walls pulsating all around. As you make your way to the center of the area, you turn your head towards the right to notice a ginormous sphincter adorned against a mass of flesh. Just by the route you chose, there was no doubt what that opening lead to. \u201cWelcome to my bowels human.\u201d Vulpix says in an almost cheery voice, as if to congratulate your efforts. \u201cWell\u2026they certainly are roomy.\u201d You admit with a chuckle as you begin to walk about the confines of her lowest gut. Vulpix simply giggles at your comment, causing the whole area to lightly wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how is it in there?\u201d She asks in a curious fashion. \u201cWell, apart from being spacious, it\u2019s really pink, slimy, and squishy.\u201d You reply, finding it hard to explain what it looked like in words. \u201cIs it\u2026smelly?\u201d she asks in an abashed tone. \u201cWell\u2026a little.\u201d You answer back honestly. \u201cThough not too bad!\u201d You quickly add causing her to giggle. As you look about, the one thing that you immediately notice was just how clean it was within her bowels. \u201cErrr\u2026Vulpix?\u201d you stammer. \u201cYeah?\u201d Her voice echoes about you. \u201cErrr\u2026this might sound strange but\u2026it\u2019s-\u201c \u201cClean in there?\u201d she states, managing to finish your question. \u201cWell\u2026yeah.\u201d You reply, surprised by how even she knew. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want my first inside guest to be grossed out.\u201d She states in a thoughtful voice. \u201cBesides.

Hooray!\u201d she says in a cheery attitude causing you to laugh and blush slightly in embarrassment. \u201cWell\u2026to be honest it was fun traveling inside your body.\u201d You admit. \u201cReally?\u201d she stammers in surprise. \u201cWell\u2026Yes.\u201d You answer with a nod. \u201cWhile I was terrified about the idea of being eaten at first, after voyaging inside you for a bit, well, it was a really interesting.\u201d Vulpix remains silent for a second or so as you gaze up in slight confusion. \u201cWell\u2026who says that you\u2019re done wandering about inside me?\u201d She asks in an almost excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d You ask growing confused by her words. \u201cWell, sure you might\u2019ve made it down my digestive system, BUT, there are plenty of other areas you can travel to.\u201d She admits cheerfully. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d You quickly stammer. \u201cAre you saying you want me to continue exploring inside you?\u201d you ask in surprise. \u201cWell. Yes.\u201d She admits following it up with an awkward chuckle. \u201cThis is the first time I managed to talk with a human. Even have one travel inside me\u201d She replies in an awkward fashion. \u201cBut\u2026if you don\u2019t want to though that\u2019s fine.\u201d She finishes as if trying to hide a disappointment in those last words. Two choices now lied before you. Do you choose to stay and explore vulpix further, or cease the journey?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Due to the sheer size of the heart, you feared you would drown long before you reached the artery. However, the walls contracted again, and you were pushed along the blood, traveling up her body and crossing her carotid artery. In a matter of seconds you had reached your destination.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were pushed out of the blood vessel and landed inside a large, illuminated chamber. Getting your footing on the bony floor, you analyzed your surroundings. Right in front of you stood a titanic, gray ovoid organ. Blood vessels and electric pulses ran on its wrinkled surface. It took you some time to identify it as her brain. Looking around you located the source of the light that bathed the cranial cavity: two oval windows, which you quickly identified as her eyes, decorated the wall of the skull, the light coming from them going out and returning at regular intervals. Her optic nerves, two large tubes that linked the eyes to the brain, extended above like bridges.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walked up to the gigantic eyes and realized with awe you could see what she was seeing. Right now she was walking through the forest, occasionally looking around, alert for other pok\u00e9mon that could attack her. You stayed a moment to appreciate the outside world. You don't know for how long you've been inside Vulpix, but it was nice to see the blue sky again after getting used to the fleshy world inside her.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the show?\" Vulpix's booming voice startles you.<br>\r\n\"A little, I guess.\" you answer awkwardly. \"So, where are we going?\" you ask after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, and I would like to get back to my den before sunset\" she answers.<br>\r\n\"Of course\" you responded. Vulpixes are diurnal, low in the food chain, and the last thing you needed was for something to happen to your host. After some minutes of walking, she reaches her den without incident, which was basically a hole in the roots of a large tree.<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home\" she announces as she enters the hole, which turned out to be rather spacious. She curls up in a corner, using her tails as a blanket. \"Anyway, sorry about your shrinking. Tomorrow morning we'll look for a way to get you back to normal, okay?\" she says, her voice betraying her tiredness.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Thank you\" you said, grateful.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight\" she says, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight\" you responded, and with that she closed her eyes, and your chamber was flooded with darkness. You moved towards her brain, and leaning on the soft matter, drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes, you saw through Vulpix's own eyes that she was already awake, and was walking through the forest in search for something. With a yawn, you rose to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning. Hope I didn't wake you up\" Vulpix says, noticing of your activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" you say groggily, and walked towards the eye-windows. \"What's the plan for today?\" you asked. Before she could answer, a thunderous roar echoed in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" you asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach. Sorry, I'm hungry\" Vulpix answers blushing. \"There should be some berry bushes around here. Ah, found one\" she says, spotting a bush loaded with succulent berries. \"You must be hungry too\" she says as she walks up to the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I am a little hungry, yeah.\" you answer. \"But how am I going to eat? Do I have to go back to your stomach?\" you ask, dreading to treat through mountain-sized piles of half-digested berry mush. Through Vulpix's eyes, you saw her pick one of the berries with her mouth, chew and swallow it, with a loud 'gulp' echoing below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I know a better way\" she says before the ground trembles again and a new tunnel opens next to you. \"Get in\" she says, and you comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the tunnel, you reach a small cavity, where two rectangles of bone emerged from the ground, one much smaller and positioned near the side of the other, giving the impression of a table with a chair. On top of the table sat a bowl of the same material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the dining room!\" Vulpix announces, feeling your arrival. \"The lunch will arrive in a minute\" she says as you sat on the bone chair in front of the bowl. Once again you hear her chewing a berry, a loud 'gulp', and from an opening in the ceiling liquefied, chewed up berry mush poured out, being deposited on the bowl. You stared at the contents of the bowl for a moment in slight disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if this is a little yucky\" Vulpix says embarrassed, \"but you can't eat a full berry at your size. It's not that bad, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Vulpix. Thanks\" you respond, and scoop a handful of the berry soup. To your surprise, it actually tastes quite good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is it?\" she asks hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes great!\" you answer as you continue to eat, and Vulpix responded with a sigh of relief. As the two of you ate, you talked and learned a little more about each other. Apparently Vulpix haven't left this forest since the day she hatched, and haven't had much contact with humans aside from watching them from a distance. You talked about your hometown and your childhood, but decided to not speak about your career as a pok\u00e9mon trainer, unsure of how she would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you two finished your meals. \"Alright, now that both our bellies are full, we can look onto your 'little' problem\" she says, chuckling to herself at the last part. She moved away from the bush and wander around, while you got back to the tunnel and returned to your 'observation post' behind her eyes. \"So, any leads?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. I was just walking when I passed out, and then I woke up at this size.\" you sat down and started to think. Did you do anything noteworthy before you shrunk? Another loud roar in the distance broke your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Vulpix, we just ate\" you say jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my stomach this time\" Vulpix says in a serious tone, and starts to look around in all direction, looking for the source of the sound. A nearby patch of tall grass shakes, directing Vulpix's attention towards it, and from it a pok\u00e9mon jumps out!</span></div></div>",

However, it quickly turned around, and cut the side of her body with the sharp rocks in its mane. Vulpix retaliates with flamethrower, but the wolf easily shrugs the flames off. It charges at Vulpix and tackles her, throwing her across the battlefield. She laid on the ground at some distance from the wolf, struggling to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Vulpix, you were being thrown around, bouncing off the walls of her skull before you got lodged in the surface of her brain.You could see through her eyes that she was downed, and Lycaroc was moving closer, ready to deliver a finishing move.

Electric pulses emerged from the spot you punched, and Vulpix shot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vulpix was still processing what happened, the Lycanroc charged at her again. However, you had just figured out a way to help Vulpix in this battle. Grabbing another part of her brain, you made her move out of the way before she could even see Lycanroc coming. You then made her turn hear head towards the wolf, open her mouth, and let out a stream of fire over Lycanroc. While this did weaken it a little, it did not show signs of giving up. Instead, it lunged at her and carved its teeth on her neck, eliciting a howl of pain from Vulpix that made you cringe, then it threw her on the ground. With Vulpix laying down with her eyes closed, you were left in the dark inside her skull, hoping she still had some fight in her...</span></div></div>",

Pressing another part of Vulpix's brain, you made her use Will-O-Wisp. A small flame emerged from her mouth and struck the wolf, causing it to be engulfed in flames. Lycanroc rolled on the ground attempting to extinguish itself, and you took the opportunity to attack again, making Vulpix unleash another stream of fire over the wolf. Lycanroc recovered itself and jumped into the air while throwing rock shards at Vulpix, but you made her dodge in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go for another attack. This time, your stimulation on Vulpix's brain causes it to release a psychic wave, which strikes Lycanroc. The wolf becomes disorientated, stumbles around and hits its head on a tree. You stimulate the same part of the brain, releasing another psychic wave, strong enough to knock Lycanroc to the ground. It  gets up, shakes its head and, deciding that Vulpix is not worth the trouble, runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, and Vulpix does the same. \"Whoa\" she says while panting, worn by the battle. \"Did... were you doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" you press another part of the brain, and Vulpix involuntarily raises her front leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that\" she says while looking at the rogue leg. \"You were making me move so fast, and even use moves I didn't know I had.

To be honest, you weren't even sure of what you were doing before you shrunk. As far as you knew you were just walking by the forest. The best option you could think of was to go back to the spot you shrunk and hope to find some sort of clue there. Alternatively, if you weren't mistaken there was a town very close to where Vulpix were. You could ask her to go there and find someone to help, but towns tend to be full of trainers, and a trainer's reaction to a wild pok\u00e9mon is to either catch it or use it as a punching bag for their own pok\u00e9mon. You really didn't want to put Vulpix through danger, but you didn't have many options.

Once you finished your explanation you anxiously waited for Vulpix's reply, expecting her to boot you out of her body and stomp you dead outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound too bad.\" Her response caught you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... you mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds better than starving to death here in the forest anyway. Plus, you seem nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I... well, thank you.\" you say awkwardly. \"So... Mewtwo.\" You try to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pink floating pok\u00e9mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, almost forgot about that. He went that way.\" She turns her head towards the bottom of a cliff in the distance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm pretty sure there's a cave that way. Maybe he went in there. Let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now? He doesn't seem to like you very much. Got an idea to change his mind?\" Vulpix says, following Mewtwo's track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no. But we need to get to him now, who knows when he'll show up again? I'll think of something on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Vulpix several minutes to reach the entrance of the cave, which you spent thinking how to convince Mewtwo. By the time Vulpix arrived, though,  you were just as clueless as you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix stepped into the dark cave, shivering as she feels the humid floor under her paws. Periodically producing small flames to illuminate the way, she pressed forward. She hears a soft hum further in, confirming there was indeed something here. She moves on until the sigh of something small scurrying along the floor made her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something on the floor.\" Vulpix says, lowers her head to take a closer look, and her eyes widen in shock. You move closer to her eyes, trying to get a better look, and you too, are overcome by shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans, dozens of them, shrunk just like you, pathetically running away as a gargantuan Vulpix stares them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wasn't Mewtwo's only victim.\" You state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do with them? We can't leave them here.\" Vulpix asks with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't mind having this many people inside you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's the only way to protect them, no.\" Vulpix says. You mentally applause her selflessness. What to do?</span></div></div>",

It was a girl, wearing a blue cap, a black tank top, denim shorts, a backpack and a belt full of pok\u00e9balls. You immediately identified her as a pok\u00e9mon trainer, and a rather skilled one if the loyal and strong-looking Tyranitar was any indication. The girl and her Tyranitar lock eyes with Vulpix, the trainer points at her, and the Tyranitar assumes a battle stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than Vulpix could react to, the Tyranitar threw rock shards at her, striking her on the chest and knocking her off a few meters. Still recovering from the initial pain, she saw the opponent charging at her and she moved of the way, counterattacking with a flamethrower. The tyranitar seemed unfazed however, and it quickly turned around and threw a swift punch at her, again knocking her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to stay on her paws, Vulpix realized that she simply had no chance against the Tyranitar. She observed the opponent, hoping to find an opportunity to run away. However, the Tyranitar seemed to have lost interest in the battle, as it simply stayed still and observed her. Meanwhile, inside Vulpix's skull, you watched the battle apprehensively, feeling powerless to do anything but cheer on Vulpix. You observed in confusion for an instant when Tyranitar gave up on its attack, but then the sudden realization hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulpix, the trainer...\" was all you could mutter. Vulpix turned her head towards the girl, who had a red and white ball on her grasp, which she hurled towards Vulpix. The ball bounced off her forehead, split in half and engulfed her in a white light. The blinding light pierced Vulpix's eyes and your own, and almost immediately she closed her eyes and sealed you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to process what happened. Had Vulpix just been captured?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulpix?\" you called out. In response, your vessel started to shake violently. Vulpix was trying to break out of the ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she succeed?</span></div></div>",

Finally, a soft 'click' sealed your and Vulpix's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix has been caught by a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Tyranitar\" the trainer congratulated her pok\u00e9mon before picking up the ball and letting Vulpix out, wanting to analyze the new addition to her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix suddenly opened her eyes upon being released, flooding your chamber with sunlight once again. She looked back at the trainer and the ball in her hand. She didn't fully understand what had happened, but she felt she was now bound to this human in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer crouched to get closer to Vulpix. \"Hi Vulpix\" she said softly, raising a hand to pet her head. \"My name is Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul...\" was all she heard in response. Vulpix closed her eyes and lowered her head to make petting her easier. She was enjoying the demonstration of affection. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad. Inside of her, however you were not as happy about the situation. Your host was now someone's propriety, just your luck. You sighed. At least she seemed to be a loving trainer. Maybe she would be willing to help if she knew about you? Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccidentally, Laura touched a spot that was still hurting from Vulpix's battle, making her wince. \"Oh, sorry. Better get you healed up.\" she rose to her feet. \"There must be a town close by. Let's go.\" she smiled at Vulpix and motioned her to follow before walking off, with Tyranitar still by her side. Vulpix complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this sort of throws a monkey wrench into our plans\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix looks around, having momentarily forgotten about her passenger. \"Oh.. well, she seems nice, why don't we just ask for help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inside you, and I don't think she understands pok\u00e9speak.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we just show you to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea\" she says, and the ground shakes slightly, revealing an opening near you. \"This will take you to my mouth. Go in, and I'll just show you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no better ideas yourself, you comply and enter the new tunnel. The further you proceeded, the wetter the duct become, until you were practically drowning in a thick, clear liquid. The walls squeeze on you, and you are shot into the air, landing on a pink, bumpy surface that seemed to stretch for kilometers. You analyze your surroundings: the air was thick, hot, humid and had a strong smell, a dark pink, ridged surface extended above like a sky, humongous sharp, pearly white blocks lined the horizon and strands of sticky liquid extended like pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a few seconds to identify the strange location as Vulpix's mouth. You were shot out of a salivary gland and landed on the middle of her tongue. Vulpix, feeling you had arrived, called out to the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulp!\" Vulpix called out while nudging Laura's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\" Laura stopped and crouched, bringing her face closer to Vulpix's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new chamber was bathed in light and a wave of cold air washed over you when Vulpix opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out, trying to make your tiny form as visible as possible. You climbed one of the taste buds, hoping to be seen better. In the distance, Laura's face seemed to grow as she came closer to inspect Vulpix's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Laura's colossal form that dwarfed even your host reminded you of how small you were. In fact, you were basically a speck on Vulpix's tongue. Would Laura even be able to see you?</span></div></div>",

And there's a chance bigger pokemon can't either, plus it would be dangerous until you do find someone. Choice two by the time you get help everyone you know will have died, and you would return to a much different world, plus at that length you might want to live inside vulpix permanently even with , the final option would give you a completely new start, but you would be a baby pokemon, and female unless you endure a males fun with Vulpix which you refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally made your decision and looked out and saw Vulpix was just finished healing, and Laura was just about to recall Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Vulpix said as she was recalled, and both of your world's went dark.</span></div></div>",

Finally, Vulpix was let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go girl, stretch your legs a bit. We have a whole day of training ahead of us.\" you heard Laura say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix turned to the trainer, nodded and walked towards the woods, feeling Laura's gaze behind her. \"This is our chance, little guy.\" Vulpix says before a tunnel opens near you. You enter and are taken to the familiar environment of Vulpix's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth slight, illuminating your world a little. Saliva builds up in the mouth and carries you away, towards the exit. Nearing her lips you are assaulted by the sun in all its blazing glory, forcing you to shut your eyes, which were already accustumed to Vulpix's dark inner world. You are then ejected from Vulpix's body along with what seemed like several gallons of saliva, although for Vulpix it was merely a drop of drool, and deposited on the ground of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreeing yourself from the viscous liquid, you looked up to see Vulpix's eyes focused on your tiny form. You can't help but think her eyes are even more beautiful from the outside. She smiles softly. \"Welcome back out. So,how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay.\" You wave dismissively and take a look at your surroundings. You were deposited at the base of a tree. Blades of grass towered over you like trees, and the proper trees erected skyward like monoliths. Looking below, you could see the individual grains of dirt, now the size of rocks. You chuckled to yourself. At least something was still smaller than you. \"So what's the plan...\" You turned to Vulpix, who, to your surprise, was brazenly relieving herself on the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, couldn't you hold it in for a little longer?\" You questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that.\" Vulpix started to explain, now looking a bit flustered. \"We Vulpixes are very sensitive to each other's scent. So if I, well, mark this spot, chances are it will attract another Vulpix to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and waited for Vulpix to finish her business. Once she was done, she cast you one last pitiful look. \"Well, I guess this is it. Stay safe, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Vulpix. And thank you, for everything.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix nodded somberly and walked away, towards her trainer. While she turned she covered her eyes with a paw, not wanting the tiny human to see her starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for some time, until Vulpix and Laura were nowhere to be seen. The smell of Vulpix's urine was getting strong. You periodically scanned the giant forest, waiting for a pok\u00e9mon to show up. After some time, you were starting to get impatient. Vulpix said her urine would attract another Vulpix, but maybe you would have more luck wandering off to find another species of pok\u00e9mon on your own? You decide to...</span></div></div>",

You ran as fast as your tiny legs could carry you, not wanting to lose your possible savior. You clung to the hind paw of the Vulpix just as it took off, taking you for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were overcome by vertigo as the giant paw moved about, rising and falling periodically as Vulpix walked. With huge effort, you made your way to the top of the paw, where you waited for the world to stop thrashing about. Eventually, Vulpix stopped and the paw calmed down. Judging by the distant sounds, she was feeding on berries from a bush. You took this opportunity to take a breather and decide your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to Vulpix's leg, which looked like an endless pillar of white for you. Even if you managed to climb it, you would still need to traverse her back, all while she moved about. You would die of dehydration long before you reached her head. There must be another way of getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point you could see the nearest entrance to her body, the slit that guarded her vagina. Surely she would feel you in such a sensitive place, right? Gravity suddenly weighted on you as the paw lifted, and Vulpix was on the move again. Sighing, you began your arduous climb towards Vulpix's nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hairs on the leg offered great leverage on your climb, although the constant movement of the leg impeded your endeavor. Occasionally, though, Vulpix would stop for whatever reason, giving you some respite.

But instead, they landed on each of her nether lips and spread them apart, exposing the tunnel of her vagina. \"This is one way in.\" she said as she blushed and looked away, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your hesitation, she giggled. \"Too naughty for you? You can enter through my mouth too, if you prefer.\" she brought her snout closer to you and opened her mouth, blasting you with a wave of freezing air and revealing the all familiar sight of a fleshy cave, lined with sharp, yellowish white stalactites and stalagmites, strands of saliva connecting the roof to the powerful pink muscle that wiggled softly, and the expectant abyss at the end, decorated with a fleshy stalactite that swayed with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue almost touched her clit, allowing you to climb in with ease. You could barely see her eyes from your vantage point, staring right at you, patiently waiting your decision. With her mouth in front of you, and her gaping vagina behind you, you made your decision.</span></div></div>",

Once you were safely inside, the rows of sharp teeth closed, trapping you in the dark. You started to make your way towards the throat, but the tongue did the work for you, wiggling and bringing you closer to her gullet with each undulation. Once you were close enough, you gently stroked the uvula that hanged overhead, the best way you thought to show affection to this titaness. Judging by the hum that came from the throat below, she seemed to appreciate it. The tongue under you lifted and a wave of saliva pushed you down the abyss, and with a loud 'gulp' you were on your way to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on a pile of half-digested mush, and you immediately noted that inside the alolan Vulpix was cold, very cold. You made your way out of the pile of mush towards a drier part of the stomach, all while you shivered and rubbed your own arms to keep yourself warm. A wall of the stomach curved inwards slightly as Vulpix poked her belly outside. \"Hey, can you hear me?\" her voice boomed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hear you.\" you replied. In an attempt to warm up, you began wandering around. This caused Vulpix to giggle and the walls around you to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tickle in there. So, what is it like in there?\" She said, with noticeable excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice, just a little too cold for me.\" you answer. Your world revolved as Vulpix stood up, throwing you into a puddle of freezing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good. Here at Hotel Vulpix we seek to offer the most comfortable experience for our host!\" she proudly proclaimed, eliciting a chuckle from you. \"We need to take you to somewhere warmer\" she paused. \"The other Vulpix, you said she could take you to her brain. How did she do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. She said something about controlling her body through heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heat, huh. I think I have an idea.\" Vulpix said before going silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the ground under you trembled and a tunnel appeared on the wall of the stomach. Above, you heard Vulpix groan in exhaustion. \"Did I do it?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see a way out. Where does it take?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my head, I think.\" she answers while panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the first time I do something like this, cut me some slack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Alright. I'm going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way into the tunnel. Unlike the ones in your former host, this one didn't have bony stairs, forcing you to climb the flesh wall of the tunnel. Eventually, you arrive into...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is so weird!\" Your host replied. Looking through the eye-windows you saw the outside world colored in yellow as the sun lowered into the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun is setting.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your surprise, an alolan Ninetales waited inside the cave, with two other alolan Vulpixes by its side. It locked eyes with your host, giving her a stern glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already dinnertime. What were you doing this late out there?\" Ninetales asked in a mature-sounding female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom.\" Vulpix replied submissively. \"I found a, uh... bug pok\u00e9mon in trouble, and had to help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales softened her glare. \"Just be careful next time, it's dangerous out there at night.\" she sighed. \"Your food is on the table. Take a bath before you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix nodded, and headed to a passage leading deeper into the cave, with the two other Vulpixes silently eyeing her on the way. The passage revealed a downwards stairway made of rock and ice, which she descended into and arrive into another portion of the cave, this one occupied by an underground lake. Vulpix submerged one paw into the lake, before promptly jumping in. Your world dimmed as Vulpix closed her eyes and started to swim idly in the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's your mom?\" You asked despite obviously knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Vulpix hummed, still with her eyes close. \"She's really nice, but a little over too protective sometimes. My brother and my sister aren't too bad either. Well, most of the time.\" she giggled softly, before sighing. \"If only you could know them better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why couldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix remained silent for an instant. She opened her eyes and stared idly at the stairway. \"Mom... really doesn't like humans. I don't want to think what she would do to one your size.\" She said, and a combination of cold and fear sent a shiver down your spine. \"My little brother likes to play with small pok\u00e9mon, but not in a good way. He likes to freeze them slowly and watch them struggle.\" Another shiver, this one powered mostly by fear. \"And then there's my little sister. I don't think she would do anything to you herself, but she definitely would tell mom if I showed you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to have noticed your apprehension, because she immediately changed her tone. \"Don't worry, I won't let any of them hurt you! By body is your fortress, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \"Right. Thank you again.\" You said as Vulpix headed to the edge of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hold onto something.\" She said as she exited the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...\" Before you could say anything, your chamber started to convulse violently as Vulpix shook to dry herself. You bounced about in her skull before being launched into her brain, where you endured the ordeal by holding onto one of the folds on its surface. Finally, everything calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok in there?\" She asked as she ascended the stairway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You replied, fighting off your nausea while climbing down the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinnertime was less eventful than you expected. Apparently the rest of the family had eaten before Vulpix arrived, so all she saw when she entered the dining room was her food on the 'table', a large block of ice. Having learned about how your former host shared her meal with you, she similarly produced a cavity where some of her food would be diverged to for you. Your meal was a liquefied mush of chewed up berries, but you were used to it at this point. She didn't dare speak much to you as she ate, as she feared the rest of the family was within hearing range and would find it weird to hear her speaking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished her meal, she yawned and headed towards another part of the cave, supposedly to her bedroom.</span></div></div>",

In just seconds, you quickly place a hand over your forehead and clench your eyes close as a surge of pain starts to emanate within your cranium. \"ugghhhh...what happened?\" you groan as your form lies down limply. While you really didn't have much of a recollection before blacking out, you do remember wandering through some sort of forest like area before suddenly passing out. Slowly, you begin to raise your torso upwards into a seating position while gently caressing your head. After a few seconds, you slowly begin to open your eyes once more as your vision finally begins to come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to stare upon your surroundings, your eyes quickly widen in shear shock and bewilderment towards your location. Last time you recalled being in a vast forest filled with a plethora of towering trees and other forms of greenery. Now however you were gazing upwards at some sort of strange batch of towering green plant life, one which you never saw so great before. \"w-what the!?\" You stammer aloud in complete bafflement before taking a few steps back to get a better view of the strange greenery. Upon closer examination you begin to see many shared qualities the strange plant had with a typical strand of grass, almost as if they were exactly...alike. As you turn your head to gaze upwards and about, you soon discover a shocking sight. Straight above you towards the right was a rather familiar object, a tree. However unlike the many trees you were used to seeing, this one was completely gargantuan in size, surpassing even the height of the greatest skyscrapers, if not doubling or tripling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-how is this possibly?\" your mind mutters aloud as you begin to shake your head in shear disbelief. As hard as it was to swallow, you just had to face the facts. Right at this moment, You're shrunk in some strange forest. As you're brain was busy working on overdrive attempting to process this shocking predicament, your unstable train of thoughts was soon distracted as an odd tremor sent you shaking. Immediately you turn your head about as a huge sense of worry begins to build up inside you. At your size, it was a hundred times more dangerous to be alone, especially in an area filled with now huge pokemon. As you continue to gaze about, the tremors soon begin to get louder, followed by the sounds of explosive 'booms'. It wasn't too long before you find yourself nearly getting sent airborne with each newly created tremor. As you land on your back from one powerful shake, you soon gaze up in shear disbelief at a truly unexpected sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming high before you was what appeared to be a humanoid figure, though this creature was far from human. What would original be a human head at the top of the figure was instead replaced with that of a vulpine, or a vulpix to be precise. From your vantage point, you could make out an orange pony tail adorned just behind the large bun Vulpixes were known for having. 't-this isn't possible!' you shout in your mind as you gaze helplessly upon the massive anthro vulpix's form. Surprisingly, like an average human being, her body was decorated with a set of clothing. An average light green t-shirt adorned the upper section of her body as a short blue denim skirt was fit on her waist area. By the way she was standing, it seemed her towering legs prevented any view up her skirt, though the idea did cause a blush to form upon your terrified face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm...that's strange...it was here before.\" The vulpix spoke in a voice equivalent to that of a young woman's as she raises her head upwards and begins to sniff the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the ground, you gaze upwards in shock at the massive vulpix unsure what she could have meant. Was she searching for something? more importantly, just what was she looking for? Your question was inevitably answered as her amber eyes soon focus straight down upon you. As the huge orbs were glued to your body, It fells as if your heart was on the verge of leaping out due to the anxiety of the situation. Moments soon pass by as you two do nothing more but stare at each other in silence. The silence was soon broken however as the vulpix lets out an \"awwwww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aren't you just adorable!\" she coos while giving a small laugh. Your terrified state was soon replaced with confusion as you gaze at her with a lifted brow. In just seconds, she gets down on her knees as her huge head slowly looms above your tiny form. \"what are you doing out in an open place like this little guy?\" she asks while curiously cocking her head to the side. \"are you trying to meet some pokemon? or did you maybe get chased by one? or maybe-\" she continuously begins to ask questions while assuming several possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"e-errr...none of those actually.\" you reply in a loud voice, hoping she would be able to hear you. Luckily for you, she stops her accusations and cocks her head the other way in confusion. It seemed by this vulpix's strange demeanor that she didn't mean any harm to you, and if she did intend any ill will then she would have done something by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so....why are you out here all alone then?\" she asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well....I woke up this way.\" you blatantly admit. The vulpix girl's eyes widen as her right brow begins to raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?...just woke up?\" she repeats growing confused by the predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yeah.\" you nod your head. \"Last I remember, I was walking in a forest before suddenly passing out. Once I woke up, I found myself here and...discovered you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I discovered you.\" The vulpix says with a smirk as she points a furred finger at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...we'll go with that.\" you reply while slowly nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyways, I think you ended up popping up in a pretty bad area.\" The Vulpix says in an honest tone. Worry begins to build up inside you once again as you feared that she was waiting until now to initiate some sort of cruel action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" you ask nervously hoping with all your might that she doesn't intend to harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this place is a normal passing route for pokemon.\" she states. \"A lot of pokemon take this path, and if you aren't too careful while being so small you could end up seriously hurt.\" While you were slightly relieved she had no ill intentions towards you, you now had a new thing to worry  about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that...doesn't sound good at all.\" you admit as a shudder runs down your spine by the thought of getting crushed underneath some random pokemon's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but hey! maybe I can help.\" The vulpix beams in a cheery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"r-really?\" you look up at her with wide eyes. \"you'd help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she nods her head as she lets out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow...thank you.\" A great sense of relief quickly rushes down your body thanks to the vulpix's kind support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, all I need is a way to carry you about so that you're safe.\" she ponders as she places one of her index fingers under her chin deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...why don't you just carry me about?\" You ask curiously, seeing as how that would be the easiest mode of transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohnonono.\" she shakes her head. \"you might fall off or slip to the ground.\" she retorts. In just a matter of seconds, her eyes begin to widen and a smile soon crosses her face. \"I think I know a way to keep you safe.\" she says with a small yet awkward laugh as she looks down upon your tiny form.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately though, you thought otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-what!?\" you exclaim with shocked eyes. \"Are you saying you want to eat me!?\" you shout in complete disbelief by the off the wall proposal. You instinctively take a few steps back bewildered and terrified by the idea of becoming her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" she quickly retorts as her smile turned to that of startle. \"I'm not gonna chew you up or anything like that!\" she says as if trying her best to calm your shaking nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's suppose to make me feel calmer!?\" You shout accusingly as your backwards pace began to quicken. Just as you were getting prepared to high tail it away from this huge vixen, a sudden leathery surface blocks your back and escaping movements. Immediately, you turn your head back only to spot her massive padded palm obstructing your escape path. With a shaking body you nervously lift your head upwards to gaze at her huge face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you.\" she says in a rather convincing innocent tone. Yet despite this act, it did little to deter your suspicions towards her supposed scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...I don't think digesting something will be pleasant.\" you retort not buying her act one second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"who said I was going to digest you!?\" she says startled, as if offended by the comment. \"let alone hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tense nature was soon swapped with confusion by the comment. \"Wait...what do you mean?\" you ask as a scowl forms upon your face. \"do you even know how digestion works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?- Of course I do dummy!\" Vulpix exclaims as her face contorted into that of annoyance.  \"and what I meant was that...well, pokemon bodies are quite...weird.\" She claims as her right hand moves upwards to awkwardly scratch the back of her furred neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon bodies are...weird?\" you repeat growing even more confused by her vague explanation. \"care to elaborate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...it's kind of hard to explain...you see, we have stomachs, lungs and hearts, and -\" she went on to name a few other organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...sounds like an overall normal body to me...\" you state as her words only continued to stupefy your mind. If she was really trying to persuade you to let her devour you, then there was no doubt she was doing a terrible job at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an irritated huff and pout, she gazes down at you with the annoyed expression still cemented on her face. \"I said it was hard to explain.\" she counters once more. \"and even if it sounds normal, it's far from that.\" she adds before slowly averting her eyes to the side. \"you...you don't trust me...do you?\" she asks in a slightly pained voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"errr...\" you stammer, completely unsure as to how to answer her question. \"well...it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it.\" she states before you could even choose the right words to explain your point. \"you don't trust me...\" Her ears slowly begin to droop downwards as if depressed by the assumption. \"and here I thought...\" After a second of silence, a long sigh escapes her mouth as she closes her eyes sorrowfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up at her saddened form, a great feeling of guilt begins to weigh upon your shoulders. The Vulpix obviously didn't intend any harm when you first encountered her, and she was even thoughtful enough to offer you her help. Yet her methods of 'helping' is completely treacherous without a doubt. Seeing as how this vulpix girl was the only being right now capable of assisting you, and fearing that you could easily end up in a worst situation alone, it seemed that the best choice you had was to try and listen in on her proposition...or at least try your best to alter her plan. With a long tense sigh and small shake of the head you finally speak up. \"you...said I'd be safe...right?\" you ask, still hoping with all your might that her strategy wasn't an easy ploy at getting a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wha?\" her head soon turns to look down at you as her eyes almost looked like they were on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, if you do eat me...i'll be safe?....right?\" you repeat once more. As you finish asking the question, the sadness within her eyes soon switch to surprise as she nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like I said, pokemon bodies are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"different.\" you finish her statement as a small shudder runs down your spine. You honestly couldn't believe you were doing this. There was a 50% chance that this whole procedure could end up with you neck high in a pool of acid. Regardless though, you really didn't seem to know any other way of getting about. Even if you were lucky enough to encounter another pokemon after escaping this vulpix girl, that is if you weren't killed first, there was no telling whether or not they would want you as a snack or worse. \"So...everything should be alright then?\" you ask, still not convinced that you will be one hundred percent safe with this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are you saying that, you want to-\" The vulpix looks down at you growing even more surprised by the further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes...\" you reply with reluctance. \"...Let's go give your plan a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a matter of seconds, the vulpix girls sadness takes a complete one eighty as an excited squeal escapes her. \"Alright!\" she says with complete giddiness. The sudden shift in behavior leaves you completely dazed as your eyes gazes upon her huge amber orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were...you just pulling an act this whole time?\" you stammer finding it hard for someone to suddenly switch emotions off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it did work didn't it?\" she asks with a beaming smile leaving you staggered by the reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-wha!? b-but...\" you try to word out some annoyed remark towards her sly actions but quickly let it slide away with a long exasperated sigh. \"So...what now? you just swallow me?\" you question as the grin on the vulpix's face began to grow.</span></div></div>",

As your whole skull fells numb from your sudden odd black out, you instinctively begin to raise yourself upwards into a sitting position. \"ah man...\" you groan as you use your thumb and index finger to gently massage the sides of your temples. After a few moments trying to ease the numbness coursing within your head, with luck the pain began to slowly deteriorate. Seconds later, you begin to open your eyes trying to regain your vision once more. While it did take a few seconds to actually manage to get a good view of your surroundings, confusion and shock immediately envelopes your mind.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll about you was nothing but towering green plant life as well as rather large chunks of supposed rocks below you. After getting a much closer examination over the strange rock like structures below you, you were shocked to discover that it carried a great resemblance to dirt, if only it was enlarged to massive proportion. It didn't take you too long to finally realize that you were somehow shrunk to miniscule proportion in a completely strange area all alone. Just how you ended up in such a place, let alone in such a size was a complete mystery to you. Despite the sudden predicament though, that wasn't the least of your worries. At such a small size, you were easily a target for stray pokemon wandering about. If one was lucky enough to pick up your scent, let alone find you, then that could ultimately result in a disastrous ending to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your head quickly gazes upwards nervously, you quickly scan about hoping with all your might that there was no sign of any stray pokemon at all around you. After doing a complete 360 multiple times, your tense nerves slowly began to ease up as it seemed you were safe. However, just when you thought all was well, a sudden voice from nearby immediately causes you to jump in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what have we here?\" the voice of a female sounds out in a rather teasing if not warm tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you quickly turn about trying to spot the owner of the voice. Despite your efforts though, the tall strands of grass prevented much of your view around the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little nervous are we?\" she asks following up with a small giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I guess you can say that.\" you reply in a stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so afraid of?\" she asks in the same teasing tone, mixed with a hint of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...apart from being tiny and probably in some hostile area...nothing much at the moment.\" You answer back, surprised that you managed to find some humor over the predicament. Nearby, the female voice erupts into a small bout of laughter as it suddenly began to trail off behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly does sound like a scary mess.\" she chuckles. \"Though...how can you be so sure that this place is hostile?\" She continues to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...I'm not so sure about.\" you honestly answer as your nerves continue to remain tense during the conversation. \"Though, how could I not be sure that this place isn't dangerous?\" you ask. \"more importantly, just how do I know that you won't hurt me?\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of silence emerges before the strange voice finally answers. \"Well, has anyone attacked you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet...\" you return. \"...That is...unless you intend to.\" you say before giving a rather audible gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have any reason to harm someone who has done nothing ill to me?\" She returns in a rather displeased tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then you have your answer.\" She states before you even had a chance to finish your assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long sigh, you begin to get annoyed by this word game this stranger was playing with you. \"If you want to talk, you could just come out you know?\" you speak loud enough to insure she was able to hear you. Another few seconds of silence filled the air before a response was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you give me your word?\" She asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?-\" you raise a brow by the sudden odd question. \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I reveal myself to you...will I have your word that you won't run away?\" She reiterates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds you remain standing confused by her odd question. However, you quickly decide to agree to her strange terms. \"errr...sure.\" You answer. \"I'm already shrunken down to size...what else could surprise me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle suddenly sounds off to your right followed by the immediate sounds of loud rustles. Just then, a large tremor immediately catches your attention as you turn your head towards the direction of the source. Within moments, a massive form began to arise beyond the view line of the grass tips revealing a shocking sight. Towering before you was what could only be described as a humanoid ninetales. The top of her cream colored head was decorated with rather long strands of matching hair that flowed down past her back. Her body was adorned in a sort of dress that looked almost oriental in appearance as her right hand carried what appeared to be a decorated fold up fan. Your eyes feel like their on the verge of popping out of their sockets once you manage to finally catch a glimpse of the voice in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" she asks with a small grin. \"Too entranced by my beauty?\" she teases<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"e-errr...well...I wasn't expecting you to look...like a ninetales\" you reply as you find it hard to swallow that you were actually talking to a gigantic ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, the world is certainly a strange place.\" she responds while giving a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up at this giantess vixen, you cant help but feel uncertain if she was truly a friendly or dangerous person...errr, pokemon to be around.</span></div></div>",

You fell to your knees, blown away by the sheer sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ninetales! A completely normal ninetales. At your regular twice, you wouldn\u2019t even give her a second look\u2026 but at your current size, she looked like she was large as a mountain! Compared to you, she looked like she was a kilometre tall! Each of her paws were as big as buildings, and they sent vibrations through the ground with every step, almost making you lose your balance. Her eyes looked like huge, beautiful seas of scarlet, as she silently scanned over the forest. You\u2019re completely frozen in place, staring at her in awe as she walks towards you\u2026 only to eventually realize you were directly in her path! At this pace, she was going to step on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped in your chest. You wanted to run, but you knew you would never be able to make it in time. For a moment, you thought you were doomed to a fate as a red smear beneath the vixen\u2019s paw. However, the ninetales ends up noticing you just in the nick of time, stopping in her tracks just an instant before she would\u2019ve squished you. You\u2019re awed as she bends down to analyze you, your entire view taken up by the vixen\u2019s massive, beautiful face. \u201cAh! Hello there, little human. I apologize \u2014 I almost stepped on you. Do make yourself a little more noticeable next time, okay?\u201d She says. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to be looking for Venaburgh, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now you must be dreaming. Not only was she huge compared to you, but she was talking all of a sudden? You\u2019ve never met a Pokemon who could say anything more than their own name. Her voice was smooth and velvety, and she seemed to speak quietly so as not to hurt your tiny, fragile ears. Still, you panicked. \u201cW-what? Who are you?\u201d You stuttered, on instinct. Judging from the look on her face, you could tell she was somehow able to hear what you were saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d She asks, tilting her head curiously. \u201cI am Lady Marissa. Have you not heard of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026 wha\u2026\u201d You said, clutching your forehead in exasperation, overwhelmed by what was happening. \u201cWhy are you so huge? I-I mean\u2026 why am I so small? How can you even talk!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... all Pokemon in this forest can speak.\u201d She raises a brow. \u201cYou\u2026 didn\u2019t happen to stumble upon this place by accident, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where I am, \u2018lady\u2019!\u201d You yell out angrily, at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems taken aback by this, her ears drooping as a look of concern dawns on her face. \u201cOh dear.\u201d She gently sits down in front of you, her many tails rustling as she lowered her head to eye-level. \u201cAlright. Do not panic, human. You are perfectly safe. You have simply entered a place where the traditional hierarchy of humans and Pokemon have been\u2026 reversed.\u201d She explained, in a calm and reassuring voice. \u201cUpon entering the Forest, all humans are reduced to a miniscule size. You should take a moment to get used to your new scale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to focus. \u201cHow do I get out of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no way out. Not presently, anyway,\u201d she frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Your heart sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, calm down, calm down! Humans are only able to leave the Forest on nights of a full moon,\u201d she says immediately, trying to calm you down. \u201cThe next one should be in just a few weeks from now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great,\u201d you groan, throwing your arms in the air in frustration. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to be stuck like this for <i>weeks</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bad. Many humans come to this forest for vacation, you know. Time doesn\u2019t pass normally here; even if you stay in the Forest for years, when you leave, you\u2019ll find that only five minutes will have passed,\u201d she says. \u201cThus, you can relax here for as long as you desire, without consequence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Mhmm. Cause that really helps me when I\u2019m a millimetre tall!\u201d You complain. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this? What am I going to do for three weeks, at this size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks annoyed at your attitude\u2026 but then gets a mischievous smirk on her face. \u201cWell, like I said, there\u2019s Venaburgh. It\u2019s full of humans like yourself. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s always something to do there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, relenting. \u201cAlright. Where\u2019s Venaburgh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose your eyes, little human, and I\u2019ll send you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow. \u201cUmm\u2026 alright?\u201d You close your eyes, and for a few seconds, nothing happens. Then, you feel the warmth of her meaty breath pouring over your body\u2026 and then suddenly, you feel yourself be scooped up something huge and wet! Your eyes snap open as you find yourself adrift in her unimaginably huge maw! Each of her fangs is at least ten times your size\u2026 her tongue alone might be a hundred times! Most worryingly was the massive, gaping black hole that was her throat, beckoning ominously to you at the back of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! No! Stop! What is wrong with you?\u201d You cry out, but your fear goes unheard. In feels like the entire Earth is moving below you as she slides her tongue back in her maw. You cry in fear as you realize you\u2019re being brought towards her throat! \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d You try to ran back up her tongue, but it\u2019s so monumental compared to you, your efforts are in vain. For her, gulping you down is as simple as swallowing a single crumb. You let out one last cry as her tongue folds back, pulling you instantly into the dark confines of her throat, sealing you away from sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d\u201d You screamed as you slid rapidly down her throat like a water slide, hearing juices flowing all around you as you descend deeper and deeper into her massive body. You can hear her heartbeat for a few moments as you pass through her chest, and then the massive amounts of air passing through her lungs, and then the gurgling and glurping of countless other organs as you slide down her throat. Eventually, you finally reach the place you were dreading the most; her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect to be dropped into a massive pool of acid. Instead, you land on top of a concrete floor. \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d As you sit up, disoriented, you are stunned and awed by what you were seeing. This ninetales\u2026 had an entire, tiny city inside her belly! You saw dozens of other tiny humans walking casually along tiny roads and living on tiny buildings, all floating on the sea of acid at the bottom of the ninetale\u2019s massive gut. Instead of roads, they had canals like Venice, with boats floating in the acid like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there, shivering, unable to even believe what you were looking at. This Pokemon had an entire city in her belly? How was this even possible? This all had to be some sort of surreal dream. Any moment now, you were going to wake up. That\u2019s right. Just wake up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a young woman approached you, dressed in fancy clothing and wearing a felt hat. \u201cAh! Hello there!\u201d She smiled, noticing you. \u201cWelcome to Venaburgh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you fainted\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up later to find yourself lying in an unfamiliar bedroom, posters and paintings lining the walls. Your first thought was pure relief. Shrinking down, getting swallowed by that ninetales, finding that city\u2026 it had all been just a bad dream. You jump out of bed, excitedly rubbing the sleep from your eyes as you pull open the window\u2019s curtains\u2026 only for your heart to sink in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still there. Inside the ninetale\u2019s massive stomach. In that strange city. You stumbled back, physically shaking. Was it really real? There was magic of all kinds in the Pokemon world, but you\u2019d never heard of anything like this. Just as you were about to panic, you heard someone walking up the stairs. You quickly turned around, only to see the smiling face of that young woman again. \u201cHey, you\u2019re up! I was worried about you,\u201d she said. \u201cI know Venaburgh can be a lot for newcomers to take in\u2026 but it\u2019s a lovely city, if you give it a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 this isn\u2019t a city\u2026\u201d You strained, still disoriented. \u201cThis is somebody\u2019s stomach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d She giggled. \u201cAll the \u2018cities\u2019 in the Forest are like this. It\u2019s actually pretty convenient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy!\u201d You stuttered, sitting on the bed and holding your head in your hands. \u201cHow are we not digesting right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the Forest, you cannot be harmed by any source. The acid in here is completely harmless,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like water. People swim in it all the time. Just don\u2019t drink it, it tastes bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no! I have to get out of here!\u201d You suddenly shouted, slamming your fist against the wall in exasperation. \u201cHow do I get out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a little saddened and taken aback, but she continues. \u201cWell\u2026 Marissa let's people leave through her esophagus once per day. She already did it today, so you\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow,\u201d she frowns. \u201cBut if you really want to leave right now, you could find your way through her intestines and exit the \u2014 ahem \u2014 \u2018natural\u2019 way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it. Even if they had a nice city built in here, you didn\u2019t want to be stuck inside a Pokemon\u2019s stomach any longer than you had to, on principle. On the other hand, you definitely didn\u2019t want to go exploring one\u2019s intestines...</span></div></div>",

You barely recognize it bending down, gently picking you up, and holding you up to its face. \"Hey, are you alright?\" It said - in a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh...\" Your eyes finally choose to cooperate again, and you saw that you were being held in the talons of a blaziken. She had her head feathers done up in a ponytail, and her red breasts loomed below you at a massive size. Her large face bore a smile as she noticed your movement. \"Well now, aren't you a cute little thing!\" She said with a tone of wonderment. \"How did you end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" You tried to think of what happened last night, anything that would lead to you shrunken in the presence of a busty blaziken, but your mind ends up drawing a blank. \"...To be honest, I don't really know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear.\" She looked down at you, petting your head gently. \"Well, however you got here, it's definitely not safe for someone so small to be lost in this forest.\" She put a talon to her chin, then perked up. \"Say, how would you like to go along with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Blaziken said, \"You'll be much safer with me than with anybody else, and, well, I suppose if things came down to it...\" Her voice trailed off, and her cheeks somehow gained a brighter shade of red. But she quickly snapped out of it. \"All we'd have to decide is where you'd be riding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's simple! Do you want to be snug and tight up here...\" She patted her generous cleavage, \"Or do you want to... well...\" She moved her hand down her body, stopping it at the tuft of feathers near her crotch. You blushed in surprise - a pokemon letting you near its most intimate areas? How lucky you were! \"So, er,\" Blaziken repeated, \"Where would you like to... ride?\"</span></div></div>",

You could even see them gently jiggle with her subtle body movements, cementing their immense size for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you, you noticed a conspicuously darker bump on the breast - her nipple. Nervously, you choose to rub it, causing Blaziken to giggle. \"Hey, that tickles!\" She said, stroking the breast you'd touched. Then, an idea seemed to strike her. \"Y'know, I wouldn't mind you climbing in that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" That confused you. Was she saying that you could actually enter her rack through her nipple? Seemed far-fetched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'see,\" She started, confirming your suspicions, \"If you just rub on them for a little bit, my tits'll be more than happy to let you in!\" She practically pushed you against her boobs by this point, your face blushing by sheer proximity. \"So, interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright then.\" Tenderly, you began rubbing down on the nipple, Blaziken's giggles slowly turning into moans of pleasure as you continued. After about a minute, you saw an entryway appear - putting your hands to the edges, you found that you could easily stretch it, causing Blaziken to let out a gasp of delight. Smiling, you climbed in, and she massaged the breast you entered until her nipple finally sealed itself. Satisfied, she began walking, her bare breasts bouncing and swaying with every step...</span></div></div>",

Unsurprisingly, this is almost the exact thing you were looking at now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the way things are in there! Normally most Pokemon have the power to arrange their anatomy in ways that would help in these situations, but...\" she sounded almost disappointed in herself... \"I've never really gotten the hang of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean arrange their anatomy? Pokemon can do things like that?\" You asked, thinking the idea as being illogical at best. \"Yeah! Mostly this ability goes unused because there is never a need for it normally, but in this situation, that ability would be super handy, if only I were any good at it...\" You were surprised to learn this information. Who knew that Pokemon had such an odd ability? Although, in this case, she was right about it being useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could still try using that ability to help me make my way through your body? It would be good practice for you too!\" You were hoping that she would be up to the task, seeing as you needed to find someplace in her body to rest and think about what you were going to do. \"I suppose I could try... but it won't be easy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you noticed that on the opposite side of the breast, an opening began to form. \"Okay, I think I did it right. That path that just appeared <i>should</i> have two paths you can take. The one on the left will lead you up to my head, in case you wish to see the outside world or speak with me more directly. Or you could use my brain to control my body for a bit, if you so desire...\" You wondered how you would possibly go about those activities... \"and the other on the right should lead you down, close to my naval. I decided to try and set up a room for you down there for you to rest in whenever you need to. If you want to, you can check it out.\" both sounded very interesting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to swim across the white lake, which was surprisingly warm, although this was likely due to the fire typing, and made your way to the entrance.

But what really caught your eye was her figure - her hips were adorably petite, and her breasts seemed large enough to fit twenty of you at once. You blush when you notice her darker nipple poking out of her yellow fur, and she lets out a simple giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I found something like YOU in this forest!\" Pikachu said, absentmindedly walking around the clearing you were in. \"I mean, I know humans are rare and all, but to find one at such a tiny size... wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tiny?\" Well, that would explain why the mouse pokemon was so much taller than you.

How did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue!\" Pikachu chirped, answering your rhetorical question, \"But at least I'll have someone to talk to, now!\" She sat down on the grass and stretched her legs, revealing a hint of... something between her legs. Then, she got up, and grabbed an orange-and-black outfit from behind her back. Confused, you asked \"What's with that costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this thing? It's my Libre costume!\" She said, putting on the costume shamelessly. She flattened out the front of her pants, and began to fit the mask over her ears. \"Y'see, I always make it a point to show up to battles in a special, amazing costume, because everyone I meet just absolutely adores them!\" Pikachu finally fits her tank top over her chest, cupping her breasts and shifting them under the tight fabric. \"And I like how they bring out my figure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You lost yourself in her fondling of her breasts, but quickly shook yourself out of it. \"So, what's this one for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be sparring with a Garchomp hunk I know,\" She said, continuing to adjust her top. \"He says he's gonna win this time, but I know for certain that he's massively bluffing.

You'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" You figured Pikachu wouldn't want to trick you, especially given how excited she was to meet you. \"In that case, can I go...\"</span></div></div>",

You heard her croon softly as you slipped within the slit, and all around you the vaginal walls pulsed in arousal. But once you passed her cervix, you were unprepared for what laid in store for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is this some sort of... hotel?\" Indeed, what should have been her womb instead resembled a hotel lobby. Above you, you could see dozens of floors, far higher than you expected for Pikachu's body, and each looking surprisingly unorganic. There were even a few elevators to either side, and even a front desk - albeit with no one behind it. \"Am I hallucinating or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Pikachu cheerily responded, \"Welcome to Hotel Pikachu! One of the best places recommended by many other pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" You took another look around, stroking one of the walls. \"But why do you have a hotel in your.... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know how pokemon lay eggs?\" Pikachu rhetorically asked, \"They just roll straight past the womb without stopping, so I decided to make mine useful and turn it into rentable living space!\" You could tell that she was positively beaming at this. \"I've got everything in there; bedding, nice views, bathrooms, even room service!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how would other pokemon be able to... er, climb in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy! My body has some sort of mass compression that shrinks - oh, hi Garchomp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm going to save any more talking for after my battle. But feel free to check into a room!\" And with that, her voice faded away, leaving you effectively alone in her womb. Going up to the front desk, you found a map of her hotel - hmm, seemed like all the rooms were available! And another thing crossed your eye - apparently, Pikachu had managed to put a therapeutic spa in her vagina. Sounds like a nice place for you to unwind after this so-far unusual day...</span></div></div>",

But inside her rear was something that absolutely astonished you - instead of the expected colon, the space behind her anus looked more like a town plaza or mall, with dozens of storefronts lining the walls. Beneath your feet is a hard, bone floor - her surprisingly flat pelvic girdle. And even despite your small size, you know that none of this could have fit in her petite form from the outside. \"How... How is this... There's no way this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I wouldn't question it,\" Pikachu interrupted, \"I don't quite understand it myself, but I decided to take in stride. Why don't you check out my shops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You glance briefly at all the stores around you - quite a variety for being inside a pokemon's body - but the one closest to her ass catches your eye. \"Wait, you have a clothing warehouse down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles again. \"Well, I need SOMEWHERE to store all my costumes, so why not in my sexy bod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess that makes sense.\" You opened the warehouse door, and your jaw drops. \"H-how many costumes do you have!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least a few dozen, I think? I never bothered to count,\" Pikachu answered. \"And if you're wondering why they look your size, my body does some sort of mass compression - Oh, there's Garchomp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I won't be able to talk to you,\" She says, \"I need to focus my full attention on the fight.

I won't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" And with that, you were now effectively alone, as Pikachu began her battle with Garchomp - one which you could barely feel from this far in, except for the occasional ripple against the fleshy walls. You look back into her clothing warehouse - you couldn't wait to see what sorts of cute and sexy costumes this pokemon had. Of course, you could always go to a different store in here instead...</span></div></div>",

Like she said, she had an absolute plethora of outfits - there was a rock star costume, a fancy gown, a scientist's coat, and even some slightly zanier ones like a full pirate ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were a few that really stood out to you. There was a cute pink outfit that looked like something a pop star would wear, one of few costumes in here that didn't have anything covering her below the waist. A tag dangling from the hanger it was on said it was \"for nightclub visits\" - interesting that Pikachu would have that sort of lifestyle. Another item was a plain white, revealing bikini - which was helpfully labelled as her sleepwear. You could just imagine her in that ensemble, sleeping cozily in the forest looking absolutely sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shaken out of your thought by the sight of a strange machine. It was sort of a metal box, with some buttons on the front and two bulbed prongs sticking out the top. Engraved into it was a sketch of a pikachu's head, with an arrow pointing towards a set of underwear. How curious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly hear Pikachu again, this time breathing heavily. \"Sorry... About that...\" She panted, \"Garchomp... really put up... a fight... so... do you... like all... my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're all very... lovely.\" You reply, \"But what's this machine all the way in the back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why, that's my Lingerifier!\" She answered, quickly full of energy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what-ifier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lingerifier!\" She repeated, \"It allows people to transform into sexy undergarments for me to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" This intrigued and slightly worried you. \"Er, is it safe? Is it permanent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" She giggled, \"It only lasts until the next day, and you'll still be able to see and stuff as my clothing! Give it a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose trying can't hurt,\" You say, going up to the Lingerifier to get a better look of the buttons.

Next thing you know, you're hanging from a coat hanger, in a form you know isn't that of a human... Just as Pikachu said, you've been transformed into a pair of panties! But not just any pair - you had a design that matched the colors of what you had been wearing, along with a pink circle to represent your face on the front. In fact, you were practically \"seeing\" out of this circle - although admittedly, looking at a bunch of sexy outfits gets repetitive after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this feels incredibly strange, yet also incredibly natural,\" you say - then you mentally gasp. It seemed you still had the ability to speak, despite your new fabricy form lacking a mouth. Better than being mute, you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...just transformed, let me take him out,\" Came Pikachu's voice, and soon you saw her massive hand reach into the clothing warehouse. She put her Libre costume on a hanger near you, then grasped you tightly and pulled you out. Soon, you found yourself back outside, looking up not only at a now-naked Pikachu, but also the Garchomp she had been sparring with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the shrunken human Pikachu found?\" He asked, gently stroking your fabric with a claw. \"I must say, you look awfully cute as a pair of panties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome!\" Ah, so not only could you speak, but others were able to hear you speak. Interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but he'll look a lot cuter when I put him on!\" Pikachu said, and she quickly did just that. Your form had to stretch a bit to fit her loins, but to your surprise it didn't hurt - it felt wonderful. \"Well, how is it?\" She asked, \"Are you comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, very.\" You manage to shift your fabric form to squeeze her buttcheeks, causing her to giggle. Garchomp smiled, then thought of something;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, no reason to wear panties without a bra, right? Mind if I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not!\" You felt Pikachu pull away your back, and Garchomp somehow squeezing inside her ass. After a few seconds, she pulled him back out, this time as a dark blue brassiere with red and yellow highlights towards the center. Somehow, you managed to move your \"eyes\" up to see her put him on, causing her breasts to turn nearly flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Garchomp? You're... Kinda crushing my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oop! Sorry, Pikachu!\" Garchomp managed to somehow loosen himself, and Pikachu's rack returned to its normal, large size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better,\" She said, jostling her dragon-supported assets. \"So, how about we take a stroll through this forest? I mean, it is a lovely day, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good!\" You say simultaneously with Garchomp. Pikachu giggles, and begins walking, causing you to feel her loins rub tightly against your \"insides.\" If you had the cheeks to do so, you'd most certainly be blushing - maybe you could strike up a conversation to ease the tension...</span></div></div>",

And now, pretty much everyone wants to get inside her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu blushed deeply at that last part. \"Okay,\" you said, \"And how about that Lingerifier thing? Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we found that thing out to rust in a junkyard. Neither of us knew what it did, so Garchomp pushed some buttons, and... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I turned into a pair of panties. Like you did!\" He finished. Pikachu giggled, continuing where he left off; \"We shared a good laugh, and I got to wear him for the rest of the day. And that's the main reason I've gotten into collecting costumes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And because of all my sexy outfits, I've gotten to know many more pokemon! Oh, and...\" Pikachu patted your rear. \"You're kinda riding up on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whoops!\" You gently removed the bit of you that was going up her ass, making her let out a giggle. The rest of the walk progressed in much the same way - the three of you talking, swapping stories, and Pikachu occasionally rubbing you. Eventually, you noticed the sky turn dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Goodness, it's late, isn't it?\" Said Garchomp, squeezing Pikachu's breasts a bit to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it is!\" She giggled, \"I guess we must've lost track of time!\" She quickly laid herself down on the grass, using her dragon-supported breasts as makeshift pillows. \"Feel free to cuddle as much you want... I'll see you in the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" The two of you say, and she almost immediately falls asleep from exhaustion. Soon after, you decided to intentionally ride up on her, massaging her ass deeply as she let out a moan of bliss. You felt Garchomp do the same up at her breasts, gently squeezing them every which way... And the two of you fell asleep in absolute ecstasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you found yourself right beneath Pikachu's vagina, once more in your normal, if still-tiny, human form. Garchomp had transformed back, too, and his drowsy face broke out in a smile as he carefully removed his hands from her breasts. He smiled down towards you, surprised. \"Goodness, you're even smaller than I thought you were!\" He tenderly stroked your head with a claw, then brought them both to his girlfriend's ass. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first,\" you say, and his face suddenly flushes with energy. He quickly and effortlessly pries open her ass, far wider than you expected, causing her to let out a deep, pleasured moan. Wasting no time, he climbed in, Pikachu's cries increasing in intensity until he was finally all the way in. You followed, although your small size didn't make nearly the same impact as she sat up, fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-he follows; due to mass compression he's now only three times your size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, aren't you two sneaky!\" She giggles, reaching a hand past you to grab her Pop Star outfit from her clothing warehouse. \"I hope you two have fun in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will!\" Garchomp shouts to her retreating hand, then looks down at you. He's still larger than you, but thanks to that strange mass compression Pikachu mentioned, he was of a somewhat manageable height - only three times your size. \"So, where do you wanna go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" You look at all the storefronts; each one seemed interesting in its own right. There was a restaurant, a games shop, a contest hall, a... \"...a swimming pool? Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man!\" Garchomp rushed over to the pool door, \"It's been forever since I've swam in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how is there a pool here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, isn't that obvious? It's her bladder.\" Your face blanched as you took in what that implied. Garchomp laughed it off. \"Don't worry, it's not THAT gross! Pikachu's urine is actually very cleansing - purer than regular water, I'd say! And-\" He ruffled your shirt- \"It won't even try to soak into your beautiful clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...kay...\" You had to admit, Garchomp's semi-sales pitch made you very interested to go in there. Of course, you also wanted to take a look at all those other storefronts, too...</span></div></div>",

Here you were, stuck in the middle of the forest, shrunk down to the size of half an oran berry alone and helpless in the wild. Here you were initially hoping to spend away time with a small peaceful stroll.

Upon pondering further over this unexpected manner, a sudden rummaging sound nearby immediately snaps your brain back to the face of earth. With terror filled eyes, you turn to gaze at the direction of the odd noise, unsure just what it was that lurked beyond your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-hello?\" you call out meekly, unsure if whatever was nearby was capable of understanding. Ah, who were you kidding? For all you knew, there was no telling if there were other humans about, let alone anyone shrunken like you. Deep down you wanted to hightail it away. Dash as mad as you could in hopes of escaping whatever it was that was nearby, But at your current size you doubted you'd be able to make it far at all. Seconds soon pass as nothing but silence looms about. Your nerves were slowly begin to calm as you wondered if whatever was nearby simply waltzed away uninterested. Just when you were going to let relief overtake you, a sudden female voice quickly interjects your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The voice asks not too far off. Shock once again overtook your mind, but also a small sense of relief as well. 'Thank heavens' You think to yourself, grateful there was someone here that understood you. \"Hello?\" You call out once more. \"Ummm, I'm in need of a little help.\" you admit without hesitation. \"Help?\" the female voice asks thoroughly surprised by your plea. \"Oh no! I'll be there in a jiffy!\" she states as a small smile forms on your face from the response. \"Oh thank you!\" you reply with a chuckle mixed with built up exhales. \"I thought i'd be-\" Your words were quickly interrupted as the sudden sounds of explosive booms, and tremor like quakes fill your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken completely by surprise from the motions below you, your feet end up losing balance as you simply find yourself landing right on your rear end. With a grunt, you give a small wince of pain before noticing a large shadow covering you from above. Nervously, your eyes trail upwards before your lower jaw suddenly drops down agape. Standing right in front of you was a massive sized sylveon! the sheer size of the pokemon seemed to rival that of a normal building back in town as you had to raise your head skywards just to see it's huge face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" the Sylveon muses as you notice it's head begin to turn back and forth curiously. At first, you were absolutely confused as to why a Sylveon would be here in the first place. Maybe it belonged to some other trainer, Let alone the one who managed to here you out? Just when you were expecting another figure to come walking by, what happens next leaves you speechless. \"Hello?\" The Sylveon shockingly spoke while still gazing about. \"Is anyone here?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't be real. Last you remembered, pokemon couldn't say nothing except the name of their own species. Yet here stood a massive eeveelution talking about like some casual human you bumped into. As you continue to gaze up at her in absolute confusion, her huge blue eyes soon manage to make out your tiny form below. \"Huh?\" she murmurs before lowering her head ever so slightly taking up nearly your entire view of the sky. \"what are you?\" She asks as her eyes sparkled with a curious emotion.</span></div></div>",

The beast lowers its head down you you and cocks it\u2019s head to the right, staring at you through one eye. You are frozen in place by fear as you watch the bird open it\u2019s gaping maw.<br>\r\n\u00abHello there!\u00bb<br>\r\nInstead of death awaiting you at the other end of the maw, only two words were sitting there, waiting to shatter your world as you knew it. The monster\u2019s beak snaps shut as it turns it\u2019s head to get a better look at you. The creature hops forward a bit but you still don\u2019t move as a mixture of fear, shock, and awe are controlling your body now. The beast opens it\u2019s beak again.<br>\r\n\u00abUmm...? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you even speak? What are you anyways? Hello? It\u2019s getting kinda boring talking to what\u2019s essentially a statue.\u00bb<br>\r\nThe beak snaps shut again as the Pidgey finishes up talking after having fired a rapid fire barrage of questions at your stunned frame. It gives you a quick lick and a nuzzle to try to spur you into motion.<br>\r\nThis does the trick as you are startled out of your frozen state. You stare up at the massive eye before you. You can finally move again but what do you do with your newfound ability to move?</span></div></div>",

The idea is that a trainer suddenly finds himself shrunk to insect-size without any reason. He then realized that the \"giant\" Pokemons wanted to eat you and they want you to live in them to explore their other-worldly interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Basic Rules:</u><br>\r\n1. Vore is absolutely allowed. The trainer can enter from any part of the Pokemon's body.<br>\r\n2. The Pokemons have the ability to talk like humans.<br>\r\n3. The Trainer can explore the 'interior world' of the Pokemon. The locations can be real (i.e. stomach, brains, eyes, etc.) or imagined (i.e. rooms, chambers, etc.) <br>\r\n4. Erotic body parts/elements are allowed. This includes cock/anal/un-birth.<br>\r\n5. Digestion is discouraged; the main point is a \"<i>Fantastic Voyage</i>-esque\" plot.<br>\r\n6. <u>One-sentenced entries</u> aren't appreciated; be sure to make it longer.<br>\r\n7. You are free to add whatever you like as long as it is on-topic and not too short.<br>\r\n8. Enjoy adding to the interactive.<br>\r\n</td>",
