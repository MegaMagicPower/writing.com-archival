I am of the female gender and I think I am very good at what I do. What is that? I am an FBI agent. A very good FBI agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't get nervous or anything. The case I'm about to embark on is bigger than any crime YOU could have committed. Or even thought of committing. My boss, Ryon Hammersby, is about to tell me about this very mission. Supposedly it's very hush hush so don't tell everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into a large office and stare at the tall muscular man behind the large desk. He sits with his large hands steepled before him, his elbows resting on the dark wood. His hair is perfect, brushed back in a professional way. He doesn't smile, never has, but sits waiting for you to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair you choose to sit in is not one of the most comfortable chairs in the world but you've sat in it before. He clears his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't think you can keep your mouth shut Agent Rayn leave now.\"</span></div></div>",

He seems to be about your age, but as far as you know he could be several thousand years old. You wonder, \"Is this man to be trusted?\" The man looks rather worn as though he has spent days without sleep. \"Is he really an elf?\" you wonder. \"The ears and eyes are definitely elvish is style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stirs, for he was resting his eyes, and looks at you as though for the first time. \"Hello, my name is Prince Lemli of the Woodland elves. I shall be your guide on your journey to save the unicorn,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Agent Silver Rayn,\" you reply. \"How did you get in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ryon let me in.

You are wearing the same clothes, but your ears are pointy and your other facial features are perfect and feline. Your eyes are as blue as the sea. There is something that you did not notice, though, until now. You have a purple birthmark on your left shoulder that is in the shape of a maple leaf. You've had it your entire life, but it was only a light strawberry color before. The prince noticed the birthmark at the same time you do and crosses the room to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is marvelous!\" he exclaimed. \"Who would have thought that the prophecies would come true through you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's right, you're an elf now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and the light seems to hurt them. You blink a few times and finally the world returns to focus. You are standing beside a small steel bed in a large white room. It gives the appearance of lifelessness and you feel it choking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just the elf blood in you. Relax.\" Ryon's voice comes from some unseen speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a jerk, Ryon.\" You say as you swallow your panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I?\" He laughs. \"Here's the deal Agent Rayn.

Slowly, you bring the mirror up to your face and stare in shock. Your cheekbones are higher up and more defined, your eyes are a deep gray which was a color you always admired, your lips are slightly fuller with a natural healthy pink color and your slightly crooked nose straightened and looked pixie-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyon jerks the mirror from your hand. \"You're falling in love with yourself.\" He says coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than falling in love with a jerk like you.\" You say because you know what he said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, choose. Do you want to work this case alone?\" Ryon questions as the mirror seems to disappear. Something is not quite right about the whole chamber of white thing. \"Or do you and Justyn work as a team again?\" Ryon crosses his arms and you notice that his eyes are not brown like you originally thought. They are a yellowish green and actually quite ugly. You try to ignore the sinister smile as you think of your options. </span></div></div>",

You were so comfortable you didn't even notice that you were even dressed like an elf. \"Where did you get these clothes?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same place I got the weapons, Agent.\" Ryon replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" You say as the snatch up the long sword and belt it to your hip. \"How do I look?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious.\" Erik replies as he stands near you. You can feel his breath on your neck as he leans in and whispers, \"Divine. Good enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me hurl.\" You say as you shrug. The others gather their weapons and you look around. Ryon is gone. \"When did he leave?\" You ask but no one answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Agents. And bring me back the unicorn. Alive.\" The disembodied voice of Ryon fills the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't he come on this mission if it was so important to him?\" Meghan asks bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's a chicken.\" You reply as the white glows brighter and causes you to shut your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or because he's smart.\" Justyn replies somewhere beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the reason, you can be sure I'm going to find out his intentions.\" You say. \"Even if it kills me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a loud noise followed by darkness. Then a gust of air and suddenly you hear birds and smell fresh air. You open your eyes. You are standing in front of a large forest. The trees are the color of blood, deep red. You smile softly because you realize that Ryon has sent you all on a fool's errand and that the only way to succeed is to survive.</span></div></div>",

Give me a minute.\" You say. You think of surviving, which has suddenly become the focus of the mission. Which way? You hold four lives in your hands.

You shudder as you walk beside Justyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayn, I must say I am impressed.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I never thought we would get along this well. Remember the mission five years ago?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. How could you forget it? You had jumped at the chance to get away from Erik since the terrible night when you came to him. Foolish you knew but it had been a bad couple of weeks and you needed comfort. Or something like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have no desire to bring up the past but you look mighty good as an elf.\" Justyn looks at you lustily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justyn. Only you would think of sex while you're a wizard and I'm an elf. This mission is strange enough without fatal attractions making it worse.\" You smile smugly as Justyn looks slightly chastised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" He says pointing. Sure enough, before you unfolds the fresh green landscape of Mandisor. You study the fresh peaceful looking land and wonder why Snarl would have had such a negative outlook on the land. Justyn begins to step into the sunlight but you halt him by placing your hand on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Rayn? Reconsidering my offer?\" He asks with a lifted eyebrow and a twinkle in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reconsidering the trolls words actually.\" You say. \"We need to use caution here.\" You look behind you then turn your gaze back to the blinding sunlight. \"We need to use extreme caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustyn looks at you a moment then frowns. In the silence you consider your options. </span></div></div>",

Although that is usually the first sign that it is dangerous.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayn, how did I ever end up with an optimist like you?\" Justyn mocks and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryon said you were too cautious for me. Who's the cautious one?\" You joke and you both laugh. \"Well, I guess if we feel good enough to laugh we should believe the danger to be not as great as we hypothesized.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless it's just the sunlight and the natural green color that has lightened our moods, I am likely to agree with you.\" Justyn said as you both step into the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is fresh and remarkable. You never realized you could get used to the smell of dried blood but now that you inhale the fresh air you realize you had done just that. You stroll calmly as the thigh high grass sways in a gentle breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayn.\" Justyn says after a moments silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love Erik?

And, I mean, it's just you're too good for him.\" Justyn runs a hand up and down his neck as though uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, Justyn, I discovered that long ago.\" You smile and pluck a blade of the tall grass. Still moving forward, you twine it into a ring and are secretly impressed by the neatness and style of it. \"I can't believe it.\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Justyn asks anxiously. He seems to be hanging on your every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out.\" You say as you hand him the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice, Rayn, but you haven't truly answered my question.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You bite your lip and think. \"Erik was a foolish time in my life. I guess I was confused and enamored and impressed all at once. He is a great agent after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you.\" Justyn whispers and you feel strange. Was Justyn truly interested in you? This was an unexpected turn of events. Of course, becoming an elf, searching a strange land for a mythical creature for you boss at the FBI was not exactly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we were wrong to fear this place. Maybe Snarl doesn't like it because of the fresh smell.\" You say, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Justyn says then stops walking. You stop as well and face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You say, although you don't feel any warnings you trust Justyn's instincts nearly as well as your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\" Justyn says and he takes your hand and places the ring on your finger. You look down at it. It is gold! The intricate weaving of the grass blade remains but Justyn has turned it into solid gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly.\" Justyn whispers in your ear. You look up and he kisses you, softly and passionately on the lips. Despite all reason you allow him to lay you down in the tall grass, many blades bending beneath you. He breaks the embrace and smiles at you. \"Agent Rayn, may I have the honor of making love to you in this strange place?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justyn, maybe we should-\" You begin but he interrupts you with another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Rayn, may I have the honor of making love to you in this strange place?\" He asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You say and you give in to the emotions that swirl within you. You and Justyn...together. Even as he kisses you, you know that this may be more than lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may actually love him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daylight fades as you and Justyn lay in each other\u2019s arms. You think silently that this may have been a mistake. Just as that thought enters your mind, Justyn turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayn, I think I may love you.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"I think it may be catching.\" He kisses you and there is no more talk. </span></div></div>",

Well, everyday with a twisted storyline.<br>\r\nYou uncork the vial. \"Bottoms up, eh boss?\" You say for lack of clever wit.<br>\r\nHis smile is unusually evil as you down the cool liquid</span></div></div>",

The word didn't leave your mouth and Ryon appears to be gloating. The room spins madly around you and you struggle to stay focused. You grasp the arms of your chair and blink your eyes rapidly.<br>\r\n\"Bad wizard or good wizard. What kind of question was that, Rayn?\" Ryon laughs and you feel like puking as the floor shifts beneath your feet. \"Of course it was a bad wizard. No decent wizard would allow this to happen.\"<br>\r\nYour vision begins to go black around the edges.
