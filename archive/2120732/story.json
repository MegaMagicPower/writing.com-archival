A gray and gloomy Spring day where going outside was not impossibly, but still made unpleasant by the constant light drizzle of rain. The weather team had missed thewir quota of rainfall the previous month so the next week was scheduled for light rain showers off and on th make up for it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside the Castle of Friendship one figure paced nervously in a circle. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As per Twilight's usual habits, as soon as she'd been gifted with the castle she made a list of all the rooms as well as their uses. Some were clear, such as the library with all it's shelves, and some where empty and left for her to fill. When the fount had been done the shocker had come in. Including broom cupboards, attic space, basement, and several spare guest rooms and bathrooms, all total Twilight had 198 rooms in the castle.And with so much space she'd set about putting it to use. Getting especially creative with the purposes of some rooms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In this case the room presently occupied was the designated 'Worry Room'. A place where anxieties could be let out, pillows could be sat on or thrown about, and no sharp objects or corners were close by in case of a potential panic attack. Twilight had even padded the ceiling after her first few breakouts as an alicorn had her flying up nervously until she banged her horn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However today it was not being used by Twilight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh what am I going to do do?\" Spike groaned as he unknowingly completed his fiftieth circuit around the room in the faint groove Twilight had worn into the crystal with all of her own pacing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well for starters you could talk to me,\" Spike jumped a bit, having not heard Twilight enter the room, \"What's wrong Spike?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young dragon fidgeted and tried to brush off her concerns. \"Wrong? Why would anything be wrong? Everything's right, right? \"And if everything's right then it can't be wrong, right?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wrong,\" Twilight replied bluntly, \"You've been pacing for almost an hour now. Just tell me. You know I'll help if I can Spike.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young dragon sighed, \"It's about our guest coming today.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh you mean Ember?\" Twilight smiled but her look turned to concern, \"I thought you'd be happy to see her?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am!\" Spike nodded, \"It's just... I was hoping I'd have grown some before we saw each other again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gave him a good-natured chuckle, \"Spike you shouldn't fret over that. Dragons take thousands of years to grow. Ember's father probably took a good ten thousand years to get as big as he is. I'd guess Ember herself is a couple hundred years old at the very least. You're not do for your next growth spurt until you hit fifty.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But that's just it, she's so much bigger and cooler than me, I was hoping I might grow some and at least be her equal if not a bit bigger and more impressive.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spike,\" Twilight smiled and drew him into a hug with her foreleg, \" You don't have to worry about that, you impressed her plenty when you met and worked together. And you more than won her over when you gave her the leadership of the dragons.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe, but isn't there some <i>magical</i> way I could be bigger before she arrives?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We've talked about this, Spike,\" Twilight sighed as she let him go, \"Magic on Dragons is extremely risky. Especially if it changes they're physical being. The mustache I gave you was just a simple trick compared to trying to change your whole body.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You don't remember what happened when i hatched you, she continued, \"That surge of magical energy made you grow into a full sized dragon temporarily, but you were under developed, A newborns mind in an adult body.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you could do it again, with more control this time,\" Spike suggested, \"You were just a unicorn filly and now you're an alicorn princess.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not that simple Spike,\" Twilight began a slow pace of her own, \"When I hatched you my magic became linked to you. That's's why Celestia had me practice by doing things like giving you a mustache or changing your colors.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh, I looked terrible in pink,\" Spike muttered in an aside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"By practicing on you my magical powers got stronger, but at the same time your body has built a resistance to magic as well, primarily my magic.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you can't do it then?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Even if I did, my magic would be no stronger or more controllable on you then it was back then,\" Twilight explained, <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Isn't there anything that can do it?\" Spike asked, almost sounding desperate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Even if there was I wouldn't reccomend it, \"Twilight sighed, \"Dragon growths aren't something that should be messed with. Remember your greed growth spree?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike winced, \"I try not to think about it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's natural that you feel the desire to grow, Greed Growth is an important survival mechanism for lone dragons in the wild, but it's lead to more feral dragons than intelligent ones like Ember and those teen dragons we met.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Again Twilight pulled Spike into a hug, \"Just relax and enjoy Ember's visit. I'm sure she'll be excited to see you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike just nodded as Twilight left the room. The small dragon sighed. He knew Twilight was probably right but the desire to be bigger to impress Ember was still burning inside him. He just had to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Spike searches the library and finds a spell book with a possible way to grow, but Twilight doesn't have all the ingredients, so he makes a few substitutions with unpredictable results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Spike goes to Zecora, hoping she might have an answer rand either sneaks a potion from her or stumbles across something on the way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Spike can't find anything before Ember arrives, but he's determined to find something during her visit that will make him bigger and more impressive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was not like the library, which had been smaller and much easier to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike had complained to Twilight about this, who had also realized that some of the work in the castle was not finished, for the dragon was finding less and less time to finish his chores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hired some help to clean the castle, something the dragon was very grateful for, but then they received the hefty bill and realized that they couldn't afford the housekeepers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Spike was alone again. He wished there was a way to receive free help, but he knew that was impossible. It was not like he could make copies of himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute! Spike jumped off the chair, grinning, for he was just struck by a wonderful idea. He could make copies of himself, for Starlight had unblocked the passage the led to the mirror pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed out of the study and left the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike looked at his reflection in the magical pool. He was nervous, for he remembered what happened to Pinkie Pie the last time she used it. But Spike only wanted to make copies of himself for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it got out of hand Twilight could always fix it, couldn't she? He just had to make sure she could identify him amongst the hoard of other Spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here I go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike stepped into the pond and he felt the world around him spin. The next thing he knew he was standing on the pond's bank again, but this time there was another Spike staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Spike smiled triumphantly to himself.

She ran up the steps and entered her castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Twilight,\" Spike greeted, running past her, a feather duster in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, hey there, Spike,\" she greeted back, smiling at her hard working assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued down the foyer, but she only took a few steps before Spike ran past her again, carrying a bucket full of soapy water and a sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Twilight,\" said Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped in her tracks, watching Spike run down the hallway with confusion. Didn't she just saw him a few moments ago? He appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was just her weary mind playing tricks on her, Twilight shrugged it off and continued. But then something very strange happened; Not one but two Spikes ran past her, carrying a heavy basket of laundry between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was speechless. She knew that she was tired, but she wasn't so tired that she was hallucinating. She followed the two Spikes, who ran into the washing room. Pushing open the door, Twilight was met with a huge surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral Spikes where in the room, washing, wringing out, and hanging clothing. Shocked, Twilight backed slowly out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors in the foyer suddenly burst open all around her and what seemed like hundreds of Spikes came running out. Many carried various cleaning utensils and others wore aprons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooted to the spot, Twilight watched as the hundreds of Spikes greeted her endlessly. After what seemed like hours did the foyer finally clear, all the Spikes disappearing behind the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight finally found her voice again. \"What in Equestria's name is going on!\" she bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from a distance, but Twilight could identify where it emanated from. Frowning, determined to get to the bottom of this, she trotted at a brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burst into the study and found several other Spikes inside, all tending to one that was reclining back in a chair. Some were dropping gemstones in his mouth while others were messaging his feet. His round belly seems to be bulging further out than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Spike opened one eye and said calmly, \"Hey there, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike,\" she said sharply, \"what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got help, that's what,\" said Spike, gesturing to the others around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike grinned. \"Yup, I used the mirror pool to make copies of myself,\" he said, \"Needed someone to help me out, but I made so many that there's really no work for me to do, so I'm relaxing, taking some time off, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike, this is bad,\" said Twilight firmly, \"Remember what happened to Pinkie when she copied herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached him and whispered into his ear, saying, \"What if this gets out of hand and I have fix this? How would I know which one is the real Spike so that I don't erase you from existence accidentally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this,\" he whispered back, showing her the bracelet on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes widened when she saw it, immediately recognizing what it was. \"Where did you get that?\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starlight gave it to me some time ago,\" Spike said, \"She said she didn't want it anymore. Anyway, the most important thing is that if you cast a spell it would most likely bounce off. No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if-\" she looked around nervously at the other Spikes in the room, hoping that they wouldn't hear \"-the others try and steal it away from you? I highly doubt they would fall for a simple trick and be erased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was taken aback. \"Uh, I didn't really think about that,\" he said, grinning sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry,\" he quickly said when he saw Twilight's angry frown, \"I can keep this under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed and shook her head. \"This is bad, Spike,\" she said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, come on!\" the dragon whined, growing frustrated with Twilight's stubbornness, \"Look around you! The castle's been the cleanest in ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight did look around and took note that the castle was indeed spotless. The copies had done an excellent job cleaning the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Twilight finally said, giving in, \"They can stay for tonight, but tomorrow-\" her voice dropped to a whisper again \"-they have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike grinned happily. \"Thanks, Twilight,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she left the study, halting in her tracks as three Spikes ran past her, she couldn't help but feel that a ominous presence was hanging over the castle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight Sparkle's castle was quiet and tranquil. Spike sighed, sinking into the couch, his feet resting on a footstool and his large eyes buried in a book. A fire burned in the earth, the logs being consumed by bright green flames, curtsy of the little dragon's special ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not one upcoming event, not one threat invading Equestria, and, most importantly to the green dragon, not one pony to boss him around; Twilight had gone to the Crystal Empire to visit her brother, leaving Spike behind to tend to their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, if there was one thing he enjoyed the most was being left home alone. Well, almost alone. Somewhere in the castle, Spike knew, Starlight Glimmer was busy working on some spells for her studies, but she, due to being a little awkward in conversation, rarely bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of awkwardness, Spike had noticed that the pony had been growing a little nervous and flustered lately. He didn't know why exactly, but he heard that it's about Trixie and a stallion. When Spike asked her for more information, Starlight only said, \"It's not meant for little dragons' ears. I'll tell you when you're older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike would usually bristle in anger at that statement. What did she mean that he wasn't old enough? Why, he helped plan celebration, wrote hundreds of letters for Princess Celestia, and accompanied Twilight and her friends on dangerous quests. He could handle Starlight's secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Spike wanted to dig a little further, but then it accord to him that perhaps this could be a personal matter, that he would be sticking his snout into something that he had no business in, so he decided to leave it. But it was on this afternoon that all that was going to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main door of the castle swung open with a deafening boom that echoed throughout the castle, startling Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starliiiiight!\" a familiar voice screamed in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike jumped off of the couch, running out of the library to see what the commotion was about. The green dragon caught sight of Trixie running up the staircase, her face twisted in rage, cape billowing in the wind as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, Spike followed her, calling out to her, but she didn't stop. He followed her and saw Trixie storm into Starlight's room. Worried, the dragon ran over and peered inside. The two friends were in a heated argument, shouting at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" Trixie exclaimed, pointing a hoof in accusation, \"How dare you steal away Black Hearts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight gritted her teeth and said, \"I won, Trixie. He kissed me. He chose me. That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you also got yourself into his bed!\" Trixie said with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight gaped in shock. \"How did you...?\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, you weren't suspecting that I would leave the two of you alone after I saw you, did I?\" Trixie said with a smirk, \"I spied on you and I saw everything he did, and he bred you good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now Starlight's turn to point a hoof at Trixie's face. \"Say what you want,\" she said, \"You're just jealous that he fell for me instead of you. But I highly doubt that any stallion would fall for you with your kind of attitude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike couldn't believe his eyes. Starlight and Trixie, two good friends that went together like peanut butter and jelly, were fighting at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O really,\" said Trixie, a sly smile returning to her face, \"Well, I bet that I can seduce every stallion in Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, you want to make bets I see,\" said Starlight, \"Well then, I could do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her hoof. Trixie stared at it for a few moments, took it, and said, \"Very well then. Whoever takes the most stallions wins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, Trixie stormed off, Spike jumping out of the way, hoping that no pony saw him, leaving Starlight glaring at her as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike stood there in the hallway, trying to process what just happened. From what it looks, Starlight had managed to steal away a stallion that she and Trixie was competing against, and Trixie was anything but happy about it, being a complete sore loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the had shook on a deal to seduce the biggest stallion? Spike may be young, but he knew enough about the Birds and the Bees. They were going to have sex and lots of it. But they would calm down, won't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would come back together, apologize to each other, and have a good laugh about how silly they were. Yes, that sounded what most likely would happen, but then a thought suddenly reminded Spike of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they had mended their old ways, joining the side of the good guys, they were still cunning tricksters, and when it came to bets they never backed down. Spike had a feeling that something very bad was going to happen.</span></div></div>",

She was going show her that she could beat her at any bet, no matter how hard and lewd it was, for she never backed down from a bet. Starlight was going to ride every stallion she found...but how exactly she was going to do that she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight sighed, sitting on a bench. It was a fine Spring morning, birds chirping and ponies going about their usually business in the market square. Starlight never admitted it to Trixie, but she never really got Black Hearts to willingly fall in love with her. She cheated using some magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie and Starlight Glimmer had been after that stud for weeks. It was an undeclared rivalry between the two of them, and Trixie was the closest to winning it. Desperate, Starlight resorted to some...dark magic for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe visited Zocora, who reluctantly gave her a rare love potion, which only worked for one night, but that was all she needed. Starlight slipped it in during her date, and there you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew now that things weren't going to be so easy for her. Zocora wasn't going to give her any of the potion anymore, for the ingredients were rare and she had only one bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to have to resort to something else. But what? She then spotted something that gave her the answer in a bizarre way. Purple Cupcakes, a pony that had recently moved from Canterlot to Ponyville, was a cute mare, but she was on the thick side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't fat but she was chubby, with a large plot, round face, and pudgy belly. But her thickness did manage to turn quite a few heads. Stallions watched as she happily trotted by, goofy grins on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight was interested by this. She had read somewhere that, many thousands of years ago, a corpulent mare was a sign of fruitfulness. Was it possible that some stallions in present day still saw it that way? Nah, that couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at Purple Cupcakes and saw that a burly stallion was trotting alongside her, whispering something in her ear, causing her to blush and look away, smiling and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was so. Starlight had made up her mind what she was going to do. She was going to gain weight to attract stallions, and she was going to use a little bit of magic to get to her desired size.</span></div></div>",

It was only when it was too late when she heard the whooshing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had barely time to react. Fluttershy dove to the ground, covering her head. The birds, startled by the noise, flew away in terror. There was a deafening boom and then dead silence. Shivering in fear, Fluttershy slowly rose to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thought was that it was Rainbow Dash, the very pony she was supposed to keep a lookout for, that had spotted her and decided surprise her, for she often did make a whooshing noise when she landed, but when she looked in the direction where the boom had emanated from she was met with something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small crater in the ground, and something was glowing in it. Fluttershy stood there, too scared to move. Dare she check what it was? Finally, after a few moments of scraping her courage together, she, very gingerly, approached the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered inside and found a lime green stone inside, which was humming softly. Where did it come from? What was it? Should she probably seek Twilight out for help? These were the questions Fluttershy would have asked herself if she was in the correct state of mind, but, unfortunately, she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was mesmerized, her pupils enlarging. It was so beautiful, and Fluttershy couldn't resist to reach out and touch it. When she did, she received a feeling very similar to an electric shock. With a yelp, she jumped back, wrenched free from whatever effect the stone had on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to do. Then she felt drowsy, and the next thing Fluttershy knew she was falling to the ground, losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Fluttershy awakens only to find, to her horror, that her whole body had turned green, transparent, and dripping strange goo.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow, Apple Bloom! It's only been a week since we've started on medical potions, and you've already made your first antibiotic! You might just be a prodigy in more than just cutie marks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks, Twilight. Ah wouldn't even know herbal essences over ambrosia, if it weren't for you being such a good teacher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's summer time. And, for Apple Bloom - since she is out of school for a while - it is more commonly Twilight Time. Even though Princess Twilight Sparkle had gotten a castle; a friendship pupil in Starlight Glimmer; and even responsibility over a magical mission map, she still finds time to personally teach the Cutie Mark Crusaders how to hone secondary skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to downplay the growth of your skills, Apple Bloom. You truly have a talent for recipe making! I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, considering cooking runs in your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ah guess cookin' and potion makin' aren't too different from each other...Hmmm...Matter of fact, Ah actually never really tried doin' any kind of cookin', other than bakin' some fritters here and there...<i>Gasp!</i> Ah'm an Apple! But, Ah don't know that much about cookin' food, yet! Ah've been spendin' all this time potion makin' and cutie mark crusadin', that Ah haven't even taken the time to really learn how ta cook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Apple Bloom bemusedly, \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Ah've got to fulfill mah duty as a proper Apple, and broaden mah skill set! Time ta become a chef!\", Apple Bloom began to gallop out of Twilight's potion lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! Where are you going, Apple Bloom? We can still continue and start with the next lesson, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom yelled back as she clopped down the long hallway, \"It's okay, Twilight! Ah didn't want to take up much more of your time, anyway! We'll continue another day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed in disappointment, \"And here I was hoping I could spend a little more time teaching something different...I guess even finally getting those cutie marks can't stop those fillies from taking on new challenges.\", Twilight then smiled warmly and giggled in amusement. She nodded serenely as she began to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom briskly trotted through Twilight's castle halls, some thoughts going through her head as she already began brainstorming how to proceed on her new project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah could always just learn how to cook from mah family and their recipes...But, Ah also wanna try doin' mah own thing...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Apple Bloom skidded to a halt as she realized what wing of the castle she was in. She looked towards the large, violet door that lead to the castle library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hoof to her chin, \"Hmmmm...the library could have a cook book Ah could use ta learn some new recipes...But, we've got family recipes at home, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she just remembered something, \"Wait a minute. AJ is the only one at the farm, right now. And, Big Macintosh took Granny Smith to Whinnyapolis for an elderly farmers convention...They could be gone for a while. AJ could teach me how ta cook family recipes, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She poked her head around to see if Starlight Glimmer or Spike were in there. It seemed as though there was nopony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how hard could lookin' for a cook book be? Ah've been around Twilight long enough to know a thing or two about browsing for books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom searched the various sections and genres of the incredibly large and winding shelves. This was much bigger than the Golden Oaks Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder Twilight misses that old tree...This place feels more like a maze than a library!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searched and searched, looking for a tome suitable for her needs. Until she reached a deep point in the mystical library that felt mysteriously untouched and isolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darn...Ah feel a little bit uncomfortable about this decision, now...\", she began to feel lost and overwhelmed by the sheer scope of this unfamiliar part of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, however, she glanced to a shelf of 'Powerful and Enhancing Arts', and saw a book in the cooking genre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey!\", Apple Bloom trotted to the untouched book and nabbed it enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the cover, \"'The Big Fat Book O' Plenty: A culinary resource for truly remarkable cooking'.\", Apple Bloom hopped excitedly, \"<b>Alright!</b> This here's just what Ah need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the book to read the back, \"'This legendary cook book is the key to becoming the ultimate, gourmet master. The text is enchanted to give any fledgling chef whatever ingredients or materials required for each and every recipe within, on a whim.'...<i><b>GASP!</b></i> Ya don't say?! Wowee! Ah've struck gold, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom did not look any further into the seemingly amazing piece of literature. She bolted back where she came from, book carefully in her jaw. Little did she know that the words inside of this tome weren't the only thing enchanted about it. She could feel an energy welling up inside of her that she had mistaken for growing excitement, but was actually a bit more than that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apple Bloom galloped eagerly out of the castle, and through the streets of Ponyville. Her resolve adamant. Her goal so clear. For now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she had gotten to her home in Sweet Apple Acres. At the time, it seemed as though Applejack was out in the fields. Mowing some grass, as Applejack never stopped keeping herself busy. Even when it wasn't necessary.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom shook her head and rolled her eyes. \"<i>You already did the few morning chores we have right now. And, that grass wasn't even that tall, yet. You're such a workaholic, AJ...</i>\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe placed the book on the kitchen table, hopped on a seat, and began to brain storm what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmm...Ah wanna try somethin' simple. But, not somethin' an Apple would normally cook. Oh! Let's see what kinda pastas are in here!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sifted quickly through the pages, finding just the recipe she wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM! It's kinda basic. But, sounds tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom was startled when the page flashed with light. Pasta noodles, cherry tomatoes, seasonings, several cooking utensils, and even one huge stainless steel boiling pot and equally large steel strainer all popped out of the book. Apple Bloom's mouth gaped in awe for only a second before she realized that these items were about to land harshly all over the kitchen table. She gasped and shot her little forehooves out on pure instinct. Of course, there was normally no way she could catch all the items with such stubs. She flinched and closed her eyes in fear of the impending crash. However, there was no crash, but a strange humming instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom's eyes were still closed. With her hooves out and teeth clenched as she was still waiting for the loud noises. As the humming droned, and the loud bangs never occurring, Apple Bloom eased up and opened one eye. Then uttered a loud gasp as her eyes grew to the size of dinner plates. She couldn't believe what she was seeing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>H-Huh?! Wha-!? Ah have magic?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely flabbergasted. But, it seemed to be so. Apple Bloom's hooves were glowing a dull shade of green. And, the items that magically shot out of the Big Fat Book O' Plenty were wrapped in the same glow, floating over the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...This is...<b>Amazing!!! Ah can't believe it! But, the book gave me magic!!! It must've!</b>\", Apple Bloom's grin couldn't curve any wider on her little face. She felt a confidence that was growing into a full blown ego that could put Rainbow Dash's to shame. \"Oh, Ah'm gonna be the greatest chef in all of existence!! And, an Earth Pony with unicorn magic on top of that!? This is the best day ever!! <b>HAHAHAHA!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom couldn't help but hop in her seat. She looked over the various tools and ingredients granted to her by the amazing book. The Strainer and pot were especially huge. The pot seemed as tall as Big Macintosh, and probably wider than her own stove! The strainer being about as round, but half as tall. The utensils and ingredients were large and plentiful as well. It was a bit overwhelming and the kitchen felt rather clustered with how much the book provided for such a simple recipe. But, Apple Bloom was too excited to care that much. There were only two issues plaguing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, how am Ah gonna use these? Our stove and sink are kinda small compared to this pot and strainer...Ah can make so much pasta, though. And, Ah'm gonna need somepony ta taste mah creations...Ah guess AJ can help me out with that...Yeah. Ah want mah big sister to love mah pasta...And, everything else Ah'm gonna be cookin'! Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom suddenly felt incredibly engrossed in this endeavor. She could appoint Applejack as her honorary taste tester. And, with magic, she could probably make a lot of food. She looked over the particular recipe to make sure she did everything right. It occurred to her that she could try cooking the massive meal with her magic. After dumping entire pounds of pasta into the giant pot, she began to get intuitive as she turned on the sink with her powers, guiding a steady stream of water for boiling. It didn't take long for her to realize she could heat up the pot with her aura. For some reason, these things were coming to her rather naturally for somepony who just acquired the ability to use magic. She felt a little put off by this, but the fact that this was all really happening had only driven her to continue basking in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly was becoming a true master of the art. As she let the pasta boil on its own, she started mixing in ingredients into bowls from around the kitchen to make the sauce and seasoning for when the pasta was ready. All of these actions that one could do at once with this power. It felt rather simple and especially satisfying. Before long, the pasta was ready to be drained with the massive strainer. It was just big enough to handle the whole meal, and - with the aid of magic - Apple Bloom was able to successfully drain the water and place the pasta back in the pot with no mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time ta make the most delicious pasta ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Apple Bloom got to mixing in everything and completing her pasta, the tantalizing aroma of her creation had been wafting out of the window and through the gentle breeze of the late afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>SNIFF</i>, <i>SNIFF</i>! Golly, what is that...darn good smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack couldn't help but stop in her tracks as she pushed the mower back into the nearby shed. Somepony was cooking something that she wasn't used to smelling while out in the fields. Usually, Granny Smith would start making supper at this time. But, the old mare wasn't here, presently. And, whatever was being cooked wasn't at all familiar to her nostrils. Her belly growled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hay. Ah'm already starvin' from all this hard work Ah've been doin'. And, Ah'm the one who has ta spend extra time doin' the cookin'. Now that smell's gonna be drivin' mah gut crazy until Ah can finally eat! Ah wish mah appetite would behave and be more patient...\", Applejack blushed a bit, despite nopony being around to witness her literal belly aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was well known by her family and friends for having quite the appetite. She was a work horse through and through. And, that meant having the diet of a very productive one, at that. The amount of carbo loading that Applejack had literally <i>grown</i> accustomed to is the reason she was so thick. With muscle, of course. Although...she has been caught eating a bit more than necessary around the winter time by her family. They didn't mind too much, but it was rather embarrassing when the slow - unproductive days of winter combined with Applejack's above average food intake would lead to some rather weighty results...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>AJ, you've been through this. Granny and everypony has told you again and again....Ya ain't fat...At least, for the most part...And, even if ya were, yer real family and friends wouldn't judge ya.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelly growling more angrily, Applejack shook her head and began rushing the mower back into its proper place. Indeed, Applejack had a bit of an eating problem that was one of the few things that she was rather sensitive and self conscious about at times. Usually it didn't bother her. She was raised as a farm pony. Convinced that good eating meant more energy and productivity. But, even for somepony with this lifestyle, she was prone to going overboard. Particularly when Granny Smith or even some of her own friends would tempt her with their overzealous offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sometimes, I feel they're tryin' ta fatten me up...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack began to realize that the smell was actually coming from her house as she made her way inside, for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in tarnation? Who could be cookin' in mah own house without permission? Probably Pinkie Pie oversteppin' her boundaries again... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's face grew stern, but also rather relieved as she began to trot faster towards her front door. Her belly grumbled some more, hoping she could still eat whatever was cooking inside, even if it was made by a trespasser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah really got mah priorities straight, huh?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack opened the door and gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom turned from the giant pot filled with delicious pasta. She smiled broadly at her sister and trotted over to her side eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Perfect timing, sis! Ah know this seems all sudden like, but Ah've decided to learn how to cook! And, Ah've got this great recipe book ta help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was still beside herself, staring agape. But, as she looked at the huge pot and embraced the glorious smells coming from it, she couldn't help but drool profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?...Oh, uh - where did ya get such a big pot, Apple Bloom? And, as much as Ah approve of you takin' up cookin', don't ya think this a bit much? And, ya should've probably came to me first before starting all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah just couldn't help it, AJ! Ah felt like Ah should be able ta make some wholesome cookin' as an Apple! Now, why don't ya have a seat and try out mah first dish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer where-oof!\", Applejack was shoved from behind by her sister towards the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, AJ! Ah know you're hungry. And, Ah made plenty of pasta that Ah'm sure you're gonna eat most of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack blushed and glared at Apple Bloom as she took her seat at the table. Her stomach growled fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you start teasin', little sis....But, uh...Y-Yeah, Ah could use a heapin' plate of that pasta. Really smells like ya did good for the first dinner ya've ever cooked yerself. Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is kinda odd. Such a big pot sittin' on the floor. How did she cook this much in here?...But, Ah just want some grub...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack sat down on her usual wooden chair, staring at the table in front of her. Feeling rather reluctant to indulge in what she expected would be an overenthusiastic Apple Bloom goading her on to eat as much of her first, edible concoction as possible. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah just know she\u2019s not gonna let me leave until Ah let her know how much Ah like this pasta...Maybe Ah can get the message across that the pasta is so good, we could eat from this for the duration of the week. Ah sure as sugar am not gonna let mahself empty this pot too quickly, now...Surely...A-Absolutely not...Even if it smells so durn good...</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo punctuate the thought, Apple Bloom plopped a hearty plate of the pasta in front of Applejack, and tied her favorite - red checkered handkerchief - around her neck. She was too distracted by her thoughts to notice the magic Apple Bloom had used to serve her meal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy, sis! Ah had mah share of it already. It\u2019s delish! But, Ah wanna know what ya think.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack licked her lips and drooled again. It really looked perfect. Almost as if a picture you would see in recipe books actually materialized in front of her. The smell being all too much to further resist. Applejack couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She just began slurping and chewing the meal with great gusto. Eating like a pig at a trough. Apple Bloom smiled brightly at her success.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWowee! It\u2019s as good as Ah thought it was, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack moaned and inhaled half of the plate in seconds. She licked her lips and smiled at Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMM-MM! Ah think it\u2019s better than that, even!\u201d, Applejack dove back in to finish off the pile of carbs. When she was done, she leaned back in her seat and picked up the plate to diligently lick it clean. The back of her chair squeaked a bit as she rubbed her tummy in satisfaction. Belly growling for more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cH-Heh...Maybe...Maybe one more serving, Bloom?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Ah want ya to have yer fill!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, right\u2026\u201d, Applejack blushed as she was reminded of all the times she was told that. Encouraged to eat her \u2018fill\u2019. And, the many times that meant the scale would not be too kind to her, whenever she bothered to weigh herself next. She idly looked to her flanks in thought. A little relieved she could still see the edges of her seat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah\u2019ve been in pretty good shape for the past few months. Mah butt ain\u2019t coverin\u2019 the seat, either, l-like Ah\u2019ve noticed a few times...A...A little indulgin\u2019 won\u2019t do me no harm\u2026</i>\u201d, her hunger driven mind quickly derailing her discipline.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe family had the habit of seating themselves in a specific manner around this table for years, now. This chair was old, but still trusty. Serving Applejack\u2019s now toned bottom through thick and thin. Quite literally, for Applejack\u2019s fluctuating weight over time had put this chair to the test, every now and then. However, the occasional squeak would sometimes only make her that much more conscious of her waistline and diet. She feared a day when the seat would bend or even collapse; in response to her overfed form.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah\u2019ve never been <b>that</b> big...A-And, Ah\u2019m sure Ah never will be\u2026Ah hope\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom put the refilled plate in front of Applejack. The older sister\u2019s eyes widened. Apple Bloom managed to cram much more pasta onto the plate, this time. Her stomach roared at the sight, causing her to bite her lip.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAheh...Uh, Apple Bloom? Ah think this might be a bit much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom just rolled her eyes. \u201cAw, c\u2019mon, AJ. Ah know ya want it all...Or...are ya lyin\u2019 about the taste?\u201d, Apple Bloom gave AJ the puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack gulped and nodded. \u201cY-Yeah, not gonna lie. This pasta\u2019s amazin\u2019. And, Ah\u2019m mighty hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe young mare just went ahead and started devouring the food. She was a big eater, and always would be. But, she promised herself that this plate would be her last. It didn\u2019t take longer than half a minute for Applejack to eat had be more than a pound of pasta. And, this wasn\u2019t counting the first serving! Her belly noticeably filled, but not nearly close to \u2018full\u2019 for the ravenous farm pony. Of course, she didn\u2019t plan on going all out. She\u2019d resist the powerful urge and convince Apple Bloom they could save the rest of the pot of pasta for the rest of the week.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>Bruuurrp!</i></b> Aaah! That\u2019s good eatin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe not only naturally ate like a beast. She was even a trained, competitive eater. Many times, Ponyville had witnessed the awe inspiring, lightning fast gluttony that was the Pinkie Pie versus Applejack matchup, when an eating contest was the challenge. As far as the residents were concerned, there was nopony more voracious than them. Even if a few: like Derpy Hooves, Rainbow Dash, Big Macintosh, and Bulk Biceps; came close. Unfortunately for Applejack, she didn\u2019t have the unreal metabolism that Pinkie Pie had. Her\u2019s wasn\u2019t anything to scoff at. But, Pinkie literally gained almost nothing for as long as she knew her. And, if she did gain any weight, she burned it off quite quickly. Applejack could get back into shape without too much hassle, but she would suddenly blow up in flab if she wasn\u2019t careful. And, converting fat to muscle could become strenuous if she was really bad, beforehoof.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack pushed her chair back and reached her hooves behind her neck to untie her now messy handkerchief, but suddenly wobbled in surprise as her chair skidded back towards the table.<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack looked over to see Apple Bloom pleading with her eyes. \u201cMore, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack put on a stern expression, \u201cNow, Apple Bloom, Ah appreciate this great meal ya made here. But, Ah think Ah\u2019ve had enough. Besides, we could have this amazin\u2019 pasta for the remainder of the week!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cB-But, Ah don\u2019t want ta just have the same dinner Ah made, all week! Ah wanna make new meals everyday! C\u2019mon, AJ. Ah know ya\u2019d <i>love</i> that. Who better to judge mah cuisine than mah own sister! A <i>healthy</i> eater, at that.\u201d, Apple Bloom grinned and winked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack was already a little beside herself. \u201cW-Well, uh...Yeah...Ah don\u2019t think Ah\u2019d mind tryin\u2019 more of your stuff...Ya need a critic, afterall...B-But, sis! Ya can\u2019t expect me ta eat like this every day!\u201d, she pointed at the pot, \u201cThat\u2019s quite a load ya made, there. Though, Ah\u2019ll tell ya that pot ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 for this gut of mine...But\u2026\u201d, she blushed and poked her taut, but otherwise modest middle. \u201cYa...Ya know how Ah am about...well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe little pony rolled her eyes and smiled at her big sister, knowingly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh, AJ. We\u2019ve been through this. No matter what size you are, we\u2019ll always love ya. And, besides,\u201d, she giggled into her hoof, \u201cAh\u2019ve gotten pretty used to the times ya\u2019ve been mah <i>big</i> sister. Hehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack blushed some more. Her cheeks almost resembling the apples that were a part of her namesake.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cB-Bloom, please. <i><b>Grrrrrlll</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHA! Ya see! You know that stomach wants mah pasta. Piles and piles of the delicious, mouth waterin\u2019, tasty, tasty, Apple Bloom approved pasta!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack was nearly shivering in her seat. Her gut growling with greed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom leaned her muzzle next AJ\u2019s ear as another serving seemingly plopped onto the plate from nowhere., \u201cWe don\u2019t want it all to go waste, now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like her decision making in the majority of situations she found herself in, Applejack went with her gut on this one. It could only think about swallowing everything in front of her. Potentially filling the void it lived in. For now, that was all that mattered. Like many times before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ll just work it off, if this meal does any damage. Might as well humor mah sister and mah belly.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack didn\u2019t say another word. She just dove in and demolished the third serving. Hoggish snorts and grunts filled the room as the gluttonous farm pony partook in her greatest vice. She belched and patted her paunch after seconds of consuming the mound of fattening food. Her muzzle and cheeks stained with sauce that she tried to slurp as much of as she could.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cKeep it comin\u2019, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom smiled and flung another hefty pile of her creation onto the plate. Her sister too enraptured by her gluttony to notice the abnormal use of magic. Like a machine, Applejack systematically and efficiently ravaged whatever piled in front of her. Her maw taking massive bites. Her cheeks and throat bulging with each swallow. The servings continued, and so did the inflation of the young mare\u2019s tummy. She would only stop to pass gas and make room for more. The handkerchief around her neck was lifting up and getting dirtier as her middle rose like dough and the delicious sauces splattered all over. The orange dome was getting close to brushing the edge of the dinner table.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom giggle at the slobby display. This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s seen Applejack go hog wild during a meal. But, she found it no less funny and endearing. The older sister had somewhat let herself go, in the past. But, Apple Bloom wondered if she never stopped and got back in shape.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>She\u2019d be a really <b>BIG</b> sister. Real heavy...Real soft. Like a big pillow...Sound kinda nice, actually. Mah big, pillowy sister, Applefat.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom giggle some more. Almost too loudly. Imagining how large her sister <i>should</i> be, with the kind of appetite and will power she had. A roaring belch shook the room as Applejack\u2019s gut pressed against the table. AJ rubbed it and moaned in satisfaction. But, not for long, as Apple Bloom piled another serving. Her eyes glistened with glee as she lifted the plate and practically swallowed everything on it in one bite. She was definitely relishing the opportunity to relinquish her suppressed need to glut.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>She always tries to cut back, and mind her weight all the time. But, doesn\u2019t take much convincin\u2019 to get her ta stuff herself silly. Ah know that, deep down, she\u2019s a big piggy.  Wonder what it would be like if she really were one?...She\u2019s gotta be mah taste tester, after all...</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom smirked mischievously. Like any great prank that her or her peers would come up with, there was no passing up the opportunity to put it in motion. Oh yeah. Apple Bloom had a lot of power, right now. She could make as much food as she wanted with the Big Fat Book O\u2019 Plenty, and the magic it bestowed on her. She would learn how to become a master chef, and feed her big sister the way she was always meant to be. It would be downright satisfying and hilarious to turn her sister into an literal cow pony with her cooking. A testament to her own ability to cook. Not to mention, more thoughts occurred to her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>She would be so much more laid back. All fat, slow, and lazy. Celestia knows she could relax and enjoy herself a little more. It\u2019d certainly make her less of a nag. With mah powers, Ah could do so many chores on mah own! She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a thing! Maybe it\u2019ll convince her that ponies will still respect her at any size. And...well, she\u2019d be mighty cuddly. Ah\u2019d like that.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith a new goal in mind, Apple Bloom continued to serve Applejack the feast. There was no doubt that the amount of carbs would show their effect on her, soon enough. With the speed at which Applejack ate, she lived up to her statement earlier. That enormous pot of food was no match for her greedy belly. It sat completely empty, on the floor. Apple Bloom made sure that not a glop of food was missed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>BUUURRRRRAAAAAAAAAPT!!!</b></i>-<b>Huff</b>-<b>Huff</b>... ~<i>MMMMMM</i>~<i>Slurp</i>...<i>Uuuurrp</i>...S\u2019Good...\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack was actually pushed back in her seat, her hat having fallen over onto the floor, as she leaned her head back and tenderly massaged her pleased keg of a stomach. And, she didn\u2019t manually push the seat back, either. Her stomach did it for her, pressed up against the table. It grew and grew until the the force of the growth pushed her back in the chair. It sat heavily on her lap and gurgled in appreciation. Practically a foot in front of her. Working down the massive offering into inevitable pounds of fat for her various assets.  Her eyes were glazed over in a drunken stupor. A stupid, satisfied grin on her face. She really enjoyed that, for sure. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah\u2019m gonna sleep good, tonight\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRight now, she was far from thinking of the consequences of this binge. Like competitions before, she would digest this meal and likely be fluffier, in the morning. But, she couldn\u2019t care to think of anything else right now. This had to be one of the best meals she\u2019s had in some time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<i>AB\u2019s a fast learner...If Ah didn\u2019t know any better, that cook book gave her a super power or somethin\u2019. That was too damn good for a first try at cookin\u2019...Ah might be lookin\u2019 forward to what she makes me next.</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nAJ felt herself dozing off. Eating that much pasta would knock anypony out for the count. Even a trained vet such as Applejack. Her eyes flickered until they slowly shut. Some snoring signified that she was out for the night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloomed giggled and rubbed Applejack\u2019s belly a little. Her big sister cooed lightly in her sleep, appreciating the touch. Apple Bloom then proceed to clean up the kitchen and Applejack\u2019s face with her magic.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ah guess Ah can move her to her room.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApple Bloom tried levitating her sister out of the chair. Strangely, it took a small amount of extra effort to lift her up with the aura.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe grunted lightly, \u201cHuh. Guess levitating ponies isn\u2019t as easy as makin\u2019 things float. Maybe with practice, it\u2019ll get easier. Could be that Ah used a lot of magic today, too.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter getting AJ out of the chair it was getting a little tiring to walk on her back legs, since she had to have her forelegs out to cast the aura.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c<b>Huff</b>. This\u2019ll be harder than Ah thought.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nApplejack just snored peacefully as Apple Bloom laid her on the couch, in the living room. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to levitate her all the way up the stairs to her room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2019m sure she won\u2019t mind wakin\u2019 up here.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd, with that, Apple Bloom thought about what she could make for breakfast, tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the roosters crowed his routine wake up call to make sure the farmers got up and ready to take on the new day, as early as possible. The sky was still only dimly lit, as late night had shifted to the early morning. The Apple family were always known to be early risers. So, the rooster felt as if it was his job to keep it that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the rooster peaked through a window into the family house, and noticed something amiss. Not only did it seem as though the little yellow Apple pony was not in her room, but the orange Apple pony was laying on the couch! The nerve of her! Ignoring his wake up caw!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe rooster breathed in and crowed again, as loud as he could.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWHUH-HUH?!?\u201d, Applejack jumped from her deep sleep. Her eyes shot open as her hat slumped right over them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Jus\u2019 the rooster. <b><i>YAAAWN!</i></b> <i>Frrrrrrrt</i>...Heh, good thing nopony's in here. Feel like Ah\u2019m gonna have one o\u2019 them lazy, careless days.\u201d, Applejack licked the dryness in her mouth and itched her side with a hoof. Immediately, she prodded a little more as two sinking feelings surfaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sinking feeling in her chest caused her to frown and worry, \"<i>Sweet Celestia...Ah didn't think it would be this bad, so quickly.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, the other sinking feeling was the one on her barrel. Her hoof poked into the new flab that seemed to have developed on her body overnight. She lifted her hat off her face with some hesitation, gulping as her anxiety built up over what she would see on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. A blush grew on her cringing face as she began exploring some unsightly bulges on her sides and middle with both hooves. The massive pasta feast had done some damage. Some inches of chub had developed around her torso. Nothing too substantial. She really didn't seem that different from yesterday. But, a noticeable gain from only one meal for the paranoid mare. She lifted herself into a sitting position and grunted as the pudge bunched up a little on her belly. And, she felt her flanks cushion under her a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This has got ta be a dozen pounds! M-Maybe even worse than that! Ah knew Ah should've stopped mahself last night!!!....That was some pasta, to make me bulk up this much in one night...What in Equestria was in all of that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had some choice words and questions for her little sister, Applejack needed to accept that she had to get a better idea of what the damage was and plan a routine exercise and diet as soon as possible. And, of course, she needed to do her normal morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>Siiigh</i></b>. Better get up to that bathroom...A-And, <b>gulp</b>, take out the scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack hopped off the couch, grimacing as she felt herself jiggle a bit from the impact. Perturbed, but ultimately keeping up the resolve to move on with her day, Applejack trotted up the stairs to freshen up and probably talk to Apple Bloom about this new activity of her\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her morning hygiene routine, Applejack opened the closet and stared at the bane of her existence. <br>\r\n\u201c<i>There ya are. Ya flat, plastic demon.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Applejack was known for her unbridled honesty, she didn\u2019t take kindly to criticism. And, one of the critics she hated most was this cheap, Equestrian scale. It was quite standard for the average pony household, but rather old by their current standards. Mostly made of plastic, with an old dial that only went up to 300 pounds. It was not really a priority for the Apple family to worry about such a thing. And, not even Big Macintosh was <i>that</i> heavy. He was around 240 pounds. Bigger than most stallions. But, not by much for any body builder. No point in worrying about some appliance to tell the weight of a bunch of farm ponies, anyway. That is, until Applejack became so self conscious about her own weight. Applejack had contemplated on getting a new one, just in case. But, ultimately was convinced she would never come to that necessity. That being said, she hated these damn things. For a pony who valued honesty, she certainly had a hard time accepting harsh truths. The scales would not hold back on showing the exact, dreaded numbers of slovenly gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged it out of the closet. The scale of considerable length and width to hold just about any pony size. But, not absolutely any pony weight. It did have a limit. Old plastic top even squeaking a bit, as Applejack begrudgingly stepped on. The dial spun to calibrate itself into measuring the sudden mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>C\u2019mon, ya blasted thing. Get on with it!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack glared at the dial in anticipation. It almost felt to her like it spun for minutes when it only did for less than five seconds. It \u2018finally\u2019 wobbled itself around the 160 mark. She was mortified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeavens ta Betsy...Ah...Ah-I gained 14 frick frackin\u2019 pounds overnight! Ah mean, Ah might\u2019ve grown about as much after a day of stuffin\u2019 mah gob. B-But...Ah didn\u2019t eat that much till last night!!! And, even then Ah\u2019ve had to eat <i>much</i> more to gain <i>this</i> much in so little time!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young, country mare was definitely freaking out. And, for once, the cause for alarm was pretty reasonable. That pasta that Apple Bloom fed her was ridiculously fattening! She wracked her brain to imagine just what kind of calorie count those noodles and sauces had. She even worried for Apple Bloom. She could very well have gained weight herself from eating just a plate of that garbage. Applejack would definitely tell Apple Bloom not to get any more food from wherever she got her ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah gotta help Apple Bloom out, before she turns us into prized hogs. Or...m-maybe Ah should just tell her ta stop...Oooh. Can\u2019t do that, AJ. She\u2019s learnin\u2019 somethin\u2019 practical, here!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she hoped she could better guide Apple Bloom to making more reasonably portioned and healthy meals, at the very least. Before any other thought could cross her mind, a smell reached her nostrils.<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>Sniff!</b></i> Oh mah stars\u2026\u201d, she drooled a bit before a growl shook her. Her belly visibly bubbling with need. She definitely smelled the amazing aroma of some of her favorite breakfast foods. But, even better smelling than ever. It was heavenly. But, despite that, dread began to fill her. \u201cOh no...Apple Bloom probably went overboard, again....And, it\u2019s not like Ah can just avoid breakfast....with the kitchen bein\u2019 the main way ta leave, anyways. Gosh, Ah\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack\u2019s legs began moving on their own, her own persistent hunger driving her down to the kitchen. Her hungry trot took her through that kitchen doorway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack was flabbergasted, once again. Pancakes, waffles, crepes, french toast, and even apple fritters littered the entire kitchen table. A good ten of each, she compulsively counted. They were big in size, too. All topped with copious amounts of various toppings like syrup, whipped cream, fruits, and chocolate sauce. Like a wolf seizing up its prey, Applejack practically stalked around the table. Until a little voice snapped her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll looks good, huh sis?\u201d, Apple Bloom asked coolly with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhuh-uuuh....Y-Yeah. Sure does. B-But...Apple Bloom.\u201d, her tone shifting to its usual sternness, \u201cWe <i>really</i> can\u2019t have a breakfast like this.\u201d She saw that Apple Bloom hadn\u2019t gained a pound. But, she wanted to try to make a point to save her own waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me, Apple Bloom.\u201d, she reared up onto her hind legs, expecting Apple Bloom to see a problem. But, then her stomach vibrated. <i><b>Groooowwl\u2026</b></i> \u201cHeh, heh\u2026\u201d, she blushed as her forelegs quickly clopped back onto the floor in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re standin\u2019 there. Hungry. Ya gotta try this awesome breakfast Ah made!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack nodded forcefully, her ponytail and hat wobbling, \u201cNuh-uh, sis. Ah gained 14 whoppin\u2019 pounds from your \u2018little\u2019 experiment, yesterday. Considerin\u2019 what Ah\u2019m seein\u2019 and smellin\u2019 here, as darn tootin\u2019 delicious as it all probably is too, yer cookin\u2019 way too much fattenin\u2019 junk that Ah\u2019ve gotta refuse. Where are you even gettin\u2019 all these ingredients from? Ah can tell none of this is made from what we got, here.\u201d, she gave her sister a critical eye, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was growing suspicious. Apple Bloom knew when her wise older sister was catching on to something unusual. She debated whether she should reveal the truth. Ultimately, although she knew this could get her into some kind of trouble, she decided to show Applejack the source of her delectable talent. Knowing full well that she couldn\u2019t hide it for long. And, she realized that she wouldn\u2019t have to, anyway. Noticing Applejack\u2019s internal conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh got a new, <i>amazin\u2019</i> book Ah wanna show ya.\u201d, she flashed a toothy grin and turned away to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah\u2019ve got a bad feelin\u2019 about this\u2026</i>\u201d She realized that this all started right after Apple Bloom came back from her \u2018Twilight Time\u2019, and that a book of all things was the cause of it. Problem was, she was a bit distracted from any more critical thinking, at the moment. Applejack\u2019s hunger gnawed at her to eat. All of the glorious food was there. Waiting for the starved glutton within her to just drop the inhibitions and dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, despite really wanting to just get her discipline across and leave, could not bring herself to skip eating at least some of this morning feast. She snapped a slice of french toast right off the table with her teeth. The tantalizing taste drove her to chew and swallow it whole. She licked her lips as her eyes shrunk. She shook as she took in the incredible morsel. Her immense effort to keep up her will power having her slowly eat a slice at a time. She hoped she\u2019d be able to hold out long enough to not eat too much and go out to work it off. She was interrupted by something bumping her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, her muzzle sticky from the cinnamon. She didn\u2019t even realize she ate all the french toast. \u201c\u2018The Big Fat Book O\u2019 Plenty\u2019?\u201d, Applejack read out loud. As strange of a title for a recipe book it was, Applejack jumped back in surprise from something far stranger about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A-Apple B-Bloom!! This here book\u2019s a floatin\u2019!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed. The Big Fat Book O\u2019 Plenty was floating within a pale green aura. Apple Bloom walked towards Applejack with her right foreleg pointing to the book. Her hoof was emanating an aura too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-Whaaaa-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes siree! This book contains an enchantment that lets me use magic to make <i>anything</i> in it. And, Ah mean, Ah can actually summon the stuff in it, too! Ah still gotta cook it all, but boy howdy is it convenient and incredible! Ah can do all this cookin\u2019 and maybe even more! Don\u2019t ya think this is great, AJ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was struggling for words. The combination of intense hunger and insanity of the situation making her practically blow a fuse. She was frozen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAJ? L-Look!\u201d, Apple Bloom placed the book back where she took it out from and used her magic to float a crepe up to Applejack\u2019s face. She waved it around to snap her out of it. It did work, as she sniffed and then tore into the confection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Mph-mmm-GULP!</b> <i>Rrrurrp</i>-Thanks\u2026\u201d, she wildly shook her head, \u201cApple Bloom! This is crazy! We earth ponies are not meant to wield this kinda magic! And, as delicious as the food is, it\u2019s way more fattenin\u2019 than it normally should be!...D-Downright addictin\u2019 too.\u201d, She felt as if she were straining not to rush over and gobble up everything. This food was truly out of this world. All the more reason to try to ignore the cravings and talk Apple Bloom out of this new predicament. \u201c\u2018Sides. If ya want ta be good at cookin\u2019, Ah\u2019d consider this cheatin\u2019. A-And not an honest w-way to improve.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack\u2019s hooves began dragging her to the table. She felt like she was on autopilot. She questioned whether she was really that hungry, or if the magic within the kitchen was causing her to move and eat against her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, buck it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ leaned her upper body onto the table and began ravenously shoveling food into her maw. \u201cMrrooohohoo! Sho gud! MMPH-\u201d, the scarfing continued. All kinds of sticky goop flying all over. Applejack\u2019s table manners were never the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But, sis! You love this! And, even if ya gain weight, what does it matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>SCURF-MMPH-UMPH-ULP!</b></i> <i><b>AAARRRP!</b></i>\u201d Her messy face looked back and glared at Apple Bloom. \u201cIt matters ta me! Ah\u2019m supposed ta be a top athlete! Ah take pride in mah physique! If\u2019n Ah don\u2019t keep that up...I-I will just be flabby pig who couldn\u2019t jump a one inch hurdle\u2026An embarrassment of an Apple farmer...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of guilt. But, at the same time, the mischievous part of her didn\u2019t want to stop this endeavor. There was something thrilling about the prospect. Maybe it was hubris. Maybe it was sibling rivalry. Either way, Apple Bloom wanted to milk this for all it was worth. The magic; the cooking; the fattening of her sister. It was a new realm of power that she didn\u2019t think she would ever enter. However, the virtue within her still challenged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ah-Ah just wanted ta become a chef. And, now Ah feel like turnin\u2019 AJ into mah personally grown, prized pig?! Ah mean...there\u2019s no way Ah\u2019m givin\u2019 this up, so soon. Ah gotta at least keep this book and these powers ta make mah future great! Ah gotta somehow convince AJ ta let me keep it all...Wait a minute! DUH! Ah can just get her to like the food so much, that she won\u2019t want me ta lose this power!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom realized that all she would have to do is keep Applejack satisfied enough to change her mind on the situation. This she could do. And, everything else she wanted could continue to progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Apple Bloom\u2019s brief period of contemplating, Applejack had brushed off all fifty of the sickeningly sweet and fattening breakfast confections that she had prepared. Applejack laid belly up on top of the table. Her paunch risen up like a mini, orange hill. Each breath made it bulge in and out. A harsh, wet belch and blissful moaning signalled the thick mare\u2019s victory over the first meal of the day. Two stained and sticky hooves resting and rubbing softly on the filled underside. Gurgling and bubbling with digestion. AJ was even comfortable enough to shift her lower body and release a hearty fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom covered her nose. \u201cUgh! Really, AJ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what ya get fer-<i><b>HIC-uurrruup</b></i>-enablin\u2019 me like this. Ah hope yer ready ta haul me outta here. Cuz Ah ain\u2019t budgin\u2019 till you feel how heavy this is makin\u2019 me. Then, you\u2019re gonna let me walk right outta here with that book of your\u2019s. So, that Ah can go give it back ta Twilight and then figure out a weight loss plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph! Fine! How do ya think Ah did it, last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom lifted her forehooves up into the air, and her aura pulsed within them. Applejack felt the familiar tingling sensation of being levitated by unicorn magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw sh-<i>uurrr</i>-cks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Applejack didn\u2019t consider Apple Bloom just grabbing her with magic. However, Apple Bloom felt a little more strain than last night when lifting her sister with the magical hooves. She strangely felt a little weaker when trying to move Applejack with the magic. She was confused. She figured that this kind of magic wouldn\u2019t be affected by the weight of the target. But, considering AJ had grown since last night, and was now filled with a few extra pounds of dough and batter, it seemed like what was up. She would have to test this, later. For now though, Apple Bloom was getting anxious. She pulled Applejack over to her until the girthy sibling was casting a shadow over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...Gotta...Move her...somewhere...before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckled snidely, \u201cYa okay down there, sugar cube? Guess yer fancy magic ain\u2019t so great, after all, huh? This is why you don\u2019t want a fat sister, Bloom. All make ya carry me everywhere! Hyuck-huh!...Well...Th-That is until Ah\u2019ve gotta shed pounds...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Did Ah really just entertain the idea of makin\u2019 Apple Bloom carry me whenever Ah want her to?...Ah mean...She does have all this power ta do anythin\u2019 for me...hmmm\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Applejack thought some uncharacteristically devious thoughts, Apple Bloom was visibly straining.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really early in the morning so most ponies were still asleep. Except for the Apple family. They need to be up to collect the apples for the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rooster crowed, Applejack leapt out from her bed.<br>\r\n\"Yee haw! Another good day for the harvest. Nothing beats the dawn of apple bucking,\" Applejack cheered.<br>\r\nApplejack looked at her body and blushed. She saw a soft jiggle as she pressed her hoof in her belly.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! A good exercise of apple picking do the body good!\" Applejack raced down the stairs to start her chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was bucking apples, she noticed that she was running out of breath and energy a lot sooner than the other time she had done it.<br>\r\n\"Ah don't know what is wrong with me. Must be the heat or something,\" Applejack leaned against a tree as she waved her hat to cool herself down.<br>\r\nBig Macintosh noticed his sister looking really tired and decided to talk with her, \"Why don't you bring your cart and set up the stall? I'll finish the job and bring the rest for you.\"<br>\r\nApplejack tried to protest but Big Macintosh cut her off, \"I don't want you to overwork yourself to exhaustion like last time. Just take it easy. Do it for your big brother.\"<br>\r\nApplejack signed and agreed with his idea. Applejack put her cart on her with all the apple products and set off the the market. As she was leaving, Big Macintosh noticed that her sister's bottom jiggle much more than usual. However, he doesn't want to comment anything about it as talking to any female that she gotten 'big' would result in a black eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Applejack setting up her stall, Applejack recounted everything odd that happen today. She gained weight overnight, she out of breath much more easily and despite not eating anything, she was not hungry at all. Applejack was lost in her thought until she was interrupted by somepony.<br>\r\n\"Hi AJ!\" screeched the pink pony.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Pinkie. Ya're here for the apples ya ordered. Just give me a sec,\" Applejack presented her with two baskets of the freshest apples.<br>\r\nPinkie Pie giggled as she retrieved the apples.<br>\r\n\"Ok. What's so funny?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\nPinkie snorted as she answered her question, \"I've never *snort* seen you rump *snort* jiggly so much in my life.\"<br>\r\nApplejack stared at her rump and shook it a bit. She saw a rump jiggle a second after finishing moving. Applejack sweared that she hadn't weight that much last time she checked this morning.<br>\r\n\"Must be thuh chow from last night. Ah should be careful what ah've been eating.\"<br>\r\n\"You should,\" Pinkie Pie adviced Applejack, \"I know I'm not a doctor but judging your weight you just gain today, you could easily double your weight within a month if you kept gaining like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Pinkie!\" Applejack blushed intensely, \"I couldn't really gain that much in one day. Also, Ah'm a farmer and a athlete so Ah know how to stay fit.\"<br>\r\n\"I know that. I wasn't born yesterday. Just be careful what you eat. Not anypony have a stomach like Pinkie Pie,\" Pinkie Pie hopped away with her apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, Applejack had sold everything in her stall. When everypony was out of sight, Applejack sat down and examined her body. Applejack was shock at what she saw. She definitely gotten fatter from this morning even though she didn't eat anything today. Applejack shook her belly with her two hooves and saw it wobble like a bowl of orange jelly.<br>\r\n\"Definitely something not right here,\" Applejack commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack strapped herself to the cart and wheeled it all the way home. She told her family she wasn't hungry and they can have her share of the meal. Applejack pulled out the scale and weigh herself.<br>\r\n\"20 pounds!\" Applejack gasped, \"How the hay did Ah just gain that much in one day without eatin' anything?\"<br>\r\nApplejack shoved the scale away from her, \"Buck this. Ah'm going to sleep and deal with this tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nApplejack crawled herself to the bed. She heard her bed squeak under the new weight.<br>\r\n\"Very funny bed. Ah know you making fun of my new weight!\"<br>\r\nApplejack put herself to sleep in an unhappy mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night, Applejack's constantly changing. Unfortunately Applejack didn't notice anything happening to her. In the morning, she find herself screaming at what she saw.</span></div></div>",

The sun was signing brightly, not a cloud in sight, a cool wind was blowing from the south, and ponies were talking merrily with each other, going calmly about their daily business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting down the cobbled road, humming a pleasant tune to herself, two saddle bags bouncing against her flank, Fluttershy looked at the many stalls selling numerous products. She was searching for the right one, for she was in town today to stock up on certain food for her animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did Fluttershy know what was about to happen to her on this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Twilight Sparkle's castle the lavender pony was looking through some old books of her which she brought with her during her days when she was still studying. Spike entered the room, and seeing Twilight reading, attempting to perform a spell on a plant right in front of her, he grew curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twi, what are you doing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I'm just trying a old spell,\" she answered, not taking her eyes off the book for a single moment, for it required intense concentration, like most spells did, \"You know, just for the nostalgia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike nodded. \"O, and which on are you trying out?\" he asked again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a simple growth spell,\" said Twilight, \"I'm going to use it on this plant here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Spike, \"I'm just going to wash the windows, if you don't mind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" she said, \"Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spike began to wash the windows, Twilight began to focus more energy into the spell, preparing to unleash it. But, for some bizarre reason, she suddenly lost control of it, and with a yelp a bolt of purple magic shot from her horn, which began to bounce off objects in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down!\" Twilight shouted, and she and Spike dove for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued to hop around for a few seconds before it finally flew out a open window, which Spike was cleaning. The two watched the bolt make its way to Poniville. After regaining their wits, Spike was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since I've seen you lose control if a spell like that,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Twilight said, \"It's bizarre. I guess it's because that my Alicorn magic is a bit too strong for average spells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes suddenly grew wide, her expression horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Which also means that bolt is extremely powerful! Anypony that would be hit by it would begin to grow rapidly to a preposterous size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple bolt sailed through the air, bouncing on a few conveniently placed metal and glass objects. Bouncing for the last time of a large mirror two ponies were carrying, the purple bolt headed straight towards Fluttershy, who was making her way back to her cottage after buying the stuff she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow pony gave a yelp as the bolt hit her, her body glowing purple for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her sore flank, Fluttershy said, \"what on earth was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the way home she wondered what harmed her, finally coming to the conclusion that it was probably a bee. She rubbed some ointment on it, placed a bandage on it, and didn't think much of it afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Fluttershy was giving her animals their goodnight-kisses, which she often gave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading off to her bed, she stopped at the doorway, and she said, \"Goodnight, everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals in the room chirped, growled, and exclaimed in their way to say goodnight to their loving caretaker. With a smile, Fluttershy went to bed, knowing nothing what she would uncover the following morning.</span></div></div>",

The creamy yellow pony was awoken by this sweet sound, and she sat up, yawning, rubbing one sleepy eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" she said, smiling warmly at the two animals that woke her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sang some more and fluttered around the room, but then they flew out the window, out into the beautiful new day. Fluttershy continued to smile, watching them leave. Then, she attempted to get up, but felt something squishy rub between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning a little, she threw away the covers and gasp at what she saw. Between her legs were two crotchboobs about the size if an apple, each dotted with a brown, erect nipple. Fluttershy couldn't believe what she saw, and she reached out to touch it to see if it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did, she gasped, plucking her hoof back, for the mounds were incredibly sensitive. She gulped, staring wide-eyed at her swollen assets. The were real alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy didn't know how she ended up with these. All mares had crotchboobs. They were impossible to see though, but the swelled with milk when a pony was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far as the yellow pony knew she wasn't pregnant, so how did her crotchboobs swell so large so fast overnight. And more importantly, how was she going to function normally throughout her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were, as already mentioned, incredibly sensitive, and it would hinder her daily activities. If she went to Poniville, Fluttershy knew her hooters would have everyone staring, and that was the last thing she wanted. Still, she had to get this checked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat aid does she get?</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy gulped and looked back at the mirror, which she was using to study her enlarged assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have sworn that they had gotten even bigger, but at least they were covered by something. Fluttershy never knew that the crotch bra Rarity accidentally sent her last Christmas would come useful on day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strange wearing the red thing, it's straps hugging her plot and thighs, it's cups gently hugging her breasts, keeping them firmly into place.

She squeezed her breasts with her thighs, which was beginning to feel a little tight in her bra for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I buy you dinner?\" he said, \"I know a great restaurant just up the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed, to Fluttershy, friendly, and would have agreed to go with him but was reminded of her predicament when she felt her crotch bra tighten around her tits, indicating that it was growing in size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" Fluttershy said hastily, taking a step back, \"b-but I-I have to g-go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made an attempt to run, but her hoof was suddenly grabbed by him. \"Wait!\" he exclaimed, looking suddenly desperate, \"Perhaps I'm coming in too fast. How about some window shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was growing very agitated, for she could feel her bra growing even tighter, and she was pretty sure she could hear the fabric tearing, unable to support her growing mounds. She really had to get away from the public eye, and quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have to go!\" said Fluttershy urgently, breaking free and running as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard him calling after her, but she didn't stop, concentrating on getting to the nearest hospital, feeling how her heavy, growing mounds trailed behind her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing that prevented her from squealing and dashing out of the room was the thought that the doctor examination her was a mare. Still, it felt very embarrassing sitting there with her legs spread wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, doc,\" said Fluttershy after a several seconds had past, \"d-do you think it could be a allergic reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor suddenly looked up, looking as if her question had surprised her. \"Allergic reaction?\" she said, \"I've seen some bad allergic reactions in my life, from Poison Joke to peanut butter, but this...this can't be an allergic reaction! If it was, it would be a very bad one indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. Fluttershy's boobs were bigger than grapefruits now, which, during its growth on her way to the hospital, had wrecked her crotch bra. If it was an allergic reaction, it would be a terrible one for it so swell her tits to such a ludicrous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, do you think it is?\" Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one why to find out,\" said the doctor, narrowing her eyes. \"May I?\" she asked, indicating what she wanted to do with her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy swallowed. \"G-go ahead,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare squeezed her left boobs, and Fluttershy had to struggle with all her might not to moan. Her assets felt extremely sensitive, and the way the doctor squeezed it was sending jolts of pleasure through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin line of milk squirted out of her nibble, and the doctor took a step back, looking relieved but still worried. \"No, it's not an allergic reaction,\" she said, \"or else something entirely different would have come out, not milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it's not a reaction, then what is it?\" asked Fluttershy, growing even more worried, \"Could I be p-p-pregnant or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only conclusion that she could come up with, even though it was ridiculous. She didn't have any partners, or any slip ups in her life. So far as Fluttershy's memory goes, she was still a virgin. But there could still be a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" said the doctor, \"It can't be that. Not even a pregnancy could have this effect on a mare's mammeries. Yours are far too big! No, something else is going on here. I suspect that you might have eaten or drank something that caused this or it could have been-\" she looked at Fluttershy suspiciously \"-a spell gone wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would never put a spell on me,\" said Fluttershy, trying to suppress her sudden outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing that she would never do, it was draw unneeded attention to herself. The doctor's sly accusation made Fluttershy rather angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, well then,\" said the doctor with a shrug. \"If it's not magic then I don't know. I could prescribe you a few things that could stop swelling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" said Fluttershy, jumping off the table, wincing as she felt her breasts jiggle, \"I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to leave, but suddenly remembered that her crotchboobs was still exposed for the world to see, and she couldn't go out in public like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...you don't happen to have anything that I can use to cover...these, do you?\" she asked, turning to the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do, but it's not clothes, though,\" said the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached in a drawer and pulled out some bandages. Later, Fluttershy was leaving the clinic, some bandages tied around her breasts. It was skimpy and it made her look stupid, she knew, but it was the only thing she had to conceal herself, provided that her boobs didn't grow again.</span></div></div>",

She exercise quite a lot to keep her weight down but she still gained some weight. She wasn't complaining as some ponies are in a worse situation than she is. She limited herself from asking Spike for anything trivial so she could stay on her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie, she is an abnormally. She haven't gained a single pound, even when she consumed tons of sweets. Scientist have looked into her genetics and immune system but they couldn't find anything unusual compare to other ponies. Scientist declared her clean and let her continue with her life. This cause many other creatures to be jealous about her weight. Twilight just assumed it is just her really high energy that it make impossible for her to gain any weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, ranked C. Rainbow Dash was the only female Wonderbolt left. The others become too fat to stay on the team. Most of the seniors become teachers or instructors for the future Wonderbolts. Rainbow was really strict with her diet even cutting down the consumption of Apple Cider. It was torturous for her as she see her fellow male Wonderbolts were eating sweets without a care in the world. Rainbow Dash was often seen a bad mood during meal break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, ranked A. Initially she was devastated. Most of her clothes she designed would not fit for most ponies anymore including herself. She went depressive and binge on ice cream. With some time, she got inspiration. She created clothing lines and accessories for larger mares. Just because they got bigger, doesn't mean they don't deserve got clothing. She made a fashion trend for clothing for larger models. Despite she become so fat that she cannot fit through a normal door, she still strive to do the best with what she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy, ranked S. Fluttershy become unable to support her friends. So she become a manager to the nature preserve and hired creatures to care for the wildlife. Fluttershy delegates rules and orders for her employees to listen. Her animals are supportive and caring for Fluttershy's new predicament. Fluttershy ensure them that she was okay and does not want to bother them. The animals ignore her request and help her with her house chores from cleaning the dishes to bringing food from the food drive for ponies heavily infected from the virus. The animals obviously can see that Fluttershy is having trouble just getting out of bed and walked down her hallway. Fluttershy was pleased to see that her animals are taken care of her like she have taken care of them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, ranked SSS+. Not even one day have passed since the virus started that she become immobile. Once a proud athlete become a blob. The first week, she outgrew her barn. Next she had to be moved away from her farm as she could actually crush it. Now she is literally a mountain next to other blobby mountains. That area is nicknamed the SSS+ blobs. Discord created magical feedbags for the victims so they wouldn't starve. Their hunger could create earthquakes and tsunami if not careful. It is a boring life for them as all they could do is eat and sleep. Twilight promised her they would find a way to save everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight wondered what is next for the research community.</span></div></div>",

If not, she would collapse from the sheer heat her body produced, even though today wasn't very hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was due to her hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated it. She hated her lover, Discord, for doing this to her. She hated these stupid sponge baths. Most of all, she hated this stupid preg-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia faltered in her step. She nearly said it. She nearly said that she hated her unborn child(ren). She felt ashamed that she dared think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't their fault. It was all because of her and Discord. Her mood swung again, going from grumpy to sad. She could feel tears spill over and run down her cheek as she climbed into the cool waters, and one of her servant mares realised this and grew concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, my princess?\" she asked as she scrubbed her flanks tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed bigger than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia wiped her tears away, feeling ashamed that she allowed herself to cry in front of her subjects. She was supposed to show that she was the strong one. Darn these hormones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-its nothing,\" she said, managing a smile, \"I'm feeling just a bit emotional, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant mare did not press any further. By now, everyone was used to Princess Celestia's bizarre behavior. She was beginning to feel much better now, almost herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed herself to enjoy the feeling of being washed by the four mares around her. She loved the way their hooves rubbed in the soap into her hair, the brushes stroking her fur straight and glossy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe especially loved it when they moved over her belly....her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia gazed at her belly. Boy, was that thing swollen!  She wasn't sure how much young she carried, but seeing that it was almost as big as a beach ball, jutting out noticeably from the side, she roughly estimated four babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never imagined that she could be so fertile, or perhaps it was due to being an alicorn. Whatever the reason, Princess Celestia loved each of them, and would raise them the best she could no matter how the looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind began to wonder, thinking about the many names she could give them when she suddenly felt one of her mares stroke a sponge across a very....sensitive area, snapping her out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia bucked her hips and whinnied from the sudden jolt of pleasure. She spun around and saw one of her younger servants blushing, looking very embarrassed indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" she quickly apologized, \"I did not mean to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" said Princess Celestia, \"Just be extra careful around there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, feeling flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neither regions was the the opposite of her belly: she really did not liked to be touched there. Not because it made her feel uncomfortable, but because it felt so darn good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything felt incredibly sensitive there, from her grapefruit sized udders to her plump pussy. She really did not want to get aroused right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare handles with great care this time, but Princess Celestia still had to bite her lower lip to prevent herself from moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sponges bath came to an end and her mares help dry her off. She felt really great now, almost like skipping as she made her way outside her bathing chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of her servants waited for her. \"Its time for you afternoon nap,\" a guard stallion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia felt her mood go sour again. She didn't want to go to bed. She felt so great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she kept herself collected and said, \"Why, thank you for reminding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was gloomy, the curtains drawn. She climbed on her sun-shaped bed and curled into her blanket as her servants closed her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to drift off when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late in the afternoon. Standing at the Ponyville train station, Twilight Sparkle was jumping with excitement. She watched with a wide grin how the well-known, colorful train came riding along the track. It let loose a whistle and came to a screeching halt next to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caravan's door opened and ponies exited, walking in a single line. Twilight kept her eyes peeled. When the line continued and there was no sign of her, Twilight began to worry. Maybe she missed the train, maybe she was delayed, maybe she didn't come at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink alicorn finally stepped out of the caravan, and Twilight's worry washed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice her, so Twilight waved her hoof, shouted: \"Cadance, over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance turned her head and spotted Twilight. They both beamed at each other. They both rush to each other, and the two sister-in-laws hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you could make it,\" Twilight said when they pulled apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would have made it,\" Cadance said, \"I wouldn't miss out an opportunity to spend a whole week with my favorite sister-in-law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave a smug grin. \"I'm your only sister-in-law,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the better,\" Cadance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe began to leave the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think Shining Armor could handle Flurry Heart on his own?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Cadance, though there was some doubt in her voice. \"But if there's trouble he could always ask for help. There are plenty of ponies up to the task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope things don't run out of hoof and you have to go home early,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" Cadance said, \"I also hope that Discord doesn't come and bother us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Twilight reassured her, \"I'm sure he learned his lesson from last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back to Twilight's castle, the purple alicorn noticed something around Cadance's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadance, where did you get that?\" she asked, pointing a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance stopped and looked at her neck. \"O, this?\" she said, lifting the necklace with the dark green ruby, \"It's a gift. I got it from a anonymous sender back home. A appreciation gift, I believe. I wore it today for this occasion. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight studied it for a few moments. It was pretty, but there was something wrong about it. She just couldn't put her hoof on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gorgeous,\" Twilight finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Cadance, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they made it to the castle, and Twilight said: \"Spike's gone to Canterlot to perform some work for me. He will be gone for a while, so the whole castle's all for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planned this out well, didn't you?\" said Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"Indeed,\" she said, \"I didn't want anypony ruining our time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked a while longer, deciding what they were going to do tomorrow, knowing little what crazy week they were going to have.</span></div></div>",

His horn flickered almost subconsciously as a small light blue shield formed out of magic to deflect the incoming wad of mashed carrots. Today was not a pleasant day for a number of reasons.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First off Flurry Heart was throwing a tantrum.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now if anypony were to ask Shining Armor on any other day if he enjoyed having a kid, Shining would have said he might possibly have preferred waiting a couple more years but Flurry heart was one of his many blessings and he loved her dearly. He'd spend hours playing with her (sometimes ducking out of his duties) and relished every time he got to read to her, go on walks with her, or just have fun with the little bundle of fluff.She was a true joy that made his heart soar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This morning however, with Flurry throwing a tantrum over the food she was being fed by Cadance he found himself wondering if Sunburst would be willing to foal-sit for a time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reason for Shining's other big annoyance that had him wondering if he could slip away started just the other day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What!? Cadance you can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am serious dear,\" Cadance replied firmly, trying to keep her tone sweet, \"And it doesn't mean I love you any less. Were it up to me alone I wouldn't mind, but this is a serious issue. What will other ponies think? Or the guards? Do you really want them all snickering behind you when you walk by?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining winced, \"But isn't there some other way? We have a library full of ancient spells...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shining,\" Cadance chided him, \"Magic is not always the answer. Haven't you learned that already from your sister?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But there <i>has</i> to be some other way, please?\" Shining was practically down on his knees, hands clasped in a pleading gesture as tears welled in his eyes and slid down his muzzle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry love, but starting tomorrow you are going on a <i>diet</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Diet</i>... <i>Diet</i>...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That word hung in his mind like a looming vulture snatching up all his favorite meals before he could ever eat them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cadance wasn't cruel though and understood depriving Shining completely wouldn't be as effective. She'd merely scaled back his portions of the bad stuff. A quarter of a doughnut with breakfast instead of the two or three he often had. A couple slices of black olive pizza. Half a cup of low-fat ice cream for dessert...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was almost worse than having none at all. Shining got a taste and his tongue begged for more, but all he had was the bland 'health-food' Cadance had the staff put under his nose. They'd even been ordered by her to disregard all of his orders regarding food. She even got the guards in on it to make sure he didn't sneak anything despite him being their commanding officer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And why? Because the last time he stood on a scale it read ten pounds overweight. Alright, technically it was fifty. Shining had been adjusting the scales sensitivity so Cadance wouldn't notice. Unfortunately she'd realized when he tried to fit into his old uniform and the buckle refused to come close over a doughy middle that hadn't been there before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So what if he was a little plump. It wasn't worth making such a big fuss over it. It had only been 24 hours and already he couldn't take it. He had to find an answer, and pronto.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were options of course. He could be crafty and try to sneak food, perhaps while out on a 'diplomatic mission' as Cadance had the kitchens well guarded. Twilight might side with Cadance though if she found out. Celestia might be more forgiving with her love of cakes, but he wasn't certain of that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then again he reasoned he could always be more creative. He was no great spell-caster like Twilight, but Shining had some skills. And they did have a library full of ancient magical books. Maybe one of them could provide an answer.</span></div></div>",

Your future is something only <b>you</b> can decide on, as long as you have the drive to follow it and make it yours.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No matter what you find your true calling in, Flurry, your Mom and I promise that we'll always be behind you, cheering you on, and willing to help you get up if the hike gets a little rough.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Really? Well, I hear Santa Hoove's got plenty in his warehouse that he's willing to give to a few good fillies this year!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll words that were spoken with sincerity and meaning when they were uttered from Shining Armor's mouth, now but one of some newly damned life choices he grumbled over as he sat on the toilet and tugged with all his might to fit a brand new belt around his corpulent middle, the ends  digging deep into its extra padding. The toilet groaned beneath the excessive weight as Shining rocked back and forth to get comfortable, his tush having ballooned over twice as wide as what the seat was normally used to, squeezed in by both walls of the newly cramped stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the <i>most</i> damned life choice of all being Flurry Heart getting a FillyBake oven for last year's Hearth's Warming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter keeping his breath held for thirty seconds on a particularly brutal attempt, Shining let go and panted heavily as his stomach sprung back out on top of the opened fly of his pants, his mane and coat damp with sweat. He could only vaguely remember the times where he felt <i>proud </i>to burst out of his old clothes, particularly when flexing his biceps or putting shirts on two narrow for his muscular shoulders, but nowadays it felt that <i>every</i> shirt's sleeves were too tight whenever he tried to pull them over his meaty arms, limbs now thickened by plump sleeves of blubber that barely held any muscle or build. Even harder shirts to find were ones baggy enough to entirely fit down his obese belly, his fondly remembered six-pack having long ballooned into what resembled a white yoga ball jutting out of his abdomen, complete with a rather feminine pair of mounds sitting on top that obscured his chiseled pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaaddyyyyy!\" Came the voice of his very doom from outside of the bathroom. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining stiffened up, eyes twitching as he stared at the unlocked doorknob, debating whether or not to press the button. True, it may have been the unbeknownst murderer of his athletic build calling for him, no doubt with another tray of cookies for him to eat, but first and foremost, it was his <i>daughter</i>. The same one that he vowed to support the very moment he rocked her to sleep for the first time, the one still at an age where all she wanted was a little attention and appreciation from her daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulling over that sentiment, and the potential scolding Cadence would give him if he stayed in hiding, Shining sighed heavily and strained as his beefy legs lifted his weight up off the bowl, but cringed as he felt the very hairs on his mane brush the ceiling. Yet another side effect to constantly eating his daughter's magically produced food was growing both out and <i>up</i>, pushing him to just a few hairs under seven feet, much like Cadance's old height when they were wed, but it wasn't the kind of height that gave him an air of authority. It was the kind that made him into a lighthouse for attention amongst castle staff and subjects,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his pride, Shining forced a smile and telekinetically opened the door, his daughter standing outside with a toothy smile and a chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay! There you are!\" She cheered, holding the cake out. \"I made you a cake, daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thanks, sweetie...\" Shining exhaled, side-stepping to fit through the door, but still felt the door squeeze at the front of his belly. The bedroom's furniture rattling as he trudged through and sat on the bed, Flurry Heart obediently climbing on and sitting next to him. Maybe it was just the extra height, but Shining couldn't remember a time where the little filly didn't seem so <i>tiny</i> in his eyes, making it all the more difficult to refuse her cooking. \"It's always nice to see you still enjoy your oven...<i>again</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, eat it up!\" She insisted, taking out a fork and gently poking it into a slice. \"Up, up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, I'd <i>love</i> to...\" He lied through his teeth, his smile twitching slightly. \"I just...I'm actually <i>really</i> full from that wonderful breakfast you made for me and mommy...and <i>lunch</i>...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please</i>, daddy?\" Flurry begged, holding the cake closer to his mouth. \"Please, please, <i>pleeeeeeeease?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining angled his head away, eyes jittering like she was offering him a bowl of spiders. \"Flurry, maybe<i> mommy </i>would enjoy your cake a little bit more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...\" Flurry whimpered, face instantly whipping from delight to big, shimmering eyes and a quiver of her lip. \"I worked <i>so hard! </i><b><i>Pleeeeeeeease?!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Wrenching his eyes shut, Shining didn't even bother with the fork right in, his tongue so used to the rich flavor that it was nauseating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!!! Thank you, daddy!\"\" Flurry beamed, nuzzling against Shining's elbow, keeping hm out of view long enough to let his face fall in a solemn frown...</span></div></div>",

Her crotchboobs were enlarged, nearly as large as grapefruits, leaking a stream of milk from her lavender colored nipples. The lips of her vagina was nearly as thick as a thumb, leaking cum from her arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plot had thickened too, like she gained 50 pounds and most of it decided to rest on her hips. Cadance groaned, rubbing her bloated stomach. She was lost in her own world, not even caring that somepony was watching this bizarre sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to her brother in his room, Twilight Sparkle was shocked, staring with wide eyes at her inflated sister-in-law. She was rendered speechless and motionless, so Shining Armor had to carry her out into the hallway with his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hoof in front of her face a few times, saying, \"yoo-hoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did Twilight come to her senses. \"How!? Just how!?\" Twilight said, clutching her head, trying to rationalize what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know,\" Shining Armor said, looking into the gloomy room where the round silhouette of his wife lay on the bed, \"She's been like this for the past three days. We can only speculate that this is the work of dark magic. That's why we brought you up here, so that you can perhaps try and fix this. I don't know how long this could be kept a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll try,\" Twilight said before blushing a little and staring into the room, \"But what is she filled with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a suspicion that it was anything but foals, judging by how small lumps formed on the surface of Cadance's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor shrugged and said, \"We believe with eggs. We can't be sure, for there appears to be a magical barrier placed around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there came a loud moan from Cadance. Her belly gurgled loudly and it expanded in size. A spray of cum came from her vagina, and her crotchboobs swelled even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Twilight asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no!\" Shining Armor cried, \"Her growth spurts are happening faster now. Twilight, you really need to do something, quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was evident that he was beyond worried about his wife's condition, and it was making Twilight nervous as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" she said, \"I'm sure that I can find something that could fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what? Spell books were always a handy source to fix problems, or she could search her memory of the hundreds of spells she had to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do?</span></div></div>",

Everypony but Shining, of course, who would always lean back to escape from everypony's line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, coach!\" Came a voice that was always light and cheerful with a weight that would've normally left him wheezing on top his lungs. The coach cringed as Double Diamond bit down the last of his bean burrito, its wrapper getting pushed into a trash can whose mouth was stuffed with several others; as friendly a student he may have been, the Coach could still feel all the pained spots in his scalp from tearing his mane out over Double Diamond bringing food into class, at how many detentions, suspensions, and parent teacher conferences he'd threatened to arrange before just giving up. With an appetite as big as Diamond's was, to get him to stop eating something was chiseling Canterlot off of its mountain with a toenail clipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Double got up from his personal bench, an incredibly wide sheet of super-reinforced metal that was still warped into the shape of his massive tush, Shining always expected the floor to cave in right underneath and send him falling into the locker rooms, despite that the second floor's ground was solid concrete supported by metal beams. Having known him since kindergarten, Shining, as well as everypony else who knew him, always saw Double as the fat kid in school, going quite often with a candy bar or bag of chips in his hands to snack on, but it wasn't until his later years that it was clear that he had a <i>lot</i> more than just a sugar tooth. Whenever his hands were free, whether he be talking with friends or in the midst of class, no matter how impossible it would seem to smuggle food on his person, Diamond would eat. And grow. He ate, and grew, and ate, and grew, and <i>ate</i>, and <b><i><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">grew.</font></i></b> His parents would watch in utter panic as their son inflated into a sapient parade balloon before their very eyes, always at ends to find clothes that would actually fit him, but it was when he broke six feet in height and destroyed their scale at 550 pounds that they all had a firm grasp of what the rest of their lives would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he'd entered his freshman year, he was a foot taller than his father, a former star of the school's hoofball team. A title that Diamond easily blew away by the size he became at his senior year. It took a long time for the sight to become a common occurrence around the school, but Double possessed a stomach so overblown in size that it was comparable to a snowball that was allowed to roll down a ski slope until it was almost nine feet in diameter, being so heavy that it stood on the floor even when he was standing nice and tall. So much of its white fur was always exposed no matter how large a shirt or sweater he'd find to wear, always riding up will it was inches from being sucked underneath his large moobs. There were always the usual taunts and teases from the other students (whenever they weren't staring at him in utter awe, of course) but a surprising amount of the student body always found his massive, jolly presence something that lightened up the mood around class, a few of the school's athletes even putting on a few pounds to join in. It was actually hard pressed for him to lose sight of many of the females in school, too, all of them in love with how pinchable his cheeks were, and just how soft it might feel to cuddle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to name some of the many things that made him and Cadance, one of the most popular girls in school, catch sight of one another, something that made Shining clench his fingers around the bench in rage. It only felt worse when he tilted his head down in shame, catching sight of his own body; graduation sat only two months away, and he barely looked like he'd aged past twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale was shiny and new, and clearly bought to accommodate for somebody of Double's size in mind, but his stomach covered the entire surface before his feet were even on top, forcing him to squeeze his hooves onto the very lip to fit in, the readout's pole bending under the front of his gut pressing against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9'10\", 17,963 pounds.\" The Coach deadpanned. \"That's a fifty pound increase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...sorry for cutting back, coach.\" Diamond joked, a smile on his face that was impervious to any and all comments about his weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Coach grunted, nodding as he scribbled into his clipboard. \"Up next, Shining Armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it was when <i>those</i> four were words were uttered that every pony would go right back to what they were doing, the scale's metal groaning as Double stepped off. Not a single eye turned towards Shining as he made his way over, but he could still feel dozens of eyes of shame glaring down on his back as he set foot on the scale, eyes shut in defeat as the coach observed the reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5'2, 149 pounds.\" He announced. \"That's a one pound decrease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining didn't bother adding a comment and got off, shutting out the next student's name as he went back and sat down on his bench. Once he'd plopped down, chin propped on top of a fist, he was shaken up by a hand as wide as a dinner plate patting his back, but didn't bother to look up at the source of the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear that, Shining.\" Double told him. \"Maybe you wanna come to my place tonight, to have a little pizza with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Shining muttered. He wanted <i>so badly</i> to respond with some kind of amazing comeback for so long, but what made those words so much more enraging to hear was how genuinely supportive Double sounded, which even Shining couldn't bear to act too mean towards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble seemed to get the hint, and didn't say anything more to him as the rest of the students all had their measurements taken. He got himself busy with another three burritos to pass the time, but Shining just sat and let his mind do all the alienation for him. He couldn't let his college years begin like this. No...he just couldn't. He had to do something, and<i> fast.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rung for class, and all the students began heading for the locker rooms, Shining thought of everything he could do, all the places he could go, no matter how shady they could seem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Shining decides to try and find some kind of magical shortcut to bigness at the library!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Shining goes to a bodybuilding store to find some kind of gaining formula...but finds something even better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Shining tries to sabatoge Double Diamond!</span></div></div>",

He stopped speaking mid-sentence and slid the book off his desk, sending it falling onto a pile of several others that lay half-open to various other chapters seen as failed attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was his little sister, Twilight, who seemed to have the growing prowess as the best spellcaster in the family, Shining still liked to consider that he knew his way around one or two spells. Most of his magical studies went into things such as combat or defense spells, all important things to know of when trying to enroll for the royal guard, but he could still get the hang of something more offbeat if he set his mind hard and studied enough, quick enough to be called an average learner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeauty spells, however? They were a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something that almost made him want to laugh, if it weren't for how frustrated he was at all the complex factors that went into things that seemed as self explanatory as a magical tummy tuck, even worse when he was hunting down for something that was the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight sliders...\" He read aloud from the page of a new book. \"Utilizing this spall shall supply the caster with whatever measurement along their waist or chest in whatever amount they desire. As long as such numbers are smaller tha- oh, <i>come on!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining was even quicker to toss that book aside, now feeling just as<i> betrayed</i> as he did tired and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Shining hissed, picking up the last fruit of his efforts at the library, the very last window of hope he could cling onto that the night wasn't all a total waste of his time. Taking a deep breath, he shut his eyes, letting them freshen up before cracking the book open, and stared down with his full, unaided attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...at a bunch of crude symbols arranged in some bizarre cipher, not a single one bearing any resemblance to the Equestrian language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn vain, he flipped a few more pages. The complex language reaching end-to-end along the book, and he gave a defeated groan, dropping his head down in his palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the reward I get for <i>trying</i> to learn...\" He quipped dryly, pushing the book aside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it was when the book was right about to fall over the desk's side that he saw a page open askew, giving a flash of an image that, as brief as it may have been, seemed to fish for his attention. He caught the book before it could hit the ground, and he began flipping through again, searching the vague images scrawled within for what he hoped was the very one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right in the book's center, right where the seam between the pages and the cover lay, that he froze, his breath getting trapped in his lungs. The language was still indecipherable, but they surrounded a squared-in drawing of two figures, one an outline that vaguely resembled a skinner pony next to an arrow that pointed to one that was noticeably chubbier, the latter with tinnier arrows pointing outwards around its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining stared at the page, mouth hanging open until he felt his lips go dry. Licking them, he studied the page for any remote means of identifying the instructions, whatever ones there even might have been, but all the text remained stagnant in his eyes, unchanging. It was when he looked closely at the image, at an inscription drawn underneath in a lighter shade than the rest of the text, that he could even recognize a clue to what the spell's working was; the magical signature. Not a complete summation of what the spell did, but an algorithm representing the mental cues that went into casting. As of now, nothing more than a blind set of directions into some random location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the rare moments he actually took Twilight's ravings during dinner to heart, and he glazed over the spell's anatomy till he though the could try it to heart. Taking the book in his hand, he stood up and trotted over to the mirror along his closet door, gazing upon his reflection with as much confidence as he could try and give off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well...here goes </i>something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining deeply inhaled through his nostrils, and his face wrenching up as he clenched all the muscles in his forehead at once, squeezing out a spark of magic that traveled down his horn in a purple glow. He concentrated the flow of power into a nice, blank stream, and he tugged at it with his thoughts, prying it into the same pattern of symbols from the inscription. Obscure as it may have been, the sequence seemed easy enough that he felt he could finalize it in little time, and once he was satisfied, centered his thought on the tip of his horn, the energy gathering into a bright orb of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>And...Now!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a secondary surge of energy, he pushed against the magic packed into the orb, and it shot free of his horn. Shining stood with his eyes shut, expecting some kind of explosive sound or rush of feeling to over take him, but his head remained tilted down as he listened into the silence of the room. Not feeling any different, he cracked one of his eye lids open, then the other, immediately noticing that his body wasn't changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his eyes were drawn up to a green light shining on the floor. His gaze was drawn upwards, and he shrunk away at a churning blob of energy that hovered just a few feet away from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what the he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob seemed to see a chance when Shining's lip parted, and it shot straight into his mouth, worming its way right past his tongue and against the back of his throat. Shining jumped back into his bed, too shocked to even swallow; he could feel the magic do all of that itself, feeling it force itself down his throat and into his stomach like a fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, startled, and flustered, Shining sat on the edge of the bed for a stretched amount of time. He didn't feel any change taking effect, and he held a hand to his abdomen, questioning what he'd done to himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and he felt his palm connect with his stomach than it should've. It felt tight, too, despite him having not eaten or drinking anything since a few hours ago. Gazing downwards, he he blinked at what he saw, realizing how truthful the picture was. It wasn't anything gratuitous, but his stomach did seem a little bigger than before, enough that there was a distinct roundness hiding under his shirt that conformed around his naval, but it only felt as though he'd chugged a liter of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Shining observed. \"It's...progress, I guess.\"</span></div></div>",

He tried to relax and work on his non-existant tan but the fact of the matter was he was desperate for something different.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His first inclination was to go to Ponyville and stir up a little fun, however that was not possible. As per the binding contract he had to sign with Celestia upon his reformation, he was allowed an allotted amount of 'messing with ponies' per month. It had stipulations that he was to cause no harm, mental alterations or permanent scarring of any form. Otherwise he was allowed to have fun in moderate form as long as he put things back to normal afterwords.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately he'd already used up his amount this month and anything more would have Celestia restrict him harder next month.

And as that thought squiggled through his mind he realized that, for a being of chaos, he was remarkably predictable in his features. Sure he changed height on occasion, turned into a snake, or made himself all blue on a few occasions, but he was always the same mismatched form of body parts. The same noodle-length body, and the same semi-phenomenal nearly-cosmic being he'd always been.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps a physical change was what he needed to spice up his life. Something new and different. But what to choose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Gender swap.

And what better time to start than now. A pan of cupcakes appeared in Discord's paw, and he began to munch on them, walking to the edge of his cloud. It was high up and provided the perfect few of Ponyville for the draconequus. As he stood there, switching between a bag of chips and slurping up a chocolate milkshake, his belly already beginning to curve from all the calorie-enriched food he was effortlessly spawning, Discord decided which place he would visit first where his fun would take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were quite a few friends he could annoy.

Her logic and scientific reasoning was the perfect counterpoint to his unpredictability. With one more bit of a delicious cupcake Discord snapped his fingers and his whole setup vanished from the skies over Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight wasn't having a good morning. It wasn't a bad morning per-sway, but it was just one of those mornings when everything felt like it took five times more effort than usual to accomplish. She'd rolled out of bed with thump, dragged herself to the dresser, grabbed her come and proceeded to brush her messy mane five times before the handle broke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grumbling about replacing it, Twilight proceed down the hall, past Spikes room where he was still snoring, down the staircase and across the large dining hall before finally arriving at the kitchen. She could have teleported perhaps but the last time she tried it while feeling so out of it she'd had to apologize to Berry Punch after landing on her Dining Room table during breakfast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yawning Twilight looked around the admittedly huge kitchen and tried to decide what to have.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pancakes sounded good.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went to the cupboard and pulled out the mix. It took reading the instructions three times before the words sunk in. Bowls and measuring cups and spoons were gathered, the stove top and pan was heating. Cooing oil sat beside it. She needed eggs and milk.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight walked to the fridge opened it, Nodded to Discord, grabbed the eggs and milk. Turned around and... Wait, what?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know it's rude to close the door on someone who's just saying hello,\" Discord huffed appearing next to Twilight with a pop.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked, there was a second or two of silence before her mind kicked into gear. \"Oh! Sorry Discord,\" she apologized, \"Just... felt a bit fuzzy this morning.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well newsflash Twilight,\" Discord chuckled ruffling her mane a little with his clawed hand, \"You're always a bit fuzzy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing Twilight huffed again and plod over to her preparations Discord backed off a little but didn't completely let up. \"What's got you so run down? Been up late burning the midnight oil?\" As if to emphasize this Discord pulled from behind his back a flaming drum of motor oil.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight however remained un-phased as she set to work, \"No, if you must know I was up late trying to decide on a new topic of research. I submitted my thesis on the Elements of Harmony last week and got the news yesterday it will be added to the Encyclopedia Equestria as of next printing. So now I want to find a new field of research.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Discord gave an exaggerated yawn, \"You are unbelievable Twilight. You are the only pony I've ever seen, save Star Swirl himself, who's been desperate to never stop learning. Even Celestia and Luna learned to take a break from such things after a century or two.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well unlike a certain braggart spirit,\" Twilight replied, \"I don't pretend to know everything already.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey I know I don't know about everything,\" Discord replied with a snort, \"I had to learn about Friendship, remember? If I knew about it already it wouldn't have been such an important lesson.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" Twilight acknowledged as she prepared to mix the ingredients, \"But you still <i>act</i> like you know everything.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's because I can DO anything,\" Discord replied with a smirk, \"And even if I don't know everything, because I can do <i>anything</i> means eventually I'll learn everything I don't already know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think that's debatable,\" Twilight replied, \"Besides, no creature can do 'everything'. Even in magic there are certain fundamental laws..\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Twilight Twilight Twilight,\" Discord smirked as if lecturing a small filly, \"Surely you as a student know that's not an absolute. Even in nature, for every 'law' that exists there's an exception. For example 'Mammals don't lay eggs' ...Except for the Platypus and Echidna. 'Mammals maintain body heat all the time' ...Except for the Naked Mole Rats.\" He poofed a animal into each hand as he spoke and dismissed them just as quickly. \"You can thank Fluttershy for teaching me those.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you're saying that even magic has exceptions to these laws?\" Twilight asked, her minf waking up and now faintly more interested in the discussion over breakfast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Discord replied, \"And I'm sure as a student of magic you know one of the biggest ones of both nature and magic. That being 'Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed...' \"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...they only change forms.' \" Twilight finished from memory, \"So what's your point?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watch,\" Discord smiled and snapped his fingers, a moment later a stack of pancakes complete with butter and syrup appeared.<br>\r\n\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So?\" the lavender alicorn asked not quite understanding what Discord was getting at.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go ahead and scan it with your magic Twilight,\" Discord smiled, \"You'll find this was not a teleport, this was not me instantly making pancakes from ingredients. This was genuine matter creation.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight had her doubts but scanned the pancakes as instructed and found Discord was shockingly right. She tried two or three different sorts of scans but it was all true. Even down to the atoms these pancakes were only just now created. No lingering spacial distortion of magic for a teleport, no friction from a rapid baking process. All indication showed the pancakes were new matter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of them were promptly speared by Discords fork and stuffed in his mouth, making his neck bunch and expand like an accordion briefly as he swallowed them down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight was speechless for a moment but she found her voice as Discord swallowed the delicious meal, \"Chaos magic.. can it actually be studied?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pardon?\" Discord asked, wiping his mouth with a napkin before eating it too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You cay chaos magic can basically do anything, that it's as wild and unpredictable as you are, but I don't believe that's entirely true,\" Twilight began pacing a bit as she thought, \"You snap your fingers and what you want to happen happens. Ergo there must be a way to control this powerful magic. And if it can be controlled then it can be studied. Maybe even taught.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa now Twilight,\" Discord looked a little uneasy, \"Are you sure you want to get into this? Chaos magic is not some new toy. It can be dangerous if you're not careful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Discord, I've decided, I want my new field of study to be Chaos Magic. Will you assist me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The chaos spirit mused at this a bit. On the one clawed hand Twilight wielding chaos magic would be humorous to see and he could indulge in tons of food as 'examples' of his magic. On the other pawed hand if things got out of control he was likely to receive a lecture from Celestia and Fluttershy both. And while Celestia's lectures could put whole armies to sleep, Discord was not keen on hearing another one from Fluttershy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, it was a chance for fun. So why not?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright Twilight,\" Discord chuckled, snapping his fingers and changing into a professors outfit complete with sweater-vest and tie, \"I'll be your teacher in this subject. However there is something we must do first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sign a binding contract. Discord is allowed to teach only one pupil in his entire existence, so only Twilight can be his student. However signing the contract has the side effect of turning Twilight into a Draconequis too for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Visit Canterlot. Discord doesn't want to begin by going behind Celestia's back. After all if Twilight accidentally turns the moon into cheese it'll be his rump on the line with the Princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Have breakfast. Neither of the two of them have really finished a meal yet and Discord whips something up, perhaps waking and attracting Spike to the kitchen from the smells in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else.</span></div></div>",

He sometimes found her hyperactive, optimistic, fun-loving attitude a little annoying, but that wasn't the reason why he tried to avoid the pink pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the Spirit of Chaos, It was obvious that Discord had a sinister side.

Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was no reply, Discord frowned.

She looked up and saw Discord floating above her, grinning, his bulging belly drooping downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...H-hey there, D-Discord,\" Pinkie Pie stuttered, looking a child being caught doing something naughty. \"I...didn't suspect to find y-you here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's under the hatch?\" Discord asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, i-it's nothing,\" Pinkie Pie said, beginning to sweat, \"Just s-some extra supplies, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I take a look?\" said Discord, reaching out to the hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Pinkie Pie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?\" Discord asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie began to sweat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was struck by an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you haven't tried one of my special cupcakes yet,\" she said, smiling happily, pulling out a purple cupcake out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past this would have been a red flag to Discord that something was terribly wrong, but due to his quest to become the fattest being in Equestria he ate the cupcakes whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was delicious like any other cupcake Pinkie Pie makes, but it had another strange taste to it that Discord couldn't identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed and said, \"Okay, I ate your cupcake. Now tell me what's under... O, my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord suddenly felt dizzy, and the next thing he knew everything went dark. He fell from the air, snoring loudly on the floor.

That stuff packs a punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're awake.\" The high pitched voice snapped Discord alert as his memories of recent events returned. Blinking his eyes clear he looked down to find himself strapped to a table angled 45 degrees back with braces around his legs, wrists and neck. \"Just in time I'm almost ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet chaos,\" Discord muttered, \"I swear if this turns into something out of 'Cupcakes' I am out of here right now. I won't be part of such a morbid reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is cupcake related kinda,\" Pinkie smiled bouncing out of the shadows, her outfit an apron  stained with many colors and topped with a puffy bakers hat that still wasn't as bouncy as her mane, \"I mean, I did use one to knock you out so I could bring you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, ha ha, very clever, but you know these braces really don't suit me,\" Discord snapped his fingers... or tried to. Looking down he found both his hands had been wrapped in latex gloves coated with flower. The same for the tip of his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no chaos magic allowed,\" Pinkie grinned and booped Discords nose, \"You know for a being of chaos your magic is fairly predictable. To change your environment you always have to snap your fingers, or something like them, to make it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but did you know I can chaotically change myself without a snap?\" Discord asked and gave a brief struggle to the bindings which yielded nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did actually,\" Pinkie beamed back as she walked out of the singular light source and back into nearby shadows, \"Which is why I got that table in particular. Twilight enchanted it to prevent me from using my abilities to just slip out while she was studying my Pinkie Sense, So I figured if they could hold me they might be able to hold you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, very clever,\" Discord grumbled a bit unhappy at being confined again, \"But just what did you want me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a very unique problem,\" Pinkie stated, \"And you know what they say about a unique problem, You-neek up on it.\" A random rimshot seemed to play from the darkness, \"Oh, so that's where I left my drum set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she continued, \"I heard from Princess Celestia that Princess Luna's birthday is coming up. And she, Celestia that is, wants me to bake her, Luna of course, a cake, by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what has that got to do with me?\" Discord asked, an eyebrow raised now,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's where this place comes in,\" Pinkie replied and then called out \"Throw ze switch.\" Only for a slightly grunty version of herself to reply \"Yezz, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room flooded with light a moment later and Discord blinked, trying desperately to remove the spots before his eyes without the spray-bottle and rag he would have used otherwise. The room was large, very large in fact. Practically a whole factory, though no such building existed in Ponyville. At least above ground. The room was dominated by several large vats and machines along with quite a few smaller ones  along the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my \"Super Pinkie-rific Ultimate Taste Sensation Detection and Cake Creation System (patent pending) or S.P.U.T.S.D.C.C.S. for short. The 'Sputsdccs' can create every flavor of confectionery ever made in a matter of hours. Then it can combine and mix and match and narrow down the flavors to find the individuals perfect pastry treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" Discord still looked uncertain but intrigued at the same time, \"But what does this have to do with me and Princess Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Since I can't strap Luna into the 'Sputsdccs' I'm going to feed you every flavor in Equestria and then when you dream tonight Luna can walk through it and pick out the flavors you've sampled and then she'll tell me which one she likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And does she know about this?\" Discord asked as Pinkie waled over to a nearby leve on a conveyor belt that was pointed at Discords face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you know I can't remember if I mailed that letter or not,\" Pinkie mused, \"Well I can just send it afterwords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't it be easier to just ask Princess Luna what she wants?\" Discord added hear thumping in his ears. he wondered if this was how skydivers felt before the big jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Pinkie mused, hoof on the lever, \"But then again, I already have you hear so we might as well go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she pulled the lever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The machine produces a slow but reasonable stream of small treats, easy to manage and savor each bite one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The machine produces a pastry about the size of a cupcake at an interval of one every few seconds, just enough time to wolf each one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: The machine produces whole cakes, one every couple seconds giving no time to chew and forcing each one down Discords throat with barely enough time to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something goes wrong and a steady stream of mushed together baked goods is forced down Discords throat.</span></div></div>",

Besides Fluttershy, Discord had a surprisingly weak relationship with the rest of Twilight Sparkle's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, why not begin to strengthen it by hanging out with the country pony? Besides, he always wondered if they truly did make the best cider in Poniville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall pink clouds tore away from the bigger one and formed some kind of staircase for the draconequus to descend from the sky, slurping the glass away from some fruity drink, his belly curving further outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comon, Big Mac!\" the earth pony shouted, \"Pull! Pull!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered from head to hoof in mud, Applejack pushed as hard as she could again the apple cart, which was stuck in a deep pool of muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tryin',\" the big, red stallion shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was straining every muscle in his body as he pulled, but the mud pool was proving a challenge even for his vast strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, Big Macintosh stopped. \"This's no use, sis,\" he said, panting, \"Can't we, like, get Princess Twilight to help us out or somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack shook her head. \"No,\" she said firmly, though she was considering the offer, \"We ain't gonna bother Twi with somethin' like this. We can do this. Comon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stallion groaned as he pulled again. Applejack began to push again, not expected to to budge immediately, but it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell face first into the mud, but she was happy that they were moving again, but she was met with a big surprise when she rose from the mud and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apple cart wasn't moving forward but floating upwards into the sky by some unseen force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\" Big Macintosh cried in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart floated a few feet away before from the mud pool and was placed gently on the ground. The red stallion was shivering, shaken by what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was shocked too, but she recovered quickly, knowing that something magical was the cause of this. The question was who did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came quickly, but the identity of her unlikely helper dismayed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, howdy there, folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Discord, giving a stereotypical western accent, wearing a cowboy hat, boots, and silver spurs, a piece of straw in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped off of his pink cloud, adjusted his belt buckle which his basketball-sized belly was drooping over, causing it to gurgle and slosh, and strutted towards Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saw ya in trouble and decided to help you'll out,\" he said before he spat and flashed her a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord was the last being in all of Equestria that Applejack expected to receive help from, but she was taught not to be ungrateful when sompony lends their hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the surprised expression from her face, she smiled and said, \"Mighty thanks for your help, Discord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tipped her hat to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd be stuck in that muck for hours if ya didn't come by. If there's any way we can repay ya, jus' let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was about to turn away and catch up to her brother, who had recovered and was walking away to his destination, Discord appeared in a puff of smoke before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had dropped his playful attitude and costume and looked deep in thought, his claw to his chin. Though, strangely, he still had that bulging belly, which struck Applejack as odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could, for starters, show me how you make that delicious cider of yours,\" he said, \"It would be very educational for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today Applejack was shocked. Was the Spirit of Chaos actually interested in farm work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, that was as strange as Granny Smith being interested in becoming a rock star, or Big Macintosh becoming a motivational speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just too strange, even for Discord. Applejack sensed that there was something up, and she wanted to know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ya so interested in helpin' everypony all the sudden?\" asked Applejack suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord looked offended. \"I'm just trying to built myself a better reputation, that's all,\" he said, \"After all, I did help you. But if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe draconequus attempted to fly away, but Applejack shouted, \"Hold up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint triumphant grin touched Discord's face. He floated downwards again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her one leg, she said, \"Alright, you may come, but no funnay business, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe draconequus whooped for joy. He snapped his fingers and was suddenly dressed in pair of jean overalls, his belly pressing against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed his pitchfork in the direction Big Macintosh went and said, \"Them cider ain't gonna make 'emselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord flew off quickly, and Applejack had to run to keep up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest of his face following a moment or two after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a while since I paid my 'respects' to sun-butt and moon-flanks,\" he mused while chugging a bottle of soda through a second mouth that appeared on his neck, \"And it would be a shame for them to miss out on all this. Heaven knows with how much caked old sunny sneaks she should be twice as big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smile curled around Discords face and to the back of his head as he got a fun idea. A snap of his clawed fingers later and Discord appeared in the royal kitchens. It was quite busy this time of day unfortunately and Discord had to snap again to make the ponies not freak out at his sudden appearance. It wasn't much of a mind altering spell (Discord had sworn on his friendship with Fluttershy never to do that again). Instead he was simply a 'blind spot' to everyone in the kitchen as they instantly forgot his arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floating over their heads Discord had to admit the royal cooks were some of the best in Equestria. He snuck a few tastes here and there of their creations and had to admit that, sadly, his own poofed-into-existence creations were merely 'good' while their were far superior in taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose that's the trade-off of quantity versus quality,\" Discord sighed as he snagged a cupcake from a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Watching the chefs work Discord was facinated with their coordination. As soon as one was done with part of the prep the next was ready to fry or bake or drizzle the next step on the meal. They worked like a well-oiled machine passing platters to eachother and moving about with skilled ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One pony caught Discords eye, a soft cream colored mare who, judging by the height of her puffy hat, was the one in charge. She moved from table to table, sampling, critiquing, and adding a touch here and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What Discord noticed most though was her size. She was very nearly twice the girth of any of the other pony cooks, but she moved with the grace of a ballerina as she slid between and around them to continue her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The head chef Toasty Cakes,\" Discord mused as he snitched an eclair from another plate, \"She certainly lives up to her reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that he was here though Discord had several ideas of just what he wanted to do. And it was so hard to decide which plan to attempt. He had every intention of joining the princesses for their next meal and attempting to show how 'civilized' he could be, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to mess with the food some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Discord enchants the chefs creations. Not only will anypony eating them find them completely irresistible, but they'll think any weight gained is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Same as Choice one only they will notice and find it attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Discord steals the 'trade secrets' of the royal chefs and opens his own restaurant in Canterlot'. Not only will he get all the food he can eat, he can spread size to the locals and perhaps the princesses themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Discord simply 'copies' the end results of cooks delicious foods and sneaks up to the princesses chambers with a 'gift'. Of course the duplication magic he used might be unstable and once consumed the duplicated food might double again. And again... And again...</span></div></div>",

Yes! Stock for Sugarcube Corner! Cakes been selling like crazy recently and it's always a good thing to have lots available to satisfy costumer's sweet tooth! It's totally not meant for anything else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie's nervous grin grew slightly wider, sweat dripping off of her face as Rainbow Dash stared at her suspiciously, rubbing her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then,\" she said, \"Be seeing ya around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaybye!\" Pinkie Pie said in a lightning fast pace, grabbing the cart and dashing away, leaving smoke behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, slightly surprised, only shook and head and floated away, but then a thought occurred to her, forcing her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec,\" she said, turning around, \"isn't Sugarcube Corner that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pinkie Pie was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pony gave a sigh of relief, realizing how close she came to getting caught. She honestly had to pick a better route next time, even if it meant taking a longer way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the cart behind her, she trotted towards a crumbling, abandoned windmill. She opened the door and stepped inside the gloomy, dark chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here!\" she cheerfully cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the darkness something hissed threateningly like a angry cat, but Pinkie Pie wasn't afraid. In fact, she smiled, glad that he was still there, and hopped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched on a gas lantern, illuminating the chamber, and in the corner, chained to the wall by his forelegs, struggling against his bounds, was a changling. He had all the typical features that you would expect: a pitch black body, holes in his hooves, insect-like wings, white eyes and a crooked horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, what made him a little different from the rest of his fellow changlings was that he appeared to have some sort of green helmet on his head, which wasn't a helmet at all but actually part of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hissed again, his long forked tongue lashing around, barring his sharp teeth. But Pinkie Pie wasn't intimidated. She loved it when he was angry. He looked so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, she grabbed his face and squeezed his cheeks and said, \"Guess what I brought ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over, grabbed a colorful cupcake, presented it to him and said, \"Open wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" demanded the changling, \"I will not eat ssstupid pony food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the equivalent of his specie's roar, but Pinkie Pie used this opportunity to stuff the cupcake in his mouth. His first instinct was to spit it out, but, to his surprise, he swallowed it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea why. It didn't even taste that good! As he pondered what just happened, Pinkie Pie took off a slice of cake and coaxed him into eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changling clamped his mouth shut, determined not to fall into the same trap again, but the Pinkie Pie tickled him, and, though he tried his best not to, laughed and she shoved the cake into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely had time to swallow before a sticky bun was crammed into his maw. And so this went on for a while. Pinkie Pie stuffed the poor changling every chance she had, and he was powerless to do anything but eat and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards he stopped putting up a fight, and Pinkie Pie only had to feed him the treats that he willingly took. Now she had time to study his swelling form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was already beginning to bulge as the sweets filled his stomach, and Pinkie Pie stared at it lovingly. She imagined the calories going to work, filling out his frame, forming into juicy, sexy, fatty goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of her caressing the lovehandles of a black blob appeared in her mind, and she felt how her neither regions grew moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie didn't know why, but ever since she lied eyes on a changling she started to have strange fascination of them, and soon that fascination developed into a fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how they would look if they were giant, immobile blobs of juicy fat, but she knew that would never be possible, for they resided very far off and would never come to Ponyville...or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happened to stumble upon her pet a day ago. Somehow he had infiltrated the small town without detection and was there for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie found him in the supply room at the back of Sugarcube Corner, ripping open sacks of flower and digging around in it for something. Without him knowing, she snug up behind him and knocked him out with a frying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of taking him to Twilight, Pinkie Pie decided to take him to an abandoned mill on the outskirts of town to inflict her desires on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the special ingredient she placed in the sweets, which not only was extremely full of calories but very addictive, he would be a black butterball in no time!</span></div></div>",

Zecora told the ponies that she woke up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how could this happen to you?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora thought to herself for a minute and come up with an idea, \"I believed it must be my ex-coltfriend. Our relationship was a dead end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Rainbow Dash was bashing her hooves together, \"I will give him a good smacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my homeland called Zebrica. Tribe called Zebabwe,\" Zecora replied as her belly grew a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think he can do it from all the way there?\" Pinkie pulled out a map out of thin air, \"He's there and he is over thousands of miles from here, Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>BURPPPP!!!</b></i>. Excuse me,\" Zecora's belly grew considerably bigger. Her bed creaked under her weight. \"A voodoo doll. That makes my belly so tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Twilight just heard something new, \"You are saying that voodooism is real. I thought those were ponies tale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real. <i><b>BURRRPPPPPP!!!!!!</b></i>,\" Zecora blushed as she gained more weight, \"I knew that he dabble in that dark art and it is the real deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Twilight paced around the room, \"To get there by airship, I need to set up the time for the crew. Also as a princess, I must tell the leader from Zebrica that we are coming. Warned the other princesses that I'm leaving. There is so much to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Twilight panicking, Rarity asked the details of Zecora's ex-coltfriend. Zecora stood up from her bed and waddle to the shelves. The belly and rump shook like jelly with every step she took. Zecora was out of breath as she got there even if it just on the other side of her room. She took out a book with pictures from her homeland. She pointed at the picture and shown it to the ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i><b>BUURRRRPPP!!!!</b></i> Zayd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies looked at the picture of younger Zecora with the young zebra stallion. He was smiling, a head taller and long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is wise and he never lies. <i><b>BURP!</b></i>. If he said he doesn't, he is telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike burped out a letter, \"Thank you Spike,\" Twilight took the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you were talking about Zayd, I wrote a letter to Princess Celestia for the fastest route to get to Zebabwe,\" Twilight quickly read through the letter and grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the <i><b>BUUURRRPPP</b></i> matter? I want to continue the chatter,\" Zecora dragged her body to Twilight. Her belly was rubbing against the floor while standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To give Zebrica time for our arrival. They needed at least two weeks to prepare for our arrival as I am a princess. The trip to Zebrica's port by air ship is a ten days journey. This give us time for the crew to set up and prepare the supplies. We can only take the carriage to the tribe Zebabwe which can take another ten days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Rainbow Dash was in disbelief, \"We will get to her hometown in a month! Look at Zecora, It has been barely an hour when we just met her and she is having trouble moving around in her own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora just tripled her weight when they first met today. Her cheeks got larger, her rumps got widened, her limbs got flabbier and her belly flattened on the ground even when she was standing. Everypony knew that it was no good for Zecora's fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but this is the best we got. We got to obey the Zebrica's law and the procedures to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNopony can do anything but groaned about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor dear,\" Fluttershy rubbed Zecora's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>BBBUUUUURRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!</b></i>\" Zecora's most loudest burp so far, rattled her belongings in her room. Zecora's weight exponentially rose up. Just before she still can touch the floor, now her hooves could not reach the floor and they dangled off her body. Her neck disappeared into her body, her rumps took up 6 seats. Zecora is now as tall as Princess Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora huffed as she talk to Twilight, \"Twilight, is it okay for me to <b><i>burp</i></b> come with you,\" Zecora trying to suppress her burping, \"or is it wise to stay here in Ponyville.\"</span></div></div>",

Luckily it was the weekend as there isn't any students nearby. Starlight was shock to see what had become of Zecora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Twilight explained the problem, Starlight thought of a solution, \"I may not have the solution but Trixie can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can Trixie do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie is a illusionist, remember. She can blend Zecora to her surrounding. Make her not stood out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarlight quickly retrieved Trixie and told her the problem. Starlight praised her to make Trixie proud of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right. As I, The Great and Powerful Trixie, would solve this dilemma until you find the voodoo doll,\" Trixie circled around around Zecora to give her an idea, \"Okay I need waterproof white and red paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it,\" Pinkie disappeared in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight,\" Trixie pointed at the wall near the ground at the side of the school, \"Make a big hole there. Enough to fit Zecora's head in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie rolled her eyes, \"It's part of the trick. Just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Twilight blasted the wall the create a hole, Pinkie brought back the paint cans, \"Got it. Got them on a good deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie brought back so many cans that it can fill Fluttershy's chicken coop, \"Good thinking. We should get extra just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ponies. Paint all the black stripes with white paint on her body and limbs,\" Trixie ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the order, Zecora's head was pushed into the wall while lying on her back. Now it resembled a giant furry white water balloon. The body would jiggle with every movement or burp she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Now she does not look like a zebra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we explained the students if they see a balloon that is behind Starlight's office?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. Just like this,\" Trixie brought out the red paint and wrote on Zecora's belly, \"A giant advertisement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig bold red words were written clearly, \"<b><span class=\"clred\">School of Friendship</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Everybody would see that is just an advertisement and they more likely get bored of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart thinking Trixie,\" Starlight praised Trixie again, \"The students would think nothing of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just make sure to paint the Zecora every time we see any black strips or the words faded. Why I decide her head is in your office so you can observe Zecora.

They were eating snacks as they are having a casual conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nice just to have a quiet chat once in a while,\" Twilight signed as she sipped her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock by the entrance, \"Pinkie and Applejack, are you there? I need you here to feed this mare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight heard a unique accent with rhyming couplets. She did not met anypony who had that accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us for a moment. We need to talk to our <i>biggest</i> customer,\" Pinkie hopped out of her seat and head straight out of the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hope Zecora's scooter board is holdin' uhp,\" Applejack followed Pinkie behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange. Why doesn't Zecora come in?\" Twilight pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you look out the window?\" Rarity pointed at the window by the entrance, \"You might get an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Twilight and Spike ran up to the window to see who is Zecora. Both their eyes widened and mouths hang open on what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had seen zebras before. What shock her that Zecora was big, like really really big. Zecora was wider than she was tall. Zecora was as twice as tall as Princess Celestia. Her rump is so wide that she required ten seats. The biggest part of Zecora is the belly. Her belly would swamped the ground if it wasn't for the scooter board. Her belly is even wider than her rump. It is no surprise if Zecora couldn't fit through some alleyway or a narrow street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. This is always the first reaction when strangers first met Zecora,\" Rainbow Dash flew up to Twilight, \"Not a surprise that she is bigger than we last saw her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the fattest creature I've ever seen,\" Spike exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike!\" Twilight hushed Spike, trying not to sound rude to Zecora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. She know that she is fat,\" Fluttershy commented, \"She like being described as fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't take offence to it,\" Rarity spoke up, \"She just a big mare with a bottomless appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight kept watching the scene. She saw Pinkie produced a three-tier cake out of nowhere and Zecora swallowed it up with one bite. After talking for a bit, Zecora strolled away with ease as if she wasn't encumbered by her ridiculous weight. Her belly, cheeks and rump shook like jelly with every movement she made. Pinkie and Applejack went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for thuh holduhp.  Zecora wanted me ta replaced her scooter board and increase her food order again,\" Applejack sat back on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Me too and the other bakeries, candy stores, dessert shops, restaurants, Rich's Barnyard Bargains and every fast food chain. Keep this up, she would be the primary payer for all the food stuff.\" Pinkie leaped to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Pinkie,\" Twilight asked, \"Was Zecora always this big or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Pinkie interrupted her and pulled scrapbook about Zecora, \"She was like any other ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Twilight and Spike was surprise to see the first page of the scrapbook. Zecora was thin and the same size as other normal ponies in the picture. It is very hard for them to believe that this was the same Zecora as the one they saw outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has this picture been taken?\" Spike asked, hoping it is like 5 years or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just one year,\" Pinkie quickly replied like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gives another reason for both Twilight and Spike to stared widely at Pinkie, \"One year. How is that possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie read out a story as she flipped through the pages. When they first met Zecora, she was greeted with a party. Zecora never had snacks like these in her homeland before. When Zecora first tasted them, she exclaimed that it was the best food that she have ever tasted. She ate so much food for an average pony. She said that she couldn't wait to eat more of these sugary treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora sold potions to paid for more sweet food. She become a regular customer soon after. She started to get discounts and freebies for being a loyal customer which lead her to eat more. She began having trouble with mobility when she able to outeat Pinkie. Applejack offered services in making scooter board and repairs for her. All the stores that she frequent now offered free delivery service to her home. This now lead to more weight gain as she doesn't have to move out of her home. Ponyville invited her to eating competition and dominated all of them. She got sponsored and get more free food. All the store that sells food here give her free leftovers and products they couldn't sell to her (produce that are damaged or doesn't look as nice as other produce). Zecora was gaining weight really quickly because her previous diet doesn't involve much sugar and she was addicted to them. If she wasn't making potions, she would most likely be eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Spike saw pictures of Zecora steadily increase in weight through each picture. There are newspaper clippings of Zecora's achievements. She can see that Zecora standing next to an average sized pony for reference. No wonder that everypony see her as a lovable zebra with an endless appetite that Pinkie couldn't match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the best eater. A competition that nopony want to compete against her,\" Rainbow added, \"I heard she wanted to bulk up more to beat dragons as no normal pony want to compete against her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Spike thought of a Zebra whose belly is as big as a big dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she is in the world record for the fattest creature comparative to her species,\" Rarity continued the conversation, \"I heard she wanted to be the biggest. She told me that if she is that big, might as well be the biggest anypony have seen. Give her an inch and she will take a mile and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't she like miss her mobility and not having an insanely large appetite?\" Twilight questioned Zecora's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Fluttershy answered, \"As you have seen Zecora moved easily with her weight, she was using strength and feather-weight potions. It is nice to see her around as she rarely go out as she used to. Her eating appetite does not bother her as it makes her happy and she would be remembered as the zebra with an endless appetite. Tourist love to take pictures with her if given the chance. The tourist commonly give her junk food as thanks for the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could talk to her,\" Twilight wondered, \"I want to see her daily life and how does she deal with her size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Twi, ya could come with me as ahm goin' ta replace her scooter board or stay an wait for thuh next taahm. Howevher, we wouldn't know whe-yn she would come out again. Yo-wr choaahce.\"</span></div></div>",

Ah hope thuh diamond scooter board could withstand thuh heft mo-wr than thuh titanium scooter board.  Ah done saw thuh titanium scooter board was bendin' under her heft eend that sayin' a lot,\" Applejack pushed the scooter board down a wide path in the Everfree Forest. The pathway was bricked and it so wide that it can easily fit 50 ponies standing next to each other, side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The community really care for Zecora as this pathway must be only be used for Zecora and the services for Zecora,\" Spike observed the surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We syhaw do.  We done made this for her so her scooter board kay-yun git into our burg without gettin' stuck in some hole.  Wer allers thinkin' ahead an thinkin' about expandin' this pathway again ifin' she almost git as waahd as this path. This also ta help for us ta give her wagons awf food with ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight spotted in a distant that there were 3 stallions with their wagons heading in the opposite direction. Two of the wagons were empty while the last one was filled with trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' fastfood employees,\" Applejack called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Applejack.

I bet she will ask you for more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed by each other and continue walking, \"Does Zecora eat three carts full of food each day?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.  Three wagons was fast food chains.  Two wagons from Sugarcube corner.  Two wagons awf bread an pastries from other bakeries.  Two wagons from dessert shops.  Three wagons from sweet sto-wrs.  One wagon from local restaurants.  Two wagons from sweet apple acres.  Five wagons from rich's barnyard bargains.  All jus' in one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly calculated what Applejack had just said, \"You are telling me that Zecora eat at least 20 wagons full of food! Where does she put all that stuff. Each wagon can at least carry 500 pounds of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyep,\" Applejack replied nonchalantly like it was normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you telling me that she eat the weight of food of 40 fully-grown stallions per day,\" Twilight trying to understand the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hooaah shers thuh best eater.  Ahm not surprise ifin' she kay-yun chew at least 50 wagons full awf food by thuh end awf thuh year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't comprehend what Applejack just had said. Before she can say anything, Applejack interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here. Welcome t' Zecora's home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked around and saw a door in a tree like her library. However, it just a normal door that would definitely wouldn't fit Zecora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Zecora way to get out before she have gotten too big for it. Now this is for guest to enter through. She leaves her home through that way,\" Applejack pointed to the large round metal platform surrounded by railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three stood in the middle of the platform as Applejack turned a key for it to descend down to the bottom, \"She owned a favour from an engineer for solving his daughter's life with a potion. She now have free repair and expansion to the elevator for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it must cost a fortune,\" Spike stared around as they are descending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is. Luckily she have lots of favours from ponies through her journey to Ponyville. That's why she could afford her underground home and her gluttonous lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is her underground home gonna be big enough for Zecora for a while?\" asked Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We done thought we do whe-yn we initially done it.  Her unpredictable appetaht may-uk it dreadfully 'ard ta know whe-yn ta expand so we will contact thuh minin' crew ifin' she gawt mo-wr fatter faster than we previously thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the bottom, Twilight and Spike gasped what they saw. The whole underground cave is carved out that can fit the whole town of Ponyville in one room. Along the walls were belongings to Zecora and wagons. There is also an underground waterfall that lead to a large pool. They spotted Zecora happily eating away by one of the carts by the wall, facing away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wer here for thuh scooter board.  Jus' cahwl us whe-yn ya get through,\" Applejack waited on the couch for visitors, \"Don't bother her.  Whe-yn she start eating, squat would stop her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for half an hour, Zecora approached them, \"Sorry AJ as I was in the middle of my post-breakfast. I can wait until I feel the fullest,\" Zecora pulled out a muffin from nowhere and gobbled it up without leaving a crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Spike couldn't help but stared at the behemoth. Standing next to Zecora make them feel as small as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckled at their expression, \"It's alraahyt.  Ahm here ta give ya thuh new scooter board.  Let me introduce t' thuh new members awf Ponyville, Twilight Sparkle and Spike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora shook both Twilight and Spike, \"Hello Spike and Twilight. Don't fear me if I am as big as a building site,\" Zecora chuckled as she patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt always amused Zecora when somebody new greeted her. Most of them could not comprehend what they just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Zecora. I wanted to meet you when I first saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony does. You could ask me anything you want after I check with the new scooter board,\" Zecora hefted her body with little effort from her old scooter board to the new and improved scooter board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack checked the old scooter board and found the wheels are worn off and the metal board part in bending towards the ground, \" Ah hope thuh new scooter board will last longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge?\" Zecora joked, \"You hope my weight would not damage. Make sure to add more pies. I don't want any compromise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the scooter board is working fine, Applejack left through the small entrance that can only fit normal size ponies. Zecora turned back to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are prepare,\" Zecora saw Twilight already holding a scroll and quill in her magic, \"I can answer whatever I can. Now give me a question mare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First question. Why do you want to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A question I always heard. I would give you the same word,\" Zecora munched on some hayburgers, \"The food here are so delicious. To show my girth is ambitious. I do not want to waste a minute not eating those food. If I am not eating, I would feel brood,\" Zecora kept pulling out more food as she kept answering to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second question. Don't you miss your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are benefits for being normal.  However, I like to be abnormal. Even though I cannot fit in some alleyway, my size keeps the beasts at bay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third question. What is exactly your job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I am not out there conquering eating competition, I am just a shaman making potions. I help ponies to give positive emotions. I keep multiple gardens here with different plants so I don't have to come out to see some ants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourth question. What are your hobbies beside eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I am rarely not eating, I would be either be reading or watching from a projector. I am also a potion book collector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifth question. What is like your diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question that I always like to give. I will tell you how I use to live. Before this, my diet was only vegetables and fruits. And also some roots. When I come to a town called Ponyville, I was introduced to their cuisine. Their food make me not so lean. Sugar, deep-fried, boiled in lard. Those are the food that made me as big as a yard. I cannot live without those food. Without them, I would be in a bad attitude. Since then, I never touch a vegetable or fruit, I kicked them out of my diet like with a boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora's belly rumbled when mentioning food. Zecora walked to a nearby wagon and munch away to ease her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. When the belly is rumbling, you can only hear me mumbling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Zecora. Last question. What's your typical day of your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much happen in my daily life. It is nothing like the wildlife. Most of my day, I would eat until my stomach feel complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least give a brief summary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you ponies, I have more meals. I have at least 15 meals and snacks in between. I have:<br>\r\nIn-Bed meal, Pre-Breakfast, Breakfast, Post-Breakfast, Morning Tea, Pre-Lunch, Lunch, Post-Lunch, Supper, Pre-Dinner, Dinner, Post-Dinner, Dessert, Bedtime Meal, and Midnight Feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so many,\" Spike stared at the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each meal is that food is my top priority. I would do nothing but eat is my only authority. Each meal would last an hour minimum and snacks I would eat while doing tasks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do with the remaining 9 hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 hours of those would be sleeping. The rest would be potion making and housekeeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you only have 4 hours of stuff you could do besides eating. That doesn't give you much time to do what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora chuckled, \"If I asked the days to be longer, I most likely be eating more while I ponder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if there is more in your daily life that you are missing,\" Twilight quickly read through her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I missed anything, you could come to see me tomorrow and witness everything. I would wake up at four, are you willing to be there by the door. I hope you made a decision before I go for my morning tea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight was by herself as she was observing Zecora while taking notes. Twilight quickly observed her surroundings, each part of the wall are designated for each meal or function. Each designated meal area contained one carriage. The snack area is for eating between each meal. Both the snack area and the dessert area contains three carriages each. This shows that she likes sugary treats the most in one sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Zecora's Schedule</b></u><br>\r\n<u><b>3:30am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora doesn't require a bed. Zecora was still sleeping but she was still eating from the snack area. Zecora have sleep eating. The first snack area is near completion. Not a single crumb left on the ground or face. Must be a really careful eater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>4:00am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora stirred awake. She still seem half-asleep. Zecora didn't notice me as she dragged her body to the In-bed meal area. She was eating in a faster pace than before. Before she was like eating a treat every few seconds. She was now eating multiple treats at the same time in a second. Still not leaving a crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>5:00am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora was now wide awake by the rumbling of her stomach. She greeted me as she does the morning hygiene (brushing her teeth, combing her mane and washing her face). She consumed the two potions, the strength and feather-weight potions. She kept hundreds of those potions in her potion storage room. Zecora stated that those potions would last 24 hours, no matter how big the consumer is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>5:15am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora is now eating her pre-breakfast meal. Again not leaving a crumb. Try asking question but Zecora didn't replied. It is true that Zecora is more occupied feeding her stomach than answering a simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>6:15am</b></u><br>\r\nAble to ask who she could eat without leaving a crumb and why. She told me that how she grew up eating. She was raised not to waste a single crumb or a drop of liquid. She said that every crumb she missed eating, a crumb would not be added to her growing weight. She went dusting all of her belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>6:30am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora started eating her breakfast. Same result like last meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>7:30am</b></u><br>\r\nCheck her plants and herbs in her hydroponic garden. All the plants are rare ones. The common ones are ordered. All while snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>7:45am</b></u><br>\r\nEat her post-breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>8:45am</b></u><br>\r\nGreeted ponies that delivered the plants and place them in the alchemy area. Check that she got everything in her order. Snacking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>9:00am</b></u><br>\r\nEating Morning Tea. Just found out her normal drinking cup is the size of a cauldron. That strength potion must have help her to lift it up without any effort. Common drinks are soda, milkshakes and energy drinks that contains lot of sugar. She avoid water, coffee and tea as it taste too plain for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>10:00am</b></u><br>\r\nZecora greeted the ponies. Ponies with carriages full of food replaced the empty ones that were eaten either earlier this morning or yesterday. The ponies empty the trash cans for her. Heard discussion that Zecora wanted to add more carriages. More snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>10:15am</b></u><br>\r\nPre-lunch began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>11:15am</b></u><br>\r\nCollect herbs and fruits from plants for potions while eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>11:30am</b></u><br>\r\nLunch, not much else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>12:30pm</b></u><br>\r\nStarted boiling water and adding ingredients for potions. Multiple cauldrons(10) was being use. Was told that it could take a while. Snacking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>12:45pm</b></u><br>\r\nPost-lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>1:45pm</b></u><br>\r\nFilling bottles from the cauldrons. Some replaced the potions she consumed and most are being sold to some business. Snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>2:00pm</b></u><br>\r\nSupper. Saw her guzzling down heavy and creamy soups with a large funnel. It was fast and efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>3:00pm</b></u><br>\r\nTalk to delivery ponies for transfer of potions. Snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>3:15pm</b></u><br>\r\nPre-dinner. Heard her saying that she was right adding more carriages. Conclusion, her appetite increased a lot since last change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>4:15pm</b></u><br>\r\nReplant herbs and seeds for the next harvest. Snacking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>4:30pm</b></u><br>\r\nDinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>5:30pm</b></u><br>\r\nRead the newspaper while mindlessly eating within her reach. Wanted to keep up with the news as she rarely left her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>5:45pm</b></u><br>\r\nPost-dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>6:45pm</b></u><br>\r\nHave a bath in the gigantic pool. It was embarrassing to watch but Zecora didn't mind. Zecora have a brush for each hoof with extended handle to reach places she couldn't touch. The handles were tied and duct taped multiple times with wooden poles to extend it further. Snacking and drinking 2L soda bottles while taking a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>7:00pm</b></u><br>\r\nDessert. It was amazing to see her want savage of those desserts without leaving a mess. Must eat three times as fast as the other meals to finish them all up in one hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>8:00pm</b></u><br>\r\nDoing night hygiene. Brush her teeth, brush her mane and wash her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>8:15pm</b></u><br>\r\nThe bedtime meal. Before going to sleep, she want to be comfortably full before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>9:15pm</b></u><br>\r\nWent to sleep by the snack area so she can eat while sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>12:00am</b></u><br>\r\nRumbling from her stomach woke Zecora up. Even though it is dark, she had her midnight feast without any problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>1:45am</b></u><br>\r\nFinish her midnight feast and went back to the snack area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Zecora were reading and talking about the observation the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, I am no where near as busy as a bee,\" Zecora stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. It just doesn't your life seem monotonous. Must of your time is just eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you it seemed a bored, but to me eating is my reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight waved goodbye as there is nothing else to talk about.</span></div></div>",

Twilight and Spike were in their costume followed the foals to the statue of Nightmare Moon. Twilight and Spike were shock what Zecora had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora gotten way lot fatter than before. Zecora just essentially double her weight since they last met. She was know 4 times as tall as Princess Celestia and the rump was so wide that it can take 20 seats. She would just barely feet in a standard street in a suburban area if it wasn't for her massive belly. If she attempt to to walk down the street, her rump would take both sides of the carriage lane alone and her belly would take up the whole hoofpath on both side of the street and squished against the walls. If there was one word that would describe Zecora, it would be 'blob'. She can fill up a small house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther ponies doesn't show any sign of shock when they saw Zecora. Either they met her recently or they expected Zecora to be that big that quickly. Zecora told the legend of Nightmare Moon with powders to show illustrations. When the royal carriage came, it scared everypony off leaving only Twilight and Zecora behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you, Twilight,\" Zecora leaned down to have a better look at her, \"Haven't seen you since that parasite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've been busy lately,\" Twilight looked at Zecora's costume. It was such a shame that nopony could appreciate her costume. Her witch doctor costume was really nice. It is very hard to see her costume when she towered over ponies and the clothes could only fit a normal pony. Her black cloak look like a cape for a new-born foal trying to fit on an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is nice to see you,\" Zecora turned around, \"I am here to see the candy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora's mouth acted like a vacuum as she sucked up all the candy around the Nightmare Moon statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, how many carriages of food are you eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently, I am eating at least 40 carriages of food. Not obeying my stomach would be rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last question before I leave. How do you leave your home? I know that the elevator is not big enough for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I outgrew the elevator, there is somepony I know who can cater. She made a short-range teleportation device. I was really nice. It only allowed me just in and out of my room. Stay clear of the exit unless you want to meet a certain doom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't believe what she just heard, she doubled her food intake just within 3 months. The only way to get out of her home is the special device. Twilight left Zecora to see Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>After Princess Luna reinstated Nightmare Night</b></u><br>\r\n\"Thank you Twilight for helping us see the fun of Nightmare Night,\" Princess Luna smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I am always happy to help,\" Twilight smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing I wanted to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Princess Luna pointed at Zecora as she gobbled up all the treats that was offered at the Nightmare Moon statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Zecora. Our zebra friend and our local alchemist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you jest,\" Princess Luna poked at Zecora's belly, \"I've seen zebras before and that is not what zebras should look like unless it change since I was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Princess Luna for eating your treat,\" Zecora greeted, \"I am zebra just love to eat eat eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Luna meet Zecora,\" Twilight introduced, \"Zecora. The lover of sweets and fatty food. Nothing would stop her from getting food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Zecora. We've never met a zebra that is as big as you. We don't mind the treats. You can have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora giggled as her whole body jiggle, \"If I met somebody who is as fat as me, I would be shock. I am here for us to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed as they talk whatever they wanted to talk about.</span></div></div>",

She looked around and shock to find out the walls and floor is made out of sweet-smelling substance and the waterfall turned into chocolate milk.

She couldn't help it but keep tearing pieces off the wall and eating them in reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething unusual about the candy wall. The more Zecora eat the weird sweet, the hungrier she get. Zecora didn't notice it as her mind is consumed by the thought of eating more. The strange candy is calorie heavy that cause her to gain weight incredible quickly. Zecora did not see what else have gotten weird in her home. All the carriages in the room came to life. They started digging the wall for more space for Zecora to grow and to feed Zecora's growing appetite. Zecora did not notice as she was tipped over onto her back by the carriages. The only thing in her mind is more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large funnel was placed in her maw. The carriages just pour the collected sweets straight down into it. There was also a hose that give her the chocolate milk from the pool.

If she is standing straight up, she would be as tall as a 20 story building. Fortunately, the room was just big enough to fit herself and her belongings. However, she would need to expand the room soon as she could easily fill out the room within a week. The room was so cramped that if she took one wrong step, her belly would smash against her belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora would not likely can enter any town or city in her current size. No street would allow her to get through as she would likely to get stuck between two high-rise buildings. If anypony would see her, they would describe her as a mass of flab.

Zecora talked to the food provider about increasing her food intake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile discussing with the food provider, Zecora encountered a major problem. She doesn't have enough fund to feed herself. She could only pay 100 carriages of food per day. After quickly calculated her size, she think she would need to consume over 5000 carriages of food per day just to sate her appetite. Zecora is easily frustrated when she is hungry. Zecora have to think a quick solution to solve this dilemma. If not, Ponyville will experience a regular occurrence of tremour cause by the rumbling of her stomach. A 100 carriages of food could not even sate her for one meal of a day and she needs 15 meals with snacks in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora quickly thought of an idea before her mind is consumed by hunger.</span></div></div>",

This would surely solve her hunger issue. She only knew it was hidden somewhere in the Castle of the Two Sisters. She could not get it for herself as she was obviously bigger than the castle. She know someone who would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours after asking Spike to retrieve the book, Spike found the book and immediately went straight to her. During the wait, Zecora tried to calm her stomach by rubbing her belly and thinking of something besides food. It was a very hard task for her as her stomach kept rumbling. She saw every part of her body wobble every time her belly shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find the book you described. A spell book made of stone and with spikes on the front cover,\" Spike nestled the book into Zecora's neck, \"I hope it would help with your diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Spike. I know this book would end this hunger strike,\" Zecora winced every time her belly roared in hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike left Zecora to be alone with the book. As soon as Spike was gone out of sight, she quickly scanned the book to find the spell. After finding the spell, Inspiration Manifestation, she read the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action. Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction. Projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the incantation, she felt a magical power within her. She used her new powers she just obtained to expand her home. She cast more spells to make her home look presentable and more homey. She transformed her book to make it unremarkable compare to other books. With tons of room to expand, Zecora started summoning food out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started out simple and small like a cookie. A quick bite out of it and she moaned in pleasure. It was the tastiest cookie she ever tasted. Even better than Pinkie Pie's. She have the power to create food with the best ingredients and flavour. She began to create more junk food for her to eat. Each food she create become more heavily dense and bigger than before. She can create cupcakes as big as a fully-grown pumpkin and ice cream scoops as big as yoga balls. She kept eating and eating until she finally felt full. Zecora initially thought it was impossible to fill something that is as big as her stomach but with this book it can make the impossible happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora rubbed her taunt belly with delight. She unconsciously summoned stoned pony golems to massage other part of her body that she could not reach. She smiled in content as she can now could do whatever she want. Have any food she wanted and how big she wanted. Not worrying about the space. Have golems to do daily tasks for her. Not having to lift a hoof to do a single task if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is life. I would be gluttony's wife,\" Zecora rubbed her belly as she observed how big it gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being full, she have the power to make herself hungry immediately and eat more. It would increase her weight rapidly. Does she want to? Would her mind be consumed to only eat?</span></div></div>",

She bet the world could not handle her weight if she grow too big. She just relax and eat to her heart's content while letting the golems to do all the work. Not having to move so much would further accelerate her weight growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time Zecora learnt some new tricks. If she wanted to have a conversation with somepony without having her mouth being muffled, she would create food directly in her stomach. She would still feel full while having a nice chat. The only downside to this that she wouldn't be able to taste the food. She would only use in dire situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother she could summon any rare ingredients. She does not have to worry if she lose or wasted it. She can try to make potions with rare ingredients without worry. She has no worries in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXCEPT for space. She have to worry in a few decades if she outgrew Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom chipped her tooth after tripping over a tree root. She would be in so much trouble if somepony in her family find out. Luckily, she remembered that Zecora may have a potion that can fix her chipped tooth. Applebloom went straight to Zecora's hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom was exhausted after climbing many flight of stairs down to the bottom floor. It seems that every time Zecora grow bigger, more stairs were added to compensate for her height. When she reached to the bottom, Applebloom couldn't help but gasped what she saw. Applebloom didn't have a chance to see Zecora after the Discord Incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom couldn't see Zecora's head as it was so high up. Applebloom can hear a rhythmic sound of chewing and gulping coming from Zecora. Each gulp she heard, Applebloom saw Zecora's belly slightly wobble. If you stared closely at it, you can see that Zecora's belly were growing bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecora! I need your help!\" Applebloom tried to get the attention from Zecora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora didn't notice anything and kept on eating. Applebloom's yelling was not loud enough to hear over the sound of munching. Applebloom looked around and found a megaphone. She picked up the megaphone and yelled again, \"Applebloom here need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound stopped. Zecora rolled her whole body around and laid on her back. Zecora's head is now on ground level so she can communicate with Applebloom without having to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was in the middle of a meal. What is the problem you want to deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom explained her chipped tooth and Zecora fixed it with a potion. Applebloom asked if she can brew a potion for a cutie mark. Zecora explained that there was no such potion for it. Applebloom saw a flower with a rooster. Zecora explained the special ingredient called the Heart's Desire and help to make the rooster crow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora rolled back up and continue eating. Applebloom yelled at Zecora again but Zecora was preoccupied with filling her stomach. It was the perfect time for her to steal the flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The next day</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rushed to Zecora's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack picked up the megaphone, \"Applebloom gawt thuh cutie pox! We need a cure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora turned over herself again, \"To cure that problem, you need to speak the truth to bloom the Seeds of Truth. It is strange when she was her yesterday, she chipped a tooth. She must have taken the ingredients in a grab. I thought I lost it in my flab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora gave Applejack the seed. Applejack went straight back to Applebloom and planted the seed. Applebloom spoke the truth and the flower bloom. She digest the flower to cure her ailment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom walked back to Zecora and apologised for stealing the flower. Zecora just chuckled as she accepted the apology. It wasn't the first time she lost something. She thought it ended up somewhere in her love handles and was a lost cause.</span></div></div>",

All you can do is to shake me as a jelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Spike became a 50-foot dragon, Zecora is a lot bigger than she was previously before. Her recent diet have exploded her weight. In a couple of months since the cutie pox, Zecora doubled her weight. Zecora was more than 10 times bigger than Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was equivalent to a 40 story building that can take up more than two city blocks. Ponies described her as a mountain of quivering flesh.  She used the teleportation device and her Inspiration Manifestation Book to appeared on top of Spike suddenly and slammed him to the ground. She watched her belly kept shaking until it stopped showing signs that Spike stopped resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike, I fought against bigger dragons in the battle of eating. You can't beat me even in cheating,\" Zecora smirked as Spike fainted from under her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora rolled off him and saw Spike got flatten into the ground. The signs of twitching shown her that he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you find the way to get him back to small. I don't want to keep flattening him like a wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>AU to Magic Duel</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me you land whale!

The sooner you can take it off, the sooner you can take-off,\" Zecora continued to lie on Trixie until she gave up the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe make sure to roll off once in a while for Trixie to breath. She doesn't want her to suffocate to death. It has been months since the giant Spike incident. Obviously, Zecora had grown a lot since than.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, it always seems that you always gained a lot more every time something major needed you,\" Twilight commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true what Twilight had just said. Zecora now took up three city blocks and as high as a 60 story building. To be able to communicate with Zecora, you either had to fly up to her head or shout really loudly in a megaphone. The shield that Trixie created couldn't withstand the weight of Zecora and broke upon impact. Fortunately, no ponies else were hurt in the body slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Zecora's new size not only flattened Trixie, she also flattened surrounding buildings around her. Her massive flab didn't felt the debris lodged in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this is not going to be a habit, Twilight. My body is more destructive than a dynamite,\" Zecora does not like being away from eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gave up the amulet and gave it to Zecora. Trixie apologised to Twilight and canters away from Ponyville. Zecora used the Inspiration Manifestation Book to fix all the buildings that she had squashed just in time for the Princess Celestia's visit with delegates from Saddle Arabia.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d put ALL of his Ponymon trading cards on the line in the ultimate match of HorseBattle 3\u2026 and after seven long, stressful rounds, he finally emerged the victor! Nothing could compare to the feeling of walking out of that sleepover with his winnings - three dozen new trading cards - tucked away in his saddlebag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one problem keeping him from feeling too proud of the events. You see, when he was \u2018in the zone\u2019 during a game, he tended to snack a lot to keep his stress down. So, during their \u2018tournament\u2019, Button Mash had been chowing down on a big plate of cookies his friend\u2019s mom had made them\u2026 only to look down afterwards and realize he\u2019d cleared out the entire plate! He\u2019d somehow packed every single cookie away in his gut without even noticing, leaving him feeling all nauseous and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d never felt quite so stuffed. He could feel the contents of his tummy shifting and sloshing about as that big round fluffy gut swayed beneath him, wobbling all around with every belabored step he took, leaving him huffing and puffin. Sure, it wasn\u2019t even close to the biggest gut he\u2019s seen on a pony\u2026 but he definitely wasn\u2019t used to being this stuffed! The worst part was, he knew that all those cookies were going to be killer on his weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did his best to remain hidden and out-of-sight as he walked towards his home, praying not to be seen. After all, he was reaching that age where he was always trying to impress fillies and mares, always trying to seem cool and impressive; being all stuffed and round like this would have the opposite effect! He shuddered, imagining the humiliation he\u2019d endure if a group of girls saw him like this and just started laughing at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed like his nightmare might just come true! Just as he was slinking out of some alleyway on the way home\u2026 he accidentally bumped right into the side of some mare! His belly let out a loud slosh as it got shaken around with the force of him getting knocked back onto his butt, dazed! \u201cOh! Sorry about that-\u201d The orange-furred mare was about to apologize\u2026 only to turn, and get a big, surprised grin at the sight of his belly! \u201cOh. My Celestia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks immediately flushed red, expecting the mare to start laughing at him any second now! Instead, though\u2026 she seemed delighted! \u201cYou are SO CUTE!\u201d She cooed. \u201cHow did you get so stuffed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, surprised by her reaction. He hardly even knew what to say! \u201cUmmm\u2026 I ate too many cookies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, seeming to fawn over him. \u201cOh my goodness, that is just adorable!!\u201d She nodded, before turning around and glancing over her shoulder. \u201cHey, Fern! Check out this colt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock, another mare walked curiously up to him in response to the orange-furred mare\u2019s call\u2026 only for her to get that same delighted look on her face! \u201cOooh my! He\u2019s absolutely adorable!\u201d They both giggled to eachother, lost in the cuteness of his tubby belly and flustered expression. \u201cHis belly\u2019s so big and soft! It\u2019s sooo cute!\u201d His blush deepened, surprised by this development! Did these mares really\u2026 like his belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, the orange-furred one leans in. \u201cMind if we feel that tummy, little guy?\u201d He was still shocked by all this\u2026 yet, nonetheless, he nodded. Immediately, both of the mares forehooves started to press against his tummy, cooing as they explored just how soft and squishy its fluffy surface was. Button Mash couldn\u2019t help but melt into their touch, enjoying the tummy rubs as it helps him digest their food. He gets a little embarrassed when their rubs make him let out a big belch, but they don\u2019t seem the mind, only giggling. \u201cGosh! It\u2019s so big and soft! You\u2019re like a big squishy teddy bear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Button Mash had gone from feeling embarrassed, to feeling weirdly proud! He felt like a total ladie\u2019s man, having these two mares fawning over him, even if they just thought that he was cute. Eventually, though, he was knocked from his trance when one of the mares leaned forward\u2026 and blew a big raspberry playfully on his belly, making him giggle and laughed at the ticklishness! \u201cHehe! Sorry, cutie pie, I couldn\u2019t resist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton Mash just laid back for a few minutes and enjoyed having his big stuffed belly rubbed and doted on by the giggling, delighted mares for a while\u2026 but eventually, sadly, they had to part ways. \u201cThanks for letting us rub your belly, cutie pie! It was suuuper cute and squishy!\u201d The mares left him with one last, big group hug! \u201cNever let anypony make you feel ashamed of gaining weight or anything! It\u2019s really just precious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they were on their way\u2026 leaving Button Mash feeling better than ever! He now strut through the streets of Ponyville proudly, showing off his belly and letting it slosh as it swayed beneath him like a hammock! Even now, he notices mares whispering to eachother and giggling about how cute he is as he passes by. He felt like the king! He had no idea that mares thought pudginess was so adorable, but if it gets him more attention (and belly rubs) from them, it sounds good to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact\u2026 if he gets a little pudgier, he can have a belly like this all the time. And then, he was sure he\u2019d be the most adorable thing in town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he gets home, he finds his mom...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh...breakfast time, Apples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo long ago was it since that phrase was something that lit up the Sweet Apple Acre's house upon speaking, once a warm, welcoming embrace to the sun rising on a new day. Nowadays, it felt cold and sterile in Applejack's lungs with every utterance that came to pass, having turned to a taunting motto of the world they now resided in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom was gone, probably somewhere off with her friends; bless her soul, she would be spared another day. Applejack was more than glad to stand in her stead, <i>anything</i> to give her sister an occasional whim of freedom, but she still felt a knot travel down her throat as she gave a nervous gulp, eyes jittering in fear as she stared up at the ceiling, ears swiveled and ready to dart towards the telltale sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just as she'd set the last plate down that it came, as though the owner had long been wide awake, counting through every clink on the table to make sure that every single plate in the house was laid. Truth be told, Applejack almost doubted that every plate in the kitchen would even be enough, even when every single one was piled up with enough food to pop a pony's buttons with thanksgiving dinner, and the red tablecloths was almost totally concealed as the plates came close to overflowing over the edges, such little room left that it looked like one would fall enough with enough of a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that Applejack came to fear would happen when a great weight from above planted itself on the floor, with any of the walls below creaking under the strain. It came again, transforming into a set of footsteps that creaked every single floorboard in the house, not just the ones for his room maneuvering towards the steps leading to the family room. Applejack wilted as she saw something red stomp down on the topmost step, and she stepped back behind the table, lest she get in the way, should he charge upon seeing. She forced a smile as a great, wide wall of denim pushed its way against the jagged edges of the doorframe, or what <i>remained</i> of the doorframe, the edges long ago having been torn a few extra feet wider. It was the same every morning, the hole widening out just a little bit more with every trip Big Mac made to breakfast, and this time around, his head took some of it apart as he rammed his gigantic body right through the \"meager\" opening, the warm smile never flinching from his lips from the familiar scent of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every meal, less and less did Big Macintosh seem like Applejack's gentle giant of an older brother and more like some demon of gluttony that had taken him as its vessel, his face but a caricature of his former self as it sat upon such a wide, paunch-rounred head. Standing in at nine feet tall, there didn't have to be a contest to tell that he was the absolute biggest pony in all of Ponyville, even if it weren't already for the fact that he was several feet wider than the very table he was licking his lips at, the shapely mass of his body dominated by that of his stomach. Covered in a giant set of overalls that only a fashion genius' mastermind could fathom, it posessed a robust orb in shape by the oversized amount of fat and muscle packed inside, devoid of any rolls or cellulite as it staunchly laid upon a wide expanse of floor in front of his hooves, even when he was standing at full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Mornin', Big Mac!\" Applejack uttered in the vain hope that he would respond, that he'd acknowledge her, anything to remind her that he knew she was family, but all he gave was a flick of the air as he trudged over to the table. Really, it was a long time since he'd spoken anything aside from demands for more, never showing any emotion aside from sheer want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no chairs left in the house to fit his gigantic behind, he sat right on the floor, the front of his belly wedged against the lip of the table. He wasted no time reaching in, not letting his own midsection act as a barrier as he grabbed for anything edible before him and brought it to his eagerly awaiting mouth. He bit straight into trays of apple cobbler without use of a fork or knife, and hollowed it out in a matter of three large bites before licking the glass clean. The same went for a pile of hay bacon fashioned from four entire packs all fried together, with Applejack watching the twenty bits worth of hay-meat vanish from existence, all being sucked into the black hole that was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was for the next plate. And the one after, and the one after that, all the same. Just eat, and eat, and eat, never satisfied, with no restraint...</span></div></div>",

There were still traces of her brothers calm and gentile nature to it, but a commanding tone filled his single word to the point of making them non-existent. It put applejack in mind of Luna's 'Royal Canterlot Voice', but even the RCV was more declarations and statements than orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" Big Mac bellowed again and Applejack hopped to to bring over more food. She tried to grab the biggest first, a pair of large and heavily frosted apple cakes and set them before her mountain of a brother. It wasn't so much she expected those to be enough these days, but they'd buy her the time to grab the rest from the counters around the kitchen and move the empty plates off the table. With every plate used she had to resort to pans and pots and any other item that could be used to serve food. Had Rarity been there she might have stood aghast at using cookware for serving but that was only if she could get over the sight of Big Mac stuffing his face into the cakes and consuming every last gob of dough and frosting he was able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack stood back, hesitantly fingering something in her pocket as she held the last food item, a dish of apple cobbler. She knew this couldn't go on and the other day, when she'd had time, she'd gone to seek Twilight for help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take it anymore,\" Applejack muttered as she paced the crystal floors of Twilight's library, nervously rolling her hat brim in her hands, \"I thought it might just be a phase at first, like another growth spurt. Granny always told me Big Mac ate like a dozen ponies when he was growing up, but it was always 'up' and not 'out'. Now... it's like I'm watching him become a landmass right in front of me. I don't know what to do Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lavender alicorn sat nearby, book in hand, dressed in blue shirt and purple skirt. Despite being a princess Twilight was never one for such formal wear (regardless of Rarity's eagerness to design for it) and insisted on keeping it simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight mulled over the situation as she set her current book aside before her horn lit drawing another couple to her off the nearby shelves.\"Well if it really is just his body growing then there's little I can actually do Applejack. Messing with your brothers biology could have lasting consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it's a spell or something?\" Applejack replied, tugging at her overalls nervously, \"Or an illness? What if he got into some Poison Joke and can't remember doing so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely,\" Twilight replied as she flipped through the hovering books, then amended, \"Not impossible mind you, but unlikely. Although...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Twilight went silent for a minute Applejack had to prompt her to continue. \"It's <i>my</i> brother,\" Twilight finally admitted, \"I mean, in my last letter with Cadance she said shining was putting on a few extra pounds these days. Maybe it's just a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it could be magically related?\" Applejack pressed, concern for her brother growing in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know yet. Still if it is we need more information. If it's more than Big Mac others might be effected too. I'll look around town over the next few days and ask if there's been anything unusual in this regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can whip up something that should stunt his apatite for a time,\" Twilight stated, \"But without knowing the cause of all this, if there even is one, there could be side effects. Nothing dangerous, but you have to be prepared for anything that might happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack held the small vile of green powder Twilight had given her. She just had to sprinkle a light dusting on Big Macs food and hopefully that would be enough. However as the vile began to pour over the cobbler, Applejack's hands, already bit slick with nervous sweat, dropped the whole thing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" Big Mac bellowed, having finished everything else. With no time to fish out the powder, Applejack handed over the pan and Big Mac gulped it down eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The powder does nothing, big Mac is <i>still</i> hungry and forces his way out into the orchard to consume the fresh apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The powder seems to work and Big Mac seems satiated for now, but soon his belly begins to give an ominous rumble as the side effects kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Something else unusual happens.</span></div></div>",

Big Mac tasted little more than parsley as his teeth and tongue completely eradicated the entire tray of cobbler in but a few seconds, only left as disappointed as before when he tossed the emptied glass dish over his back, smashing it against the wall. \"MORE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, any deluded remain of hope Applejack might have been clinging onto was crushed into a fine dust, blowing away to give way for a tidal wave of absolute dread that washed its way into her chest. Not only was her smartest and most connected friend's only word of help totally useless against his hunger, but she was alone with an unstoppable eating machine in a house that was stark clean of anything edible, lest he was so wrought with hunger that biting right into the table sounded tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac, we're...we're out of food.\" Applejack looked down so her hat covered her face, having finally reached the moment that she was terrified of reaching for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, though, Big Mac sanity hadn't seemed to have dwindled<i> that</i> much, and Applejack let out a small trace of the breath she'd been holding as he only stared down at all the plates, trays, and cookware that were all licked clean, a totally blank expression along his face. She sucked in even more air, though, when he dazedly turned his head to the double doors leading outside, a lethargic smile reaching across his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Big Mac, no!\" Applejack begged as he rose up from the floor, the table getting knocked over by his stomach as he turned around, the loud crashes of several plates and glass articles smashing along the floor briefly rendering Applejack deaf. The excessive weight that hardened his already distended belly reduced his walk into an awkward waddle, but Big Mac's determination wasn't challenged in the slightest as he pushed himself right up against the entire doorway's wall, knowing full well how useless opening them would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was broken out of her shock when all the wall around the doorway was torn right of of the nails and pipes holding them all together, an enormous crater having been dug into the side of their house as Big Mac marched on towards the apple trees, seemingly oblivious to what he'd just done. Applejack had no idea what to stare at first, mouth agape as her eyes darted between the smashed plates, the hole, and Big Mac, switching between them over and over again, but caught herself and ran after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG MAC! <i><b>STOP!!!</b></i>\" She screamed at the top of her lungs, leaping and grabbing onto his tail, but she couldn't even tell if it was intentional when he gave it a flick that threw her over to the side, her back slamming into the trunk of an apple tree. She groaned in pain, massaging what she could tell was going to be a nasty bruise as she got back her footing, but didn't bother to chase as he looked back at her brother navigating down through the acres of their land. Without a word, she turned the other way and ran as fast as she could back towards the barn, willing to drag Twilight back to the house if she was busy fighting some new monster, if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Big Mac, his mind was hammered upon by the scent of fruit that was starting to surround him. That of vitamins. Calories. <i>Food,</i> food for as many miles as a pony's eyes could see. Not wanting to waste any more time that'd let his stomach empty out some more, he reached out and grabbed the thick end to the branch of a nearby tree, pulling it down so the apples were right within biting distance. Of course, to pluck and eat the apples one would've just been using a breath mint to treat the rate of his hunger, so he opened his mouth wide and bit down on a sizable portion of the branch, the apples getting sucked clean off as he pulled it away. For all the apple cobbler and pie he'd gone through at breakfast, the taste of the apples in their pure form was an explosion of delight on his taste buds, and even the leaves gave it a musky flavor that accentuated the quite nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with his hunger, it made him all the more quick to draw off more of the branch, and he took another bite, leaving a noticeable amount of the foot at the tree's leaves totally bare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun glared down on Mac's shoulders as the day reached the dead of noon, timed perfectly as he finished off the last of a tree standing right in the midpoint of the farm's acres. From up above, a long line was visible in the green of the trees from those that was stripped totally bare and dead of all their nutrients, all  to become one with Big Mac's ever-growing mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell he was taking less effort to reach the higher portions of the trees, probably by an extra two feet of height since he'd wandered into the orchard, but then he wasn't gnawed upon by his endless need for food, he felt his massive arms being pushed higher up as his backside became even more vast, his stomach having enlarged to obscure more of his expansive frame, a few extra feet of volume bloating out to fight against the super-elasticity of the overalls he wore. The shirt underneath'd ridden up enough for the red fur underneath to be visible, the straps digging deep into the two mounts of his chest, but all of those were but mere details in the back of his mind, his top (and only) priority of the past month having never changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many trees remained ahead to feast on, with even more at either side, or even behind, but hat didn't waylay him in the least. At the very least, he saw it as a challenge, something the growing rumbling of his stomach was more then excited to see him pursue...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, a few trees down, he could see one with a bottom branch that hung a little lower than the others, weighed down by some round, shapely mass on top that was shadowed by the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, if only a little, Big Mac's hunger was pushed aside by the anger that somepony, a <i>trespasser</i>, had gone to the effort to loiter their way onto his property and eat the apples that <i>he</i> had worked so hard on to grow himself and rightfully eat, and he slowly stomped to turn himself around with a little more force than usual, a few more apples falling from the trees than before as he trudged over to the intruder. When he heard their chewing go on uninterrupted when he was staring right down at the tree, he rose a hoof a few feet off the ground before thrusting it back down with all his might, sending both the pony and every apple within a block's radius falling from their trees, even shaking a few branches loose from their roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and when Thunderlane still kept on eating, ignoring his rotund body's blubber rippling from the impact, Big Mac let out a rough growl, eyes narrowing on his fellow corpulent stallion. It looked like the formerly slim and scrawny Pegasus had gone days, perhaps <i>weeks</i> being so similarly engrossed with food that he looked like he hadn't bothered changing his clothes for quite a while, as evidenced by a pathetically tiny t-shirt clinging only partway around cumbersome moobs that sat sprawled over a gray, yoga ball-sized belly that bulged out totally naked on his lap, now sporting a set of weighty buttocks that left him without a chair for a good 'll away that wouldn't't get flattened right undearneath him. Probably why he was here and not at home, Big Mac surmised, because there wasn't place left at home to sit and eat. Big Mac could've sworn he was a little bit taller, too, hard to gauge from his viewpoint, but he could sense with a little squinting that there was an extra head or so of freight since they'd last met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahem?</i>\" Big Mac coughed loudly, fists resting on his large hips, but Thunderlane only gave a flick of the ear. \"<i>AHEM?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Finally, Thunderlane cracked his eyes open to recognize the red battleship of a pony standing before him and squeaked in fear, scooting backwards and wedding the free between his shoulders. He gulped down the last hunk of Apple in his mouth and breathed loudly, grinning sheepishly in the spotlight of the enraged behemoth. \"Uh...hey there, Big  Mac...\"</span></div></div>",

Not due to any lack of hunger, if anything it was insistent he continue, but he had to pause momentarily due to a pain in his hooves. Big Mac couldn't see them so he was unaware of what was happening, but if anyone had been able to peer under his boulder sized gut which nearly hung to the ground, they would have been able to see his hooves crack and split, dividing into three pieces. There was no blood though as this was not some effect of his vast tonnage breaking parts of his own body. Instead the pieces separated and pushed out, the hard keratin changing from pieces of his hooves to actual claws adorning toes on a spreading foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac knew none of this though, he just knew his appendages ached too much to walk for the moment, but as it passed he continued on to the tree and bent a branch to his face to continue eating. However, this time rather than let the branch slide from his mouth, devoid of leaves and apples alike, Big Mac simply bit harder and broke off the entire branch in his mouth. The bark was dry and the wood chewy, but in the end it was just more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother branch followed, the stallion unaware that with every bite his teeth changed to better pulp the wood he consumed, two of his teeth in his lower jaw began to grow, pushing up on either side of his muzzle as they protruded from his lips even when his mouth was closed. A pair of tiny 'tusks' beginning to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Big Mac finished the tree it was virtually stripped down to the trunk. He did try to eat it, but it was too big around to get his jaw around and his insistent hunger demanded more food. So with some reluctance Big Mac moved on to the next tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about an hour later when Applejack and Twilight arrived at the same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Horseapples!\" Applejack exclaimed, \"Look what he's done to our trees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting serious Applejack,\" Twilight replied, \"Big Mac is getting out of control. And if what I've seen in town is any indication he might just be the first. No other stallion has it this bad but there's definitely some with similar characteristics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad it has hit the foals yet,\" Applejack muttered though that was some small consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight just nodded, \"I've already written to Celestia, Hopefully she can send help, but with the Royal guard being  seventy-eight percent stallions they might not be much help. Especially considering....\" Twilight pointed down at the tracks showing the change from Big Macs deep hoofprints to the clawed toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Celestia!\" Applejack gaped, \"What in tarnation is happening to my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Twilight replied, \"I've never read about anything like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we going to do?\" Applejack looked about ready to suffer a breakdown with a combination of desperation and fear for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can get close to Big mac I'll hit him with a sleep spell,\" Twilight stated, \"We can hopefully keep him under until we find an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Hopefully'?\" Applejack echoed, questioning the doubt she'd heard in Twilight's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell is designed to work on ponies, but these tracks, those bite marks on the tree... I hate to say it Applejack, but your brother might not be entirely equine enough for it to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack bit her lip, nervous. Still they had to try as the pair pushed on, following the trail of consumed trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: They find Big Mac even more transformed and bigger, eating whole trees now. Twilight attempts the spell but it doesn't work, causing the giant of a fat stallion too change even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Same as 1 but the spell does work and Big Mac falls asleep for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3.

Noticing Applejack's face go slack with terror, she reluctantly turned her head around at a tree that stood along one of the untouched rows near Big Mac's path, one that was wriggling its way out of the ground, seemingly on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi?\" Applejack peeped quietly. \"What's goin' on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last invisible tug, the tree's roots were torn loose of the ground, little clumps of dirt clinging to its tendrils as it floated inwards towards the heart of the orchard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow it!\" Twilight declared before running off in the same direction. Applejack didn't initially register her command, lost in questioning reality for a few moments before she snapped and gave chase, as well. Between the other trees in the orchard, the two could see more being pried at by auraless magic, being torn up from their spots to fly down towards the same source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...It can't be <i>Big Mac</i> doin' this, can it?!\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I highly doubt it, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't ask Applejack why she was slowing down before the entire side of her body'd rammed itself deep into something large, warm, and firm enough that it'd sprung her back several feet, throwing her face-down into the dirt. Spitting up a few bits of grass, she pushed herself up and craned her head to see Applejack's hooves right in front of her, and she trailed her eyes up to see her expression, that of a hypnotized mix of absolute fear, shock, and catatonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack?\" Twilight asked, looking backwards to follow her friend's gaze. \"What's going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was sitting there to show off, taunting them, Twilight's eyes were smacked by a massive field of red that sat along the front of a absolute mountain of red that towered over all the trees it sat wedged between, their trunks creaking under stress as the levitating flora were drawn somewhere at its very peak. She stood up, taking Applejack's side and perfectly matching her gobsmacked expression as the two stepped backwards in complete harmony, only faltering when they both recognized an orange mane that seemed so puny compared to the body it sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac's legs seemed painfully spread apart to make room for his stomach, now a spheric bulge of red so tightly packed with food and blubber that it was larger than Ponyville's town hall as its weight hung on top of the trees on the very edge of four rows that were dissected on his walk. With the torn tattered of his work shirt dangling along the large bags of his chest like a dirty necklace, all of Big Mac's fur was totally exposed, noticeably longer and scruffier than an average pony's coat would be. That came as the slimmest relief to Applejack, having smoothed out some of the details of her brother's body as she watched him sit naked whilst out in the open, but her mind was reeling far more in the fact that, while three times as big as he'd been this morning, something about him beyond his behavior and size was changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being overtaken by a pair of overfed cheeks and a huge triple chin that sat on a huger triple neck, her heart went cold as she made out his face. The shape of his head still seemed the same, but whenever he opened his mouth to bite down on one of the trees that'd float into his mitts, she could see a sharp row of teeth that were each guarded by a thick pair of tusks that pointed out from the cricks of his mouth, effortlessly slicing apart the thick, toughened wood of the apple trees they'd grown. But worst of all, the thing that <i>really</i> glued Applejack to the grass in fear, of course, were his eyes. His pupils had been thinned into slits, something that reminded her of Nightmare Moon's, or a bat pony's, yet something about them seemed more...gleeful. He wasn't just eating out of a relentless hunger, but some kind of sadistic urge that sought enjoyment from him tearing something apart so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't let herself get overtaken as much, and charged up her horn. \"Stand back, Applejack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill reeling, Applejack didn't fight Twilight as she charged up a spell and shot it right into Big Macintosh's stomach. He continued to ignore the two as a constant stream of magic was pumped right into him, but it was when the spell was caught up that his face was seized up, pupils constricted in surprise. The two mares waited around, watching as his eyes clenched in pain, hands grabbed at his middle as he slowly got to is feet, his stomach still laying upon the ground even when he was standing nice and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Twi, what's happening?!\" Applejack whispered, noticing quickly that Big Mac wasn't falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" Twilight hissed, holding an arm up in front of her. \"Just wait!\"</span></div></div>",

The rumbling behemoth that was Big Mac moaned and growled as his stomach rumbled like a distant rock-slide. And then, ever so slowly, but picking up speed little by little, Big macs stomach began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? It's working,\u201d Twilight smiled. However her glee was short-lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac groaned as he shuffled on the spot, his legs cramping terribly. He couldn't see what was happening but Twilight and Applejack could as his right leg began to shift, claws receded as toes plumped up. Soft pads grew under his appendage as it changed into a paw. The fur all along his leg also began to change color, turning golden with large irregular black spots appearing all along it up to his hip. His left leg meanwhile remained the same shape, but the fur was falling out to be replaced by the same colored red scales <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in Tartarus!?\u201d Applejack exclaimed in shock, \u201cTwilight what did you do to my brother!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don't know,\u201d Twilight stammered, \u201cThis shouldn't be happening...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mac shifted in place his backside briefly visible as Twilight saw his tail pushing out, growing long and ropy with a tuft of tan-ish fur sprouting from the end. The changes progressed up his back which seemed to be elongating a bit as his middle shrank a bit with the mass being used to fuel the growth. A pair of wings sprouted from behind his shoulders. The left one a dark blue like Luna's Night Guards and the right green, insect-like, and full of holes. A changelings wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight I'm telling you to stop this!\u201d Applejack was almost hysterical, \u201cYou have to have some spell that can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApplejack I've never seen anything like this,\u201d Twilight countered, barely able to take her eyes off the towering, near one hundred foot tall figure of Big Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis arms stiffened as they changed next. The right one shifted colors to white with stripes, that might have been a zebras, only the stripes were red instead of black. The left meanwhile darkened almost completely to black but still had a faint red shine if the light his the fur just right and the hand shifted to that of a panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well isn't this quite the sight.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBoth girls turned as Big Mac's head bean to rise, neck elongating in jerking spurts, to see the figure of Discord dangling off a cotton candy cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiscord!\u201d Applejack snarled, \u201cThis is your doing isn't it? Change my brother back now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really Applejack,\u201d Discord yawned, \u201cSurely even you know what they say about assuming, don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if this isn't because of you then what the heck is going on!\u201d Twilight replied, glancing back at Big Mac as a pair of horns sprouted from his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left one pointed back in a strange faintly corkscrew shape while the right curved gracefully back in one long curl with ribs on the outer edge. Twilight, well read as she was, recognized them as Addax and Ibex horns respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that will take some explanation,\u201d Discord mused, here, let me give us a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mismatched being snapped his fingers and the world seemed to shift into a state of gray, colors were muted and there was no sound. Even Big Mac seemed motionless at present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d Discord snapped his fingers and a pair of chairs and a chalkboard appeared, \u201cSit down both of you and I'll try to explain this as simply as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack grumbled a bit but Twilight actually looked eager as she took a seat. Discord paced back and forth a couple times as he tried to find the right words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt either of you knew this,\u201d he stated finally, \u201cBut I am the last of my species. Yes, there are no other draconequuie in the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean until now when you changed my brother,\u201d Applejack snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Applejack what did I say about assuming?\u201d Discord smiled, \u201cI didn't do this. The universe did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Applejack retorted in disbelief, \u201cYou mean the wold just decided to turn my brother into a draconequus for no durn good reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just told you the reason,\u201d Discord smiled, \u201cI'm the only one left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Applejack's blank look Discord turned to Twilight, \u201cSurely Celestia's faithful student here knows what happens when an equation is imbalanced right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in math any equation can't be solved unless both sides of an equals sign are balanced out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Discord noted drawing on the chalkboard with his tail (in rainbow colored chalk interestingly enough), \u201cYou may scoff Applejack, but my kind plays a very important roll in the universe. We are the forces of change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord had drawn several stick-figure versions of himself on the board doing various things (all animated simply of course). Making flowers grow, digging a gorge, erupting a volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think Celestia's perfect harmony is ideal, but if true order imposed itself on reality there would be no creativity, no change, no development. Without adversity nothing grows. Why would any of you have become friends if not for the incident with Nightmare Moon bringing you together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you saying you caused that?\u201d Applejack countered with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d Discord replied, \u201cIf you recall I was completely stoned at the time. And not the good kind of stoned either. My point is that a little chaos and unpredictability is a good thing. And until now I've been the only one in this whole universe really pushing it along. So now it seems the universe has begun to seek balance again and is helping to restore my species. Big mac just looks to be the first. More might come along. Though whether that's tomorrow or a thousand years from now I can't say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean Big Mac has chaos powers too now?\u201d Twilight asked looking a bit fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord looked at the towering figure in consideration, \u201cUnlikely. I wouldn't say no for certain. I was born in the very decline of my species, so I have the power to make lots of changes. The powers of total chaos you see. If my species is coming back Big Mac's powers might be more limited, able to only effect himself or a few close friends or maybe just food. I couldn't say. He certainly seems to have developed an affinity for food. And size. So it's possible his powers may revolve around that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is a <i>chance</i> at least he might have your full chaos powers?\u201d Twilight asked, torn between worried and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly, but we'll see here in a minute, provided he's coherent yet. All the changes he's gone through have been a shock to his system. Hopefully he should snap out of it shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord snapped his fingers and once again the color returned to the world, just as Big Macs tusks gave a sudden surge and sprouted up from his lower lip to be level with the tip of his longer nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were finished as Big mac now stood at a hundred and twenty feet tall, a bloated portly draconequus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Big Mac tasted little more than a bit too much parsley upon erasing the cobbler from existence in three big bites, its flavor disappearing just as quick as the satisfaction it brought him. He opened his mouth to bellow another command, Applejack's shoulders tensing up as she braced herself to hear that fateful word once again, but he only gave have of an 'm' when his stoic expression was rippled with surprise, a hand touching his stomach on instinct at a sudden warmth swelling up deep within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, it seemed as though the cavernous emptiness that was gnawing inside of him had materialized into a massive thanksgiving feast that was still nice and warm, eyes rolling back into their sockets as his head sank back down into the fat of his own neck, a wobbly smile cracking his lips that was partly squished within his cheeks. Applejack watched his brother drift off into that bubbly state in a mix of doubt and amazement, astonished to see him actually<i> stay </i>there, seconds going by where he didn't scream his new favorite word at her, then let herself take what felt like the first deep breath she let had in almost an hour, if not a week. True, a part of her may have still been listening to Murphy's law, begging her not to fall into the tranquility of the scene, to take the chance and run before some corner of tartarus waiting beneath their house opened up and pulled them all under, but she only wanted to cherish the present for as long as she could. For now, as brief a moment it might be, her nightmare had come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrief, sadly, was all it was meant to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calm was rippled by a deep, bassy sound, one that she could only guess what its source was. Both of them looked to his enormous middle; it didn't quite sound like the traditional growl for when his overworked stomach was breaking down its endless fills, but a croak mixed between that of a frog's and the skin of a balloon being stretched. A squint of discomfort tightened along Big Mac's face, hand stroking against one of the rolls hanging at his middle's side. Applejack steeled herself, expecting just a little errant of gas, but then he bared his teeth as a groan of genuine <i>pain</i> scratched out from his throat, his hands clamping around the sides of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac? Big Mac, what's wrong?!\" Applejack came to his side in worry, tenderly taking his arm, but she snapped back in fear when he thrust it back down on his knee, hand knotted into a fist, but the action alone wasn't what startled her. He uncurled his fingers, revealing to her that the tips were stretching out into stiff, claw-like points, and the fur on his arm was rapidly shedding off his arm like red snow, peeling away from a metallic layer of scales covering his skin. Her jaw hanging loose enough for her teeth to start going dry, Applejack glanced up at Big Mac's head, the fur shaving itself away from his face and neck as well, but his mouth and muzzle were stretching in unison to form a more pointed snout, his gritted teeth sharpening out into clean points. A pair of black horns sprouted out through his mane from the top of his head that pointed backwards, a pair of webbed fins unfurling from along the edges of his jawline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hooves split apart into reptilian talons that dug into the wooden floor, giving him all the grip he needed to straighten out and haul his indomitable size up. To add injury to even <i>more</i> injury, Big Mac was getting even bigger, his bones stretching to gradually add an extra few feet to his height. He shivered slightly, feeling a tear rip along the crotch of his overalls that let him feel his stomach's underside as it spread along more of the floor, amassing into even more of a gigantic, scaly ball, a wide strip of black armor running up along its surface from his tail to his very chin. A shredding noise tore all around his body as the muscles and lardy tissue in his arms and thighs became to massive for his clothes to conceal, leaving him almost totally naked, save for what would've been a comically large set of apple-decorated boxer shorts that stretched around his mammoth legs almost magically, one of the many foresights courtesy of Rarity in all her cooperation to keep Big Mac clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hunched forward, having to fight against the size of his middle as the pain tingled along two points on his back. Having backed up against the wall quite some time into his tranformation, Applejack could feel her breakfast try and fight its way back up from her stomach as two bony appendages rose from his shoulders blades in the form of hand-like digits. There didn't stay skinny for long, quick to leech off their mountainous owner's adipose and swaddle themselves in thick paddings of blubber, but the fingers stretched thinner and thinner, a thin webbing of black membrane fusing them together in a draconic set of wings. A wooden <i>crash</i> came from behind him as a wooden chair was crushed beneath a fatty tail springing out from over the crack of his colossal, its spine decorated by a black fin running all the way down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac barely registered his head bumping against the ceiling and setting cracks in the plaster, nor the front of his stomach impaling the wall with the dining table as it kept on growing outward, but as his rebirth eased towards its end, he could feel the painful shifting and stretching of his skeleton begin to subside, yet still felt a burning heat growing in what was once the demanding void that his belly once housed. When the folds and tips of his wings were both able to touch the floor and ceiling when relaxed, he could feel the last of his bones snap into their new homes inside of him, mind now only focus on a large flame fighting to force its way up is throat. He opened his jaws wide, the orange-maned dragon looking prepared to give his first roar of power to the world... only to belch up a large cloud of red flame, its hue so bright that it resembled energized neon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyelid shot open, pupils shrunken into slits that could pick up the tiniest of movements happening in the room. One in particular was a twitch of an eye nearby, and Big Mac craned his head to the side to see her sister gripping the wall with the backs of her arms and legs, shivering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac...</span></div></div>",

Terrible as it was she was certain he might just devour her then and there with no regard for who she was. Some part of her insisted she run or try to fight back when he came after her, crazy as that sounded in her own head, but her limbs simply refused to move as she stared at the mass that had been her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, whatever mind was in that newly reshaped skull of Big Mac's, either resisted the idea of an easy pony sized snack or recognized her enough to not try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That however did not apply to the rest of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible as it seemed Big Mac grabbed a whole cabinet off the wall and began shoving it, contents and all, into his mouth. The wood splintered, the dishes inside crunched and smashed, but the massive creature hardly seemed to care as bite after bite was forced down his bulging throat. More of the kitchen soon followed, the refrigerator was emptied first then devoured whole, the stove bent like taffy under the dragons powerful jaws. And all of it piled into his gut swelling it larger and larger from the sheer mass it contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Big mac cleared enough room to turn himself over and then tor through the doorway, ripping a gaping hole in the wall as the massive dragon rolled out onto the back lawn. He paused only to get to his clawed feet and then stomped towards the nearest apple tree, uprooted it, and munched it down from the tips of the branches to the root-ball underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was seeing one of her apple trees destroyed that finally galvanized Applejack enough to move. Though all she could do was shakily wobble to the hole in the wall and watch as the behemoth that was her brother waddle to the next tree and the next. And the next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack licked her dry lips as she fought to bring up the first words that came to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the Hay was in that stuff Twilight?\"</span></div></div>",

Dealing with her class size quickly quadrupling over the course of a year was difficult. Dealing with the new students from exotic lands, who had none of the respect for her that she\u2019s spent so long fostering in the Ponyville community, was difficult. But in the end, if she was able to brighten and enlighten her student\u2019s lives, she was happy. And besides, she had her ways of \u2018coping\u2019 with difficult times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee just couldn\u2019t help but stuff her face, even when she was at the head of her class. Whenever some disrespectful colt started talking back to her, she busted out a chocolate bar and starting chewing. Whenever parents rush in loudly blaming her because their foal isn\u2019t trying at all and thus is getting bad grades, she goes and binges on ice cream. She figures it\u2019s not that unhealthy of a response, when you really think about. Some people get depressed. Some people get angry. Cheerilee\u2026 just eats. Surely, that\u2019s not so bad, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026 to be honest, she has been putting on a worrying amount of weight over the last year. Nothing that bad, honest! It\u2019s just\u2026 her cheeks have been getting a little rounder, her legs a little thicker, her tummy a little squishier, her flanks a little jigglier. She\u2019s gone from being a sprightly young mare to having more of a\u2026 \u2018doughy\u2019 look. It certainly didn\u2019t earn her any extra favor with her new students. Many of them cracked jokes about her behind her back, especially saying that her flank won\u2019t be able to fit through doorways soon. At this rate, they may be right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit, she had a bit of a potbelly going on. When she walked, it swung back and forth beneath her slightly, and her rump jiggled just the slightest bit. Still, she keeps telling herself she\u2019s not fat, only plump! And while that may be true, she knows that this is but a taste of what\u2019s to come. If her job keeps stressing her out this much, there was no way she was going to lose all this weight any time soon, or even stop gaining. She shudders to imagine just how fat she might get if something doesn\u2019t give soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, her class is unruly. Yeah, what else is new? All these new students seemed to have no respect for her, and the problem only worsened as she gained weight. Worse still, she can\u2019t really punish any of them or their parents will come running, and their parents are almost more rude than their foals. Every time one of her students blows her off and disrespects her, it hurts. Every time one of her students makes fun of her behind her back, it hurts. But instead of getting upset, she reminds herself to take a snack from her desk drawer and try to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just foals, after all. They might not respect her now, but eventually, with hard work and dedication, she\u2019ll get through to them, and show them that learning can be fun and fulfilling. Enlightening her student\u2019s lives was her talent, after all. Her days weren\u2019t all bad; watching her brighter students make progress and excitedly learn new things was always heartwarming and exciting for her. Still, over the course of an average day\u2019s work, she probably packs away about 2,500 calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eight hour day, she still lingers around the school for about three hours or so to grade papers, counsel students, meet with parents and all that. That builds up her appetite for after hours, when she really lets loose. She likes to stop by sugar cube corner on her way home for a big, delicious pastry feast just to unwind after work. At home, she tends to binge on ice cream, chocolate, and other snacks just to keep her mind off her anxiety. At this point, she was probably eating over 5,000 calories a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s completely given up on keeping track of her weight. Just stepping on a scale fills her with anxiety. What\u2019s she supposed to do? Exercise? She worked over twelve hours a day! Where would she find the time for proper exercise? Portion control? She just didn\u2019t know of any other ways to cope with the stress. Eating made her feel better, and not eating made her feel worse, ergo, through sheer Pavlovian condition, she just can\u2019t help but eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem; the incredible amounts of snacks she burns through every day is killer on her budget. She\u2019s already being paid a pitiful amount, and worried percentage of that is going to food. If she wants to maintain her appetite, she\u2019ll have to find a way to avoid breaking her budget...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You remember all those snacks Cheerilee\u2019s been munching on over the day, right? Were you wondering how she got her hooves on all those? Well, believe it or not, they mostly seemed to come from her students! Back in the days, it was customary for some of them to leave an apple on her desk\u2026 but when she started gaining weight, they started leaving candy on her desk instead. Now, every student seems to bring some kind of treat or another, and Cheerilee has no idea where they\u2019re getting it all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she asked, they always came up with a new excuse, but at this point, Cheerilee was certain they were getting them from the same place. It was like her students had a vested interest in making sure she gains weight. Not that she didn\u2019t appreciate the extra treats, but she would like to know where they\u2019re getting all these snacks, and what exactly their motives are for feeding her. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to stare a gift horse in the mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression brightened when she walked into the Sugarcube Corner that afternoon, however, and noticed Rarity sitting at one of the booths! That fashionista was the caretaker of one of Cheerilee\u2019s original students, but nowadays she seemed to be travelling all across Equestria most of the town, dealing with her boutiques. It was a surprise to see her at the bakery. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cOh! Miss Rarity! Why, it\u2019s nice to see you around Ponyville\u2026\u201d</span> Cheerilee greeted as she took a seat on the stool next to Rarity\u2019s, her big rump squishing against her seat as the stool creaks beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looks up at her, a little confused for a moment. Cheerilee realizes that the mare\u2019s having trouble recognizing her! Has she really put on THAT much weight! Eventually, Rarity has a flash of cognisance in her eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAh! Cheerilee! Why, you\u2019re looking marvelous this afternoon!\u201d</span> Rarity complimented her, trying not to make the mare feel insecure about her weight. Cheerilee just felt patronized. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI\u2019ve seen the new schoolhouse they\u2019ve built! Ponyville\u2019s really making leaps, I\u2019d say. It\u2019s wonderful that our foals get access to such fine facilities.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee nodded. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cOf course! The deserve the very best,\u201d</span> she said, though there was something else one on her mind. Rarity went back to reading her newspaper, and Cheerilee wondered if it was really wise to bother her with this, but this question would probably drive her crazy otherwise. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cI just\u2026 had a question I\u2019ve been wondering regarding Sweetie Belle.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looks up. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDid she do something wrong?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cOh, no, no! Not at all! Quite the opposite, actually. At least, I think,\u201d</span> Cheerilee explained sheepishly. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cThis may sound a little silly, but... her and the other students have been bringing me snacks everyday. As in, a ton of snacks. And I was just wondering if you had any idea where they might be getting it all from...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity places a hoof on her chin, considering it. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhy, that is strange! I haven\u2019t the foggiest! Sweetie Belle doesn\u2019t even eat snacks, so she definitely hasn\u2019t been asking me for any...\u201d</span> They probably plopped about 20 bits worth of candy on her desk every single morning\u2026 which may not sound like a lot, but these foals don\u2019t have any income! They must be getting them from somewhere. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWould you like me to ask her about it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee wasn\u2019t about to waste anypony else\u2019s time with this silly business. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cOh, no! Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not really important. I\u2019m just curious,\u201d</span> she says. She resolves to get to the bottom of this on her own time. She didn\u2019t really know why she was so curious. Of course, the worst case scenario is that they\u2019re stealing all the candy\u2026 but she doubted her students would do something like this. There must be a more reasonable explanation\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mrs. Cake emerges from the back room balancing some exotic looking ice cream on her back. She places it gently in front of Rarity, who coos in excitement as she starts chowing down. Her table manners are much more refined than Cheerilee\u2019s, she notices. She has to work on that. Once that was settled, Mrs. Cake turns to Cheerilee. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAh, Mrs. Cheerilee! Good afternoon! Will you be having the usual?\u201d</span> She smiled. They\u2019d been through this countless times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee nodded, simply. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cYes, please. Thank you,\u201d</span> she said. She couldn\u2019t help but watch Mrs. Cake\u2019s rump jiggle slightly as the older mare walked back into the kitchen. Mrs. Cake seemed to be the only other pony in Ponyville that was as \u2018big\u2019 as Cheerilee\u2026 and at this rate, it seems Cheerilee will soon surpass her. The fattest pony in all of Ponyville! That would be an embarrassing title\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot embarrassing enough to stop her from eating though. She licked her lips, practically drooling at the mouth when Mrs. Cake eventually wheeled out a big cart stuffed with a spread of different, delicious pastries. The smell evoked a powerful sense of gluttony within Cheerilee, and the mare\u2019s big tummy growled loudly. Rarity, who was a much lighter eater, couldn\u2019t help but stare in awe for a moment at the size of Cheerilee\u2019s meal as it was plopped down in front of her. Cheerilee thanked Mrs. Cake, before eagerly digging in, stuffing her face full with seemingly ravenous efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity\u2019s stunned. Within a couple of minutes, the scrumptious pastries on Cheerilee\u2019s plate are reduced to nothing but crumbs! She knows its rude to stare, but she can\u2019t help but glance at how the teacher\u2019s belly seemed slightly bigger and rounder after her meal. The once demure teacher leaned back with a satisfied sigh, patting and rubbing her full tummy with her hooves. Every single day, Cheerilee tells herself that this is the last day she\u2019s going to binge like this. Every single day, she just keeps coming back! How is she supposed to resist, though, when the bakery\u2019s pastries are so delicious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasty snacks were like antidepressants for Cheerilee! \u2026 sad as that was. Still, as she paid for her meal, she\u2019s grimly reminded of just how much her appetite was breaking the bank. It was actually quite fortunate that her students seemed to want to chip in, or she\u2019d probably go broke trying to buy all the snacks she eats every day. Her full tummy swayed to and fro beneath her as she walked home, a little smile constantly on her face, the sensation of being full brightening her spirits as they always do. Once she makes it home, she spends the rest of the night grading papers, eating ice cream, and cleaning up around the house\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, Cheerilee shows up over an hour before class starts as always, busily working around the classroom to get things set up. She was definitely not a morning person, so she needed this extra hour to really wake up and prepare for another exhausting day. Eventually, she heard little hoofsteps coming from down the hall, indicating that one of her students was walking in early! Indeed, Cheerilee turned to see Sweetie Belle\u2019s smiling face as she stepped inside! <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cGood morning, miss Cheerilee!\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle smiled, placing a chocolate bar on her teacher\u2019s desk as she walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cGood morning, Sweetie Belle,\u201d</span> Cheerilee smiled. She\u2019s worked with the filly for years, and Sweetie\u2019s always been a model student. All A\u2019s, very polite and respectful, the likes. Definitely lives up to her older sister\u2019s pedigree. The way she set that candy bar down on her desk, though, reminded Cheerilee of the concerns she was having yesterday. Just as Sweetie Belle was about to walk over to her seat, Cheerilee lifted a hoof. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cUh, Sweetie Belle! There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly turns. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYes, miss Cheerilee?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee holds up the chocolate bar. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cWhere, exactly, did you get this?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee knew how to read foal\u2019s expressions, and judging from Sweetie Belle\u2019s expression, she was trying to come up with a lie - fast. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, I just had a ton of candy last night, and I couldn\u2019t eat it all! So I figured, hey, why not give the leftovers to my beloved teacher?\u201d</span> She said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee raised a brow, incredulously. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cIs that so? Your sister, Rarity, told me you don\u2019t eat candy\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle\u2019s ears lowered, and a distressed look dawned on her face. She looked guiltily at the floor, realizing she\u2019d been caught in a lie. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry. That wasn\u2019t very honest,\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle sighed. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThe truth is, we get the candy from\u2026\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

His high cheekbone and flat snout gave him a handsome face, and his bright green eyes and blond mane only enhanced these features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was an image of perfection: his torso were two slabs of muscular pecs, which he enjoyed to flex often, and his front and back legs, along with his large, golden brown wings, was very powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood-looking, strong, agile...Yes, Evening Skies loved the idea that he was the ideal Wonderbolt, the very best they had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...At least, that was what his image in the mirror showed him. The Evening Skies in real life that studied his reflection was the a near polar opposite to his fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had bright green eyes, a blond mane and wings, he was very, very far away from being considered the spitting image of a Wonderbolt. In fact, anypony might wonder how he even was excepted to be a Wonderbolt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Evening Skies staring at the mirror was seriously obese. His belly brushed the floor, pressing itself firmly against his four thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched upon two sagging golden brown butt cheeks was his tail, his thighs as thick as tree trunks, and his cutie marks, which displayed three clouds with three lightning bolds coming out of them, were as large as pony's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he did, indeed, have a handsome face, but it was covered by two chubby cheeks and a second chin. But Evening Skies didn't see his corpulent state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself several years ago, the day he joined the Wonderbolts, before he was promoted a few ranks up, before life had gotten a little too good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot himself a grin and waddled away from mirror. He dressed himself in his blue and yellow Wonderbolt suit, which didn't fit him so well, for it was tearing at the seams, and here and there were a few rips in the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't notice how snug his uniform was, or cared if he did. He placed the goggles over his eyes, strolled out of his house that was made out of clouds, and, with some effort, flapped his wings and lifted his fat body off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: While he flies through the air, he is unable to, in his corpulent state, to maneuver himself properly and ends up crashing against another fellow pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plummet and crash lands on a cloud, the unfortunate pony underneath Evening Skies' large belly. When he looked at who it was, he discovers, much to his surprise, that it was Rainbow Dash, the mare that inspired him to join the Wonderbolts in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoice 2: As Evening Skies flies through the air, a very weird weather phenomenon takes place; it begins to rain chocolate milk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord had appeared and had taken interest in the fat Wonderbolt.</span></div></div>",

He had done it. He had captured the Crystal Heart, defeated his foes and regained his rightful throne to the Crystal Empire. Not that he doubted himself in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he was free...well, almost free. King Sombra turned his attention to the swirling mass of dark clouds in the sky, his grin fading. Some of them containing green gems that glowed with malice. It was a thick canopy of dark magic that blocked out the sun, leaving the region in a perpetual state of dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice evil decoration, Sombra admitted, but it was also a powerful shield. Nothing could get in, nor could anything get out. King Sombra was still trapped in a prison, unable to conquer the world that lay beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never knew how this came to be. After obtaining the Crystal Heart and regaining his true form, Sombra attempted to destroy the ones that opposed him, but the unicorns and alicorns attacked him with powerful spell, immobilizing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe furiously attacked the magic, trying to break free, unleashing terrible spell after spell. When he finally managed to do it, Sombra was met with this swirling dark magic, and the alicorns and unicorns were no where to be found. He suspected that they were either destroyed my his vicious spell casting or the escaped. Sombra hoped it was the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to escape several times, but the clouds proved too strong for him. King Sombra hissed in frustration, heading back into his castle.

Out of thin air appeared a mare, who had a brown coat, a thick curly mane and tail, and red eyes. She eyed the king lustily, her cunt wet and her crotchboobs sloshing with milk as she strutted towards the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, wasn't a real pony but a soulless entity, much like his guards, that Sombra conjures when he is horny, like now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I please you, my king?\" she said in a seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra was impatient, and didn't want to go through the pointless teasing ritual that he liked so much. He grabbed her forcing her on his bed, and after giving her a few thrusts he climaxed, inflating her belly a bit as his seed filled her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she disappeared, leaving the king behind to pant in exhaustion, his over sized member deflating, but the damage seemed permanent; his balls and sheath still remained visible. Sombra stared at his crotch, debating whether he should continue with the absorbing spell or fix his embarrassing problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he choose?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">An interactive featuring characters from the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Thems will focuss on weight gain, inflation expansions of all kind and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always i have a number of rules here. Quick copy, paste, and edit from my other stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n#1 - No gore or death. Characters should not be killed if at all possible. If, for example, you plan on having a plot revolving around mafia-esq characters who might be assumed to be killing others, keep such events off screen and not described in more detail than necessary. So short of adding drama to the plot, death should not factor in for the main character if at all possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 - Keep vore to a minimum. The reason being because there are interesting ways of voring individuals that could be used to make a individual 'bigger'. Non-fatal ways. Either way, for whatever reason, voring does not kill characters here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3 - No short posts. Any post added must be a minimum of one to three paragraphs or approximately two hundred and fifty words. Which is not as hard as some might think. Longer posts will be greatly appreciated though. Small posts should ONLY be reserved for adding more chapter options, and even then, try to be creative with more elaboration before adding other choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4 \u2013 Give everyone an out. All chapters should have two options at the very least. Give everyone a chance to follow the story you want to see and a way to escape that path if they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#5 \u2013 Keep the flow. Everyone is entitled to interject their own ideas, however do not suddenly stop a story line for no reason to start a new one. So if there's a character given super powers, don't just suddenly strip them from the individual for some arbitrary reason and dump him somewhere to start your story. See point 4. If everyone is given an 'out' then everyone will get the chance for the story they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 \u2013 Keep the focus towards Weight Gain and Inflation of various kinds. Transformation can play a part too, as well as other changes, but WG and Inflation should be the main subjects of interest of the city for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#8 \u2013 Oviposition or egg-laying. Some writers like like the idea of a character being expanded with hundreds of eggs, and I will allow this. However! All eggs laid must be infertile and not be destined to hatch into hundreds of babies. If having children is to be part of the story keep the number to a minimal amount no matter how many eggs are involved. OR hundreds of thousands of eggs/births have to have the beings born be able to take care of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#9 \u2013 Lastly, have fun with this. Get creative. The rules above are guidelines rather than strict 'do not cross' guardrails for the most part. However, take note of each since anything falling into such 'unpleasent' categories may be removed if it is deemed inappropriate in one form or another. Such actions will not happen without the author being told though and giving them a chance to correct their chapter. Any abuse or rude behavior, including mean spirited posting, will be removed without such notification though, so 'play nice'.</td>",
