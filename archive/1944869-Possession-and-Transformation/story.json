She was slightly surprised and hesitant at first but she allowed me to hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat there for a few seconds before she cleared her throat and slowly began to speak. \"I can't... deal... with it anymore.\" She sputtered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with what?\" I said inquisitively Rachel told me everything, this came as a surprise to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man has been following me for the last week.\" Immediately my blood began to boil. \"He approached me yesterday to ask me out. I was totally creeped out by him though so I said no and moved on, thinking it was over. Then yesterday he was everywhere, when I left the dorm, when I got to class, when I left class, all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled her into the embrace more. \"It's ok tell me everything.\" I said with great concern in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stammered at first. \"Then... then when I was heading back here he approached me again. This time he told me I had to go out with him. That we were soul mates. He told me that he was in love with me.\" She paused readying herself. \"Then she grabbed me and pushed me up against the wall trying to kiss me.\" I was shocked worried how far this had gone. \"I screamed and it seemed to worry him so he backed off and seeing that other people were looking he ran away.\" Relief came to me in a large wave, nothing had happened... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Rachey.\" I said as I stroked her hair. \"Starting tomorrow I will go with you. to class. We should go to the police and see if we can't get a restraining order.\" Rachel nodded slowly.</span></div></div>",

Slowly the process began of creating a report of verbal and physical assault and stalking. They got us to describe him to a sketch artist and told us it may take some time to find him. Until they do, they can't file a restraining order without a last name. They also told us that they would fax the sketch to campus security whom would keep him off campus if they see him. They told Rachel to never walk alone until they find him. Finally they got an officer to give them a ride back to their dorm.

Nothing in my life had been working out since being fired I had to have this. If only Rachel would love me I could get it all back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was brought out of his simmering thoughts when I saw a shop in an alley I had never seen before. The sign merely read Magic. Magic was certainly something I needed right now. I entered the shop looking around at all the odd items on the wall. \"Sorry we are about to close.\" The patron said as he looked up to me. His face changed from contempt to a sinister smile. \"Well I guess we can stay open for you. I have exactly what you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know what I want?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I can see as clearly on your aura as your face, that you want something you can't have. I can help with that, although in a bit of a round about way.\" The man pulled a scroll off the wall. \"This spell will allow you to possess what you seek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I thought he was insane, but as I looked at the scroll it seemed to call to me. \"...how much...\" I said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see $100 should be just fine, cash or credit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed my wallet and handed him my credit card, which was already nearly maxed out, this would make it as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He took the card and ran it through his machine. He tossed the scroll to me and I walked slowly out of the shop. I stood there for a while my mind completely blank. Suddenly I woke up and turned around to see that the shop was gone. I was still in the same alleyway, but it was just gone.</span></div></div>",

I told her she had to go on a date with me. She stabbed me in the back and turned me into my supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I meet Rachel, she was brilliant. All of my problems washed away when she was around. I needed her, I loved her. More than anything else in the world. Now I had nearly completed my final objective. Destroying my former self was an important step, but not the last step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill inside my mind I looked down to see Ryan's hand inside my gut, the resistance to the tendrils ended and instead I began to welcome them into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, accept me. Soon we will be the same.\" Ryan said to me smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back. \"Yes, your right, or course. I can feel you, I want you in me now.\" I hugged him and pulled him towards me.

Ryan removed his hand just as my body settled into it's new form. I was Ryan now, in body and in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now let's complete our plan.\" Both Ryans said in unison. \"First we must change you into a female version of myself.\" Said the original Ryan to me. \"Thanks to your old self, I am a wanted man, my life is over. It will be easier to stay in the shell of Erika if you are female.\" The first Ryan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more, but only you have that power.\" I said coldly. Once again the original Ryan stabbed me, this time I changed quickly, I was reshaped in a female version of Ryan. My breasts were C cups, I had long brown hair and brown eyes, wide hips, and long slender legs. I drew off of Erika's old memories to gain any skills I would need to live in her body. \"Perfect.\" I looked at my new body.</span></div></div>",

Like it was the last bottle of beer so compelling and yet could be so dangerous. But what the heck, YOLO right? Erica held the tube at her lips and felt how the drop went between her lips inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica, are you crazy? What did you just do?\" Rachel asked freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Rachel, I just wanted to taste it, it's rather sweet isn't it? It tastes like...\" Erica couldn't finish her sentence as she felt woozy all of a sudden. The whole room was moving and she felt sick all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica! Erica!\" Rachel shouted but Erica couldn't hear her best friend. The bed of her best friend sure did look nice. Perhaps she just needed to sleep it off. Erica staggered through the room until she reached the bed. With a crash she just let herself fall down on the bed next to her best friend's body. Her world immediately turned dark after that. She then began to dream, she was in some kind of wet cave which was vibrating like crazy. The only thing she could do was move forward. Erica did so and then she finally reached the exit, it was a bright light with some black string dividing it. Erica didn't care she needed some air. So Erica moved forward and squeezed past the black thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was weird.\" Erica mumbled as she looked around herself. This, this was a weird dream. It looked like Rachel's room but only bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica?\" She suddenly heard a voice. Erica looked next to her and there she saw Rachel in her slime form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel? What happened to me?\" Erica asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you? You're just like me now, a slime creature thing.\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked down and saw she was indeed some slimy thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that tunnel I just escaped out was my....\" Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was your vagina. You just escaped from your vagina, how freaky is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's totally weird. Speaking of which what do you suppose we do now?\" Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it would be best for us to return to our bodies.

We're way too small to reach anything, we don't even have hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But imagine us sneaking into places like this?

When Erica was finally upon the bed she heard Rachel speaking to her. \"Wow, it's way easier with you. You were only wearing a thong tonight underneath.\" \"Yeah, I told you, you totally need to get them as well.\" Erica told Rachel as she made her way to Rachel's body. Rachel was wearing pink pajama pants and top. So Erica made her way through the trouser leg of the pajama bottom to reach Rachel's vagina. She crawled her way through noticing how soft Rachel's legs were. They were really something to look forward to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Erica reached Rachel's panties. Pink panties to match her pajama's. As Erica looked for a way to easily squeeze around, she found that this wasn't the case. She just had to squeeze past her leg in order to get inside her panties. When Erica thought about it she giggled: \"I never thought I would find myself in another girl's panties.\" She then reached Rachel's vagina enclosed by her natural forest. Erica knew one of the things she would be doing. She then squeezed herself inside Rachel's vagina, not sure what to expect. When the last of her slime entered the vagina, Erica began to feel strange. She felt herself spreading throughout Rachel's body, not knowing what would happen. Everything turned surreal and at last black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then felt a hand touching her shoulder. \"Erica, you alright?\" The voice asked awfully similar to hers. \"Yeah, just five more minutes.\" Erica said turning the other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you silly. Open your eyes and look.\" The voice said incredulous. Erica opened her eyes sleepy but they got wide open when they saw who tried to wake her. In front of her was a familiar copy of her body. The same black hair, the same face, even the same nightgown she was wearing.  Was that her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, is that you?\" Erica asked confused. Rachel nodded as she grinned. Erica looked down and saw the pink pajama's Rachel was wearing earlier and her hands were also different. \"Rachel, we did it.\" Erica grabbed her friend who fell down on the bed with her. They both laughed at it and examined each other for quite some time. \"This, I didn't foresee.\" Rachel said as she sat down next to Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither, I thought it was just some kind of dream you know. A very weird dream, but okay.\" Erica said admiring Rachel's nail polish skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Rachel asked nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do? We try this thing out of course.\" Erica told Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But tomorrow we have classes, are you sure you can fit in with my classes?\" Rachel asked unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there's nothing to it. We can do this Rachel!\" Erica said hugging her friend once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess you're right. We can tell each other tomorrow what we need to know.\" Rachel said standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll go to my room.\" Rachel said making her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go to sleep as well. Sleep tight.\" Erica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Rachel replied. Then both girls thought the same thing: \"But not before I have checked out my new body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to follow?</span></div></div>",

It still felt like a dream; all of it. Rachel turned into a slime creature, Erica drinking the potion as well and their plan to switch bodies. It all just seemed like a dream, but now it turns out to be reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me. I'm gorgeous.\" Erica said as she heard Rachel's voice or something similar like it talking as she looked at herself in the mirror. The mirror displayed Rachel's look. Her cute little nose, her sparkling blue eyes, the cute looking freckles on her cheeks and the small petal rose like mouth. Not to mention the long red hair she possessed. Erica touched it as she couldn't believe it, it felt so thick and curly. Erica couldn't believe Rachel had this type of hair without having to do a thing for it. She loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica touched her face, or Rachel's face, as she felt around it and saw the reflection in the mirror copying her action. Pinching her cheeks, rubbing them, pulling her nose up and sticking out her tongue. All that was just her doing it. This was unbelievable. And then the rest of her body as well. Erica looked down at the pink pajama top and bottom she was wearing. It was typical something Rachel would wear. but not something Erica would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica carefully undid the buttons of her top though the last one was a bit of a hassle. Apparently Rachel sewed it back on. A skill of Rachel Erica didn't have. Erica once tried, but it never worked out. She wondered if now that she was in Rachel's body she could sew as her. That was something of later though and Erica pulled the pajama top off. Looking  in the mirror Erica was happily surprised. Rachel looked well...amazing. She had pale skin which made a beautiful contrast with her red hair. Her breasts were smaller sized, C-cups she imagined, but they looked nice. Erica tried not to stare too much at them and concentrated on the rest of her upper body. Rachel's waist size was smaller than Erica's, probably because Rachel tried to eat healthy and work out once in a while. Erica carefully touched her stomach area, amazed by how it was much smaller than her own. \"Nice Rachel. You have really got something here.\" Erica said amazed by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then pulled off the bottom of her pajama pants and shove it away. She was wearing Rachel's pink panties. The same panties she crawled through in her slime form. \"Weird.\" She said to herself as she touched the area. \"To think I crawled through there.\" Erica then frowned and pulled off the panties as well without a moment of shame. She wanted a full inspection of Rachel's body. Erica was surprised to see Rachel had a bush around her nether regions. Something she had taken care of. Erica was pleased to see the carpet matched the drapes. \"Something to take care of yet.\" Erica said as her fingers gently took hold of her bush. Erica then concentrated on the rest of Rachel's body. Her hips weren't that large and while Erica maintained a jiggly ass, Rachel's was less noticeable. \"Though I think a guy wouldn't mind one like this.\" Erica said as she slapped it a little. Finally her legs were nice, smooth shaven as Rachel likes to wear skirts often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erica looked at herself in the mirror she liked what she saw. It wasn't as sexy as her own, but she could do with it. While looking at her naked reflection Erica thought of something which made her reflection turn as red as the color of her hair. She wanted to see what she had to work with and masturbating as Rachel would give her the right info. But doing it as Rachel was a weird thought. She could also just dress up and go to sleep. Tomorrow was a whole new day and things could get hectic. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Erica felt she was going to cross a line here; an important one. On one hand she didn't want to use her roommate's body as some sort of jerking off material; but on the other hand it felt exciting and thrilling to find out how Rachel's body would perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just once.\" Erica promised herself as she closed her eyes as her hands were drawn to Rachel's breasts. She imagined Tony, a guy she regularly dates, playing with her breasts. Seeing his handsome face, those cute dimples in his cheeks playing with her breasts. Erica carefully began to play with Rachel's breasts, rubbing them gently, occasionally giving her nipples a little twist. Erica slowly felt a familiar feeling coming from down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked down at Rachel's nipples. They were cute, even with them being pointy like they were now, but there were no competition for her own nipples. Erica had what they called inverted nipples and when they would come out they were pretty long, unlike Rachel's here. She often licked her nipples like that, but with Rachel's nipples that was no option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down we go.\" Erica mumbled to herself as her left hand continued rubbing Rachel's breasts while her other hand snaked itself down to Rachel's pussy. Erica smiled wide as she gently began rubbing it. It was the weirdest part of all. Erica was used to masturbating in her own body, but doing it in someone else's body was amazing. Erica could feel the difference in pleasure zones between herself and Rachel's body. Not to mention how tight her pussy felt now. Probably because her body was still a virgin, but even then it felt pretty tight. This was one of the best things that happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orgasm came, Erica didn't know what to do. She didn't want it to come, but Rachel's body couldn't contain itself any longer and she felt herself coming.Erica was surprised when she felt how Rachel's fluids flew away. <i>OMG, Rachel is a squirter.</i> Erica realized. She never told Erica this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica felt herself comfortable in Rachel's body as she was enjoying the afterglow. If Rachel's life was like this, this was one of the best thing she ever did. Erica continued having orgasms for three times after which she felt tired. Putting on the pair of panties she pulled off earlier, she went to bed with a grin on her face.</span></div></div>",

For example sleep with a bad boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you do that normally?\" Rachel asked smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica smiled at the thought of that last guy, yeah he wasn't exactly a saint. \"Okay scratch that last example, just don't do things I wouldn't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the second thing?\" Rachel asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure if it's possible, but when you take me over could you let me see everything and that sort of things. Not to intervene of course, but just to see how you handle things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought about it then she nodded. \"Okay that sounds good to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so how do you want to take me over?\" Erica answered excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shrugged. \"I guess I'll just go pass through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to take a special position? Lying, standing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lying like that would be fine.\" Rachel answered. When Erica got excited she tended to ask useless things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Erica said as she lied down on her bed. \"Good luck.\" She put up a thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Rachel said as she blushed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel slowly moved down as she phased right into Erica.

She moved off her bed and towards the full sized mirror standing in a corner. When she stood in front of it, her eyes went wide open. Her hands were going in her hair, feeling the softness of it. She walked closer to the mirror, studying her eyes. Rachel's had been blue ones, now hers were green. Erica took a deeper look as she pulled off different faces, looking from sexy to really weird. \"I'm really you, Erica.\" She talked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sheesh Rachel, is that the only thing you can think of.\"</i> Erica thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erica's hand went to her chest. Her hands weighted the gain of flesh she had just gotten. Her fingers even twisted a nipple. \"You're really sensitive Erica.\" Erica mumbled. She then pulled the nightgown over her head as she looked once again in the mirror. Her fingers felt around her stomach, she was a bit overweight but Rachel didn't seem to care about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were resting on her hips, she was big, but not unattractive. Erica then pulled off her thong, she was a bit surprised to see that the area around her vagina was clean shaved. \"I guess I have to do that too, it does rather smooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been telling you that for years.\" Erica thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Erica turned herself around and looked back in the mirror. Erica had a real nice ass, and judging by her reaction Rachel seemed to like it too. She gave herself a little slap, and giggled from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do?\" She asked herself.</span></div></div>",

Erica you can keep the rest of the potion I have nothing to worry about now. I think I'm gonna keep this body.\" <br>\r\n\"Well alright then. I'm gonna go find Jamie.\" She walked out the door and headed to the dance studio. When she got there, she could see Jamie practicing inside. \"Wow isn't she gorgeous.\" She murmured. Jamie frolicked around and danced to a classical tune. Erica decided to wait around for her and follow her to her room. When Jamie finished up, she changed her shoes and walked to her room. Erica followed behind, trying not to be noticed. Once she got into the building, she saw Jamie opening her door. \"Hey Jamie!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there Erica. What's up?\" <br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could help me review some steps real quick.\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm. Alright, I guess I have a couple minutes. Come in and show me what you need help with.\" Erica's followed inside giddily and sat on her chair. \"Okay so which dance?\" <br>\r\n\"Okay just the beginning of wind song.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, watch.\" Jamie jumped up and down reciting the dance moves. Erica watched her body as it moved. It was a perfect dancers body. And she could have it. <br>\r\n\"Great! Thanks so much!\"<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" <br>\r\n\"So I wanted to ask something else.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n\"I wanted to know if I could borrow your body?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" <br>\r\n\"I have this ability to possess people and I wanted to know if I could use it on you.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know. That sounds kind of weird.\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay. Well would you want to try it on someone else?\"<br>\r\n \"Could I use it on you?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, I suppose.\" <br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Jamie jumped up and down. <br>\r\n\"You have to fall asleep first.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jamie took a few sleeping pills and went out like a light. While she was asleep, Erica looked around and observed Jamie's body. She was wearing black leggings and a white tank top. Her feet were bare and exposed. Erica always had a crush on Jamie, and had some desires. She always wondered what her feet smelled like. Erica crept up behind her and looked at her feet. She stuck her face in them and inhaled deeply. She quivered and went back for more. She kept smelling them until they didn't smell like anything anymore. So she started liking them. She sucked every toe until they were fully cleaned. She thought about possessing her there, but she wanted to be fair with her. Maybe she could play around some more until she woke up. Erica jumped onto Jamie's bed with her and began to dry hump her. She grinded on her ass and laid on top her. Wow she was having a great time. The last thing she desired to do was smell her ass. She lifted Jamie up and placed her bottom directly on her face. A strong smell flew right into her nostrils, since Jamie had been dancing for so long. She couldn't help it anymore. She threw Jamie off of her and got out the potion. Right before she drank it, Jamie woke up. <br>\r\n\"Am I Erica?\" <br>\r\n\"No not yet. Here. Drink some of this and then enter me when I drink it as well. Jamie drank it and her torso flopped to the side of the bed. A ghostly figure came out of her and hovered around the room. Erica quickly drank the rest and passed out as well. Erica flew over to Jamie's rag doll body and flew strait into her head. She woke up and was pleased to feel her new body. Jamie's spirit flew into Erica's ass and she rose up like a toddler. <br>\r\n\"Woa it's weird walking in someone else's shoes.\" <br>\r\n\"You get used to it.\" Erica, now Jamie, picked up her shoe and began to sniff it.<br>\r\n\"So you had a foot fetish for me and that's why you wanted my body?\" <br>\r\n\"No not just that.\" She picked up a pair of Jamie's panties. \"An ass fetish as well.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh wow, well same to you.\" <br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, since you walked in I've wanted to smother you. You think I didn't feel you licking my feet?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh haha well, my feet now.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe after this we can do this more often.\" <br>\r\n\"Alright.\" <br>\r\n\"Have you ever smelled your own ass before?\" Jamie says in Erica's body.<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n\"But not from another persons body.\" Erica's body smiled.<br>\r\n\"Bend over.\" Jamie smashed her face into Erica's ass and began to sniff. \"Oh my god yes!\"she began to finger her self and she fell over.<br>\r\n\"Let me help you.\" Erica sat on Jamie's face. \"Wow this is weird siting on my own face. Let me smell yours.\" Jamie got up and pushed her booty up. Erica dove right in and began sniffing. <br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness this is amazing.\" The two girls laid down on the bed and started to kiss. Jamie then slowly put her hand down Erica's dress and started fingering her. Erica did the same to Jamie. They came then passed out on the bed with their hands down each other's pants.</span></div></div>",

There wasn't much in the room anymore, a couple of posters of a boy band, a wardrobe and her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down on bed, Paige wondered what she could do now. Nobody was around to text, all of her \"friends\" were off into foreign country. She was the only one who decided to go back to the parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige was squirming a bit, she hadn't done it since she came here, but having nothing else to do, she didn't have a choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige pulled off the tank top she was wearing over her head and threw it into a corner. She then pulled her shorts off and threw them into the corner with the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige was proud of her body, and although a bit fat many boys found her attractive. That's why she slept almost every other night with one. She even once got with a girl in bed, the pleasure was good too.  She asked the girl to go again but she refused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige first hugged her breasts tightly, she moved her right one knowing that was her sensitive side. Pulling her nipples she let out her first moan and her first orgasm of the day. Boy was she in need of this. Paige began to play even harder with her breasts, she pulled the bra off and began to tear her nipples which hurt her but made the electric shocks keep going constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she would be wet down, Paige first rubbed through her panties. She was really wet today, her juices were pouring out. Pulling her panties off she began to rub her clit. Her moans got louder, but she didn't care anymore if anyone would hear them. All of her siblings were out, and her mother was usually busy downstairs. She began to put her fingers inside, first one, then two at last three. She was on a roll here. Paige turned around and was now in the doggey stand. If only she had a cock within her, that would feel so much better. Any one would be good. Just a few more seconds. She lied on her back again, final having the big one. Pulling her clit a bit she felt the wave hitting her. She felt like she was in heaven. Her body was done, and in one way more than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige didn't noticed at first, but she felt as light as a feather suddenly. Like she didn't have a care in the world. When she opened her eyes, something was wrong. She was floating in the air. When she looked down, she saw her body lying there sleeping. Paige was in shock, what happened to her? Paige dived a little in front of her body. There she was, just like she was sleeping. Paige knew of ghosts their power, they could take over people's bodies. Her mother's one for example. Paige grinned at the thought of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swam through the door  and downstairs. There she saw her mother reading a magazine. Wearing a yellow shirt, with a long skirt.  This was going to be awesome. And without a notice Paige dived right into her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Paige possess her mother?</span></div></div>",

Her sight was then set on her breasts, they looked they had gotten bigger too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" She said out loud. Wait a minute, that wasn't her voice. What was going on with her? Paige stood up and quickly ran for the living room mirror. In it's reflection she saw Natalie staring back at her, with a confused expression as well. Paige slowly raised her hand and saw Natalie doing it as well. She looked to the right and saw Natalie's reflection doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait that means I'm my mom now.\" Paige said out loud. Paige looked again in the mirror and giggled. \"I don't think it's that much of a downgrade I suppose.

She put her hand in her panties and then began massaging her clit. She needed to get ready for this; it was a once in a lifetime experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige pulled off the push-up bra and thong and crawled on the bed towards her lifeless body. Her eyes were still open and Paige quickly closed them before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Otherwise it just looks like I would make out with my corpse, gross!</i>She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige grabbed her old head and kissed her former lips. She could taste the cherry lipstick she put on that morning. Paige then put her tongue inside her old body's mouth. She tried to play with her tongue, but her tongue would just lay down lifeless. There was no action in it and it frustrated Paige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\" She cursed. \"Why couldn't you be alive? Then I could really make out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige then looked over at her former breasts. Though her own chest was bigger and prettier, her former breasts still looked nice. Paige took a nipple and sucked on it. She played with her left nipple while sucking the right one. She would always get horny that way. Paige saw them getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Glad that's still normal</i>. Paige then thought of something. Paige moved her breasts on top of her old body's breasts and then began rubbing them. This felt good, her old breasts were soft and squishy, just how she liked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish this had happened earlier, then I could do this a lot more. Mom, you're amazing.\" Paige let out a moan. But still it wasn't enough to even give her an orgasm, she only felt herself getting a little wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige then turned her attention to her old vagina. It was getting wet too. Paige put her nose in front of it, the smell was really sweet. She then began to lick her vagina like that. Paige her thoughts were only on getting an orgasm as fast as she could. With her other hand she began to finger herself. Her old body was just lying still, only for getting a little wetter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Paige long to get herself an orgasm. The feelings she received were intense as she began to squeeze her breasts to further stimulate the shocks coursing through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't done yet, there was one thing she wanted to do. With a lot of effort she managed to put her vagina and that of her old body against each other. Paige then began to rub. At first she didn't feel anything, but then it began. She felt herself getting hornier, her movements were getting faster and so did her breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Paige screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had her orgasm it was the biggest one she ever had. She could feel her juices pour into her old body. It was a magic moment, one she would remember forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next? </span></div></div>",

She had dreamed she had such a masturbation session she was a ghost and took over her mother's body. What a weird dream. When she opened her eyes, she felt something was wrong. She couldn't move anymore, she was stuck somehow. But then a hand moved in front of her. And her mouth opened: \"What was that?\" She heard herself say. She moved up a bit from the couch and then sat back. Looking down Paige noticed the same outfit her mother had been wearing. Was she her mother? But why couldn't she do anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sucked, totally. Paige couldn't do a thing, she had to look at what her mother was reading, her eyes couldn't look at anything else. Trying to remain calm, Paige began reading the article. It was terrible. This really is the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow her mother had the same thought, as she went to the next page. Wait, did she do that? Paige tried again. She thought of to scratch her nose. Natalie didn't react to it. Then Paige thought of not giving an explicit command, but to give the cause of the action. She thought how her nose itched. And like that, Natalie scratched her nose a bit as she continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was amazing, Paige thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Natalie suddenly felt herself getting happier suddenly, she didn't know where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bob maneuvered his blue work van through the quiet streets of the neighborhood toward the house of his next client.  The rolling mass of metal and rust rolled unsteadily on as gears grinded and big metal tools rattled about in the back of the old beat-up van.  Hitting the occasional pothole brought strange noises from the metal monster and, without fail, a mighty jiggle from Bob\u2019s potbelly as his rotund form strained against the greasy blue work suit.  Bob had been doing this job for years and had gotten fairly good at it, and he was even able to make decent money at his work, but the recent divorce from his wife had rattled his finances and forced him to postpone the purchase of a new vehicle, which he really needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van rolled to a grinding stop in a driveway close to Bob\u2019s own house.  He reached down, grabbed a rag, and wiped his hands, but of course this did little to make him presentable.  He wiped the grease and sweat from his face, only a slight improvement on his image.  He gazed into the rear view mirror at himself, almost like a kid planning to go out on a big date.  Looking back at him was his 43-year-old face, one that had aged beyond its years because of the physically demanding nature of his job.  His smile was wide, but his hair had thinned recently.  He tried to cover his balding with a comb-over, which made it more obvious.  He smiled at himself in the mirror, gazing upon his pudgy, unshaven face and double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob opened the door and ungracefully exited the van.  He began to walk slowly to the door, each step labored because of his weight.  He always carried a bag of M&amp;M\u2019s; he could hear them rattling around in his pocket, and, without even thinking, he would reach down every minute or two and grab a handful with his left hand.  That contributed to his weight problem, of course.  His right hand carried a rusty orange tool box.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob reached the porch and knocked on the door.  He tensed up as he waited for a woman he had harbored a crush on for years\u2014Natalie Redford.  She was a beautiful woman of 38, with hair as red as fire hanging down past her shoulders.  She is about 5 feet 8 inches tall, a good 5 inches taller than Bob.  Natalie\u2019s body was the stuff of legend to him.  She\u2019d gained some weight recently, what with her nearing 40 and having carried 3 children, but this had served to make her all the more curvy and voluptuous to the hapless plumber.  She had fair skin and a set of breasts so large they jiggled with every step and threatened to burst through her shirt.  She had a slight pouch in her belly that was downright cute and a lovely bit of thickness in her arms and legs.  She had a narrow waist that flared out into a set of wide, child-bearing hips and a lovely ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob just finished munching nervously on a handful of M&amp;M\u2019s as the door opened.  Bob smiled as the beautiful Natalie received him warmly.  \u201cHey, Bob!\u201d she said, \u201cHow have you been?\u201d as she motioned for him to come inside the house.  She was clad today in a figure-hugging green skirt that matched her beautiful eyes.  Covering her top half was a thin white blouse against which her breasts strained mightily.  Bob could barely tear his eyes away from her long enough to say \u201cOh not bad, Natalie; how are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I've had some bad luck lately, Bob,\u201d she explained, telling him to follow her upstairs.  Bob waddled after her as he stared at the sway of her hips as she climbed the stairs.  \u201cSee,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this noise that we hear when we turn on the warm water; it\u2019s like the whole house is groaning.\u201d  The two reached the top of the steps, and Natalie took Bob into the bathroom nearby.  She reached down with her dainty hands and turned the left faucet, and suddenly the plumbing seemed to groan or roar or\u2026whatever the word was\u2026it wasn\u2019t something plumbing should do.  \u201cThat is a problem, Natilie,\u201d Bob declared good-naturedly, \u201chave you called anybody else about it?\u201d  \u201cNo, Bob,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re the go-to guy around here for plumbing\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob smiled as he slowly bent down and prepared to get on his back to gaze under the sink.  \u201cThe kids are at school, so I\u2019ll be here if you need anything.  I took the day off from my receptionist job.  I\u2019ll leave you to your work, Bob, and I\u2019ll be downstairs doing some yoga,\u201d Natalie said, \u201cI\u2019ve got these few Christmas pounds I\u2019m still trying to get rid of,\u201d she said with a slight laugh as she patted her belly.  Bob quietly hoped Natalie stayed just as she was.  \u201cNatalie, I\u2019ve got weight hanging on from about 1988; if you figure out how to get rid of it, you let me know,\u201d he declared as he motioned to his own gut.  \u201cWill do, Bob,\u201d Natalie declared with a laugh as she headed down the stairs.  Bob watched her curvaceous form disappear down the stairs longingly\u2026and munched on some more M&amp;M\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had rolled by, and sweat rolled down Bob\u2019s rough and whiskered face.  \u201cStill can\u2019t find the problem,\u201d he said to himself as he exited the space under the sink.  Bob began to slowly make his way, his joints stiff, toward the door of the bathroom because he needed another tool down in his van.  As he stepped slowly toward the door, Bob\u2019s feet suddenly flew out from under him, going up where his head should be as his rotund and overweight body thumped loudly on the slippery tile floor.  Bob hit his head hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bob\u2019s eyes shot open.  Instinctively, his hand shot to his head as he rubbed it.  \u201cDammit,\u201d he said, \u201cI gotta be more careful\u2026this ol\u2019 body can\u2019t take much more of thi\u2026\u201d Bob stopped himself.  He realized his head didn\u2019t hurt at all.  It should have been throbbing, but there wasn\u2019t any pain.  Bob looked around confused.  Suddenly, he beheld something on the floor\u2014his own unconscious body!  \u201cOh my god!\u201d Bob said as he leaned over his own sweat-covered body as it lay in a heap on the floor.  Bob staggered back in shock.  \u201cWhat the hell happened to me?\u201d he asked himself.  After a few seconds, he inched forward, seeing his belly move up and down slightly\u2026apparently his body was still breathing--alive.  A dozen or so M&amp;M\u2019s were spilled on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob slowly stepped over his body as he tried to grasp the situation.  He looked in the mirror and got another start when he saw no one looking back at him.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?!\u201d he said, panicked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob slowly and uneasily made his way down the stairs.  \u201cNatalie?\u201d he called out, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to believe this\u2026I don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s happening.\u201d  No answer.  He looked about the house until he heard the TV, up quite loud, coming from the other room.  \u201cNatalie?!\u201d he called out as he moved toward the sound.  He found Natalie in her living room in a wonderfully tight-fitting spandex suit, her ass in the air as she assumed various positions, imitating the movements of the people on the screen.  \u201cNatalie,\u201d Bob called.  Nothing.  \u201cNatalie, help me,\u201d Bob demanded as he ran over between her and the TV.  Still nothing; she looked right through him.  Bob still found himself a bit distracted by her heaving cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie stood up, breathing heavily, apparently wanting a break from her work-out.  Sweat rolled down her beautiful body.  She sat down gracefully in a chair.  Bob, beginning to panic, decided to try once more.  He went over and carefully knelt down right in front of the beautiful woman.  \u201cNatalie, you gotta help me.  PLEASE!\u201d he begged.  Ignoring Bob entirely, Natalie looked right past him and flipped the channel on the TV.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was despondent.  Natalie laughed as she gazed at the television.  \u201cI\u2019m in my Mom\u2019s body,\u201d came a voice from the TV.  \u201cI loved Freaky Friday when I was a kid,\u201d Natalie said to herself.  Bob, fearing he would never recover, began to stand up slowly.  Suddenly, though, he lost his balance.  \u201cShit!\u201d Bob screamed as he fell in the direction of the oblivious Natalie as she sat on the couch.  The strangest thing happened; Bob did not crash into Natalie or hurt her as he fell.  Instead, his form fell into Natlalie\u2019s body, merging with it and forcing its way inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie\u2019s sweaty body convulsed and shook for a few seconds.  Her breasts jiggled, and her belly shuddered slightly.  The woman groaned and grunted momentarily; it was as if something was inside Natalie, and her own spirit and mind were working to force it out.  After about five seconds, all that stopped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob suddenly felt that he was sitting again.  He opened his eyes slowly and cautiously.  His eyes darted about the room as he looked for Natalie.  \u201cWhere did she\u2014\u201c Bob stopped upon hearing his voice.  His hand shot to his mouth, as the voice seemed not to be his.  He could see bits of red hair hanging down into his field of vision.  Looking at his hands, Bob noted that they were dainty and fair-skinned, with jewelry adorning the fingers.  Bob put his hands on the arms of the chair and very slowly stood himself up.  He struggled to do so, as he looked down and saw, hanging from his chest and barely contained by a black spandex top, a wonderful, sweaty, and heaving pair of breasts that rose and fell with every labored breath.  \u201cOh my god,\u201d Bob said as he beheld them and slowly moved toward a nearby mirror.  His hips swayed as he walked.  He felt that hair bobbing around the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob looked in the mirror and beheld the body of Natalie Redford, the curvy, beautiful woman he\u2019d loved for years.  Her face was a strange combination of blank and chocked as Bob gazed upon his new body.  He reached up and cupped the breasts he had admired for so long, moaning as he did.  He slapped himself on his full and motherly ass.  \u201cAn interesting day at work I guess,\u201d Bob mused to himself in his host\u2019s shocked voice and stared into the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tBob hears a knock at the door, and it\u2019s Janice (the lady from down the street who is obsessed with the paranormal).<br>\r\n2)\tBob feels a slight urge to call his friend Amy (who Bob doesn\u2019t know, but Natalie does)<br>\r\n3)\tBob can\u2019t resist exploring his body.           <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie was quite the antique collector, she would buy items fix em up and sell them on ebay for a profit. Although she also had a part-time job she didn't really need to her widow's life insurance would keep her and her family well-off for the rest of their lives, but that didn't mean she couldn't have fun making more money. They certainly weren't rich either, but all three of her children would be able to get educations with their trusts, she had enough to retire on, and the house was paid off.

To state that this woman will have her life changed is quite the understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a 35 year old mother, she doesn't let herself be lazy with her health, taking daily jogs in the morning and sometimes with her husband in the evening. Compared to most mothers, she's definitely a MILF by other standards. Of course, even Jake had to admit that and is happy to have such a beautiful mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, she can come quite nagging sometimes and highly expects Jake to pick up after himself. Unfortunately, Jake is a lot looser than his mother wants, so he can't always please her. It can be said that her insistence on getting things done as soon as possible annoys her son greatly. He has always taken up his life easily and overall, while he studies, he pretty much is average in comparison to some of the smarter students in his class. Paige, of course, only wants the best to be shown in her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Charles is a 38 year old father who is a little overweight, his job taking priority over his physical health. He takes much joy in his wife Paige, enjoying the sex they have every weekend when Jake is out hanging with his friends. Like Jake though, he feels she is being a little too strict on their only son. Yet, since he's working, he can't be critical to say he has a major part in his son's life compared to Paige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will first possess Paige?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey mom.\" Kelly said as she entered the living room. Kelly just came back from another day at school. It was Friday, so she was in a better mood than the rest of the days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige on the other hand was sulking as she was lying on the couch watching another of her soap opera's. It was another dull day, just like all of them. She went to the pedicure this morning to get her nails done with a couple of friends and this afternoon she took it easy. But it was boring, like all other days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how was it?\" Paige asked as she was still watching her soap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay, a Jock at school asked me out though, I turned him down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? You turned him down, why?\" Paige asked her daughter, she couldn't believe what she just heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom, he looks great and all, but all muscles and no brains. Do you know what he said when I asked him what our future perspectives would be, huh? He said I would stay at home taking care of our kids, while he would go and be a major football player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And could he be a big player?\" Paige always liked the jock types, those thick and big muscles she loved it. And being the mother-in-law of a major football player could have it's benefits. Perhaps she could go look after him, if her daughter would be away. Paige smiled at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, there are a couple of universities interested in him. But that's not the point mom, he just expects me to go sit at home doing nothing while he's out there. That's so old fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it young lady, me and your father have done the same thing. And look at how happy I am.\" Paige showed off her pearly whites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom, while dad is away for months you're sitting here alone with me. That's some live.\" Kelly rolled her eyes. \"And besides that's not even the worst that jerk said to me. He even told me to change the way I dress.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThat's something we both agree on.</i> Paige thought. For years she tried to change the way Kelly dressed. She would suggest skirts and dresses, but the more Paige pushed Kelly, the more she rejected it. In the end she dropped it, though she couldn't resist making comment once in a while. Kelly had gone to school wearing jeans, white socks, sneakers, and a pink tank top. It could be so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's something I will never change mom, not even for a guy.\" \"Well I'm going to be upstairs.\" Kelly shook her head, letting her long and curly hair bounce on her neck. Paige was always a little jealous of her hair, well actually she was jealous of everything Kelly had. Kelly had such a tight and pretty body, Paige couldn't believe she was still a virgin. When she was Kelly's age, she was already pregnant of Kelly. It was an accident of course, she didn't want to be pregnant at that age. She wanted to do so much more, she wanted to get in college, hang out at party's every night, and have sex all day long. Instead the man who would become her husband, stayed with her, promised to take care of her and their child. She accepted it of course, but she always resented that decision. If he was like one of those other jerks she knew from that time, he wouldn't have looked back at her and she would have given up her child and get on with her life. Now she was a house-wife, a loaded one, but still, she never could enjoy her youth as much as she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wouldn't be long, Paige received a gift this morning from an old friend. The friend promised her it would help fulfill her deepest desire. To be young once more. Paige grabbed ... from the table.</span></div></div>",

I really can't wait for it.\" Whining Betty asked as she jumped up and down in her circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, just a little more dust over here.\" Jo said as she read the lines of the spell once more. She knew she had to do this right, this was her only chance, one little slip and everything could turn out different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo looked around the room, it was small, very small with only a bed inside it and nothing else. This was the room she worked in, customers coming in and out every day. All satisfied of course. But Jo dreamed of something much more. She always wanted to own her very own brothel with the most beautiful girls around. Girls that would pleasure and do anything for the client, just as she always did for her own clients. Jo looked down as she saw her naked figure, she didn't look that bad. Her D-cup breasts may be fake, and her butt as well but she always had enough clients. Problem was that she was addicted to having sex, a few hours without it and she would go crazy. And that was the whole reason she was standing here with Whining Betty. With her own body Jo knew she could never build up her own brothel, she would want to keep all of the customers to herself. But if she had someone else their body, then it would be something completely different. That's why she turned to Whining Betty, Betty was still in her twenties, had a tight body and was an all-natural beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course when Jo proposed her scheme to Betty she didn't agree to it, but when she heard about the amount of clients she would receive she agreed with Jo. And that's how Jo always managed to persuade people into her schemes, a natural charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo and Betty were standing in two magic circles, Jo only needed to pronounce the magic words and they would switch bodies. With Jo inside Betty's young body and leaving Betty in Jo's sex crazed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jo began to recite the ancient spell, a group of girls were gathering in front of the room outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I really do this?\" Alice asked the girls of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we all did this.\" One of the girls said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not dangerous, you just have to go inside and tell her to do you.\" Another girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what exactly?\" Alice asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something funny, now go in.\" Another girl said giggling. They all pushed Alice closer to the door until she walked herself to the door. Alice took one last look at the group of girls. They were a couple of older girls. Alice didn't have many friends, so when they asked her to join their group she jumped to the chance, but before she could join them she had to their initiation ritual. She hoped it wasn't scary inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alice opened the door, the other girls quickly ran away. They would never allow Alice to join their club, they only did it to fool her. Laughing uncontrollably they ran out of the street. Just imagining how Alice must look like when she would find out what door she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo was finally ready with the spell and she could feel the circle working already. \"Yes, yes I can feel it. Now honey, just don't move and stay calm.\" Jo told Betty. Jo slowly felt her spirit detaching from her body as she was floating in the air. It really worked, the spell worked! She had to thank that wizard for giving her that spell and those medallions. She got it for only a blowjob, if she knew it would work she wouldn't have mind having him inside her for all that matter. Jo felt her spirit being drawn to Betty standing in the circle, wearing the other medallion. Jo had been wearing the same medallion, when her soul would enter Betty's body, Betty's soul would come out and be drawn into Jo's body. Betty's body was ready for it, Betty drank a special mixture that needed to be prepared to allow the spirit to pass inside her. Jo could swear she had tasted it before, but could not remember what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it happened. The door suddenly opened and the force of it knocked Betty down, making her lose the medallion in the process. Jo could only watch as the medallion flew into the air and then by chance landed right on the girl who came inside the room. \"No, I need to go back. Stop! Take it off! Jo said as she waved her arms around trying to prevent crashing into the girl. Alice however could not move as she saw the ghost fly straight for her, she tried to cover her face. Jo tried to move herself away, but it was no use. Her soul was being drawn to the girl's body. She then felt herself being pushed inside the girl's body, the girl looking shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
