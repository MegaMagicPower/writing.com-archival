Since then they have discovered that, while they can talk to their human companions, and their partners can visit, the Digimon are no longer able to return to the Human world. While disappointing both sides have realized it's not so bad as there is plenty more to explore in the Digital world than the Human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been several years since the D-Reapers defeat, and the Digimon have matured somewhat. Guilmon, while still the happy little dino he's always been, has gained a new level of intelligence that could be considered comparable to a teenager. Renamon meanwhile has stayed almost the same, but new feelings of affection for Guilmon, something the dino has yet to notice, have her confused every time she's near him. As such, the pair have been traveling separately for some time, yet both have little idea of just what awaits them further down their paths....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Guilmon and Renamon meet by chance at a ruined city, deep in the Digital Jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Guilmon and Renamon stumble across a highly advanced city devoid of any creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Guilmon's path takes him to a beautiful valley hidden deep in the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Renamon's path takes her to a beautiful sparkling beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: Free choice.</span></div></div>",

Near perfect in that the momentary beauty of the morning is shattered by an echoing scream that rang through the jungle for a few miles, disturbing all creatures nearby in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the scream of a particular red dinosaur waking up and finding a bug the size of his head three inches from the end of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon was having a hard time not laughing as she disposed of the recently incinerated insect. \"It's ok Guilmon,\" she called up to the twitching mass huddled in the lowest branches of the nearby tree, \"I got rid of it, you can come down now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red and white dino looked reluctant as he slid to the ground, still looking around nervously as the sudden adrenaline rush made him quite twitchy for the moment. \"You never told me there would be bugs that big on this trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon shrugged as she started packing up the small camp they'd made, \"I told you we'd be dealing with all sorts of wildlife, including big bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you never said just HOW big.\" Guilmon persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon sighed and just let it slide as they finished packing up, shouldered their packs and pressed onward through the jungle, pausing every dozen yards or so to use an attack to clear away the thick vegetation to make a trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, once Guilmon had calmed down, he tried for a more normal conversation, \"Renamon, just what are we doing out here in the jungle anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going on the basis of a legend,\" Renamon replied simply, \"In an attempt to find a lost treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of treasure?\" Guilmon asked, \"Because silver and gold I can take, even something like gemstones, but if it's something hokey like 'self-discovery' I'll be upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon chuckled at that remark. \"Well, I honestly don't know what the treasure is Guilmon. All I know is it's rumored that deep in this jungle lies an ancient city with untold value, many Digimon have searched, but while some came up empty handed, those who plunged the deepest depths of the jungle never returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Guilmon huffed, \"It's that kind of talk that makes me want to leave right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon turned as if to leave, but tripped on a root as he did so. Landing at the base of the nearby tree, it was even more startling when the ground gave way under him and he began to fall. Renamon barely saved her companion by grabbing hold of the tip of his tail just in the nick of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon,\" She called, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Came the slightly muffled reply as he dangled upside down in the hole, \"But I think I hit my head. I'm seeing a faint light down a long tunnel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minuted later the pair were in the tunnel, Guilmon almost having been ungraciously dropped on his head thanks to Renamon start of surprise at hearing about the light. The pair proceeded down the tunnel and soon came upon an amazing site. The tunnel ended at a cliff that plunged downwards several hundred feet into a gigantic cavern. Above them the roots of old trees dangled like some sort of woven ceiling. But under that was truely incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vast domed city lay spread out before them. Easily ten miles wide from that they could see, almost reaching right up to the cave wall. Inside the dome, the city glowed with light, and every building was like some futuristic tower, curved and arching, full of all sorts of structural achievements that could not be made with crude efforts using wood or stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for all it's wondrous design, there was something eery about it. Guilmon was the first to notice. \"The city is empty,\" he breathed, almost afraid to hear his voice echo in the cave, \"How is that possible Renamon? It looks like it was just built yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Renamon gave a cocky sort of smirk as she pulled a grappling hook from her pack, \"But I intend to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes of tens repelling down the cliff face found them standing next to the city. It was creepy in a way. They stood on the edge of a perfectly manicured lawn, so uniform it looked like every blade of grass was the same length. And yet it stopped perfectly in line with the dome around it, leaving it to the rocky ground the pair stood on. This in itself might not have been unusual had the dome been solid, but when Guilmon reached out to touch the dome, his hand slid right through it. It was like a giant soap bubble almost, pushing through, while not as easy as walking in a room, was still far easier than trying to break through glass as one might assume the make of the dome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both were in the city and standing on the finely trimmed lawn. The more he looked around, the more Guilmon felt uneasy. There was a stillness in the air that was so thick it seemed almost as if severe pain would come to anyone who should break it. The air too smelled funny. Fresh and pure, but also tinged with the faintest smell of metal, as if it, like the city, had been manufactured.</span></div></div>",

This was not the case though, as in the distance they spotted a group of flying metallic objects approaching. Just when Renamon was getting ready to run, the objects began to slow and approached them before stopping just five feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were robots, that was clear, but they didn't look to be Digimon of any kind. Bronze in color, they had an oblong torso that extended up from a small glowing plate that seemed to give them the ability to hover. The backs of their hands seemed rounded as well, added to the wide brimmed dome shape on top of their heads, it could be presumed that the robots could curl up into a tight ball for easy storage. Their eyes were an emotionless blue that glowed with no visible signs of intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots attempted to speak, or so Renamon and Guilmon could only guess, as the noise they made sounded like a pack of wolves drowning in pudding. After a moment of silence the robots tried again, this time sounding like a robotic cat destroying a orchestra pit full of harps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they want from us?\" Guilmon asked Renamon as he tried to withstand the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the noise ceased and the Robots spoke in perfect English this time. \"Welcome home masters.\" it said in a voice that seemed to almost have emotion, but not quite. \"We trust your journey has been rewarding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon and Renamon looked at eachother in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come,\" the robot continued, \"Your quarters have been prepared and cleaned to perfection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the group of half a dozen robots surrounding them now, Renamon shrugged and started walking with Guilmon close behind. No matter the pace it seemed, the robots stayed the same distance ahead or behind them. Eventually, as they pushed deeper into the city, they came to the tallest building in the exact center. The lead robot extended one of it's fingers into a key-like slot and the doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, both Digimon could that lobby, if that's what it was, was sparsely decorated with a large metallic desk along one wall and several metal chairs on the other. The creepy thing was everything was almost too perfect. As the Robots continued to lead them to some sort of elevator, both Renamon and Guilmon wondered what sort of wird place they had discovered.</span></div></div>",

The whole thing was one gigantic room, easily as wide as the whole building. The walls were a tangerine coloring and the floors were carpeted with a thick tan colored wall-to-wall rug. Probably the oddest thing about the room though was its features. It held two gigantic beds on either side of the room facing each-other, each looking big enough to have a game of tennis on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt right angles to both of the beds were two large in-ground baths, already steaming with warm water. And to add to the odd set up, in each of the four corners of the room, were corner kitchens, each corning having a fridge, stove, and preparation area. And in each seemed to be a squat robot wearing a chefs hat already preparing food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All for you masters,\" The lead robot said ushering them into the huge room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon couldn't stop from ginning ear to ear. \"Renamon, I think we've hit the jackpot.\" he smiled, \"These robots think we're their masters and want to wait on us hand and foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon looked a bit unsure as she glanced around the room though. \"Are you sure that's a good idea Guilmon?\" she asked as she tried to ignore the nearest robot preparing what looked to be her favorite meal of chicken and rice, \"I mean, what if they turn on us or something? This room could be a elaborately disguised jail-cell for all we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah get over it Renamon,\" Guilmon smiled stripping off his few clothes and sliding into the nearest bath, \"If it looks bad we'll fight our way out, it's that simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon looked unsure as she glanced back at the elevator doors which seemed to be flanked by two more robots. Both offline it looked like, but it was hard to tell.</span></div></div>",

Practically like sleeping on a silken cloud.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The afternoon has been quite luxurious. Both she and Guilmon had enjoyed the warm pools immensely, soft water jets playing over their bodies the whole time, relaxing every muscle like a deep massage. Before long both had been brought food by the robotic staff. Chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables for Renamon and what looked to be a small bakery's worth of bread and bucket of peanut butter for Guilmon. Both ended up eating as they lounged about. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon had told herself she should get up, explore, look around, plan possible escape routes... But every time she got up the urge the water just felt too good to leave. The servants even lowers a device made of four huge TVs, two facing the opposing beds and two he far ends of the tubs. From there they gave the pair controllers so Guilmon and Renamon could play video games.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon had watched Rika play some but have never really had time for games herself. Guilmon on the other hand was slightly more experienced. Pulling up a FPS Guilmon and Renamon made their selections. It took the first five kills from Guilmon before Renamon began to get the hang of it. After they'd gamed for a bit and their meals digested the robots brought more food for both of them. Renamon picked at it somewhat but Guilmon stuffed his face once more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After about twenty rounds the pair tried another game, this time racing. Again Renamon lost for a while until she got the hang of the controls, but she soon was beating Guilmon with ease. After that came a fighting game and more snacks from the robots. Now Renamon was in her element.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It still took a couple losses before she got the hang of the controls, but she soon was beating Guilmon with ease.After that came a big dinner as both agreed to just watch a movie while they relaxed. When it had ended and both had sampled some desert, the pair were helped out of the pools by the robots, toweled off, and then tucked into bed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon groaned a little, feeling her stomach stretched with so much food she hadn't intended to eat, the round bulge making it seem like she'd swallowed a basketball. Distantly on the opposite bed she could make out Guilmon who seemed to be sporting an even larger bulge and yet was snoozing soundly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon rolled over with a sigh and tried to get some sleep. She made a promise to herself as she dozed off, she would eat less the next day and exercise more, but could she keep it?</span></div></div>",

Can you?\" Guilmon shook his head walking over to the edge of the lawn and looking over the wall that surrounded the lawn they were on. \"I guess we should look around eh. Maybe we'll find that treasure you heard about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the small yard and began walking down what could loosely be called a road. It wasn't paved but was instead made of the same strange and slightly ceramic material the buildings were made of. As they neared an intersection Guilmon paused and tapped his claw against a building wall. The noise it produced was slightly harmonic, almost like a bell or something. \"What is this stuff.\" Asked Guilmon, a note of awe in his voice as he played a short tune on the wall. Renamon stiffened slightly then pressed her paw against the wall, muffling the noise, and motioned for Guilmon to be quite. She looked up the road and waited a moment. \"What is it?\" whispered Guilmon. \"Shhh, someone's coming.\" She replied, clamping her hand over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word a moment later a young boy went running by, he was clad in blue armor and had a head of spiky brown hair. Barely had he left then a bunch of squat robots with a single glowing eye came bustling in then out again, pursuing the blue armored boy. After the strange procession had left Renamon released her grip on Guilmon, who gasped for air, his face slightly tinged blue. Renamon walked over to the corner and peaked round both ways. \"Should we follow them? He may need help, and at the very least he might be able to tell us something about this place.\" She glanced back at Guilmon who was leaning against the wall trying to catch his breath. Renamon smiled apologetically. \"Sorry Guilmon. Too tight?\" Guilmon growled \"C'mon lets go. And next time let me keep you from breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon walks up to the center of the crossing with Renamon and looks both ways. \"So should we follow them or look around somewhere else?\"</span></div></div>",

Guilmon laughed \"You know me, always up for a fight.\" And with that they both took off in the direction the boy had run<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short dash they rounded a corner and nearly bumped into one of the robot things. It immediately turned towards them and made a grating, electronic noise that definitely did not sound friendly. Guilmon reacted first hitting it hard with he's claws and yelling rock breaker. The robot was knocked back, flipping over and exploding upon impact with the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon covered his head with his arm as small bits of it came raining down. \"Well that was easy.\" He said grinning at Renamon who plucked a few pieces of metal from her fur. Renamon looked over his shoulder, her face paling slightly. \"What is it.\" Asked Guilmon, looking behind himself to see over thirty of the things. All staring at them with those glowing red eyes. \"Umm. Should we run?\" Asked Guilmon. As one all the robots tilted backwards revealing a black hole at their base. Guilmon took a step back, then as if taking that as a signal all the Robots shot out large balls of spinning fire. Guilmon and Renamon dodged back around the corner as the torrent of fire burst from the alley. \"Yes Guilmon. I think we should run.\" Renamon replied. \"C'mon, back the way we came.\" She said pointing in the direction they had come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than they pushed off the wall than another group of robots had slid out of the alley opposite them, cutting off their escape route. \"Dammit!\" cursed Renamon turning to face the robots that appeared from the original alley, completely surrounding them. \"So, fight our way out?\" Asked Guilmon standing back to back to her. \"Well, it's either try or die I suppose.\"Said Renamon. Both digimon took up fighting stances as the robots tilted backwards ready to fire. Suddenly a line of robots exploded as they where hit by small balls of red energy. Both the digimon looked up to the top of one of the shorter buildings to see the boy in blue armor shooting a arm mounted gun into the crowd of  robots. Renamon and Guilmon nodded to each other and then dashed into the crowd destroying robots with their power paw and rock breaker attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the Robots where reduced to a smoking mound of scrap and the boy leapt down from his position and walked towards them. Guilmon stepped forward his claw extended. \"Thanks for the help. Do you live round here?\" The young boy accepted the offered claw and shook it firmly. \"Your welcome. My names Megaman Volnutt, and I should really thank you. Those reaverbots have been chasing me for ages.\" Renamon stepped up next to Guilmon. \"So those things are called reaverbots then. Why where they attacking you. Your not a digimon are you?\" Megamon shrugged. \"I'm a digger, I go around to ruins looking for power sources called refractors. Needless to say they are valuable and protected by the robots that we just destroyed. So that's my story, what's yours?\" Asked Megaman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Guilmon answered \"Our names are Renamon and Guilmon. We were looking for treasure in the forest above when we, well, I fell into an entrance and, here we are.\" Megaman nodded then turned towards a large tower that was roughly central to the city. \"I did some reseach on this city before I came. As well as having a large refractor they posses an advanced machine that can change the physical properties of anything. Such as gold from anything from wood or whatever. would you be interested in helping me get the refractor in exchange for my services to get to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glint passed through Renamons eyes. \"Excuse us a second Megaman.\" She said as she pulled Guilmon aside. \"We should help him. He helped us after all.\" Said Guilmon. \"Your right, but this refractor thing sounds valuable as well.\" They both glance at Megaman who is inspecting his gun arm.</span></div></div>",

Lets go.\" Megaman nodded and motioned along the road towards the tower. \"This way.\" Then began running along the road. A light tinkling coming from their claws against the roads surface. As they got closer to the Tower they noticed that a few walls seemed to be knocked down and a building was totally destroyed. Megaman stopped suddenly and held up his hand. Signalling them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Asked Renamon, not sensing any danger. \"Something is wrong around here. Generally the Reaverbots are programed to not damage the city they protect but this looks like it was done by a big one. We should be on our guard.\" Guilmon laughed \"C'mon we can take whatever this place throws at us.\" He took a step forward and was suddenly thrown from his feet as a huge robot burst from the ruins of a building. The Robot turned towards their group, raising the huge club like appendages attached to its arms. It's single red eye glowing with malevolence. \"Watch out!\" Yelled Megaman as he jumped away from the robot as it slammed it's arms against the ground. Causing a large explosion which knocked everyone against nearby walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon does the term be careful even register for you?\" Asked Renamon as she got up and launched herself at the attacking robot. Guilmon chuckled to him self and did likewise \"Nope. Why do you ask.\" Guilmon said as he ducked under a clumsy swing and launched a fireball at the smoking hole Megaman had made a second before. This caused a small chain of explosions which linked up with another series that Renamon had caused on it's back. Everyone backed away quickly as the explosions increased in violence and engulfed the mechanical warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the explosion cleared several diamond like objects fell to the ground. Megaman stepped forward and crouched to gather them up. Renamon and Guilmon moved closer to try and see what they were. Megaman stood up and held out his diamond filled hands to Guilmon. \"These are refractors. Small ones of course but they should be able to power the machine I was telling you about when we find it.\" Guilmon took the crystals and held them up to the light. They sparkled brilliantly, blue and purple in colour. \"Are they valuable?\" Asked Renamon. \"These ones aren't worth much, but the larger ones can fetch a fair bit.\" Replied Megaman as he turned and continued along the path. Guilmon put the refractors in his backpack and followed suit while Renamon looked at the wreckage of the reaverbot. Just that handful of gems had powered that huge robot. No wonder bigger ones must be valuable. she shook herself out of it and ran to catch up to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she caught up they were entering a courtyard that lead to the front of the tower. Guilmon noticed that here to, the lawn was perfectly manicured. \"Megaman, do you know where the people who built this city are? This place looks like it was made yesterday.\" Asked Guilmon. Megaman glanced up at the ceiling. \"I have no idea who lived here or where they went. There are places like this all over the worlds. But as far as I know it's the reaverbots that keep the place from falling into disrepair.\" Megaman walked up to the front door. Which was completely smooth and featureless, save for a panel next to it. He was about to enter something on the keypad when he hesitated and looked at them both. \"Be careful it's likely there will be a guard inside, trying to stop people from stealing stuff.\" Guilmon and Renamon nodded and stepped away from the door getting ready to react to anything. Megaman nodded back and pressed a botton on the panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the door way slid silently open. Whats inside?</span></div></div>",

Renamon dashed forward, teleported behind it, launching a flurry of sharp diamonds at the base of the creatures neck. It stumbled to the ground and thrashed a bit. But quickly got up again and faced them. Guilmon and Megaman had gotten back to their feet and where ready to counter attack when the robot defender raised it's head then spewed fire at them. As they dodged the flame Megaman noticed sparks emitting from it's neck where Renamon had attacked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it tried to train Renamon and Guilmon's movements Megaman took aim and shot it in the neck. The hit penetrated and a large explosion ripped through it, breaking it apart. Guilmon and Renamon brushed soot from their fur while Megaman entered the room, checking for more reaverbots. As he returned Renamon and Guilmon had gathered up the large number of scattered refractor crystals and deposited them in Guilmons backpack. \"Okay the areas clear, we're almost there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the tower Guilmon and Renamon where awestruck by the scale and complexity of the architecture. On the outside the building was simplicity itself, a plain if impressive tower. On the inside however the ceramic material had been crafted into rooms and pathways around the inside of the tower creating a dizzying effect when looked at from below. A lite almost ethereal wind blew throughout, playing a soft tune as it blew up along the center of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman called them over to where he was standing on a small platform with another panel beside to it. As they reached him he pressed a few buttons and they began to descend. As the floor rose up level to them Renamon turned to Megaman and asked \"So how far do we have to go down?\" Megaman glanced at the panel for a second. \"Not far, we should be there in a moment. And according to that thing there should be a control panel or something in the same room. You can find directions to the machine you seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lift they were standing on slowed to a halt and a pair of doors opened in front of them.

To the side of the room, attached to the wall was a large screen with a keyboard below it. Megaman began walking towards the keyboard saying \"I should be able to find a map of the complex on this thing. Could you go and get that refractor down and bring it over here. Thanks.\" Renamon and Guilmon nodded, approaching the refractor cautiously. If someone had bothered to construct robots it made sense if the crystal was protected in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the refractor Guilmon shrugged and reached out for it. But was stopped by Renamon pulling him back. \"It's probably booby trapped. Maybe I should try to snatch it.\" Guilmon nodded and took a few steps back. When Renamon was happy with his distance she herself took a step back then took a running jump at it. Snatching the refractor from the air and landing smoothly on the other side of it's pedestal. \"Nice.\" Declared Guilmon, clapping at her performance. Megaman coughed from over at the computer. \"Yeah, it was pretty impressive. But I had already deactivated the security system. Anyway come over here, Iv'e found the the maps you'll need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon glared at him for a moment then followed Guilmon to have a look at the screen. \"You're in luck. The machine is in this building, all you have to do is use the elevator to get the the right level and there seems to be an exit of some sort in that room. So leaving and coming back again should be easy. Whats more the people who lived here before seem to, by chance, speak English. Most of the information I found on this thing had English translations next to it.\"  Just then a walkie talkie at Megamans hip crackled to life. \"Megaman can you hear me? We need to leave now! The Bonnes are in the area and they're still looking for you.\" Said a young woman, her voice distorted by heavy static. Megaman raised the walkie talkie to his mouth and answered \"Roger. I've got the refractor and I'll be there as soon as I can.\" He clipped it back on his hip. and glanced at the lift door then back at the digimon. \"Sorry, but we have to get in the elevator and get going.\" Renamon handed the Refractor to Megaman and they all ran into the elevator. Megaman tapped a key on it's controls and the lift began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it reached the level they had arrived on and Megaman got off. He was about to run to meet up with his friend when he paused and turned back. \"It's been nice to meet you both, maybe we'll meet again in another ruin, eh. Oh and just press the up button twice and you'll be on the right level. See ya.\" With that he turned and ran out the door. Guilmon pressed the button shaped like an arrow and they began ascending again. \"Strange guy. Seems nice enough though.\"  Remarked Renamon offhandedly. Guilmon nodded as he inspected the panel in front of him. It was covered in buttons who's meanings seemed to be showed through their shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon's attention was drawn from the controls as Renamon nudged him, \"We're here.\" She said as the doors slid open. They stepped out into a relativity small room with a large computer console that bordered off one corner of the area. But the majority of the rooms space was taken up by a large platform with all sorts of wires hanging above it, leading to a pair of large electrodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it definitely looks impressive. Do you think it works?\" Asked Guilmon. Renamon shrugged and walked over to the platform and began looking around it, searching for some place to insert the refractors they had gathered. \"Guilmon, could you look for anything that might start this thing.\" Guilmon nodded and walked over to the control bench, taking off his backpack and standing it behind him. Looking over the expansive set of buttons and knobs Guilmon noticed one that looked like the on switch of a computer. \"Hey, Renamon, did you find anything yet?\"She was laying on her stomach inspecting something near the floor. \"No. You?\" Came her muffled voice. \"Yeah I think so, come over here just in case something happens.\" Renamon pushed herself off the ground and walked over to stand next to him. Guilmon noticed that she stood slightly closer than was necessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon pressed the on button and the control panel in front of them hummed with power, lights all over it flickering to life. Suddenly a holographic screen appeared in front of them displaying a warning. It read \"Power is insufficient. Insert new power supply? Y/N\" and next to that was a load of incomprehensible glyphs that probably said the same thing. Guilmon looked around the panel for a regular keyboard or something. There didn't seem to be one but he did notice a pair of buttons shaped like a tick and a cross. He pressed the tick and a small panel opened front of them, revealing several clips of different sizes containing grey and dull looking refractors. Guilmon smiled and opened his bag, pulling out the new ones and replacing them. Once all the clips were full the screen flashed for a moment and was replaced by another which read. \"Welcome to the room of configeration. Please place an object or living creature and select modifications.\" \"Hmmm.\" said Renamon. \"Looks interesting.\" She shuffled through her bag looking for something to test on and came up with an apple. \"Try finding a gold option.\" She went over and placed it on the platform. Meanwhile Guilmon had found options that changed anything into any other substance. Sounds very intriguing thought Guilmon. He eventually found a gold option and selected it. There was a sudden flash of light from on the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Guilmon and Renamon's eyes readjusted the apple was still there but it had turned yellow and was shining brightly. It had turned to solid gold while perfectly maintaining its shape. Renamon went up to have a closer look. As she picked it up and hefted it up she called to Guilmon \"Yep it seems real. Guilmon, we could make millions off this.\" Guilmon wasn't paying that much attention, as he had noticed two things. One some of the options were things he had fantasied about for ages and two, Renamon was standing on the platform, staring at the golden apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon grinned to himself. He had to do it it was just to tempting. And besides they should learn the effects of this thing has on living creatures. What does he choose?</span></div></div>",

Guilmon was again blinded by a flash of light, when he could see again he noticed that Renamon had stayed roughly the same colour, possibly lighter, and was kneeling on the platform with A paw to her head. Guilmon rushed from behind the platform and went over to help her stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guilmon Helped her stand Renamon pulled her paw away from her head, noticing that it was slightly tacky. She shook her head, trying to get herself reoriented.  Then she smelt something strange, it was a strong scent of artificial banana. \"Guilmon, you pervert.\" She growled realizing that he'd changed her into some sort of candy. She half heartedly threw her fist at his chest which smooshed on impact, loosing all definition. Guilmon just grinned. \"Don't worry, you'll get a turn to play with the machine soon, but I want to try a few things first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon was about to ask what when he pulled her close and kissed her passionately. \"Heh heh, Renamon, you taste like Bananas and cream.\" He whispered and kissed her again. He slowly moved down, kissing her on the cheek, then the neck and worked his way down to her breast. He began massaging one breast while kissing the other softly. Renamons raised he paws and put them on Guilmon's, head rubbing his muzzle gently. Guilmon looked up at her and smiled, \"This is where things get interesting\" He said and took a huge bite out of her left breast. Renamon tightened her grip in Guilmon's head as she felt his teeth dig into her, it didn't hurt. In fact it felt better than anything she had felt before. Guilmon pulled back, taking her tit with him and leaving a more or less flat patch were her breast used to be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon began chewing in a steady rhythm, which drew a moan from Renamon. She could feel every tooth moving through her body and it felt strangely sensual. After a fair bit of chewing Guilmon poked his tongue through her breast and began to blow into her in great, long breaths. Renamon felt the pressure building up inside her and when the bubble popped, covering Guilmon's face, she nearly fell off the platform from the sensations. Panting heavily Renamon smiled and pealed her breast from his muzzle. Guilmon took the moist blob from her and pressed it against her chest then deftly sculpted it back into shape. When Renamon looked down she was surprised to see that her breast was good as new. Even her nipple was exactly as she remembered it. She looked at Guilmon who blushed slightly, (or profusely, he has red skin, its hard to tell) and shrugged. \"Iv'e been taking sculpting classes. So anyway, there is just a few more things I want to try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what? Oh.\" Said Renamon as Guilmon crouched down and thrust his muzzle into her. He began licking her clit, probing deeply with his tongue. After a bit of that he pulled back and ran a claw down her stomach, then pretty much scooped out her pelvis. Renamon moaned louder expecting Guilmon to toss her pussy into his mouth. But instead he lowered her down gently then used his other claw to pull her substance out stretching it this way and that, rolling it into a ball between his paws then pushing it flat. Once he was satisfied he tossed the whole ball into his maw and began chewing with vigor. Renamon felt the familiar feeling of pleasure quickly building within her. But was unable to reach that peak of orgasm. Eventually Guilmon began to blow a bubble again and with no small amount of relief Renamon felt the pleasure build to it's limit. When the bubble was large enough Guilmon pressed his lips together and took the sealed bubble from his mouth. Renamon Growled angrily \"I never thought I would say this. But hurry up and pop me Guilmon.\" Guilmon smiled and raised his claw, poised next to it. \"Pop.\" He chuckled and poked it causing Renamon to orgasm explosively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she recovered Guilmon gathered her up and replaced her womanhood, molding it into the proper place. \"So was that as fun for you as it was for me?\" He asked grinning widely. \"I *pant* will *puff* get *pant* you for *sigh* this.\"  Guilmon laughed \"I hope so.\" Renamon sat up and kissed him on the cheek. \"Now go over there and change me back to normal. Okay.\" Guilmon just smiled wider and went over to change her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood behind the control panel he realized he didn't even know how to do that. He glanced over the panel noticing a button shaped like a circle made from an arrow.  Guilmon shrugged \"Looks like a reverse button to me.\" He mumbled to himself. He pressed the button and covered his eyes. After half a second he looked up to see Renamon inspecting her body. She looked up at Guilmon and smiled walking over to stand with him behind the control panel. \"So give me a quick run through of how this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Renamon was happy with their grasp on the machines functions. \"Okay Guilmon, it's my turn. Go stand on the platform and we'll have some fun.\" Guilmon nodded and walked around the console and did as she asked. He was curious as to what she would turn him into. As he stood on the platform, rocking lightly on his heels Renamon was looking over the many options that the machine possessed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Renamon tried to decide what to do to him Guilmon glanced at his watch (Kind of hard to imagine, huh?), noticing that it had gotten quite late since they had found the city. \"Hey Renamon, do you want to pack it in for the night after your done.\" Renamon was still engrossed and apparently hadn't heard, just mumbling. \"Yeah sure that sounds...\" She paused and looked up, giving Guilmon a smile that made him feel slightly uncomfortable. \"Like a great idea.\" She finished, looking back at the controls with a mischievous grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon was begining to get a bit worried now, whatever she was planning it was going to be big, \"Aha!\" Renamon declared in triumph, leaning against the panel and fixing Guilmon with a wide goofy grin. Guilmon covered his face with his claw. \"You have a horrible pun don't you Renamon?\" Asked Guilmon. Renamon nodded slowly, apparently enjoying his unnerve. \"Bed time.\" She giggled and lowered her finger to press the activation button. As she did Guilmon groaned loudly, that was really awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon was again blinded by the bright light, but this time he had the sensations to go with it. First his skin warmed slightly, then it seemed to stretch out in every direction. Suddenly Guilmon was overcome with a feeling of hollowness and as the brightness faded, a darkness quickly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guilmon came around he felt a pleasant fullness inside himself. It felt as if he was floating in a sea of warm, still water. A pair of furry paws on his waist brought him to his senses. Suddenly his view swung wildly as the paws lifted him into an upright position. It was Renamon, she was holding him up, panting heavily. \"So any guesses what you are?\" She asked. Guilmon Tried to shake his head but found that he was immobile. \"Nope, not a clue.\" He said although he had one or two ideas she was enjoying herself to much for him to ruin it. although he was slightly relieved that he still had all his senses, and the ability to talk, which is kind of strange if you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you a hint.\" Giggled Renamon pushing him backwards. For a second Guilmon panicked, as he couldn't stop himself from falling, or even brace for impact. But he was surprised as he lightly hit the ground and even bounced a bit. Sending strange vibrations through him, not unpleasant just strange. He was even more surprised when Renamon crouched next to him and ran her paw over his now flat surface. He felt her every hair lightly brushing against his skin, which to Guilmon's surprise squeaked slightly. \"Renamon, you turned me into an inflatable mattress, didn't you?\" He said. \"Yep.\" Answered Renamon brightly as she stood up and walked away. As she left Guilmons field of vision he called out after her. \"So what do I look like?\" Renamon's footsteps paused for a second. \"Like a large red and white inflatable mattress with eyes, a mouth and that cute digital hazard symbol on your stomach.\" Guilmon smiled, this was going to be a interesting night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the sound of it she was shuffling around in their bags, probably looking for the pillows and blankets they had brought with them. As she came back within Guilmon's line of site, she had the guessed items over her shoulder. She tossed the Blanket onto the ground next to him and laid the pillow near his face, well the area near his eyes and mouth. Then she looked him over one more time and eased herself down on to him. Guilmon would have shivered if he could, the feeling of Renamons legs and buttocks sliding smoothly over his surface was quickly arousing him. Then her thick tail began brushing around, constantly tickling his chest and groin areas. All of which were more sensitive than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                   -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon stretched herself out on Guilmon who was easily big enough to accommodate her. She rolled over on her stomach, smiling as she felt her breasts press up against him, her nipples rubbing across his skin. She smiled wider, if this felt anything like earlier when he had turned her to gum then he must be going wild. She glanced over to his face and giggled. His eyes were unfocused and he had a goofy grin on his face. Yep he was enjoying this. She moved her tail around some more watching Guilmon's expression as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this for a while Renamon noticed Guilmon refocus and look at her. She leaned over and kissed him, he kissed her back and smiled. \"I think this is the best thing we ever found.\" Renamon laughed, rolling on her back. \"Definitely.\" She replied. She reached over and grabbed the blanket tossing it over the pair of them. She readjusted it making sure it didn't cover Guilmon's mouth or eyes. Renamon rubbed her hand against Guilmon's chest, feeling the warmth of his body. Guilmon moaned softly, his eyes unfocusing again. \"Good night Guilmon.\" She said, then she laid her head against the pillow and began drifting off. Her thoughts full of the things they could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                    ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon heard Renamon say something then move around a bit, readjusting her body. Eventually only her tail was moving and then even that stopped, her only movements a soft rise and fall of her chest as she slept. As Guilmon felt sleep start to blur his perceptions he fixated on Renamon and the warmth her body spread throughout him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                    ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon was stirred by Renamon moving about, her tail sweeping around more. A nice sensation to wake up to. \"Morning.\" He mumbled sleepily. Renamon kissed him and got up, stretching her back. \"Well, please turn me back?\" Asked Guilmon. Renamon nodded and lifted the bedding off him, tossing them towards the rooms wall. Renamon then picked him up and placed him on the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light later and Guilmon was in his proper shape again. He cricked his neck and walked over to stand with Renamon behind the Controls. \"Have a nice slee..\" she was cut off as Guilmon grabbed her and kissed her passionately.  As they separated Guilmon was already pondering what he would do to, or with Renamon next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renamon blushed, slightly unbalanced by Guilmon sudden kiss, but she quickly regained her composure and leaned against his shoulder. \"So I guess we're officially going out now?\" Guilmon just gave her a funny look and kissed her on the cheek. \"I thought we were already.\" Renamon felt her blush deepen. \"Yes I suppose we are.\" She replied happily \"So do you have any ideas on what to do next?\" Guilmon was looking from the display to the controls scrolling through the massive list of choices. Whoever made this thing sure was thorough, thought Renamon as she scratched an itch that had developed behind her ear, noticing a few \"explicit\" options, that Guilmon glanced at thoughtfully, they were probably a bit perverted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon clapped his paws together, making Renamon start in surprise, \"Ok I think I've go an idea. Could you please go stand on the platform?\" Renamon nodded and began walking over to the platform. \"Any hints to what you have in mind?\" She asked as she stepped up onto the pedestal. Guilmon just shook his head. \"The surprise is half the fun.\" He looked back at the controls then pressed a few buttons. Renamon was blinded by the now familiar flash of light and she began to feel the changes. Her breasts tingled lightly as they seemed to increase in size, then she felt her labia spread out and become round which was strange, but gave her an idea as to what Guilmon had chosen. Suddenly She felt herself lose all her weight and a strange emptiness come over her. As she lost consciousness Renamon wondered if this is what Guilmon felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                           ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon chuckled to himself as he watched Renamon collapse in on herself shortly after becoming a Blow up doll. Guessing from his own experiences she was probably unconscious at the moment and wouldn't wake up till she was full of air. Guilmon Walked from behind the platform to inspect her, he rummaged through the pile of plastic and found Renamons shoulders. Lifting her up Guilmon almost laughed. She looked more or less the same but with several differences, first her mouth had become a perfect circle, as was her pussy, designed to receive phallic objects. Secondly her nipples and navel had become air nozzles complete with cap. Not to mention the plastic sheen that covered her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to himself Guilmon sat down on the platform took a deep breath and put her navel nozzle to his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Guilmon noticed Renamon start to move on her own. As he kept blowing her movements became more pronounced and steady. Soon after she began to moan groggily. \"Guilmon. What are you doing?\" Renamon asked, her voice slurred heavily. Guilmon smiled, he had a bad pun he just had to throw at her. He changed his grip from her waist to under her arms and looked into her dazed and sleepy eyes, \"Blowing you.\" Even in her state Renamon groaned loudly. Guilmon moved his lips to her nipple and began blowing more air into them. Renamons moan changed in pitch slightly, signaling to Guilmon that she was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral strong gusts later Renamon was more mobile and alert, she inspected her inflated body while Guilmon sat nearby watching her happily. She was touching her \"enhanced\" breasts tentatively, as her paw brushed up against her nipple she quivered visibly and looked at Guilmon, \"I guess it is your turn to get some release.\" She said seductively. She walked slowly towards Guilmon, her every step light and almost silent. Guilmon was by this time thoroughly aroused and had a goofy grin plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon reached out and placed her paw on the head of Guilmon's cock. \"So what are you waiting for?\" Guilmon needed no further encouragement and almost leaped on top of her. He began firmly massaging her new breasts eliciting a moan from Renamon and a soft squeak from her rubbery body. Guilmon laid down with her positioned himself above Renamon and slowly slid his cock inside her. As he began thrusting in a steady motion he opened one of Renamon's nipple valves and began blowing into her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                 -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increase in pressure from Guilmon's weight and his additional inflation efforts seemed to make Renamons skin more sensitive. She could feel Guilmons rough skin rubbing against her, his breath across her face and every vein on the organ within her. As she got closer to climax she could feel another type of pressure within her, it was the warmth of Guilmons breath. The air inside her was in constant motion, tickling and stimulating her from the inside as Guilmon worked her from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Guilmon rolled over and spread her legs wider, fucking her from below, Renamon began pushing harder against him, flexing her pelvic, \"muscles\"? Well somehow she squeezed Guilmon's manhood for all it was worth and felt it tense inside her. She could tell by Guilmon's face that he was trying to hold back as long as he could, but they both reached orgasm soon. First Renamon then Guilmon immediately after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they lay next to each other panting and occasionally kissing, Renamon was thinking, this is way too fun. We need to find some way to make this machine mobile. Guilmon kissed her one last time and got up. \"So would you like to be turned back to normal now.\" He asked Renamon nodded and pushed herself to her feet, a surprisingly easy task because while she weighed next to nothing she hadn't lost any of her strength, which made no sense really. Shrugging off that strange impossibility Renamon stood on the platform and was blinded a second later by the flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her original body Renamon noticed for the first time the rumblings of hunger. \"Hey Guilmon, do you want to find that exit Megaman told us about earlier and have some food outside?\" Guilmon looked around the room frowning slightly. \"Hey yeah, he did say there was an exit in here. But I can't see another door beside the elevator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother door. Thought Renamon, maybe she could. Renamon dashed over to the wall and picked up the blanket she had thrown there earlier. She put it on the platform then went over behind the controls. Guilmon was watching all this with keen interest. \"What's your idea Renamon.\" He asked the yellow vixen. She answered as she looked through the options. \"Well I figured that we might be able to create a doorway to another place.\" Guilmon Walked over to her and looked over her shoulder. Renamon finally found what she wanted, a option labeled doorway. As she selected it she found it was actually a sub folder with options from selecting locations to inputting geographical coordinates. \"Oh wow, that's awesome. This will make getting gold to a safe house easy. As well as letting us come back here at any time.\" said Guilmmon from beside her as he wrapped his arms around her waist. swaying side to side slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon typed in the location of a secluded beach she knew of and pressed activation button. After the light died down a large wooden door stood in the blankets place Guilmon and Renamon approached it and Renamon took hold of the brass door knob and turned it. As the door swung open the salty smell of sea air wafted in through the door. Followed by a bright shaft of sunlight and the sound of waves crashing against the shore. '\"Wow.\" Breathed Guilmon while Renamon curiously looked behind the door. On the other side she could see a thick tropical forest. Which she knew for a fact was what faced the ocean on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon ran over and picked the pillow up and placed it inside the door, preventing it from closing, then went and fetched the backpacks. Renamon took hers and nodded thanks. Then they both stepped through the door and onto the sandy beach. They chose a spot and laid down, getting out some of the food and drink that they had brought with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began to eat Guilmon paused for a moment. \"Ya know, when we set out to find that place, I said that as long as we found valuable stuff and nothing \"hokey\" like self discovery i'd be happy. Well I take it back. I think what we found was potential, pure potential.\" Renamon giggled to herself, recently Guilmon had been hit by the occasional poetic flash. \"Well, after your finished eating do you what to explore that \"potential\" some more?\" Guilmon smiled and wolfed down the fruit he was holding then got up and practically ran back through the door. Renamon ran after him and was soon back in the strange room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived Guilmon closed the door after her. He was about to go behind the controls, presumably to change the door back when Renamon put an arm on his shoulder to stop him. \"Leave it as it is, could you pick it up and stand it near the wall?\" Guilmon nodded and easily lifted the door, standing it where she indicated. As Guilmon went to stand on the platform Renamon walked over to the controls, several beach related ideas running around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" asked Renamon a few seconds later. \"Ready.\" Replied Guilmon, giving her the thumbs up sign. Renamon pressed the activation button and looked away. Guilmon had been transformed into a... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renamon giggled to herself as the light dimmed, she couldn't wait to see both Guilmons new form, as well as his reaction. Renamon walked from behind the control panel and went over to the platform to pick him up. Where Guilmon had stood a few seconds before a pile of Red and white fabric now sat. Renamon picked him up and held him by his straps. Again Guilmon had taken on the shape and material of the object without changing his colours. His eyes where located on the chest area, right where her nipples would end up, his mouth was just below that and cutely enough his digi-hazard symbol was in the place her pussy would rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what am I now?\" Asked Guilmon smiling and trying to get a better look at himself. \"Well having a visit to the beach made me think, we haven't had a nice, slow rest for a while. We've either been running around exploring or having pretty interesting... well, I guess you would have to call it sex, it's certainly been fun enough. So this time I turned you into a swimsuit.\" Guilmon chuckled. Renamon placed Guilmon over her shoulder and changed some things they didn't really need into a pair of sunglasses and a towel. Then they, well, she walked over to the door and opened it again, revealing the beautiful surf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Renamon found a place she was happy with she laid out the towel and took Guilmon from her shoulder. \"You ready for this part?\" She asked lowering him to her feet and stretching him open a little. Guilmon laughed, \"Of course, who wouldn't want to go sunbathing with his girlfriend.\" Renamon chuffed at his \"directness\", then lowered her leg into him, working it into the proper leg hole. She did likewise with her other leg then began pulling him up towards her waist, making sure to go as slowly as possible to tease him. Once his bottom was nice and snug against her crotch she pulled his straps over her shoulder and adjusted his fit. She felt her tail being pushed up against her back, which was pretty uncomfortable, and began trying to figure out how to fix that when she noticed that there was even a hole in Guilmon's back for her to thread her tail through. As she did Guilmon let out a soft moan of pleasure. \"Hey Renamon, wanna take a guess what part of me your tails going through?\" Renamon looked down at her chest to see Guilmon's eyes out of focus again and a thin line of drool running from the corner of his mouth. \"I think I can assume it's your backside?\" Guilmon smiled and mumbled something in agreement, almost completely out of it. As Renamon got her whole tail through Guilmon's hole she paused to wonder, \"So if you have a tail hole in you does that mean the creators of the machine had tails as well?\" Guilmon probably couldn't care less right now so Renamon just shrugged it off, a movement that caused her breasts to jiggle slightly and Guilmon to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon giggled as she laid down on her towel, \"Does that feel interesting Guilmon?\" Asked Renamon, her nipples hardening slightly as she thought of Guilmon wrapped so tightly against her body. Again Guilmon just gave a incomprehensible answer. Renamon smiled and began run her hands down her perfect figure, concentrating around the areas that Guilmon covered. \"C'mon Guilmon, hold up your side of the conversation.\" teased Renamon. Guilmon shut his eyes tightly for a second then looked up at her and asked. \"Renamon, where are we exactly?\" Renamon looked out at the ocean for a moment. \"This is an island off the coast of Hawaii. I heard about it on the internet as a romantic area, Why.\" Guilmon looked round suddenly, well as much as his immobile position would let him. \"So you mean this place is in the real world?\" Finally catching on Renamon lept up. \"God, Guilmon you're right. I thought we where stuck in the digiworld forever. We so gotta tell everyone about this machine.\" Guilmon paused, obviously in deep thought. \"That can probably wait till later hmm?\" Renamon settled herself back down, \"Your right, we could take a little while longer to enjoy our selves.\" She said giggling some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of relaxing in the sun Guilmon asked. \"Renamon,</span></div></div>",

Even over the distance between world Rika could guess they had something going between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock from the door, Rika didn't look, up engrossed with the internet, and answered \"Come in.\" she heard they door knob being turned then spun round, that came from the wall opposite the bathroom and hallway. As she turned towards the sound Rika saw possibly the last thing she expected to see. Renamon and Guilmon standing in front of a strange door grinning widely at her. Rika glanced through the door behind them, seeing a pale white room she didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika stared at them both, completely dumbfounded. they room they came from was a floor off the ground! And thats just the first thing. \"Renamon, Guilmon, How did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon sat on the bed near her while Guilmon just dropped himself onto the carpet. \"Boy have we got a story for you.\" exclaimed Guilmon happily.

Or more accurately, jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon had gone from a slim, trim, super athletic vixen, into a chubby, butterball, amazing-she-can-still-move tub of lard. Renamon's muzzle was nearly nonexistent as her fat cheeks on either side rounded out her face to soft, cherubic like proportions. Both cheeks rested on the large ring of fat that encircled her head, replacing where her neck had been. Covering the front of it were at least three chins that sagged down like a small waterfall to rest just at the top of her cleavage. (We'll get there in a moment.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders were at least a foot broader and quite thick, her upper arms were now bigger around than her whole body used to be. Fat spilled down to cover her elbows slight, laying her forearms thick as her former thighs. Her hands were bloated affairs, topped with sausage-like fingers that looked like they could barely bend with how thick they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were quite impressive, big sagging mounds each as big as a large watermelon and tipped with nipples that looked as big as saucers. But they were tiny compared to her largest feature though. Her stomach was huge, sagging heavily passed her knees, it looked big enough to hold three of Guilmon inside with room to spare and jiggled with her every breath. Her fat love handles were so thick it would be impossible for Guilmon to grab hold of one in only one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back rolls cascaded down her wide backside, to cover the top of her tail, which looked noticeably shorter as it hung over her huge rear. Butt cheeks that looked big enough to fill a large armchair each sagged down against the back of her thighs. Each thigh looked as big around as Guilmons whole body and they sagged heavily over her knees, covering them completely in her folds. He shins and calves did the same to Renamons feet nearly, leaving only the bloated tips of her paws show. All in all she had to have been 700 pounds if not closer to 800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renamon regained her balance, she looked over at Guilmon. \"Guilmon?\" She asked, \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon was secretly glad he was behind the console as he was porting an almost painful erection he wasn't sure if he wanted to show Renamon yet. \"I'm... I'm fine Renamon...\" he muttered, unable to take his eyes off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look fine,\" she replied. Then she smiled, \"I get it. You're eager to use the machine yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon seemed unsure what to say and just continued to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, you can have a turn.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Guilmon was both shocked and confused at the creature that had engulfed Renamon's wide silloet, the dino digimon afraid that he might have transported Renamon into the gut of some beast.  Though as the smoke soon cleared, Guilmon was met with the image of several white furred blobs that quickly began to shake, it's owner frantically groaning and yelping.  She then squealed like a little girl as her legs quickly collapsed from under her, causing the fat blob to slap against the ground and jiggle violently from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon... are you... are you alright?\" Guilmon asked nervously, slowly approaching the massive tub of lard he had turned the fox into.  He only got an exhausted moan in response, quickly followed by constant heavy wheezing that would occasionally have a slight whistle to them.  Though, even with his nerves on edge, the red dino was soaking up the sights.  The massive white furred belly was titanic in scale, oozing and stretching across the floor creating a footprint that a small car could easily park in with room to spare.  The virus digimon gawked at how wide the belly was, it appeared more than twice as wide as the dino was long from the end of his nose to the tip of his lengthy tail.  His curiosity continued to push him to explore, noticing not that there was a massive cavernous fold of belly fat that could have been mistaken to have once been a belly button, not that there was already a very thin layer of sweat on her fur, but that on the furthest reaches of her belly he saw strange redish purple veins spreading out like a spiderweb.  Guilmon was not terribly surprised seeing the stretch marks on her, but the fact that he could see them on her did, as the fur, now been stretched so thin by the skin trying to contain the mountain of digimon, that in certain places, like at the furthest reaches of her belly, it had become diluted, semi transparent like a white or yellow fog of fur.  Curiously, Guilmon gave her belly a light poke with his long finger like claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YIP!!!\" Renamon breathlessly cried, Guilmon trying to look over the expanse of belly flesh to assess the situation.  Though the pile of lard in front of him was in fact too tall, the top of the white belly almost even with his eyes.  The mere hint of the idea that Renamon has reached the point of obesity to where the field of view in front of her was engulfed entirely by her own gluttonous body instantly made Guilmon's erection rock hard and for the little wings on his head to stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly began to travel down her side, having to waddle as the erection was quickly starting to grow painful.  It was easy to see the white mass could have easily enveloped both Renamon's legs and Guilmon entirely with room to spare, but desperately trying to free themselves from the fleshy blanket were massively bloated legs.  Renamon was flexible though, having to spread her legs out to the point where  if it was spread out any more she'd be doing the splits.  The cankle fat was near the end of eating her feet, Guilmon bent down to peer into the crater to find her white foot paw, bloated to obscene proportions and unable to do anything more than a microscopic wiggle.  The massive cankles then swelled out almost expodentially down the leg and exploded at her thigh.  It bloated outward, being so thick that Guilmon guessed that he wouldn't have been able to fit a large tractor tire around it.  A puddle soon developed when Guilmon started drooling at the large distorted purple coloration that he recognized was once the tattoos on her legs, unrecognizable now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ass, oh it was beautiful to him, maybe even rivaling the width of Renamon's belly, each the size of one of those large orange floaty things Guilmon saw bobbing about on the sea.  Perched on top like the cherry on an icecream sunday was her still bushy but slightly slower tail. He clearly saw, despite all the fur, that at it too had suffered severely from the weight.  Sticking out in a very slight arc, wiggling just lightly, it had bloated beyond uselessness like the rest of her, the base being as thick as his thick arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen up the stairway of back folds that continued up her neck, a section of flab pushing against the back of her head, causing the pointy yellow ears to stick up vertically, making the fox look a little like a bunny rabbit.  With that he began to crawl across the yellow landmass, having to bite his lip feeling the soft lard under him.  Her arm, now a huge sagging cone of fat, was in his way, the purple arm band she wore now torn apart, but still painfully taught as it held together by a few seams.  It seemed to beg the curious digimon to touch it, the red dino taking his claw and lightly poking it, the tortured cloth violently exploding off and letting the wrist fat finally start it's journey on swallowing up her useless bloated paws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally, he made it, and it was both a pitiful and sexy sight.  Flanked by two basket ball sized cheeks, her head was almost encased in fat, her plethora of chins and massive sagging weather balloon like breasts forcing Renamon's head to tilt back, her bloated sunken in muzzle now pointing to the corner where the wall and ceiling met.  Her eyes were squinting from both her cheeks pressing from underneath, and the back fat starting to press from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms wobbled, Renamon panting and wheezing heavily, \"Too... *wheeze* much.... faaaaaahhhht.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly to GUilmon's surprise, a little oxygen mask popped down from the ceiling, like being in an airplane during an emergency.  The dino first questioned about why it would be there, Renamon quickly trying to communicate that she really needed it but was imprisoned and muted by the blubber filled prison she had become.  Though not too soon, Guilmon finally put two and two together and wrapped the mask and the rubber band straps around the massive mound of flab her head was.  Laser scans quickly passed over her body and electrodes stuck to several areas of her, a screen quickly displaying Renamon's current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDATA STREAM ANALYSIS<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-SYSTEM OVERHEATING- COOLING OXYGEN MASK ALREADY DISPENSED<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-MAINFRAME: 1000% PASSED RECOMENDED MAXIMUM DATA THRESHOLD<br>\r\n-SPAM, MALWARE, COOKIES, JUNKMAIL to OPERATING SYSTEM: 98 to 1<br>\r\n-BANDWIDTH: NARROWED/BLOCKED TO CRITICAL LEVELS<br>\r\n-ENERGY CONCUMPTION: VERY HIGH<br>\r\n-MUSCLE GROWTH PROGRAM: CRASHED<br>\r\n-DIGIEVILOLUTION PROGRAM: CRASHED<br>\r\n-HUNGER REGULATOR: SUSPENDED<br>\r\n-HP: 5/250<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTOTAL MAINFRAME CRASH, REBOOT, AND DATA REORGANIZATION OF renamon.doc WILL BE REQUIRED UNLESS renamon.doc MAINTAINS OS STABILITY BY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.

I want you to stay this fat\" Guilmon said as he nuzzled her swollen cheeks.<br>\r\n\"I do too, this problem needs to be fixed real soon though...\" she said, her hands trying to bend encased in their fatty tombs, \"I don't want to be rebooted and turned into a digi egg.\"<br>\r\nGuilmon quickly nodded and slid down her huge body and back to the control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he choose?</span></div></div>",

He loved how much fatter she had become thanks to the machine, but he wanted her to keep getting bigger and fatter. However, due to her body's condition being on the verge of failing, she'd either have to be reverted to a digi-egg or hooked up with a large device to keep her from a worse fate... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the answer came to him! Since they were data in part, he could simply hack/rewrite her digital code. Then he could alter her body to simply make itself stable. It would be as if it was normal for her to be that fat and perhaps even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon hurried over to the panel that controlled the machine and began to enter numerous programs. It took some effort to figure out the programming process but the machines systems helped some. Looking up and smiling at the blob that was Renamon, he hit the Enter button. There was a bright flash of light, he heard a soft yip of surprise. When the dust settled there stood a massively fatter Renamon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy his best estimation she was now five times fatter in all her previous measurements. Arms and legs had all but been burred in her fatty rolls. Only her extremely puffy hands sunk into divots of flesh were visible along with her fingers. Her paws had completely vanished under yards of leg fat. And yet she appeared to be standing now somehow. Though her fat covered her limbs like a living curtain, her bloated paws still seemed to shuffle along under her many thick rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there was much room to move. Even given the large size of the chamber, the machine, and the platform where she'd been sitting, Renamon took up almost half of the room with a belly as big as a two car garage and a rear end to match. Somehow her head rose above her titanic form, ears nearly brushing the ceiling. As cheeks the size of beachballs were on both her face. Each of her busty breasts retained their massive sizes despite being heavyer under their new weight as they perturded off her mountainous form, but each had to be as big as a sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, they were leaking in small but strong streams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guilmon looked up at her sexier/fatter body a moan of pleasure came from the colossal fox as milk sprayed from one of her nipples and into Guilmon's open mouth. The taste was unlike anything he'd ever had before, sweat and creamy with just a hint of some flavor he couldn't pin down. In spite of any concern he might have had, Guilmon gulped down the flow as stray splashes dribbled down his chin and across his own gurgling belly. By the time he finished he'd swallowed several gallons worth judging by his sloshing middle. Of course it was then as he rubbed his gut a strange tingling sensation began to fill his body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

I wonder how I can do two things, have Renamon near me and food in my belly.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he see a stone shine in a certain way that marks it as different from the other stones around it. Not knowing what the stone was he picked it up and looked at it. It was colored the same two shades as Renamon fur. He guess it was a wishing stone and made a wish on it. \"Please can Renamon be teleported to where I'm standing with a picnic basket?' Then there's a bright flash of light and the stone is gone. The wish is granted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",

It wasn't that she disliked other Digimon, far from it, but it was just so nice to have an ideal place like this to herself.<br>\r\nRenamon padded closer and let the farthest reaching waves gently roll over he sandy paws and she smiled, enjoying the feel of the cool water against them. Once more she looked up and down the beach, as if to confirm there wasn't a soul in sight, but this time, from her new vantage point by the water, she spotted something she hadn't noticed before in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't deny she was interested. Looking down at her own small mounds hidden under her ruff of fur, she had always wondered what it would be like. Back in the human world she'd seen guys ogling female breasts more the bigger they were. And now that she had the pills that could do such a thing in her hand, an internal struggle took place. Not between the proverbial 'Devil and Angel on her shoulders', but in her mind between her warrior spirit and a new side of her she had recently discovered, a side that she didn't have a name for really, so she just call the other desire Id after what it represented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't be a fool,' her fighter side said, 'what use is it to have such things? They'll only slow you down in a fight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why should we fight?' came the reply from the other side, 'We've learned fighting isn't always the way to strength. And the Digital world is in a period of peace now with almost no fighting at all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But what if war comes again? Do you want to sit on the sidelines as some huge boobed bimbo who can't even walk without falling on her huge melons?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That won't be for years and years if it happens at all. Besides, we've earned a break and the chance to relax and maybe even be admired. Perhaps we could even use this to find a good mate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There is a third option,' came a new voice. This being seemed to manifest in her head looking much like the old trixter Impmon she used to know, 'Don't use the pills, but try them on others. It might be fun to see other females with breasts so big they can't move. Or better still, trying it out on males to see how it effects them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sides seemed to have valid arguments. Which one does Renamon choose?</span></div></div>",

She must've dozed off though, because she was awoken not too long after to a strange tingling sensation in her chest. It was unusual and yet felt wonderful at the same time. Sitting up, Renamon could feel a slight added weight to her chest. Looking down, she watched in amazement as her small breasts, once hidden by her neck fur, began to slowly push outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the course of a minute, her breasts had at least doubled in size, which, while not much considering their size to begin with, was substantial enough for her small pink nipples to finally emerge from under her fur.

But it was not for hunger. As soon as she took her first step to find some help, her body overwhelmed with fat. Her belly became so huge that her belly went past her knees. Her thighs widens that makes the markings on it stretched and uneven. Her butt is so wide that each butt cheek is as big as a beanbag. Each breast became as big as a watermelon and her cheeks resemble as a chipmunk's cheeks fill with nuts. Her neck is hidden behind the 4 chins with the fifth chin clearly coming. Her arms were sagging with fat and the finger-less gloves tighten around her hand. She even has to widen her stance to give space for her two thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wasn't prepared for the new added weight on her figure, she was losing balance. She tilted many times to the left and right while waving her arms until she fell flat on her back making a loud slapping sound of fat. She fell so hard that it cause the beach to shake a bit. Her belly wobble a moment until it settle down. Renamon looked down and gasped what happen to her body.<br>\r\n\"What the heck happen to my beautiful figure?!\" screamed angrily at her own body.<br>\r\nShe tried to heave herself but fail. All she can do is flail her useless arms and legs, and swift her tail between the two humongous butt checks. She breath deeply between each wheezing after the tiring work of lifting herself. It was no use yelling for help as she was hours away by foot to the nearest digimon. All she could do is to lie down and wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was waiting for help, she looked at the buried object in the sand that was directly next to her face. She use one of her flabby to clear the sand out of the way to get a good look at it. It was extremely difficult as she has poor immobility moving her arm and her massive cheeks blocking most of her side view. As she finish clearing it, she found the top of a giant metal box. She figures out it was a cargo container. The faded letters on the box told her that it was lost for many years and nobody bother to look for it. She tried to decipher the faded words, even though she couldn't turn her head all the way. <br>\r\n\"Mini Food Capsules,\" Renamon cursed at the pills for destroying her figure and mobility.<br>\r\nRenamon just laid there and sleep waiting for any digimon to find her and send help.</span></div></div>",

The more pills she was given, the harder it was for her to hold them all in her cheeks. About 32 bottles Impmon shoved in Renamon's mouth. Renamon really started to worried. She knew if she shallow all the pills, she might outgrow the size of a Whamon, if not bigger. About the 35th bottle of pills, it seem that Renamon's were at max capacity. Impmon gave a wide smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems that you are quite resilient, Renny.\" Impmon said putting his hands and Renamon's cheeks. \"Come on, just swallowed them already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarted to feel pain in both her cheeks, Renamon was about to cave. She was attempting to spit out the pills, but Impmon covered her mouth. Out of options, Renamon only had one thing to do. So she had no choice but to do the biggest gulp in her life and swallow all the pills. The pills slid all the way down her throat and to her stomach. At that moment, her stomach grumbled the loudest yet. The next thing to happen was her body erupting with a sea of fat. Unlike the last times, it wasn't looking like her belly was gonna stop growing yet. Her belly spreaded more across and started to reach the trees in the island. Her height also increased, becoming taller than the trees. Her cheeks grew more and more rounder and she grew a few more chins and each of them were thick. She grew bigger than a house, but was still growing. Impmon just happily laid on her growing belly. Soon part of the island were starting to covered by her titanic belly. After her belly swelled enough to cover a third of the whole island, Renamon stopped growing.  Basically Renamon was now the fattest digimon in history now. Due to her size, she was also past immobile. She couldn't even see her feet anymore. Let alone anything past her belly. She was pretty upset about all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.... i'm so fat now. How am I ever gonna be skinny again?\" Renamon said looking depressed.<br>\r\n\"It's not THAT bad.\" Impmon said.<br>\r\n\"NOT BAD!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without any further hesitation, she dug in. <i>Violently.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" she yelled, stuffing her face with two drumsticks (one chicken, the other turkey) in the same time. Tearing both cooked birds from limb to limb, she ripped of their wings, their legs, their chest, grabbing handfuls of the stuffing, and jamming it into her awaiting mouth. Oddly enough, none of the grease or sauce splattered everywhere, and even her paws stayed relatively clean. She scooped up the potatoes (smashed or baked, it didn't matter), and crammed into her maw as well, lapping up the sauce from the silver trays, and picking all the bones clean.<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, her once flat stomach rounded out, growing into a packed pot-belly, which burbled, ever-so-slightly, as she began to carve up the goose, sucking the fat out from under the reddish brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is delicious!\" she exclaimed, as she finished with the goose, moving onto the ribs and stakes. By now, her stomach was already a bit packed, but she kept going, nevertheless. Taking bite after bite of steak, with the bare bones piling in place of the cooked ribs, she had her eyes on the salad, as she kept stuffing her face. Tipping the bowls and pouring their contents down her throat, she found the salads easy to swallow, the chunks of meat and bacon tickling her tongue and throat as they rushed past into her gullet. She dutifully lapped up the mayonnaise and Tartar, unaware of the changes happening to her body...<br>\r\nBy now, her stomach was more akin to a dome, tightly packed with all the food she had consumed so far, and began to push her thighs apart, as gravity took hold of it. Yet, it also managed to push up her breasts from underneath the thick tuft of fur she had above her chest. Or perhaps it was her mammaries that decided to follow her stomach, as they grew greater, and more taut. Her hips seemed to broaden, slightly, and her hind cheeks grew, not with fat, but with muscle as well, increasing their size, as she continued to consume,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is excellent!\" she whispered, slicing up the fish, and delighted to find that it had been boned for her. Seafood wasn't really her thing, but she enjoyed it, nonetheless. By now, she had slowed down, considerably, feeling the weight of her feast. She cut the soft fish up meticulously with her claws, and placed the slices atop her tongue, letting them slide down, occasionally stopping to chew on a few sticks of chips before resuming the procedure. Slowly but surely, the large swordfish found a new home in her crammed midsection, followed shortly after by the remainder of the chips.<br>\r\nBy now, her burgeoning frame seemed to have reached it's apex of size, her stomach round and tout, akin to an overstuffed beanbag. And overstuffed it was, packed to the brim with all the fancy upperclass food there was on the table. It sagged, ever-so-slightly, the pressure keeping it firm and shapely despite gravity's increasing pull. Her legs, near completely pushed apart by the massive stomach, were still kept together by an enormous behind, which itself had swollen in proportion with her belly, even spreading down on her thighs, thickening them to support the \"Grade-A\" swine buttocks. Her voluminous breasts were the most eye-catching, however. Having also grown in proportion to her giant beach ball of a belly, they remained perky, ever so slightly giving in to gravity, and taut, with nipples poking out from under the fur, slowly growing erect. The pounds were appearing, however, around her cheeks, which have grown cherubic, and on her widened hips and waist, which also bulged with the added fat. Her pace grinding to a halt, she was intent on wrapping it properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... Is...<i> Divine!</i>\" she moaned, propping up her gargantuan stomach with a free paw (the kilos making their presence known on her upper arms), and feeding herself from the cheese plate, savoring the exquisite flavors of the many pricey dairy products. From sweet to sour, from salty to bitter, her tongue was teased with each bite, each small piece or block eaten whole, letting them melt and dissolve in her mouth without chewing. Finally, pouring herself glass of fine red, she raised the oversized wineglass, sighing:<br>\r\n\"To our health!\"<br>\r\n...And drinking it proudly, muttering to herself, as she observed between sips. \"Fine vintage, and finer lineage, still.\" She chuckled slightly at her own wit, placing the glass down onto the now half emptied table, and wiping her mouth with a napkin she found for this purpose.<br>\r\nSetting that down as well, she observed the emptied plates.<br>\r\n\"My, oh my...\" she mused, chuckling delicately \"Well, fancy that... I've had a feast all to myself... Very unladylike... But, I suppose a lady indulge, every now and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then glanced at the stacks upon stacks of fast foods on the other side of the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" she said in a posh voice \"All that feasting, and the table is still half full... Oh, I couldn't bring myself to consume all those delightfully rustic meals... Perhaps I should offer it for some poor, starving soul... Oh, I know, I should make a donation, and...!<i> Ooooooh...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her rambling, placing both hands on her more-than-stout stomach, and letting out a moan of both pain and pleasure. Her stomach churned and gurgled loudly now, trying to process all the weight-creating foodstuffs she had stuffed herself full with. Groaning, she leaned forward, allowing gravity to take full hold of her gravid orbs - her colossal belly hanging freely under it's own weight, groaning with her, her taut and titillating teats sloshing with it, and her hindquarters, the size of a well-fed horse's ass, rippling with every tiny movement. Her adipose-laden arms propping her up on the table, the construct creaked, even moreso when it did under the weight of the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, goose, you harlot of feasts... *<b>uuurp!</b>*<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> ...Oh, how vulgar... </font> You have betrayed me so! *<b>hic!</b>* And you too, my cheese? *<b>hurf!</b>* Oh, this will not do... I cannot come to the aid of others in such a troubled... *<b>urp!</b>* ...state! <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">...Oh, dear...</font> I'll require some aid myself! But, from whom? *<b>hic!</b>* Who could I find in such a pleasant, yet, deserted beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze upon hearing her name. She recognized the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, with much caution, she turned around, step by step, to face her visitor... Only to realize she couldn't quite see past her own breasts or belly. She could, however, see a small pair of raised bat-like wings, red wings she recognized as the ears of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon!\" she called out to him \"Is that you, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" the dino digimon could only stare at the blown-up vixen. She looked like she had swallowed an armchair, or boulder, and her belly definitely protested with the volume to indicate that she actually did.<br>\r\nBut that wouldn't explain the enormous breasts, the size of giant beach balls themselves, sitting and slightly swaying atop the engorged stomach, nipples fully visible and erect.<br>\r\nEven from the front, he could tell that her frame broadened, her widened hips revealing her stuffed thighs and plumped up rump, now nearing that of a cow's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a loud churn erupted from her, he saw her chunkier, meatier arms reach out around her stomach - and being <i>unable</i> to do so, So they kept on petting it instead, as she groaned and whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon...\" she whined \"I require your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally catching his breath, he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... In a spot of bother, wouldn't you say...\" she murmured sheepishly \"I need your help, Guilmon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...? S-Sure! Of course! Do you need a doctor, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i>, Guilmon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then, where shall I...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub my belly, Guilmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... Whaaaa?\" he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please, massage my stomach, dear Guilmon!\" the vixen replied, regaining her composure after that small outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to rub your belly?\" he asked, incredulously. Renamon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub the pain out, massage it away!\" she pleaded \"Please, Guilmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeechless, he stood before her stomach. It churned and gurgled angrily, like an overheated boiler, and had grown visibly red. The dino digimon didn't wanted to see her friend in pain, so, gingerly, he reached up with his clawed paws, gently placing them onto her full stomach.<br>\r\nHearing her sigh, he began to knead, only to stop abruptly as she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so roughly!\" she yelped. Gulping, he took it easy, gently moving his paws around, careful not to sink his claws into her skin, just barely grazing it, as she rubbed, patted and kneaded the reddened area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's better...\" she sighed, her tail beginning to wag, it's path blocked by her too massive buns \"Keep on going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he did just that, now with more vigor, and was glad to hear another pleased moan elicited from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels wonderful...\" she murmured \"Could you... Go a bit lower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so, moving down to her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeper...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe complied again, slightly uneasy, now going beneath her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping again, he began to massage her abdomen, happening upon a number of cramps, and easing them up as he did.<br>\r\nAll the while, listening to her moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oooh... Oooh, that's right... Oh, right, right there... Oh! Ooooooh...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, elatedly, as the draconic digimon kept on massaging her churning mass. Suddenly, she motioned him to stop with a louder moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing up, she met with her eyes - black sclera, blue irises and black pupils staring down into his own, yellow irises and slit pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed, enjoying the gentle touches on her heavy rock of a stomach.<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that we had happened upon a hammock chair fitting my... <i>Enhanced</i> size.\" she said, as the dino digimon kept massaging her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So am I...</i>\" thought Guilmon, but he knew better than to speak his mind in this case. A previous occasion during their considerably long walk towards the deck chair had him receive a stinging enough nose bop from the somewhat snooty vixen to still his tongue now. Anyways, he felt content doing what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely, rubbing Renamon's massive frame in the late afternoon sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we do something about the remaining food?\" she asked \"It would be a shame letting it go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry yourself...\" he chuckled, picking up her mannerism, slightly \"We shall take care of it... In due time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, while no longer hurting, still churned, digesting her massive feast, and kept adding on the pounds, adding to the material which Guilmon could grasp and knead, not just gingerly rub and pet. He continued rubbing, going over the whole, slowly flattening and fattening dome of her stomach, reaching down to her abdomen, and up under her breasts, smoshing his entire frame against the pressured flab.<br>\r\nEventually, he was just hugging and nuzzling the great mass, gently moving his arms around it, trying to encompass it with his limbs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon woke from her daze as she felt the rubbing motion stop. Sitting up, she glanced down forward, wondering why her friend had given up. She smiled at what she saw.<br>\r\nFor there, leaning against the side of her increased girth, was Guilmon, soundly asleep, still gently rubbing his face across the surface of her stomach, though the motion was not as rhythmic, which made her think he had stopped. Still smiling, she gently reached over, and scooped up the sleeping digimon, before leaning back, and placing him atop herself. She giggled quietly, as he began to nuzzle up to her breasts as if they were a pair of fluffy pillows, not even stirring in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing over his body, as well as the gargantuan body of her own, she watched the sunset, slowly drifting off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Guilmon blinked, noticing that the red spot on her stomach slowly faded away, however, the taut dome still kept churning and gurgling, making it's owner moan again, long and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing from embarrassment, Renamon spoke up in a quiet, wispy voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">\"Could you... Go... Even lower?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widening, the draconic digimon complied, reaching down lower, no massaging the vixen's thighs and the very bottom of her abdomen. Down here, her continuous weight gain after the feast became more evident - the skin, despite being pulled the most by gravity, remained lax with layers of adipose, ever growing, until her stomach began to apron her thighs. Without thinking, Guilmon gently probed his cold claws under the flab, reaching deeper and deeper between her thighs, and going higher and higher, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-Oooh... Aaaaahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly leaned back, her heavy buttocks leaning onto the table behind her, and it groaning under their weight, along with her. Her belly lifted, revealing her abdomen properly, and beneath it, where her thighs met...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the relatively small, pink slit upon the white fur, gazing at it as if it was a miracle of nature - as it was for him. His shaft unsheathing itself, he leaned forward, grasping her thighs, and pulling them apart gently with his claws, not even waiting for her demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning deeper forward, he took a deep <b>sniff</b>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped for air, feeling his cold, scaly nose rub and exhale against her outer folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back slightly, he observed her rose, cocking his head aside, as he was deep in thought... Thinking about how to approach this... But as her quickened breaths became impatient, he tossed all care aside, and decided to go with his instincts. Leaning in deep again, he opened his mouth, and reached out with his long, wet, and warm tongue, beginning to caress those folds with it, the sensation making him death to her increasingly excited moans and pants. He noticed that the gentle stir that occurred each time he lapped, and how it increased when he reached the slit's top. Upon closer examination, he found out why: a tiny nub, hardened by actions, and pulsing slightly, like a little red button that was begging to be pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did so, directly, with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp, whistling gasp, she shot forward, making him jump back, as she rapidly turned around (much faster than she did before), and quickly leaned against the table, going lower... And lower... And lower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she was practically hanging off the table, not leaning onto it for leverage, but holding herself up, as she stuck her buttocks out into the air.<br>\r\nBetween the deep canyon of her cheeks, he noticed something, and, using his long claws, and disregarding her aroused shivers, he parted the two cheeks, only to reveal the familiar slit, now upside down, and puckered hole, now slightly gaping, with her fluffy tail raised well above. He vaguely remembered through the haze that clouded his mind, what the other hole was used for, but disregarded it, digging into the slit again, using his tongue to drill in between the folds, while holding the two cheeks apart with his cold claws and warm paws. Eventually, he moved down onto the nub, which was now on the lower end, and, using this newfound advantage in position, he pushed forward, and did, what his mind told him to to: gently bit into it, and began flicking his long tongue across it's tip lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted and squeaked and whined and moaned above and in front of him, sashaying her hips, and gently jutting her hanging breasts and belly forward, gasping again as he moved onto her other, puckered hole, and began to perforate it with his tongue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" she hissed, looking down between her legs \"Stick it in already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That may be a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, she could see, for she saw, over her own mammoth mammaries and burgeoning belly, that while his own balls now churned and swelled, and his generously portioned shaft now stood fully erect, he could only taster her pucker when he stood on his clawed toes. Sighing in frustration, she stood up, surprised to hear a whimper coming from him - with the cheeks closing, he felt like he was locked out from world of warmth, into the cold shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, she swept the table clear, caring not about what shattered on the ground, and began to climb up. He soon followed suit, but hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hold us?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, he climbed up after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for him to reach her holes, she had to get down onto her knees, and lower her upper body completely - or at least, as far as her engorged chest allowed her. Propping herself up on her elbows, her breasts under chin and chubby cheeks acting like pillows, she had her bottom raised, her entire body beginning to turn upside down, it's contents stirring, as she raised her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be alright?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" she replied, though, not before stiffly a worrying short belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he became determined. Kneeling behind her, he played with her privates again, until a needy whine encouraged him to continue. Rising up slightly, he began to insert his long pole into the slit, the latter perfectly lubricated by his saliva. After the initial penetration, he went deeper, her long moan accompanying him on his crusade, until his thick blade was all in, down to it's hilt. She let out a gasp, as he began to retract it from between her folds, going only halfway before coming down again, his scrotum slapping against her lower abdomen. Pulling out halfway again, he rammed in once more... And again... And again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was a steady rhythm between the tow of them, with him smacking against her with all his might, and she gently moving her rear up and down. The table groaned, but the system of support beams held them with ease. She became coated with sweat, her fur covered in the hot dew, as she wheeshed and gasped, panting heavily between the moans, and vise versa. Her breasts jiggled like gelatin, her hanging, pressured stomach churned, and her buttocks wobbled and rippled upon every impact, as he held her close with his claws on her broad hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she could take no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer walls contracted, the slit narrowed fiercely, trapping his shaft within as he felt her juices overflowing. He was yet to reach his own climax, but didn't mind. However, what happened next changed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bubble of gas, dislodged from the wall of her small intestine, traveled upwards, which  was no her large one, and made it's way through, increasing in volume along the way, making her squirm in discomfort through her bliss, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>PHFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast was loud, and rank, hitting him square in the face, as he gazed down upon her pucker, contemplating. Soon, both of them caught it's waft, and while she blushed, muttering an apology, he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude!\" he declared, his shaft still erect, painfully, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, even deeper, having a good idea what he was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're willing to resort to such unladylike behavior...!\" he declared, picking up her mannerism from before \"Then I shall take it upon myself to stop such vulgar emissions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he grasped her hips, making her squeal in excitement. The next second, her rammed it in, using his full body weight to do so.<br>\r\nNow, while her slit was well lubricated by his prior intrusions and her juices, her pucker was only briefly visited by him, and the increasing heat of her actions had already dried up most of it, and her flatulence had blown away the last remnants. He came in, and came in dry, but after a couple of cycles, all of which felt like a blissfully painful eternity for her, his own juices leaked, bringing forth the necessary lubrication, as they continued to rut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, her burst had not spewed forth any gastric juices, so he could operate in relative cleanliness. Not that he would've minded either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to prop herself up properly now, on all fours, breasts and stomach swaying and sloshing, churning, as he churned her contents into fat and sweat. She let out a belch, then another, and more, as her other windpipe was blocked. She still freely leaked her juices, while her other canal became loose as well, due to the regular intrusions. Finally, she felt his shaft pulse and twitch, as he slowly came to a halt, and, with a final, deep thrust, he released, shooting his own cream, his own sauce, his own filling for her up her rear, making it rush through her, reaching he stomach from the other end, and mixing with the churned brew within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out of her as his shaft softened, slowly retracting into it's sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laying on her breasts and stomach, her loosened pucker couldn't hold back the next burst of air, as it came, rumbling, spewing forth the white cream, making her now softened cheeks ripple even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them panted, exhaled tiredly. The deed was done. The feast was fully complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, they found themselves on the beach, basking under the sun. There were still bouts of gas within her, which is why he kept massaging her stomach, though, her soft moans now rose because of him nibbling on the still perky, still taut, still erect nipples, rubbing away at her fattening midsection. Finally, he let go, using the breast as a pillow instead, as they laid beside one another, his arm thrown across her engorged stomach, while she hugged his now much smaller body close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>that</i>!\" she sighed \"Was divine...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gingerly, she picked up one of the greasy burgers. It wasn't a processed, typical fast-food-joint burger, but rather, more home made, with multiple levels, and many ingredients, stuffed to the brim with them, and sweating it's juices onto her fingers as she merely held it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a great big bite, she felt the myriad of flavors explode into her mouth (and all the condiments explode all over her chest and hands), and she had to chew fast to take another bite (and save the sandwich from completely falling apart). Soon, she managed to stuff the whole thing into her mouth, and began to lick the grease and sauce off her fingers, swallowing hard, and moaning, as the heavy meal reached down to her stomach. It was sloppy, yet, satisfying. So she reached for another one, and that one went down the same way - messily, but also, surprisingly satisfying her. So she went for another one, and another one... AND another one! Soon enough, she was cramming all the burgers into her mouth, only stopping for brief breathers, and to force down a more troublesome bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was finished, she felt exhausted. Her maw, cheeks and throat burned from all the stuffing and hard swallowing, her hands, and, subsequently, her sleeves were coated with grease, as was the fur around her mouth, and on her chin. She had even worked up a sweat, forcing all that down. Letting out a pained belch, she felt her stomach churn, doing away with the greasy meal. She had already gained a soft potbelly from all the burgers, yet, her stomach seemed to be begging for more.<br>\r\nSo this time, she just grasped the french fries without care. They were the driest, and thus, the least greasiest of them all. However, she soon grew tired of their taste, and wend for the chicken wings as well, eating with abandon. True, they were far less greasy than the burgers, but they were fattening non-the-less: her potbelly grew, and love-handles soon joined it on either side of her hips. Her ass and ties also seemed to pack on the pounds, even as she stood.<br>\r\nThe mess returned when she realized that she could dip the wings and the fries into the excess sauce, and thus, began to stuff herself silly with the sloppy mess. When she ran out of wings and fries, she turned toward the hot dogs and corn dogs. Soaking them in the slimy sauce, she continued her binge, caring less and less about her table manners, and more about keeping her greedy gut content. As the dogs ran out, she stopped for a breather, grabbing one of the fizzy, soft drinks, and gulping it down to elicit some stomach-easing belches. Her maw felt raw, and even her stomach burned now, yet, the hunger remained. Her ass and thighs had grown soft, and became riddled with dimples under her fur, also increasing in size, the fat seeping down into her shins. Her arms were now flabby, her love-handles spread over to her back, and her stomach was an apron of churning flab and indigestion. Finishing her drink(s), she tossed the cups aside, not caring anymore. Finally, a belch came, slightly rippling her puffed up cheeks, shaking off some of the crumbs and grease of her mouth, jaw, chin, cheeks, but only managing to make them drip down to her chest, her fur soaked with sauce and salt, and her breast poking out, increased in size with fat, yet, somehow resistant to gravity.<br>\r\nShe was also sweating all over now, wet spots appearing under her arms, around her thickening neck and growing second chin, and in between her legs. Sweat dripped down in the crevice of her ass, and in her cleavage.<br>\r\nAfter another belch, she returned to her food and drinks, continuing her binge.<br>\r\nThe sauce had ran out, much to her disappointment, but her next choice thankfully had a sauce of it's own: the corn-cobs, coated in butter and salt, were just perfect. Sure, he had a bit of trouble grasping them, what, with her sleeves now completely covered in grease, and her fingers becoming fattened as well, but after a few attempts, during which she repeatedly dropped the corn-cob into her cleavage, she finally managed to get a hold of it, and her motor skills, and began to scarf them down, only caring about eating it all. With all the dripping sauce and grease, she was still a very thorough eater, chewing as much as she could, and never letting a single bite go amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorn-cobs were followed by pizza pies, with the large pizzas following suit. Both of these were oven-baked and relatively consistent with their toppings, if rather oversized, so she haven't made much of mess of herself eating them, however, the pounds kept packing on:<br>\r\nShe had a second chin now, and a third was on the way. Her arms were meaty and chunky, padded, except for the wrists and the elbows. Her constantly moving fingers remained slim, along with other joints, but her knees and ankles were slowly being swallowed by her leg fat. Her thighs were thicker than ever, and her ass had grown so fast that the dimples flattened out, however, stretch marks became visible under her fur, on her thighs and atop her ass cheeks, while her hips and waist flared, love-handles growing thicker and thicker, along with her back fat. Her stomach was now a content, bulging apron of fat, reaching down to above her knees, and bulging out as well, with the familiar stretch marks appearing on her abdomen. Even her shoulders have grown padded with adipose, and her cheeks were spreading down onto her thick neck, which now felt like it was playing the role of Poland between her cheeks and multiple chins.<br>\r\nThe only thing that escaped the stretch marks and the sagging were her breasts. Sure, they hanged low, but they were still full, still perky, now taking on a distinctive \"missile shape\", as they spread across her growing stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was sweating like a horse, as she began to consume the desert: snack-pies, few-bite-sized pies stuffed to the brim with a sweet cream, and small cakes, caked with icing and powdered sugar, with a spongy texture, and plenty of jam and cream inside. And, along with that, of course, came the last of the drinks.<br>\r\nDue to their small size and the routine she had gained after consuming so much junk, she managed to avoid making more of a mess of herself with her binge, only getting just a wee bit of jam and powdered sugar atop her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chugged her last, jumbo soda, she glanced down, noticing that the powder had spread all over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hehehe... Sugartits...</i>\" she chuckled inwardly, even surprising herself that she had found that funny, before letting loose of a long, frame-rattling belch after finishing off her drink.<br>\r\nOddly enough, the obscenely loud and long outburst only seemed to humor her more, making first giggle, the chuckle, then after a second belch, break into a hearty guffaw, so hearty, in fact, that she dropped down onto her ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former, slim and svelte vixen was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon was now a sweat-coated, dressing, sauce and condiment-caked, chunky and flabby, yet, oddly enough hourglass-shaped parody of her former self. With hips and waist flaring out, and a fat, doughy as spreading out even more, especially now, as she sat, with thighs meeting each other in the middle somewhere, no matter how distantly spread they were (unless she was doing splits, which she, surprisingly, was still quite capable of), and a big, churning, sweaty dough of a stomach occupying her lap, a pair of missile shaped, engorged, pert and perky, full-looking breasts stacked atop, with areolae and nipples thickened, puffed up slightly, and enlarged, and thick love handles on each side, with a thicker back, chunky, meaty arms stretching the ruined sleeves, padded shoulder with a ring-shaped neckfat and multiple chins united in the middle, against the invading cheeks.<br>\r\nShe was sweating from her every crevice, still belching, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumble came from somewhere under her abdominal fat, and the next second, a massive fart rippled from between her adipose-coated ass cheeks, with a volume and stench that would've made a cow jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fart felt suspiciously wet, the fox digimon clenched her muscles to see if anything came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, it didn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmm... My ass-sweat musta seeped in...</i>\" she pondered, feeling a chuckle rise from he through, now in a considerable deeper voice than what she had in the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well...\" she muttered \"Better luck next time...\" and she burst out into a guffaw again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon could only stare at the sacks of blubber in front of him. He couldn't believe it.<br>\r\nIt <i>looked</i> like her (vaguely)...<br>\r\nIt <i>sounded</i> like her (if deeper)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the Renamon he knew was an exercise-freak if he ever saw one. This digital fox was, for all intents and purposes, a fatty. Not to mention that her mannerism and sense of humor was far off from the often cold and formal vixen. Heck, the only thing that wasn't engulfed in fat on her was her tail, <i>which just kept wagging</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't, for his life, understand it. This fat slob in front of him, IF she's Renamon, would be depressed, or at least lethargic, to be in such a shape. Most people would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon plucked up courage, and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatty fox digimon looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hiyya Guilmon!\" she greeted her cheerily \"Care to help a girl out?\" she asked, holding out her arms (and thus, revealing the grease that coated them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly disgusted, the draconic digimon grasped her arms, and helped her stand up. Well, he tried, but she mostly needed him as a form of leverage to hold her balance. So she jumped up into a stand, slamming her body right into the now considerably smaller digimon, giving him a face full of \"Sugartits\" and \"Sauce-cleavage\", as well as leaving a coat of sweat on him.<br>\r\nGuilmon tumbled back, gazing up at her with both shock, surprise and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she asked, whilst scratching her butt \"Watcha' planning on doin' now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment, given her a once-over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for a swim?\" he asked, finally.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright!\" she cheered, disturbing the poor dino digimon even further \"Race ya to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she <i>ran</i> off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, as the gears in his mind tried to process what was just fed through them, he got up, and stared after the golem-sized fox digimon.<br>\r\nRenamon stomped her way down the beach into the shallow water, and, when she was about knee-deep in the water (as far as he could measure it through all the leg flab), she <i>jumped</i>, <i>twice</i> her own (noticeably increased) height, and <i>four times</i> her own height in length from starting point to landing point. Falling into deep water, she created a micro-tsunami, that was approaching the beach rather quickly.<br>\r\nGuilmon, walking, or rather, stumbling forward, his mind slowly overheating as it tried to make sense of things, walked right into the middle of it. As it crashed over his head, rapidly cooling it down, a cog, representing his sense of logic, suddenly lost it's bearings and began to spin in it's own speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it all clicked together.<br>\r\nRenamon was somehow fattened into a hyper-hourglass parody of herself, and she was perfectly content about it, even becoming more carefree in her elation, as she retained her abilities, with some even increasing in proportion to her new body.<br>\r\nSmiling broadly with this new revelation in mind, Guilmon sat down, and stared at the engorged beauty, as she swam about in the deeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the considerable amount of arm and leg fat, to fox digimon still moved as quickly as ever, her movements as fluid as the water around her. Movement, of course, was a bit harder, and her muscles burned, as they began to retake their place, but her throat, mouth and stomach had also burned during her binge - she had gotten used to it, heck, she even liked, as it was her body's way of letting her know that she was making progress.<br>\r\nAnd she was. Rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, her chunky arms were replaced by thick, but toned \"bear arms\", and her meaty shins regained their necessary muscle, and her flabby thighs slowly transformed into thick thunderthighs. Her extra chins disappeared as well, the remainder absorbed by her round, fluffy scarf-like neck fat, and her cheeks receded into being merely cherubic, rather thank hamster-like. Her back lost considerable amounts of adipose, as did her love handles decreased into a manageable, truly \"lovable\" size. Some of the padding of her shoulder disappeared as well, leaving only a tasteful amount that propped up her now thicker arms and neck, and, as if by magic, all of her stretch marks disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her new personality and bodily traits also came into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to dive down, her ass was still sticking out, the water collecting in between the two now shapely cheeks. Suddenly, there was a loud rumble, and a jet of water shot out from between her cheeks, accompanied by a loud rippling sound.<br>\r\nBack on the beach, Guilmon could only laugh.<br>\r\n\"Thar she blo's!\" he cried, laughing at the \"fart-whale\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, after she had grown tired, the vixen was now idly floating atop the water, allowing the waves to make her drift out onto the beach. Her nipples were still erect from the cold water, but she didn't mind. Drifting lazily, she glanced up to see how far she was from the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far away from her, Guilmon waved to the large digimon, blushing slightly as he saw her nipples standing erect, making her already prominent breasts seem even more of a focal point on her. She was drifting rather close.<br>\r\nAs he waited for her, he suddenly heard a quiet dripping sound, which then grew into a tinkling, then, a full blown flow.<br>\r\nWondering where the sound was coming from (as it began to irritate his bladder), he glanced around, but saw nothing on the beach, and the ocean seemed far to vastly spread to make such a noise.<br>\r\nHis eyes fell upon Renamon again, and, as the waves turned her around, he found the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd felt like a pinch in the groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting without a care in the world, the fox digimon was also casually peeing into the ocean. Rather heavily, too, as all those sodas manages to catch up to her. Eventually, the flow decreasing into a tinkle again, then into a drip, and a larger wave, acting as nature's bidet, washed over her, she shuddered delicately, felling the cold water lap up against her privates. She then swam a bit further from the spot she peed in, and stood up. Here, the water only reached up to her thighs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter previously covering his eyes, then turning away from the urinating Renamon, Guilmon slowly began to turn back around after the \"flow\" came to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw felt like something right out of poetry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding thigh-deep in the water, a hyper-voluptuous Renamon was washing herself, cleaning her sleeves, washing her arms, her armpits, her thickened neck and it's folds, her head, her ears, then her sides, her stomach, her abdomen (she spend some time down there), in between her thighs, her buttocks, her crevice, under her beasts, between them in her cleavage, and her breasts themselves (again, spending considerable time here, casually rubbing her nipples and areolae, deep in thought, with the self-pleasing only serving as an idling activity). Finally, she washed her plush tail as well, and her face. Now, finally clean of all the crumbs, all the grease, all the sweat, and all the sauce, she walked out onto the beach, and laid down, soaking up the sunlight while waiting for her fur to dry out. She smiled to herself as she heard the footsteps of the smaller digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, she was slightly taken aback by Guilmon's sheepish grin, but more importantly, by the massive, pulsing erection that forced the poor dino digimon to waddle.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she mused, eyeing up his shaft and balls, the latter churning <i>audibly</i> by this point \"That's... Rather impressive... Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she sat up. After a bit of pondering, she glanced back at the half-spread she had left behind in the buffet. All the exercise had made her hungry, but she was also sure that the viral digimon hadn't eaten anything yet, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin spread on her face, as she turned back to Guilmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what...\" she said, beginning to stand up, her generous assets jiggling, and eliciting a rather worrisome churn from his bulging scrotum \"Why don't we solve this problem... Over dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon's jaw dropped. Did she really see right trough him that easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel rather peckish after that swim.\" she said, rubbing her generous pouch, the belly-apron now only reaching down to the top of her thighs. It, too, had receded, but a large portion of it remained, as if to verify her missile tits and grand shelf of an ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about you feed me some of that fancy stuff that's left?\" she asked, making her swallow dryly \"Although, you seem to be rather ravenous yourself...\" she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now?</span></div></div>",

It's time for him to learn to <b>always</b> be </i>straight<i> with me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down onto the smaller digimon, his smile fading as her own grin grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you're getting at.\" she said, putting her flabby arms on her love-handle-laden hips \"Sweetie, if you wanna tell me something, you better tell me straight. Let me teach you why sincerity is such a great value.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she began to walk over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon's mind raced, and blush began to spread on his face, as he thought to himself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sweetie? She called me sweetie? I should have been more direct with her. How did she caught on so quickly? There's more to her than I thought. Wait, did say \"teach\"...?</i>\" and that's as far as he got, when something great big and yellow covered up his entire face. A moment later, it dawned upon him that Renamon had effectively <b>sat on</b> him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmh... There you go...\" she muttered, kneeling above the viral digimon's head, and slowly lowering her new weight onto his face \"Nice and slow... Let's savor the taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he did, though, reluctantly. As fresh air was rapidly running out, all he could smell eventually was the sour smell of sweat (which he soon grow acquainted with, as the fox digimon's full weight was slowly lowered onto him, coating him with the very juicy behind the pungent stench). Finally, she had fully sat down on him, her fat ass fully covering his face. Renamon then grinned.<br>\r\n\"Let the fun begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she began to grind her ass onto his head, making him sink deeper and deeper in between the massive cheeks, feeling every hair, every dimple on it, and every bead of sweat, as he was dragged deeper and deeper into the sour-smelling inferno. Suddenly, a new, even more stronger smell, or rather, stink, began to make it's way into his nostrils.<br>\r\nWith shock and horror, he realized why the slobby vixen was grinding on him...<br>\r\nBut it was all too late to struggle by then. His nose made contact with a fleshy, puckered ring.<br>\r\nThe only things he could hear where his own, panicked breaths, his blood drumming his hear, as well as the heartbeat of the fox digimon above and all over him. Suddenly, a new noise, a sort of deep rumbling and bubbling became audible as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath of the still breathable air, and waited for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Renamon was clutching her doughy stomach with one paw, while the other rested on her generous backside. The gurgling was even more louder here, and she made a discomforted grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoooh boy! This one's going to be big!\" she grinned, which quickly turned sheepish, as the nature of what she was about to do slowly sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no point holding back now...\" she thought, easing up another painful cramp in her abdomen, before calling down \"Hope you're ready down there! I saved the best one for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Guilmon seemed to clench his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever digimon...\" she muttered to herself, followed by a loud groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... It came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressurizing her entire stomach, making it's way down the small intestine, through the large intestine, picking up it's smell, and growing ever larger. Finally, it reached her rectum, causing a series of cramp-ups along the way. Her pucker quivered and bulged out, as the deep crevice of her ass cheeks became sweatier and sweatier.<br>\r\nGuilmon waited.<br>\r\nFinally, she couldn't take the pressure anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>fff...frrrt...phrrrRrrRrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRLBPHRRRRRRRRRRRRRPHHHT-BLRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFffffh...BLRRRPHT-FLRRRRPH-FLRRRRRPHFLRTHPLSSSSssss... FFRRTH!</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was long, about five minutes long, and it was loud, making the floor shake underneath the two, and it was wet, a horrible, foreboding wet one. But, most importantly, it was <i>rank</i>. Eggy, spluttery, squelching, and rank, with the stank of a rotten skunkmon corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even Renamon smelled it. Gagging on it, and frantically searching for pockets of fresh air in the haze, all she could do in the meantime was blush in utter embarrassment. This haven't gone well. In fact, it seemed to have gone horribly wrong. Guilmon wasn't even moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Guilmon! Are you all right?\" she called down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and very violently, he began to struggle, digging his claws into her bloated ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" she yelped, raising her weight. However, Guilmon, instead of slipping backwards, managed to scuttle forward, so when the vixen's weight came down onto him, it landed on his collarbone. That wasn't much of a problem, he could at least breathe, but the air was still pungent with the rotten smell... Except for a rather convenient, and rather literal \"sweet spot\" right in front of his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, he stuck out his tongue, and took a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHH!\" the fox digimon moaned, feeling the long tongue lap against her privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon noticed the tiny jolt that came after his lick, and, purely for the sake of research, she licked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHhh!\" Renamon moaned again, and began to feel increasingly hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo completely verify his logic, the dino digimon decided to lick again. He was really getting into this, and felt like he was about to reach a breakthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooahh...\" the vixen was really feeling the heat now. Prior to this, she had no idea where the viral digimon could've slipped into (though she sincerely hoped she hadn't crushed him), but by now, she was starting to have a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Guilmon decided to lick again, in conclusion to his research. And, for posterity's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oueeehhh...\" she was practically melting now, but knew exactly where the naughty little dino had gotten to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha...\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his breakthrough now reached, his research came to a conclusion. To celebrate this, Guilmon began to eat her out. Wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, Renamon collapsed into a panting heap, as the draconic digimon's assault continued, relentlessly. Like a dog eating form his bowl, he dug his snout in, licking about and sniffing, rolling his tongue around his mouth, and imitating chewing motions.<br>\r\nPractically drooling, the fox digimon above him could barely gather her senses. Slowly, she began to play with her breasts, a vain attempt to counter raw pleasure with pleasure, but she, even with her generous proportions, could barely grasp herself. Eventually, however, she gathered her wits, and lifted up her apron of a belly, gazing down into the surprised eyes of Guilmon.<br>\r\n\"So...\" she whispered \"You know a few tricks, huh?\"<br>\r\nThe dino digimon blinked nervously.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she dropped her pouch right back onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so do I!\"</span></div></div>",

Then, found himself dragged forward along the floor by his ears. Then, face-to-face with a wickedly grinning Renamon, hovering above him, on all fours.<br>\r\nBut before he could do anything, the vixen suddenly turned her nose away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.U.!\" she gasped \"You, mister, are quite rank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grinned at him from her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do something about that stench, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up from her elbows, she began to rock her torso back and forth, her breasts and gut swaying along with her movement. Eventually, her breasts swung out so widely that, as she brought he torso down onto her elbows again, they landed right on top of his face, his snout quickly ending up in between them.<br>\r\nWith the sweet smell of sugar filling his nose after all the torture it was put through, Guilmon's senses, and common sense as well went berserk. He began to dig his snout deeper into her cleavage, savoring the smell of the sauces and condiments, the salt, the grease, even. Almost automatically, he opened his mouth, letting his long tongue lap and feel around, eliciting more moans and whines from the already horny vixen. Cleaning up in her bosoms in an almost canine-like fashion, he also managed to drive her crazy as well, especially when he moved up to her puffy areolae and hard nipples, doing his \"tongue dance\" on them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was dragged out from between the milky mountains, and found himself face-to-face with their owner, once again. Still licking his snout, he acted on instinct, throwing his arms around her fat neck, and pulling her down into a sloppy french kiss.<br>\r\nWhile she was strong, with so much distraction, she couldn't hold her weight. Thus, she collapsed onto him, burying his body under her own, while they kept kissing, more and more passionately - one a canine, the other a lizard of sorts, plenty of tongue to go around.<br>\r\nHe savored the tangy taste of her long-drawn meal, while she could taste her own nectar in his saliva. However, during their random make-out session, she began to feel something pulsing under her belly. From it's shape, she recognized what it was, and grinned into her next kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she sat up, and glanced down at the equally horny Guilmon, who kept staring at her with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n\"All right, lovermon.\" she chuckled \"Time for the real deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled back on her knees, until she was right above his crotch. He stared at her with interest, as she reached down, and lifted her belly-apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing this \"magic handkerchief\" revealed was a massive, painfully pulsing pole of meat, and somewhere underneath, she could feel the churning balls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could do was stare at her pelvis, her plump, perfectly portly pelvis, which he had the fortune of meeting orally before, but now, he saw it in it's full glory. The puffy nether lips, with the sweet little button at the top, smiling at him in her slantwise way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just look at it, silly.\" she chuckled, though, her voice was riddled with need \"Explore it with what the Digigods gave ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon cue, his penis pulsed again. Realizing what he had to do, he gingerly grabbed the sizable shaft with his claws, and eased it towards her lower lips, slowly rubbing the tip up and down along them, lubricating them both with their own juices, before slipping it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them moaned, loud and long, as the pistonwork began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her strong legs, Renamon lifted herself off from the base of his rod, going up, up until only his very tip was still in, then came down, down fast and hard like a steam hammer, dropping her full weight back onto him. And with that, the slow climb began again, followed by another heavy drop. Climb again, drop again, the pace only increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her arms unoccupied, she began to play with her breasts, until she felt two sets of long, cold claws fondling he bosom, Lowering herself upon him again, she went weak in the forearm, and collapsed onto her elbow, as he began to lick, taste, savor, and tease her huge chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplitting their work like this, they eventually brought each other to the climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Guilmon exhaling loudly, and Renamon's legs finally giving out, the steam hammer momentum came to a halt, finally crashing down onto the viral digimon's rod, making the plump pelvis jiggle as the lips tightened with unusual force. Her pouch, apron-of-a-belly, which, up until now, existed in the weightless equilibrium of the rapid movement, flopped down, as if chastely covering up the final act: the eruption of Guilmon's shaft, an eruption so powerful, it travels up his spine, down his arms, into his paws, as he gives the vixen's tits one last squeeze, bringing her over the edge as well,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating a perfect harmony in mutual ejaculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly bloats slightly under the pressure of his release, while her fluids drip out along his softening shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the passion lowers it's flames, and the pheromones, hand in hand with the stench, are dispersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that is left is the desire to cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it's also mutual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying atop the well-padded body of his new lover, Guilmon exhales, his paws still playing wit her breasts, as they breathe into each other's mouth, the snuggling growing in intensity, perhaps preparing them for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe session is, however, interrupted by another, mutual effect: the rumble of their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, both of them exchange looks, before glancing up at the still fresh, still waiting fancy foodstuffs atop the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea forms in both of their minds, similar in context, but switching with the roles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is... Who's idea should they follow?</span></div></div>",

The many levels of the table, or bar, rather, were display cases for the many exquisite (and probably expensive) drinks the establishment could offer. Behind the bar stood the wine rack and a tall and wide set of shelves that might as well be used as the rear wall. In fact, it seemed like the fishnet curtain behind it tied the shelves to the palm trees. An old OXO jukebox-radio stood in the corner, now very quietly dispensing static, as if waiting for the pin to hit the vinyl, or for someone to tune it it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of typical, round bar stools stood before the counter.

The idea of a male so private about his, well, privates and then loosing them on the beach was just humorous to her.<br>\r\nUnfolding them properly, she could see they were a extra large blue colored pair with flame accents along the seams and the hem of the legs. On a whim she held them up to her own middle and found that, even with her muscular hips, the pair would have been quite large on her. its such a strange thought that she would think of wearing them that she wonders if she should. There's no one around on the beach and she could have gone without, but something about the absurdity of wearing a gigantic pare of men's swimwear was humorous to her.<br>\r\nSo, lowering the shorts and opening the top, she eased one leg in after the other, getting a little chill up her spine as the wet pants wrapped around her legs. Tucking her tail through a small hole in the back, she gave one last pull and felt the pants now wrapped around her hips.<br>\r\nThe pants were too loose though, so Renamon felt for the drawstrings in front. Giving them a light tug, she quickly tied them in a bow knot. The paints felt a little more snug, but not enough. Still, she'd fix it lather she decided. having wet pants like this was a nice excuse to stretch out in the sand and let them dry in the warm sun for a bit. So she did so, relaxing on the warm beach and in almost no time at all, she was fast asleep.<br>\r\nThe pants she was wearing though, were far from normal. And as she slept, changes began to occur.</span></div></div>",

The sun was low in the sky now, turning it a light pinkish shade. She lightly berated herself for sleeping so long and missing an ideal day of swimming. <br>\r\nAs she made to get up though, she found it was easier than she recalled. It felt like she had increased the size of her muscles during her nap, however odd that sounded. When she looked down at herself, the first thing she noticed was her flat chest. It took her a moment to realize that her breasts were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream echoed along the empty beach. However, it was a much deeper scream than usual. Renamon moved one of her hand-paws up to her throat, as she realized that her voice had gotten deeper, too! And that wasn't all that was changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's eyes widened even more, as she saw that her whole body had changed! She was still a Renamon, but she didn't look quite like herself anymore. Apart from her disappearing breasts and deeper voice, Renamon's body was no longer; well.... femenine. That was the only word to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's body had lost its hourglass-figure; her hips and buttocks had shrunk a little, while her waist had gotten bigger; her shoulders were broader and, most importantly, she had gotten very muscular! Not overly so; just enough to make it look natural on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon looked at her changed body with a mix of distress and facination. Her hand-paws felt her all over, gently feeling everything from the biceps on her arms, to the six-pack on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now she had guessed what had happened, but she didn't want to believe it. Renamon tried to calm her racing heart, this was bad, but not horrible. Such things probably happened in the more remote places of the Digital world all the time. She could still be alright. and work this out, she'd just need a level head. She had been in stranger situations before and she could do this.<br>\r\nAs she was trying to remain calm though, one of her hand-paws began gently rubbing her muscular pecs and, unintentionally, she was getting slightly aroused by it as she was unintentionally trying to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about then she felt an odd stirring between her legs. She hadn't noticed her lower half much, since she had been distracted by her beefy torso, but when she got a good look at the shorts, her eyes widened in horror as a prominent bulge could be seen in them; right at her crotch!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that it wasn't what she tought it was, she loosened the drawstrings on the shorts, jammed one hand-paw into the shorts, under her muscular stomach and felt for it. Unfortunately for Renamon, her fears were confirmed, as her hand-paw soon clasped a foreign but familiar object about a foot long, three inches thick, and flanked on either side by a pair of egg sized orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no longer a 'she'. Renamon had become a male!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother scream rang down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Arms and legs, his washboard abs, even his new privates got a strange tingling rush of heat as though he'd just stepped into a soothing sauna. But it didn't end there. In moments he could feel something like rippling movement run through his muscles. It felt like the after effects of laying in the surf as the phantom waves rolled through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly as they did so his form thickened little by little. Renamon watched with a mixture of numb shock and fascination as his arms swelled, starting at the bicep and rolling all the way down to his hands as each finger thickened slightly one after the other. It was tricky to see over his slabs of pecs but his thighs did the same, expanding with new mass that bulged under his fur  and rolled down into his calves and paws which thickened even more than his hands did it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face flushed hardest though when another 'hard' part of him refused to go down as his shorts tightened around his new privates. The orbs and length of male flesh jammed in them strained at the fabric a little more by the moment as the once large bathing suit seemed to get smaller on Renamon's thickening frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The growth eventually stops, for the moment, leaving Renamon with the figure of a pro body builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Renamon's growth isn't stopping.

He stood on his hind legs resembling a Veloceraptor.  \"Forgive me vixen.  I am searching for a golden yellow creature with your discription.

The fox Digimon had been exploring further and further across the digital world as of late, but something about this forest drew her in. The calling seemed even stronger the further she went, something tickling at the back of her mind almost like a half heard whisper. The thick canopy above meant that very little light reached below the thick cover, and what little there was tinged green. Ahead though there was a blindingly bright wall of light, it almost hurt to look upon it, but that seemed to be where she was being called so Renamon plunged on. When her eyes finally adjusted, she saw that it was a clearing in the midst of the forest, and within the clearing rose an enormous building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop on one of the few tree limbs to extend into the clearing, the fox looked over what she had been apparently called to. Made entirely of what seemed to be gleaming crystal, the building caught the sunlight and refracted it in every direction. Four spindly towers were placed one apiece around a massive dome that rose nearly as tall as the towers around it. Markings covered the curving surface of the dome, none of which Renamon could recognize. The calling nagged at the back of her mind, urging her on, but something about this location caused the normally cool and collected fox to resist and want to back away. The air smelled wrong and it was too quiet compared to the noise of the forest behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep after step, she forced herself back towards the cover of the forest. The calling seemed to respond to her unwillingness, becoming a howl that ripped through the back of her mind. She suddenly found herself down on the ground cradling her head before the vast crystalline wall rising far above her and curving in every direction away from her. The fox started to move away from the wall when a spot of darkness marred the otherwise perfection of the wall. That spot quickly grew into a tunnel bored through the crystal. Despite the light streaming through the crystal everywhere else, the tunnel was pitch black just a few steps inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fur bristled and she tried to resist, but she found that her body seemed beyond her control now, walking stiffly towards the yawning darkness. Once she was several steps in, the light from outside started to fade. She managed to get a slight glimpse over her shoulder as the \u201cdoor\u201d irised shut plunging her into complete and utter darkness. Whatever was controlling her seemed to release her body, but it did little good, she couldn\u2019t find the door behind her nor the walls of the tunnel that should have been there. It was almost as she was plunged into a featureless void except for how the smooth floor was still beneath her feet, granting her the sense that at least she wasn\u2019t floating in absolute nothingness. A sudden brightness overwhelmed her, blindingly bright after the darkness, so it took some time before she was able to see what she had gotten into.</span></div></div>",

Ever since he'd gotten separated from Renamon in a data storm, he'd been forced to wander on his own.<br>\r\nHis scaly feet trudged along the barely visible path as all around the wind whistled through bleak, rocky landscape. Tired as ever, Guilmon looked for some place where he could rest. Spotting a nearby rock formation he started towards it, hoping to find some shelter in it's shadow. Better still, he discovered a thin, narrow cave in the rock face he was barely able to squeeze into. As he settled down in the larger internal cavern, he rubbed his stomach. It had been days since he had a good meal and he was a good bit thinner because of it.<br>\r\nLeaning back, Guilmon relaxed in the cool of the cave.<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\nThe wall and some of the floor behind him crumbled and the dino suddenly found himself sliding down a long sandy slide, plunging deeper into the Digital Worlds depths. Eventually the slightly bruised Digimon rolled to a stop in a moderately large chamber.<br>\r\nStanding slowly, Guilmon shot his Pyro Sphere onto the ground in front of him, lighting up the room if only briefly. Looking around he spotted something just ahead of him, something that caught his eye and yet was iimpossible to properly identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?</span></div></div>",

Anyone observing might have thought Guilmon weird for doing that, but truth be told he'd eaten far weirder in his life. Like the time he'd eaten a toaster, thinking it saved the hassle of putting bread in to make toast. Or the time he'd eaten an alarm clock just to stop it from making noise. <br>\r\nChoosing to rest for a moment before climbing out of the cave, Guilmon leaned against the wall and rubbed his bulging middle gently as he felt the object inside him. Soon the Digimon dozed off in the cool of the cave, unaware that the object he'd ingested was already working some power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Guilmon came to later, after some weird dreams of eating food that looked like anything but food, he yawned and stretched as he usually did. Oddly enough, the cave seemed different somehow than when he'd fallen asleep. But Guilmon put it out of his mind as he crawled back over to the hole and began working his way up it.<br>\r\nIt was tough going for some reason. His claws didn't seem to want to dig into the rocks and everything seemed vaguely slippery. Eventually he made it though and leaping the last couple feet he flopped belly first on the sandy cave floor. As he got up and started brushing himself off, he noticed that the sand didn't seem to want to come off him. Shrugging it off, since the sand didn't itch or anything, Guilmon just figured he'd take a bath at the next river or whatever.<br>\r\nExiting the cave, he could see it was still rather bright out under the Digital Worlds Sun. Shielding his eyes against the light, he scanned the landscape. It was then he noticed something odd...</span></div></div>",

It was like his hand was some sort of red gelatin dessert.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this was worrysome and Guilmon scanned his whole body to find the same thing. Every bit of him was vaguely see through. And not only that, his body had a sort of shine his scales shouldn't have had after such a dusty trip. Speaking of which, the sand that had covered his belly seemed to be gone and he rubbed his front, feeling his hand squeak faintly against his jiggling middle.<br>\r\nGuilmon just stood there for a long moment, thinking about this. He knew it had to be that thing he swallowed, but despite being see through, the object seemed to have vanished from his stomach. <br>\r\nFinally he came to a decision. Shrugging his shoulder he started off across the sands in the direction he'd been heading. He reasoned that there was no reason to panic just yet. He may have been changed physically, but he was still the same more or less. And even if this new development proved to be problematic, there was nothing he could do now save find civilization. Panicking would solve nothing.<br>\r\nSo the lizard walked.<br>\r\nAnd walked.<br>\r\nAnd walked...<br>\r\nAbout mid-afternoon or so (hard to say since the sun never really set until night fall), Guilmon had to stop for a break. All the long walking had been wearisome on the poor dino and he wiped his brow despite not being able to sweat. He placed his clawed hands against the ground to steady himself, and for the second time that day he was surprised since his hands were on the ground and he was still upright.<br>\r\nLooking down, Guilmon let out a small yelp of surprise. Below his waste his legs had vanished into a pile of red jell, looking behind him he could see his tail surrounded by a small pool of the jell as well, though thankfully there was none to be seen beyond, which at least told him he hadn't lost any of himself.<br>\r\nStill it was disturbing to see his legs gone completely. A memory came to mind though of a Jello mold he'd had with his tamer once. On a hot dy the jello had melted into something less solid. Guilmon could only guess that with his new form, the heat of the desert was doing that to his new dessert-like body.<br>\r\nLooking around, he spotted some more rocks about a hundred yards away. Angling for them, Guilmon began to move again. How he was able to move with no legs, he wasn't sure, but he had to keep going. He had almost melted to his chest before he made it into the cool of the shade and he sat back to relax. As he looked over the jell that was his body, he wished his legs were back, and the more he thought about it, the more he wanted it. And, amazingly, as his body began to cool once more, the jell that had been trailing behind him began to solidify again into his familiar limbs.<br>\r\nThankful that the crisis was over for the moment, Guilmon dropped off to sleep once more, with a final resolve to wait for night fall before continuing.</span></div></div>",

Stretching slightly and yawning, Guilmon looked his body over again to make sure it wasn't some weird dream. Sadly it wasn't as his body was still the same shiny, vaguely see-through mass it was when he fell asleep.<br>\r\nBefore setting out on his journey again though, Guilmon decided to take the time to experiment with his new physical state.He gently poked and prodded his body all over, feeling the same jiggling nature in every spot. Then by accident he poked his belly a little too hard and gasped in shock as his clawed finger plunged right into his middle. Guilmon hurriedly pulled it out, but there was no wound, only a small hole in his belly which slowly filled in with his jell body.<br>\r\nEven more curious now, Guilmon pressed his clawed hand against his belly and pushed. His whole hand slid inside him easily. And oddly, while he could feel his hand stirring his insides gently, it didn't look like it was plunged into him. His arm seemed to grow out of his belly as naturally as it did out of his shoulder.<br>\r\nGuilmon gave a tug to his hand but found it to be stuck for the moment, pulling harder resulted in another surprise. His arm separated at the elbow and he found himself with half his arm hanging at his side and the other still stuck in his middle. Yet despite their separation, both moved as naturally as before. On a whim, Guilmon willed his arm back to where it used to be. The hand inn his belly seemed to dissolve and the jell moved through his body and then bubbled out his stump of a arm, recreating the missing portion of his limb.<br>\r\nGuilmon was getting excited now. Even his still somewhat childish mind came to the realization he couldn't be hurt any more. Any bullet would pass through him, and if he were cut or even dismembered he could pull himself back together.<br>\r\nGuilmon continued with his trials and found he could do still more, it was harder, but he found he could will his body to be shaped however he liked. The first form he did was Renamons, he knew the vixens shape so well.His figure transformed into the identical shape of the female fox, however Guilmon still retained his original colors, and instead of being fury, he remained the shiny jell he had become.<br>\r\nRelaxing back into his own form again Guilmon wondered if he should continue on his trip or experiment more. He had a few more ideas on stuff to try, but the cool night was getting on and it would be easier to travel than in the scorching heat of the day.</span></div></div>",

He reached the gates just as the surroundings changed from night to day and the gates swung open. Guilmon practically had to jump out of the way as transports of traveling sales-mons hurried out of the city, intent on getting to their next destination before nightfall. As soon as the rush cleared, Guilmon noticed his tail tip was missing. A moment later he found it as the puddle of goo slithered up to his foot and sank into him, regrowing out his stump of a tail where it belonged.<br>\r\nGuilmon entered the city now and watched eagerly as Digimon hurried up and down the streets, each focused on a particular task of some sort. Guilmon walked towards the center of the city where a large fountain sprayed water high into the air. It was about then his non-existant stomach grumbled. Looking around, Guilmon spotted a restaurant named Gotsumons Grill and went inside.<br>\r\nThe room was dimly lit compared to the bright outdoors and it took a moment for Guilmons eyes to adjust. The room was, oddly though, covered in metal. Walls, floors, ceiling, tables, chairs, even the long tall bar was metal. Guilmon could only guess it was all belt to be sturdy in case things got rowdy. <br>\r\nQuicksteping around the tables and avoiding other patrons engrossed in their food and drink, Guilmon made his way up to the bar where a Gotsumon, most likely the owner, stood cleaning glasses. \"Hey there,\" he smiled as Guilmon plopped into a seat, \"Always glad to see a new face around here. What can I get ya?\"<br>\r\nGuilmon blushed slightly, \"Actually, I don't really have any money, or anything to trade with. Is it possible I could get a job here? Just for a while.\"<br>\r\nThe stone digimon eyes Guilmon carefully, as though trying to make up his mind. \"Well, to be honest I'm not really hiring right now. Now I'll take ya in, and you can work for your meals, but this place gets really rough sometimes. Last three waiters I had were sent to the hospital for trying to break up the fights.\"<br>\r\nGuilmon gulped nervously.<br>\r\n\"On the other hand,\" Gotsumon continued, \"You could always try and win our local competition. Winner gets a hundred thousand Digi-dollars and free meals from any restaurant in town for life. But I will say the competition this year looks really rough, and won't be easy to go against.\"<br>\r\n\"What sort of competition is it?\" Guilmon asked, curiously.<br>\r\n\"The local 'Eat 'Till You Explode' tournament,\" Gotsumon smiled, \"A eating contest that lasts as long as the players last. And let me tell you, they are hard to beat. The last winner kept up stiff competition for his rivals for three whole days before the last one collapsed into a food coma. He still hasn't woken up.\"<br>\r\nGuilmon looked nervous. Which should he do?</span></div></div>",

Lost in the depths of a dark forest in the Digital World, the yellow vixen had beens tumbling around for days, weak from lack of food and lack of sleep due to the seemingly endless cold rain that poured down. Occasionally she found a dry patch under a big tree to rest for a while, but the cold wind took her breath away with every hard gust piercing her drenched fur coat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She couldn't go on. Hunger and weariness were taking their toll.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spotting another large tree as she trudged forwards Renamon curled up in a small notch in the side of it. <i>Is this really how it ends?</i> she thought darkly, <i>A life spent fighting to get strong finding friends, having a home and a... family. And now I loose to the very nature of the Digital World? How pathetic...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking up at the dark sky barely visible through the tree branches she sighed and spoke allowed. \"They say the Digi Gnomes grant wishes of humans, but do they listen to the actual Digimon?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a sigh she shook her head and looked skywards again, \"If I could have a wish, it would be to have a way to solve all my problems. I wish I had a way to have everything I lost or need and then some. I don't care if it sounds greedy, right now I want what I deserve for all I've been through.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course Renamon was sounding greedy and she knew it, but after slogging through the cold rain and being wet, hungry, and miserable for days it was understandable she'd about had enough. As she leaned back against the tree though, there was a sudden crack and with a yelp Renamon, too tired to react in time, fell backwards and down a muddy slope into the dark depths of an underground chamber.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a groan Renamon tried to brush some of the muck from her eyes and face groaning as she felt herself absolutely covered in the muddy mess. As her keen eyes looked around for any method of getting out, she spotted a strange glow, carefully standing up and finding she had the head room to do so, Renamon tried to find the source of the strange lavender glow that filled the chamber.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As it turned out it was right over her head in the shape of a strange pendent hanging off a golden chain that dangled from the tree roots. The pendent itself was shaped like a flower with a strange blue gemstone set in the center the size of a circle formed between the thumb an forefinger touching fingertips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spotting some writing on the back of the pendent, Renamon carefully pulled it down and tried to read it in the dim light.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" 'Wishes small and wishes grand, help to shape the Digital Land. Anything you want and more, but remember be careful what you wish for.' \" Renamon blinked turning the pendent over, \"A wishing amulet? Anything I want?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It seemed too good to be true, which normally would have been exactly the case, but in the digital world anything was possible, So with some minor hesitation, Renamon slipped the chain over her neck and let the pendent rest over her chest ruff of fur. The pendent flashed brightly for a moment and then dimmed somewhat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, might as well test it.

Slowly she pressed the opening to her mouth,  tilted the bottle up, and began to wet her lips.<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow as he tongue lapped at the substance. It was unlike anything Renamon had ever tried. In just a fraction of a second she tasted at least fifteen different fruit juice flavors, but it was much more than that. A second later and she had another two dozen she didn't even have names for dancing around on her tongue. <br>\r\nIt was almost a painful wrench to pull the bottle away from her mouth, but she'd unintentionally drank nearly half and her conscience reminded her about Guilmon being thirsty.<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she passed him the bottle, \"It seems ok to drink.\"<br>\r\nShe smiled, smacking her lips gently as she figured she'd let Guilmon discover the taste for himself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been about two years after the clash against the D-Ripper, and everything was calm. The incident, while not out of common knowledge, was very secretive, and only those involved ever knew the true story, aside from the one told by the government of Japan. Takato, Rika and Henry had left the town for important matters, and decided the digimon should stay back home, as they were concerned anyone would think of them as dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon let out an annoyed sigh as she headed over to Takato's home, to meet up with Guilmon. Due to some new oddities in her body, and a strange heat in the area around her stomach, she decided to investigate. See, ever since she had come back to the human world, her body had changed a quite a lot, reflecting on the physiology of both humans and normal every day animals. She had grown more curvaceous, having gained what a few books described as 'genitalia' and 'breasts'. to put it bluntly, she had fully become a female animal. being a digimon, she didn't know the full extent of it, but she had read up on a particularly interesting state female animals, included foxes like herself, entered at a specific time of year, a state of estrus, also known as 'heat'. she didn't understand very much of it, aside from it existing to perpetuate a species, and she didn't have enough time to investigate further (which was only made more inconvenient since Rika took her laptop with her). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having the means to invetigate, she had anything else to do, and she was bored due to Rika's absence, so it made perfect logical sense to entertain herself with Guilmon, even if the big lug was a pain to deal with due to him being so childish. She preferred an entertaining annoyance, much more than a boring fluff ball like Terriermon and Lopmon. Without so much as giving the door a knock, she just opened it and stepped inside, only to get tackled down by a startled Guilmon, who attacked, thinking she was some kind of robber, who had sneaked into the house to steal his bread. At this moment, Renamon just remained still, her body almost not responding, her nose had picked up an... interesting smell. Some musky... enticing smell that almost made her go crazy. After a few growls from the reptile-like digimon, she snapped out of it as he started to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, evil person!?\" Guilmon hissed aggressively, before getting punched right in the mouth by Renamon. \"Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilmon, it's me.\" Renamon said as she glared at the shorter digimon, fist still clenched as she stood up, ready to punch him in the face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon whimpered a little bit before hiding underneath a table looking over to Renamon wide eyed. \"I-I'm sorry, Renamon! I-I thought you were a mean h-human that came to steal all of Takato's bread!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon stared at him blank faced for a few moments, mulling over the smel a little bit before getting an idea. She could take Guilmon over to a park, and train with him, after all, he was just as strong as her. It'd just be a while, and she could have a little bit of a break off of the boring life humans usually had, and besides, it could help her get the weird heat in her stomach out of her mind. with that decision made, she had a little bit of a chat with the big lug, and took him over to the park where Takato kept him at all times just a little bit more than a year ago, and just decided to have their little sparring match right in front of guilmon's old home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got there, Renamon hopped away from Guilmon, taking a fighting stance once she was far away enough from the smaller Digimon. \"are you ready?\" she said, with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon smiled a little bit and nodded, before taking a fighting pose himself. \"Ready\" he said, before rushing over to her and trying to tackle her as hard as he possibly could, almost the same as he had done a few minutes ago. Renamon tried to jump out of the way, but since Guilmon had actually grown to be almost as fast as her, he actually managed to grab her by the tail, with the intention of slamming her into the ground. And as he did, he felt a peculiar smell that made him feel very weird. see, he like Renamon had grown body structures similar to those of humans and animals, and, for some unexplainable reason, he had developed canine mammal-like structures, even though he was very much a reptilian being. the smell, which he had felt before, when he had pinned renamon less than a few minutes ago, only now it was much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon groaned as she lay on the ground, pinned down by Guilmon, who was just to heavy to get him off of her, specially since he had his feet and his claws on her limbs, effectively preventing her from moving. However, as she tried to struggle away from him, that peculiar smell got to her again, now much stronger. and as it did, she could feel herself growing hotter and hotter, to the point it was slowly getting between her legs, and... she could feel a certain wetness growing between them. she then looked up to Guilmon who had a small pink blush on his cheeks and a....</span></div></div>",

Renamon stared at the door, suddenly growing regretful. she had just started doing that to such an innocent being... granted, she didn't know what was happening, but it still made her feel bad seeing guilmon so freaked out. with a cautious look on her face, she started to approach him slowly, crawling towards him, in an attempt to look smaller. however, as she approached she couldn't help but to stare at that thing between guilmon's legs again. it was still stiff and just standing there, pulsating a little bit, with a curious bulb at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry.\" she said, stopping right in front of him, taking a very submissive possition, her nose practically pushed against the thick red shaft as she looked up to him, with regret in her eyes. however, even if she did feel regret, she could feel her body about to explode, and the more she stared at that thick thing she couldn't help but to get closer and closer, until her lips were pushed to the tip of red thing in a little kis. \"g-Guilmon... please forgive me. I'll do anything for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon stared at her blankly, his claw now settled on the top of her head and the thick red thing twitching and pulsating a little bit. there was something he could do with it... and he had a few thoughs, mainly hunches that gave him vague ideas of what to do. he opened his mouth to tell renamon something but stopped himself to think what he should say. finally, he decided and opened his mouth again to say.</span></div></div>",

But there are some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep the focus on Renamon and/or Guilmon. New characters may appear, but those two are the focus of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No one sentence paragraphs. I reserve the right to delete or edit any posts I deem too short or utterly unintelligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No human sex. If your going to bring in humans for adult moments (or at all really), they need to be transformed into Digimon through some sort happenstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Always give an out. In every chapter always list at least two options for the characters to take, either with the path you want or out of it. No change need be permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No death or gore. If any character pops or something, they will do so like a balloon and return to normal in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Pregnancy, should it come up, will only be with Digi-eggs, and of those, if any have to hatch for the story, keep it as few as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Try to follow one theme, don't go from one theme to another without giving an explanation. Changes may stack, like macro growth and weight gain, but do not just suddenly stop one to start another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Watersports, scat, and other such gross instances are completely out. Not one instance of them or the chapter will be deleted. I will tolerate some minor slob (belching, farting, a dusting of crumbs or other debris covering a body) but don't make it the main focus of a story. And always allow the option of the character getting cleaned up in a followup chapter.</td>",
