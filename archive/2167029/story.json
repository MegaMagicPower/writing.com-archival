To try an create some order there will be five categories of cryptids, by clicking the right category you'll be able to choose the cryptid you'd like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease note, there are a lot of cryptids in folk-lore (More so that I'm including mythical creatures as well.) so I won't have every cryptid in the list. If you'd like a cryptid added please ask me instead of adding it yourself so that it can go into the right category.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the categories are as followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLand-Dwelling Cryptids<br>\r\nSimply, cryptids that walk and live on land, this category won't include human cryptids or creatures that are regularly depicted using magic.<br>\r\nExamples of the Cryptids in this category: Big Foot (All of them), Mongolian Death Worm, Chupacabra, Tatzelwurm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatic Cryptids<br>\r\nCryptids of the sea, any cryptid that lives in the ocean or bodies of water. Amphibians will only be included if they are known to live in water, unlike the first category this one will include human creatures (aka mermaids.)<br>\r\nExamples of Cryptids in this category: Bunyip, Leviathan, Nessie, Kraken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying Cryptids<br>\r\nCryptids that have the ability to fly, this category does not contain cryptids who have the ability to fly using supernatural means, it will also exclude humans.<br>\r\nExamples of Cryptids in this category: Mothman, Ahool, Thunderbird, Jersey Devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupernatural Cryptids<br>\r\nHuman cryptids and creatures that have been known to use magic. <br>\r\nExamples of Cryptids in this category: Baba Yaga, Vampires, Were-wolves, Fairies, Jinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythological Creatures<br>\r\nMonsters and creatures found in mythology that aren't nesseccarily considered cryptids.<br>\r\nExamples of creatures found in this category: Hydra, Griffin, Draugr, Xiezhi.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Take up the role of the half-human child of famous cryptids living in a world where they are considered monsters and hunted. Will you choose to wage war against the human, try to hide yourself and others like you, or maybe even help the humans hunt others of your kind? The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryptids in this story aren't just wild animals that the world has yet to discover. (Considering they have human children that would just be weird) They are sentient beings, however way you which that to be portrayed. They could be supernatural beings, gods, cursed humans etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the story, the characters will all be at least partially human, after all, there needs to be something that connects them to the human world. But how much of them is human and how much it shows is up to you, they could look completely normal except for having odd abilities, or they may look like a younger version of their cryptid parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules! They're pretty much the same my other interactives but read them anyway to refresh yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 13+ story: I'm sure you can read up on the specifics of what that means but essentially make it appropriate for young teens and older to be reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn regards to cryptids with multiple origins (most notably, were-wolves): There won't be a separate line for Gevaudan were-wolves and Lycaon were-wolves, or any of the other million were-wolf origins, after picking were-wolf you can choose which were-wolf origin to use in your character's story, not all characters have to use the same as the others. But if it has already been mentioned in a story that the character is the great great great great great great grandson of Lycaon's youngest son, don't suddenly change it to them being a descendant of someone bitten by the Bete de Gevaudan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice long chapters: No one likes one-liners, they waste chapters, there's no point asking people if they want the character to be called Fred or Mike, just pick the name you like and if someone doesn't like the name, they can always make a different storyline with their own characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllow multiple characters: When starting a story, make sure to leave an option for someone to create a different character, not everyone wants to play the same character as you do, and hey, with more characters being made you could even have them appear in another character's story as friends or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo Wild! As long as you stick to the 13+ get a crazy as you want with the stories, these are your stories and you can shape them in any way you want. You want your character to have a 50-foot one-eyed, one-horned flying purple people-eater as a pet? then go right ahead (Though maybe teach it to eat pork instead) I'm not going to delete chapters for being too crazy, as long as the other rules are followed you have free reign.</td>",
