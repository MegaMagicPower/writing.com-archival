Ryoga had already \"wished\" to be on a date, but that didn't make it true that he was on a date. It was just true that he wanted to be on the date. Very little change<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at first, it seemed like nothing happened. That bastard Ranma sneered. \"Some wishing ring, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair wrapped Ryoga like a blanket. He didn't understand. Anything he said with this ring came true, right? \"I don't understand! I should be on a loving date with my real fianc\u00e9 right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the blink of an eye, Ryoga found himself by a lake, sprawled on a blanket in the grass. He shook his head in puzzlement. Shouldn't he be somewhere else right now? He couldn't quite recall. It almost hurt to recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanko was going through a similar predicament. She had been arguing with someone, hadn't she? She vaguely remembered anger and fighting and mocking. But trying to think about those feelings just left her mind in a deep fog. Why the arguing and yelling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor reasons Ryoga and Ranko couldn't understand, all they felt like being right now was \"loving\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes meet and bright smiles lighten up their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darling... I'm so happy to be enjoying such a wonderful picnic.\" Ranko's method of being loving to her fianc\u00e9 wasn't all that different from how a disguised Ranma would wrap Ryoga around \"her\" finger. Lots of flattery and promises of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga blushed. \"You- you really mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ryoga! I can't think of a better way to spend my afternoon than with my <i>handsome</i> betrothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! Ryoga couldn't believe it. The ring had given him a beautiful, kind woman to spend a happy marriage with. For all the misery in his life, something finally went his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness there wasn't any twist.</span></div></div>",

They walked around the lake, and held hands while enjoying the scenery. If by fate, or design of the ring, the bandana-clad boy never once managed to utter a 'truth' that disrupted their good time, with only asking for the occasional flair to enhance things: a flower to place in 'Ranko's' hair, a few yen to buy ice cream. It was so mundane, that it came off almost surreal in the outlandish chaos that was typical in Nerima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout it all, there was a slight nagging in the two's minds that something was terribly, <i>awfully</i> wrong, but both quashed it as quickly as could be. All that was important was that 'Ranko' was with her beloved husband-to-be, while Ryoga finally had someone who accepted him for who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for several hours, as the midday weather eventually started to fade into dusk. However reluctant they were, at the first sign of a shiver, Ryoga offered to take his fiancee home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, this more amounted to Ranko guiding Royga arm in arm back to the dojo, but that sense of protective duty despite his directional foibles was what she found so cute about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course though, this was a 'loving date,' and what better way to symbolize that, then to end it all with a passionate kiss? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking up to the Tendo gates, the two, still tightly woven under the magic Ryoga's 'truth,' turned to each other. There was a slight bashfulness in both of them, but an equal twinkle of longing in their eyes. Ryoga was the first to instigate, as he cupped at his girlfriend's cheek. Ranko leaned in, rising up to her tiptoes; her masculine lover always towering over her petite form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their eyes closed, as their faces drew inches away. For the second time that day they were about to embrace, and it felt as natural and right as anything else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spark lit between the two as their lips met, and for a wonderful moment, they were together as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until Ranma wondered just what the hell she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, I think I should make a portrait out of this one.\u201d Nabiki spoke, as the flash of her camera tapered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, Ranko! This is so sweet. I always knew you'd find a boyfriend!\u201d Came the jubilant voice of Nodoka, as she clasped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiance, Mrs. S. She <i>did</i> agree to it.\u201d Nabiki corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR- Ranko, we were worried... You've been gone for hours.\u201d Akane had an annoyed twitch on her face, but nevertheless kept the charade up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just about to go looking for you, sugar.\u201d Ukyo's tone was even, but her eyes were zeroed in on the sight of her currently female 'fiance' locking lips with a man. Suddenly the idea of practicing her breast-bindings again, and dusting off her boys school uniform, wasn't sounding like the craziest idea. \u201cShampoo already did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon left only a few minutes after Ranma and Ryoga had. With experience of tracking the redhead across all of China, she thought she'd be able to catch the two quick, but the magic of the ring inhibited her from interfering, and instead led the girl on a wild goose chase that she was still lost on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma could only thank the little blessings. This, and the fathers being away on a 'training trip,' helped make her not <i>totally</i> want to melt into a puddle and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse for Ryoga was the tingling he still felt on his lips. The past few hours were an odd blur for him, but the normally dark and depressive aura that surrounded him seemed to be... lessened. Like, for just a moment, he was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that <i>Ranma</i> might have caused him to be happy was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner's ready!\u201d Kasumi chirped, as she walled over to where all the commotion was. \u201cOh, Ranko. You're back!\u201d She paused. \u201cI like the flower in your hair.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nabiki followed, already volunteering her experience services for the ceremony. She'd conned her way into various professions including priesthood, a wedding was no trouble. Their words of recitals and love vows and flower girls attempt to reach Ryoga's brain, only to encounter a harsh wall of denial. This couldn't be happening. This couldn't possibly be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanko was too absorbed in her own bafflement to join him. Hands combed her dress carefully, feeling the soft fabric of her girlish outfit. How in the hell had he been shoved into this get-up? And what was he doing with Ryoga?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raaaanmaaaa...\" the familiar, dangerous tone of an angry Akane spoke to him from the pit of horror he found himself in. \"You aren't manipulating Ryoga again, are you? You wouldn't do that &lt;i&gt;right?&lt;/i&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma's mouth desperately fumbled for a defense. He's not a pervert, and what does that have to do with an uncute girl like you. The typical things that got him beat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, Ranma's fingers curled around the flower in her hair. Puzzled, she pulled it out to examine it closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's this.\" A strange mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ranma answer the question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane's rage was directed to the flower. \"What? How should I know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like ya date gave it to ya, sugar.\" A bitter retort from Ukyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brain refused to understand. Even with his memories and evidence, he refused to grasp it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finances paused, glancing at each other warily. Ranma could be dumb, but this was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah... with Ryoga? That's what happened, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDate. With Ryoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower was crushed in Ranma's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo didn't understand in time but Akane immediately went to work throwing herself between Ranma and the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ranma, don't you dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him and his stupid ring, Akane!\" The anger was pushing through Ranma's mouth like a stampede over Mufasa. \"It's all his fault and he's gonna pay for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightbulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wish ring. That's it!\" The anger shifted to glee as she pushed past Akane. \"I just gotta get the ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- Ranma!\" But he couldn't hear his fianc\u00e9 over sheer desperation and a need for solutions.</span></div></div>",

A stray thought, caused by some conversation at school she already forgot about made her think about certain things. Specifically, of Ranma, of Shampoo, of Ukyo, of Kodachi, of Happosai, of many more as her mind leaped from person to person. She didn't exactly hate them (okay, she didn't hate ALL of them), but she did hate how they all complicated her once simple life. That was when she tripped over something and fell in some mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grumbling for a bit, Akane turned to see what tripped her and found a small, plain, white box. Curiosity overtaking her, Akane opened it up. Inside was a piece of paper and a small silver ring with a light blue gem in the center. The paper read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THE RING OF TRUTH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever wears this Ring, their words will become law. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ring of Truth binds itself to the one who discovers it and puts it on, so that none but the wearer can remove it. Whenever the wearer pictures the Ring in their mind and speaks, reality itself will conform to the wearer's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay you use this awesome gift wisely.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAkane picked up the ring and slipped it onto her left ring finger. Her first instinct was to scoff at what seemed like an obvious trick, but she thought back to the many, MANY magical items she encountered in her life, so she figured she might as well give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane looked down at her muddy dress. It was good enough a test as any. \"This dress is now clean,\" Akane said uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. The dress was still dirty. Just her luck to run into a fake ring and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. The paper said to picture the ring in her mind. And she didn't think she did that. Okay, just one more test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dress is now clean.\" Akane made sure to imagine the ring's appearance as she spoke. To her amazement, the dress went from covered in mud to completely spotless in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I didn't think that would actually work.\" She considered just how powerful this trinket was, and how amazingly fortunate she was to run into it (almost literally). She didn't know what this ring's limitations were, if it even had any, but that didn't make it any less impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin formed on Akane's face.

Besides, her life started getting weird once he showed up, and he was kinda-sorta the cause of all the disturbances in her life. She'd always wanted to put him in his place, and now she had the tool to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane made her way to the Tendo residence, managing to get there before Ranma did. Once Ranma did get there, he saw Akane leaning on a post at the front of the dojo, her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ranma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi, Akane,\" Ranma said, a bit absently. From her pose to the smile on her face, Akane just emanated a feeling of... smugness? That was odd. Ranma was about to ask Akane about that when he saw a ring on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up with that ring? I never saw you wearing it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane figured he would notice, so she already had a lie prepared. \"Oh, this? There was a guy on the street hawking jewelry at a hefty markdown. I got this one for about 500 yen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" He was sceptical of her explanation, but he wasn't quite sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" said Akane, \"I've been getting a bit bored lately. I was thinking, say... a sparring match would be one way to pass the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma looked perplexed at what Akane suggested. \"A sparring match? Is that really the best way to cure your boredom? I mean, no offense, but I'd totally kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost days, that would be enough to make her pissed off, but not today. With a smirk, she said, \"Oh really? <i>You'd</i> kick <i>my</i> ass? That's odd, given how <i>I'm the strongest a person could possibly be</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane didn't see it, but the ring's gem glistened once she finished her statement. But Akane didn't need to see it. While everything around her seemed the same as it had always been, she could just FEEL reality bending to her words. She smirk widened even further, as she was so excited at the power she held in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she heard Ranma's response to her claim, she would learn more about how this ring worked.

Cleaning a dress was one thing, but this was quite another. If Ranma admitted how strong she was, she must be pretty strong indeed. More importantly, Ranma didn't seem at all confused when she said how powerful she was. So not only did the Ring of Truth alter reality, it altered HISTORY. \"That means I make any changes I want and nobody will notice,\" Akane thought. She felt like there was literally nothing she couldn't accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Akane, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped Akane out of her train of thought. \"Huh? Oh, yes. I was just thinking about some things. Anyway, are you still open to sparring with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?\" Ranma spoke with bravado, possibly a false one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll meet you at the practice hall in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, the two combatants faced each other in the practice hall, Akane in her karate gi and Ranma in the same clothes he had before. Both people performed the customary bow and got into their stances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane thought, \"Hmm, I have no idea just how strong I am now. But what would be the best way to test that? Maybe if I-\". Her thoughts were cut short when she noticed that Ranma already had his arms around her neck. Just a few seconds into the spar and she was already in a standing neck lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, \" thought Akane, \"how could I've let my guard down?... Huh?\" Ranma was trying to force Akane down to the floor, but to no avail. Eyes closed, teeth clenched, he was clearly using all his might, but her body refused to budge a centimeter. \"Heh, this'll be even easier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane tensed her neck, sending Ranma to the ground so hard you would think he got hit by a car. As Ranma was rubbing his back in pain, Akane laughed. \"I did barely anything and you're already on the mat! Ready to give up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma got to his feet and said, \"You really think I'm gonna give up after just one attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane shrugged her shoulders. \"Not really, but it was worth a shot. You know what, you might have gotten the first attack off, but I'm feeling generous, so you can have the second one for free as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma grumbled as he saw Akane's smirk, the very definition of a shit-eating grin. The same goddamn grin she she had every time they fought. What he wouldn't give to wipe it off her face. \"Seriously? You're gonna regret that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than Akane could see, Ranma leaped up to Akane and started punching. It was a flurry of punches, hundreds of them per second. To Akane, they were completely invisible, but she did feel and hear them. They felt like a bunch of flies landing on her torso in quick succession and sounded like a hammer repeatedly hitting a steel wall. She smiled. Her body must be the toughest thing on Earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane put her hands on her hips and laughed. \"Really Ranma, don't you get it? There's no way you can beat me! Any attack you use will simply bounce right off my immovable body! Why, I bet my toes are stronger than your entire body! Don't you remember how many times you've fought me - and lost?\" Akane had no idea how many times that was, but she knew that Ranma did.<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Just shut up and let me beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane rolled her eyes at Ranma's outburst. Ranma was sweating pretty heavily from the exertion, but Akane knew that he could keep that up for at least a few minutes more, and she wanted to finish demonstrating her newfound superiority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing as quick as she could, Akane brought her right foot up to Ranma's chest and pushed him to the mat. Soon, Ranma found himself with his back on the floor, Akane's dainty foot keeping him pinned down. He struggled a bit, only for Akane to exert a tiny bit more of her tremendous might, making him cry out in agonizing pain. Akane heard some bones creaking, but she didn't think it was anything serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You sure talk a big game, but you can't even move one of my feet!\" Akane moved her left foot onto Ranma's stomach so that she was standing completely on him, making Ranma cry out even more. \"Keep in mind, I'm going <i>easy</i> on you. Tell you what: admit that I'm the strongest person on Earth and we can end this without any broken bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way am I giving up to a tomboy like you.\" Ranma was still predictable as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Akane brought her left leg over her head, held it there for a moment while giving a smirk, then suddenly brought it down towards Ranma's head. Ranma flinched, but Akane only brought her foot to right in front of his chin, her toes curled inwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ranma, Ranma. I've tried to be nice, but this is my final warning. Admit my superiority and I won't uncurl my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma gulped despite the ridiculousness of her threat, as if this exact situation has happened before. He took a deep breath and said, \"You-you are the strongest person who ever lived. No one could ever be half as strong as you. I could train for a hundred years and still be weaker than your pinky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane smiled. It looked like she did do this sort of thing in this reality. \"Very good.\" She hopped off of Ranma's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma got up to his feet, said, \"Hmph\", and walked out the room without looking back at Akane. Akane, for her part, loved what happened. She loved being able to dominate Ranma for, and so easily at that. She loved finding the Ring of Truth. Now, she just needed to figure out what to do now. She was nearly overwhelmed by the options the ring gave her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being super strong was one thing, but there was so much more to learn about this ring and what it could do. Might as well test it some more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am now in my room</i>.\" There was no flash of light, no swirling colors, no stepping into the fifth dimension. All that happened was that one second she was in the practice room, the next she was in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat immediately caught her eye were a few photos on her bookshelf that weren't there before. Most of them showed her at various martial arts tournaments, wearing a gi and holding trophies (hopefully, the trophies were kept in another part of the house). But one was different in that it showed a young Akane in casual clothes, standing on top of a bear she apparently just beat up and giving a double biceps pose. It didn't give a good impression of how strong she was now, but it was still impressive and testing her strength could come later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her gi, Akane said, \"<i>I'm in my everyday clothes</i>\". Not only was that now true, but she opened her dresser and found her gi where normally put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, there's not much else I can do in such a small room. Better go to where there's more space.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, she hadn't seen Ukyo in a while and wondered how she was doing. So after thinking carefully about what to say, she said, \"<i>I'm at Okonomiyaki Ucchan\u2019s, but no one notices me teleporting there</i>\". Sure enough, she was suddenly at the restaurant, but everyone around her acted as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. For some reason, there was a long table with a bunch of seats on one side in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane saw Ukyo in the distance and ran up to her. \"Hey, Ukyo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo turned around. \"Oh hey, Akane. What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. But I was wondering why that table's over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo clapped her hands together. \"I was waiting for you to ask that. Okonomiyaki Ucchan\u2019s received its 10,000th customer just a few days ago and I decided to celebrate with an eating contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eating contest, huh?\" Shoving food down your throat wasn't the most refined or feminine thing in the world, but it could still be fun. \"Can I join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? Er, I mean, you <i>can</i>, but you do know this isn't the sort of contest where brute strength is gonna help much, right? I've never even seen you get all that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Akane pictured the Ring of Truth in her head and replied, \"Oh, I'm not just super strong, and<i> I may not be hungrier than anyone else, but I'm a total beast at competitive eating! In fact, I can outeat every student at Furinkan High School at the same time and still have room for more - and no matter how much I eat, I never get even slightly fat</i>!\" That last part was a hasty edition. Otherwise, this wish could have nasty consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our entire high school?! That's a bit hard to believe.\" She then started to stroke her chin in thought. \"Then again, I remember seeing you wolf down that entire banquet - and in less than half a minute, at that! So... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way you could lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane smiled warmly at her friend's encouragement, but then Ukyo snapped her fingers and said, \"Damn, I forgot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, forgot what?\" Akane hoped it was nothing serious. Then again, Akane could easily deal with pretty much any problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the deadline for signing up was last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane was, to be honest, a tad annoyed, but she realized it wasn't <i>really </i>Ukyo's fault that she forgot. Besides, it wasn't like there wasn't an easy fix to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, it's a good thing <i>I signed up a few days ago</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSure is! I\u2019d hate for you to miss out on this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Akane sat at the table, wearing a special shirt that all contestants had to wear. Strangely, the table was at full capacity \u2013 seven people \u2013 but there were a couple dozen other people wearing the contestant shirts standing in a corner of the room.<br>\r\nUkyo stood in front of the table and gave a speech to the audience. \u201cWelcome to Okonomiyaki Ucchan\u2019s first ever eating contest! The rules are simple: eat more than your opponents, and you win. However, this eating contest will do things a bit different from other contests.\u201d Everyone\u2019s ears perked up at Ukyo\u2019s words. \u201cThis contest received a huge number of applicants \u2013 37!\u201d In fact, not that many people signed up before Akane did. Once word got out that she applied to a local eating competition, a few meatheads signed up, hoping to defeat \u201cThe Furinkan Wunderkind\u201d in at least <i>something</i>. Ukyo continued, \u201cWe thought it would be a shame to turn these people away, so we came up with a way to take advantage of the large number of applicants. Instead of having all contestants eat at the same time, whenever a contestant can no longer eat, they are replaced with the next person in line. Additionally, if anyone other than Miss Akane Tendo wins, the prize money will be paid in full to all 36 other contestants!\u201d Akane turned her head to Ukyo in surprise. She didn\u2019t remember being told that this was how the contest would be set up. But before she could even say \u201cwait, what?\u201d, Ukyo announced the start of the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlates of food were placed down in front of each contestant. Most of it was okonomiyaki, but there were also dishes of yakisoba and scallions. Akane took one plate in front of her and devoured it in less than a second, the food just going down her throat, barely needing to be chewed. She took a large bowl of noodles and downed it just as quickly. The same went for her third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dishes. Akane knew that her previous words made her the best competitive eater by far, but she didn\u2019t give it too much thought, so she didn\u2019t truly expect to be able to eat food this quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was certainly eating much faster than her opponents. By the time the runner-up was reaching for his fourth plate, Akane already had twenty plates and a dozen bowls stacked up in front of her. Soon, a contestant passed out, followed by another, and then some more. Some of the competitors had wide smiles plastered on their faces, thinking that they had finally trapped Akane in a fight she couldn\u2019t win, only for those smiles to turn to frowns, partly from the realization of how bottomless Akane\u2019s stomach was, and partly because they were about to throw up. Meanwhile, Akane never showed the slightest sign of slowing down.<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, Akane\u2019s final opponent finally passed out. Upon seeing this, Ukyo made her way to Akane\u2019s seat. It was tricky, as Akane ate so much that there was no room on the table for the countless dishes she used, so most of them had to be placed on the floor around her. When she got to her, Ukyo raised Akane\u2019s arm and shouted, \u201cThe winner is\u2026 AKANE TENDO!\u201d To the audience, it was clear that Akane would win right around when her fifteenth opponent collapsed, but they clapped all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the audience left, and the contestants were carried away, Ukyo spoke with Akane. \u201cThat was amazing! But I just knew you could do it. Anyway, do you want your prize money in cash or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? You can keep the money. I don\u2019t really need it that much.\u201d In truth, Akane was more interested in seeing what the ring could do than using it for money. \u201cBut why pit me against dozens of other guys? You never told me you\u2019d do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo blinked in response. \u201cWhat do you mean? We both agreed on this back when you signed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh yeah, now I remember. I guess I just forgot.\u201d That\u2019s the problem with using a magic ring that changes history: you never remember the new history you\u2019ve just created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo thought it was odd that she would just forget about something like that, but she just accepted that it was possible. Instead, she gazed at Akane\u2019s belly, still flat as ever despite Akane having eaten \u00be of the food eaten at this contest. \u201cIt must be nice to have a metabolism like yours\u201d, she practically mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Akane could see what Ukyo was implying, and smiled as she said, \u201cReally? I\u2019ve never seen you fat. Most likely <i>it\u2019s impossible for you to get fat</i>.\u201d She very well leave without giving her friend a gift, especially given how easy it was to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right. Guess I just have good genes, like you apparently do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane said goodbye and left Okonomiyaki Ucchan\u2019s, where she saw that it was now nighttime. That contest must have taken longer than she thought. It was probably a good idea to go home now. Then again, she might have just enough time for a little bit more fun with the ring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She held her left hand closer to get a good look at it, not to see any particular detail, but to remind herself that such an object actually existed. Sure, she had encountered her fair share of magical items, but nothing was half as miraculous as the ring she had around her finger. In a way, it reminded her of the Battle Dogi, only far more potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stray thought of the Battle Dogi made her realize something. Many such items seem wonderful at first but carry some hideous drawback such as a time limit, or it drives the user insane, or \u2013 worst of all \u2013 it gives you facial hair.

Aang met with Iroh in his Tea Shop in Ba Sing Se and recieved a surprise when the old master presented him with...a ring. \"This is the Ring of Truth\" Iroh explained to the skeptical monk \"it is an ancient artifact of great mystical power said to predate the very first Avaatar. Whoever wears the Ring can make  their every word a reality. It is very dangerous and can not be destroyed by any bending. That's why Wan, the first Avatar, hid it away over ten thousand years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's interesting and all Iroh but why give it to me?\" Aang asked \"I mean, if the very first Avatar didn't know what to do with this thing, what makes you think I do?\" Iroh smiled. \"Because you are not like the other Avatars and have done thing many of them would not be able to do. You are very special Aang and I believe you have the wisdom to make the right choice with the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroh then excused himself to tend to his costumers and left Aang with his thoughts. The young Avatar looked at the ring for several moment, contemplating what he had just been told. He could definitely feel great power within it and if what Iroh said was true, that power could do practically anything. Slipping the mighty treasure onto his finger, the Avatar weighed his options... </span></div></div>",

Nothing really interested her as it all looked like junk anyway but then she saw the ring. It was more beautiful than anything she had ever seen and there seemed to be a kind of aura about it that drew her in. The salesman noticed and a crooked grin crossed his face. \"Ah, I see you've found the Ring of Truth\" he said in an oily voice \"forged in the days before even the First Avatar, it has to the power to make the words of whoever wears it come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara raised an eyebrow at that, the ring's spell on her temporarily wearing off. \"Yeah right\" she scoffed \"if that's true, then why are you still a merchant? Why not use the ring to make yourself a king or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ring is useless to one who already has what his heart desires\" the salesman chuckled \"but you look like a person with secret wishes in their soul. You've lost someone very dear to you in recent years haven't you? Your mother right? I believe her name was Kya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's eyes widened and the salesman chuckled again. \"Don't be alarmed\" he said \"one of the things I did ask of the ring was to know all about my customers the minute I see them. I know the Avatar is alive and you're his traveling companion. I also know you seek to end the war and with the ring, you can do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't have any money left\" Katara stammered \"I just remembered but I believe you now, I have to! I'll give you anything for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salesman chucked once more and held the ring out. \"put it on\" he instructed \"and want for nothing.\" Katara did as she was told and was amazed at how well it fit. \"Now\" instructed the salesman again \"use the  ring to pay me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  waterbender was a bit confused at first then suddenly, knowledge came to her. \"My pouch has an endless supply of money\" she said confidently and an instant later, it was so. Katara pulled out a handful of coins and a big grin crossed her tan face. It actually worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara gave the salesman a thousand coins and he smiled greedily. \"Pleasure doing business with you\" he said before he and his stand vanished into thin air. Katara was a bit surprised but quickly got over it. Right now, nothing was impossible. <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She had to fight a couple of low level thugs. It was a tough fight but she won. However Batgirl had several bruises on her and a swollen black eye. The two thugs were knocked unconscious when they refused to talk to her. The police soon came to take them to police headquarters and into a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back, Batgirl was in tears than fighting crime. It was getting harder and the \"bad guys\" were not that scared of her because she was a girl. Batgirl hoped someday the criminal world would fear her and respect her fighting skills. About an hundred yards from the secret Batcave entrance, Batgirl noticed a small tin box discarded by the side of the road. She stopped to pick it up before entering the Batcave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was there at the moment, except for Alfred the butler 2 floors above her.<br>\r\nShe examined the ring carefully and researched it some more in an Greek History textbook. Then Batgirl realized that it was a magical ring that could make the truth happen by speaking it. Batgirl smiled as she placed the ring on her finger. The first thing she spoke was : I do not have any injuries on me anymore.  Suddenly all of her injuries were gone. At that moment, Batgirl realized that the ring was for real.

With it, the Dark Wizard would not only be able to bring his son back from the Land Without Magic but become invincible! But fate intervened when the mysterious Sorcerer sent his Apprentice to get  the ring from him. Though Rumplestiltskin's powers far out matched the Apprentice, the Sorcerer's disciple succeeded in sending the Ring through a portal across time and space, to a very distant land. He was also able to erase Rumplestiltskin's memory of not only their battle, but  the Ring's very existence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of years later, the Evil Queen cast the Dark curse. The entire population of the Enchanted Forest and then some was sent to the Land without Magic. It was there that they would be trapped in the town of Storybrooke, Maine, their memories taken and forced to live miserable lives under the thumb of  Mayor Regina Mills. the former Evil Queen.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwenty-eight years passed in this way with no hope in sight. It was not until the coming of Emma Swan, the prophecised Savior and secret daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, that the curse was lifted. Mr. Gold, the former Rumplestiltskin, brought magic to Storybrooke around the same time, beginning a whole new series of adventures. Little did anyone know that the Ring of Truth was also in Storybrooke, it's powers reawakened by Mr. Gold. Who will find it and use it's power...and for what?  </span></div></div>",

The girls are still out looking for firewood. Never would've expected them to take so long with it. Need somethin' to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Brandon stated as modestly as he could. \"I was just wondering where I should put the chicken and fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel paused in his work and turned around to face Brandon, and his jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE! CHICKEN!\" Daniel rushed over to Brandon, leaving his unfinished shelter as if it weren't even a concern. Brandon nodded vigorously, glad for the positive attention from a tribe mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the MAN!\" Daniel then cupped his hands over his mouth and screamed. \"HEY Y'ALL, WE'RE HAVIN' KFC TONIGHT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the tribe came back in a span of five minutes, some carrying a few pieces of fruit, some carrying twigs, and all carrying astonished glances at the soon to be meal. Toby came forth and inspected the chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny boy, where did you manage to get this? I didn't even know chickens lived this far out in the jungle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stepped forward alongside Toby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I caught it over there by the trail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby turned in surprise, not even being aware of Brandon's presence before this encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Toby stood silent for a while, as if the new information blew him away. Then one of the girls walked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is awesome! You are great! By the way, we never really did a formal introduction. My name's Beverly, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon surveyed Beverly. She was about 5'5\", about a foot shorter than him, and had short, dirty blonde hair. She seemed pretty athletic, had a bit of a \"California surfer\" accent, and was wearing khakis and a light blue tanktop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and Bev shook hands, and then he found himself being introduced to all the other members of the tribe. After a few small conversations and a lot of praise, Brandon decided to tell everyone he was going back out to hunt for more food, but in actuality, he was going to get some more use out of his all powerful ring. Once he was gone, he noticed a camera man moving to follow him, so he made his wish quickly. </span></div></div>",

He looked around and noticed that one of the guys, Bobby, the fat farmer from down south, was giving a confessional. He tried using his powers, and was able to listen to what Bobby was thinking/saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was praising the camp life and Brandon's chicken kill. \"Who woulda guessed tha the city boy from up North could atually do somethin' li tha. This trahb migh atually be pretty darn good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, it's a good thing I can get the gist of what he's saying, what with the accent and all.' Brandon thought. He surveyed the rest of his team. Most just thought about getting work done on the shelter, or getting food, or whatnot. Bev was also praising the great chicken hinter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cool is this guy. He's this scrawny, pale dude that reminds me of Slender Man at first, and he's out in the jungle for like three minutes and brings back this chicken. It's unbelievable. Our tribe doesn't have a single weak link, except for maybe Yvonne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne, a Russian-American woman in her early 40's, was on the chubbier side, but still seemed pretty strong. She didn't talk too much, and seemed to be a bit of an outsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of searching he 'found' some bananas and decided to head back to camp. On his way back, he decided to give a confessional, and used some of his psychic abilities to start talking about his tribe mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bev and Bobby both seem to be getting a lot of work done on the shelter. Steve and Danny Boy aren't getting that much done with the fire, but bless em for trying. Jo and Nikki,\" Brandon referred to the athletic African American woman and the skinny Hispanic woman, \"are getting supplies for the fire and shelter, they seem alright. I dunno what Toby and Yvonne are doing, I think she's trying to go get food too, maybe? As for Toby-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY GUYS! WE GOT TREE MAIL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked away from the camera to see Toby coming into camp with a note. Everyone dropped what they were doing to go to Toby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quicker than a fish, stronger than a bull,<br>\r\nmiss a few shots and you'll look like a fool.<br>\r\nImmunity is what you seek in the shape of a tome, <br>\r\nbe on the losing tribe and you may be sent home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's our strong swimmers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki, Jo, Bev, and Daniel raised their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it also says strong as a bull. Who's up for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, Bobby, Yvonne, and Toby raised their respective hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also says something about good aiming or targeting. Hey Chicken Killer, wanna step up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon grinned at his new title and nodded enthusiastically, receiving a hard but loving slap on the back from Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe grabbed their flag and headed out, but not before Brandon said one last thing into the ring.</span></div></div>",

Jeff then asked some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man in the shades and white wife-beater, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man from Yang Lain was a buff Caucasian American with short blonde hair and a cheeky grin plastered on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marty.\" The man said with a slight hint of a New England accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marty, how's your camp life been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, we got a fire started and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded and turned towards the Nevis tribe. \"How about you guys? Girl in front with the khakis. How's your camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. We don't have fire yet, but when we do, we'll have plenty of water, warmth, and chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded and went to start talking, but then did a double take. \"Chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel started laughing and slapped his hand onto Brandon's shoulder. \"Colonel Sanders over here killed one earlier today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked dumbfounded. \"Colonel Sanders, anything to add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon just shook his head and smiled. He cast a quick glance over at the other tribe. Some looked at him in awe, while others looked skeptical. Jeff decided to start talking about the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. For this challenge, you'll divide into two groups of four and one group of one. The first group will be the swimmers, who'll swim out over there.\" he pointed out a ways into the ocean to eight rafts that each carried objects. \"You'll drag those back. Once all four rafts have been brought back, the four strong members will be given the task of hoisting up the cargo. Glass tiles. You'll be hoisting them using a rope and they'll hang from a horizontal pole twenty feet from the ground. The last person will use rocks to try and break the windows from ten yards away. There are two catches. If any of the strong members drop their windows at any time, they will have to drag the window back to the shore line and then back to the pole. These are heavy windows. Also, the thrower will be blindfolded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon grimaced, but inwardly felt safe knowing about the wish he had made. He shook off his negative look and put on a smile. He wanted to look competitive for his tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff finished his guidelines. \"I'll give you guys a minute to get arranged, and then we'll begin.\"</span></div></div>",

The oldest man and the youngest woman being the slowest swimmers!\"<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Jerry and Danny both have their rafts untied, heading back.

Now she has to listen to a fifty year old host heckle her, too.' Brandon decided to give her some positive reinforcement. He would've given her a ring-power up, but he had foolishly left the ring back at camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got this Nikki!\" Brandon shouted. This was followed by shouts of encouragement from his teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki finally gets to her raft. Everyone has untied theirs except for her and Harold, who also seems to be struggling a bit. Bev, Jayson, and Manoj having trouble getting the rafts back.

Harold, trying to strengthen the lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon rubbed his forehead, and heard some of the tribe sigh. 'I'd hate to be her right now.' he thought.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Nikki done with her knots! She is now swimming back. Harold now getting to shore! YANG LAIN! Get your windows hung!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIT!\" Brandon figured it was Toby who swore. He waited for Probst to scream for them to go, but first he heard a loud CRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang Lain, first window down. Lex aiming for her second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon smirked as he thought of a way to slow them. \"Bobby, tell me when she's about to throw again. Quietly.\"<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISS!\" Brandon screeched as loud as he could. He waited a second and heard a curse or two from the other tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Stepped on something sharp and screamed.\" Brandon hid his smirk, though he heard Bobby and Toby laughing. He thought he might have even heard Yvonne giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff didn't pay them any attention. \"Nikki is back! Go Nevis! YOU'RE STILL IN THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH! CRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more windows! Lex only has one left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon heard grunting, and grabbed a rock from the pile. 'Time to see what I'm made of.' He thought to himself. He waited for the call that the windows were hung. But a different sound came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang Lain, WINS IMMUNITY AND FLINT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon dropped his rock as he heard the other tribe cheer. He didn't even want to take his blindfold off. 'This is what I get for not just having us win.' He stood back with his tribe as they watched the opposing team get the immunity stature. He dismissed them after tossing them flint. He then turned to Nevis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevis, got nothing for you. I'll see you tonight at tribal council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed back to camp.</span></div></div>",

True, he didn't compete in the challenge, and some of his tribemates didn't think he was too physically strong, but he had something to ensure safety. The ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It should be right where I left it.' He thought as he went right for his bag. He reached in while Nikki made a big speech about how she was sorry for blowing the swimming portion. His hand moved around a bit, but he couldn't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no... oh crap.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost the ring! How could this have happened! He looked back to the rest of his tribe, and saw that most of them were hugging Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh great, my reality altering relic isn't here, and any of these guys could've taken it!' he thought frantically. 'No, no. Nobody would just take it. I just need to be cool, and try to find it later. Right now, I need to make sure I'm safe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over and gave Nikki a hug as well, and then stated he was going to go to the woods to look for more food and wood for their non-existent fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get us another chicken Colonel!\" Dan shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brandon thought he was far enough away, he decided to read some of his tribemates' minds, and who there vote was for. After a bit, Brandon got that Bev, Danny, and Bobby were voting for Nikki, as she had cost them in the challenge. Jo and Nikki were voting for... him? They thought he was physically weaker than anyone, (which wasn't wrong), and that he didn't even participate in the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby was also leaning towards voting for Brandon, mainly for the physical reason. Steve hadn't given the vote any thought, but was awfully close with Toby. That left one person who might be the swing vote. Yvonne. If he had any hope for feeling safe tonight, he'd have to get Yvonne with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to help her throughout the day, getting wood for the fire with her, helping her and the guys refine the shelter, and trying to strike up conversations with her. It seemed to be going alright, but Yvonne didn't ever really talk back. Most of the time, she just worked without even acknowledging his presence. He tried reading her mind, but it was never on the vote, or anybody on her tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, however, get some new thoughts from Toby, who was giving a confessional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby: \"That Brandon guy. I think he knows he's in trouble. He knows he's getting at least four votes. Mine, Nikki, Jo, and Steve. I dunno if he knows yet that I can get Danny Boy and Bev to vote with me. After that, we'll be six strong and we can run this thing. He's busy wasting his time on Yvonne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon saw the sun beginning to set, and decided he had two choices left. He didn't have enough time to find the ring, so he could either talk to Yvonne about the vote, or get in better with Danny and Bev.</span></div></div>",

Then he remembered that other teammates were not allowed to steal things from other teammate's bags. He felt that Yvonne might listen more if three teammates approached her.  So he headed off to where Bev and Danny were talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he approached them, Brandon said ' Too bad I could not begin my part of the challenge. But does anyone feel like they are in trouble tonight?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBev replied coyly and flexed a small athletic bicep ' I feel rather safe but one never know what might happen during the TC.'<br>\r\nDanny laughed ' Want to join our side. Don't worry. You're cool.' Bev winked when Danny said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sensed that they were mostly honest but still a little skeptical of him.  Brandon said ' I am fairly open to anyone you suggest. Just give me a reason why. But first we need to draw in the shy Yvonne so we can be 4 members strong.  I fear that the other teammates are bonding together.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sensed that Bev and Danny were listening carefully. Bev said ' Well, Danny and I were thinking about maybe voting off either<b> Nikki or Jo</b>.'<br>\r\nBrandon said ' That sounds fair to me. I was thinking that you might say Toby since he is trying to run things there. But we might need him for challenges'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBev suddenly spoke up ' If we are going to talk to Yvonne, we better talk to her now.'  <br>\r\nThey all agreed and headed back toward camp. When they arrived, Yvonne was not in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon said 'Oh dear, maybe she is looking for food or firewood.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny laughed and said ' I got an idea, why don't we all get a piece of a rock and maybe we can get lucky and kill another chicken.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got a small rock near each of their bags. <br>\r\nWhen Danny grabbed a rock near him, he picked up his bag one more time. But he noticed something sticking in the ground where the bag was placed.  It was the ring. Then he noticed that his bag had a tear in it. The ring must have fallen out of it. Danny grabbed the ring and quietly said ' My bag is mended and Yvonne will listen to us seriously. We will form an alliance. And nobody will take this ring from my bag. He put it back in the bag.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shouted  'Hurry, Brandon, Bev found Yvonne crying near those mesquite trees.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny smiled and thought <i> Looks like luck is smiling on me/i}  He hurried to join Danny, Bev, and Yvonne to discuss whom they think is the best one to vote off the show.</i></span></div></div>",

Election Day was next November and she knew that the voters will demand some change--- FAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her desk was a small box from her  uncle who lives currently in  Ireland. It held that magical Ring of Truth.  Ariel opened the box that revealed the ring along with a note explaining its powers. She knew about her uncle. He was a honest man although a little eccentric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the ring on her finger, wondering what is the first thing to say, and it would actually happen. It had to be tangible at first, something that she can see. So she said ' I have a sack lunch of a ham and lettuce sandwich along with an orange, and a can of SlimFast.'  <br>\r\nSuddenly the items she announced did appear on her desk. Ariel smiled as she realized that the ring actually worked.  The next thing she said was this. <b> Everyone who works for me is honest, talented, and won't be influenced by the mob.</b> Ariel just had to be sure that her Sheriff Department would be clean and respectful. 67% of the force were male, the others were female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she walked out in the main area where there were people in the holding cell nearby. The men in the cell looked like linebackers for a pro team.  The 3 dispatchers were answering calls as needed. Ariel was going to change the town for the better but did <b>not</b> want to do it just by saying that no crime can't be committed here.  Ariel looked around and sighed</span></div></div>",

They wondered what was happening to them at first. But it felt good, really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Ariel then said ' Make them strong as the HULK. They can control and manage their strength easily. And they will not get angry easily ONLY with due cause. Just let their biceps grow 3 inches but Yes, they are as strong as the HULK.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the female deputies found themselves much stronger than the male deputies. Surprisingly the male deputies were not jealous at all. And the female were not conceited.They were all a TEAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple of other changes Ariel had to make but sending them on their patrol. First, the law was changed to make it much easier  to make arrests and to make it stick in court. And only the truly guilty one are arrested, not any innocent citizens. Secondly, anyone that is currently in jail that is TRULY innocent would be officially released  and restored to society with open welcoming arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ariel came out of her office after her speech to her ring, 15% of those in jail was released. They were all happy at their good news. They shook hands with the sheriff as they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel then decided on the roster daily duties, both in the office and those out on patrol. Then she decided to go on patrol too. Ariel assigned another deputy named Ed Duncan, a red-haired 6\" 25 year old man to go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd asked Ariel as she drove him to their first location.....

They applauded at what she did. Ariel simply smiled. She replied in a kind and friendly voice ' I use my skills to help people, not to be a bully. Remember everyone.

It was a gift from her estranged husband that hadn't even been bought, but found in the street somewhere. Thinking of it made Jane regret marrying so young. Howie was the only thing that made it worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the ring looked nice enough to fetch her a decent price.
