Kitty then diverted her attention to her chest as it is now a EE that practically shredded her entire shirt, and her bra barely remains intact. The only reason she hasn't lost her balance is because her breasts are resting on a chubby stomach, which is now about 1 inch over whatever's left of her pants, and has buried her formerly flat abs under 6 inches of soft and flabby flesh that is stacked in a few rolls. Finally, her face has also gone through some changes. Starting with her having the beginning of a double chin that slightly shakes when talking. Kitty's cheeks are now fleshier and softer, sticking out right about to where the ends of her mouth are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-... I.\" Kitty stammers, in a panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we can find a way to Fi-Fi-Fi-Fix you.\" Keswick says supportively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" The chief chimes in \"if Keswick can make defective bombs than surely he can invent a barely functioning weight ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we also need to attempt a daring rescue mission... So, no offense but. Maybe you should stay here\" Dudley says looking down at his feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Kitty says sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent puppy's right, this'll be too dangerous for you to go on\" the chief explains \"Sorry agent Katswell, but you can't leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Kitty says, upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to look through the clothing bin in the corner, your clothes are trashed\" Dudley yells as they all leave</span></div></div>",

She noticed that her tail felt tingly and when she turned and looked at it, it had turned into a mouse's tail. Kitty then felt her ears change into mouse ears and she started to get smaller.

My Lair! My beautiful lair!\" Snaptrap cries as he watches the destruction, \"This was your plan! Don't you have some idea how to stop this!?\" Dudley says, panicking as he grabs Snaptrap, \"Well I figured there was a possibility my henchmen would lose control like this so I created a prototype control collar, Follow me!\" Snaptrap leads Dudley to the upper floors of the lair as Kitty continues to ravage the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening a small safe Snaptrap reveals a circular collar with small electrodes sticking out of it, \"It's a prototype but it should diminish any aggressive behaviour, All we have to do is get it on her neck.\" Dudley grabs the collar \"Shouldn't be too hard\" He and Snaptrap look back to the ground floor as Kitty is now slamming the metal table she was locked onto into the ground breaking it apart all the while she continues to roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes nothing!\" Dudley leaps off the railing towards Kitty, He lands directly on her back with his arms around her neck \"Dog.. get off Katswell!\" She yells as he tries to shake Dudley off \"No can do Kitty, This is for your own good!\" Dudley clamps the collar around Kitty's neck and leaps off as it begins to electrocute her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty roars in pain as powerful volts course through her body, Seeing his friend like this saddened Dudley but he knew it was necessary given the circumstances, However something shocking developed as Kitty began to power through the pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting furiously Kitty managed to grab the collar around her neck and with her tremendous strength she snapped it to pieces!  \"Uh Snaptrap, Any other ideas!?\" \"I've got nothing Agent Puppy! But we have to go, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yelling immediately attracted Kitty's attention \"Dog and Rat hurt Katswell...\" She said stomping towards the two \"Make Katswell MAD!\" she roared as she suddenly begins grunting in pain, Coming down to her knees once again Kitty slams her hands to the ground as she begins to transform even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingernails start to sharpen and grow into claws! Her hair grows even longer, Her body tears through what remains of her clothes as her muscles expand even further! As her fur grows shaggier and the growth continues the roars and grunts are slowly replaced with sinister chuckles and laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty slams her growing fist into the ground, Cracking it as she stands up, her shadow growing over Dudley and Snaptrap as she grows to 15ft tall and her muscles swell even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty continues to laugh as her teeth sharpen into fangs and her growth finally ceases, She looks downward at Dudley and Snaptrap with a sinister smile as she observes her newly transformed body \"Hehehe Katswell bigger\" Clenching her enlarged fist she punches the wall of the lair shaking everything, She flexes her right arm and admires her bicep \"Katswell stronger!\" She then leans down so her minuscule company is fully within eye sight \"and Katswell smarter, Dudley and Snaptrap\" Kitty then lifts her gargantuan foot and stomps the ground a few feet away from the two as she roars to the sky, \"Katswell going to enjoy this!\" she proclaims as she flexes every inch of her gigantic powerful body.</span></div></div>",
