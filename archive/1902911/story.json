George Hood was different- he wanted to be a cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most people, hearing their son wants to be a cop would make them happy. For the Hoods though, this was a bit of a concern, for the Hoods were a family of thieves. It was nothing too serious like stealing welfare checks from the needy, or goods from the store. No, they stole from other thieves- corrupt politicians, businessmen, and others like them. Afterwards though, they\u2019d distribute the money through various charities to help out the needy. Then again, they were descended of the legendary Robin Hood. Unlike their ancestor though, they used modern technology, with the current generation of thieves using the computer to hack into bank accounts- and using false Computer Identification Pin Numbers to make trackers think that the thieves were operating in other countries, and framing other groups in the process. Of course, they also engaged in other forms of theft- cars, jewels, cash, even the occasional kidnapping. To be in the Hood gang, one had to be in the family- by blood, by marriage, or by adoption- though special associates would be used on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge though had no desire to be a thief- in any shape or form. From the moment he could watch TV or read, he was fascinated by cop stories- they were almost always heroes fighting against evil villains. He wanted to be just like them- helping people out, and putting criminals behind bars. At first, the Hoods thought that this was just a passing fancy- that George would grow out of it, and join the rest of the family as a thief. However, he never grew out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to change his dream, the family did the next best thing- they trained him to be able to catch thieves. If they couldn\u2019t get him to become a thief, they could use him to deal with the competition. They taught him every trick in the book, and more than a few that weren\u2019t in the book. They also taught him how to fight, and use firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was old enough to go to the Academy, a hacker in the family had created a false past for George: father was a soldier, mother a secretary, and that he had a juvie record for boosting cars, and stealing a few things before he was 18. This was to explain his skills, as it would have seemed highly suspicious if he could just hotwire a car without any prior knowledge of it on his records, along with other things. However, he was made to promise two things- that he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone the true truth about his family, or intentionally go after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince graduation from the academy, George has been a patrolman, and has performed well under pressure. His wits have resulted in the capture, and conviction of several highly dangerous criminals. Currently, he is up for a promotion, but the captain is trying to figure out where to place him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain decides on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided to put him as a detective in training with Homicide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey George,\" his new partner greeted him. \"We just got a call. Grab your gear and let's head to the river. There's been a murder at the docks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge nodded and followed him out to the car. His partner, Jones, chatted him up all the way to the docks, but he couldn't concentrate. He was excited and apprehensive to work on his first murder. Of course he had training in this area, but what would it be like to find a killer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived to find the Crime Scene crew doing their job. They went over to look at the body that was swollen and decomposed. George felt a hard heave and tried to hold back the waves of nausea. He tried looking away from the body, but Jones was pointing something out to him. What was it? He couldn't see clearly. This time he couldn't hold back, and he tossed his breakfast. Recovering from the embarrassing event, he heard the snickers and guffaws behind him. His partner tried to act sympathetic, but there was a twinkle in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happens to all of us the first time,\" he let out a chuckle. \"You'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope not,\" George replied. He hoped he would never throw up again, but he never wanted to get used to see dead bodies. \"Now what were you telling me before I lost control of myself? I thought I heard something about 'Hood'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jones tell hi partner?</span></div></div>",

Indeed, he recognized the face of the decomposing corpse- Edward Hood was his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George? George, wake up, man!\" George opened his eyes to find himself lying on the ground, little pebbles digging into his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" George clumsily got to his feet, wobbling a bit. Immediately, he heard the murmurs of the officers around him, and everything came rushing back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me.\" Jones replied, concerned. \"You fainted. Why?

For the time being, anyway, being a part of any other unit in the Police Department would not put him directly in conflict with his family.  The patrol team he was leaving did not hold back in their congratulations and good wishes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch your back, Georg'e\" was the ominous warning from more than one of his colleagues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be just fine, I can take care of myself\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Hoods, the atmosphere was more somber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so George has done well enough to be promoted to Narcotics.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember your promises to the family. Do not betray us.\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge laughed,  \"You really don't need to worry about any betrayal from me.  I know only too well how that will hurt your reputations, not to mention mine.\"   George however could not help feeling a sense of foreboding, as though sooner rather than later, both his worlds will collide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's first day as part of the Narcotics Squad did not go without incident. The raid of the meat packing warehouse in the industrial district twenty blocks from the Precinct was George's first taste of what it meant to be in the Narcotics Squad. The heavily armed thugs did not hesitate to greet the oncoming police unit with a barrage of gunfire.  That no officer was injured during the exchange was no small miracle. Ten arrests, fifty kilos of pure cocaine seized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in a day's work\", Hank Brodin, the Captain of the Narcotics Team, a twenty-five year veteran, commented. \"George, I see you have the knack for this. Keep it up.\" George smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following days were all activity for George and his Narcotics Teammates.  Raids, Stakeouts, Covert Surveillance, Arrests, Seizures, Marijuana, Cocaine, Hashish, Heroin.  George soon became the rising star of the Narcotics team, much to the admiration of his superiors and envy of his peers. \"How do you do it?\", \" How did you know what to do?\" \"It's as if you have a criminal mind yourself, George.\" With each success came new and more dangerous assignments. It is as though George was being put through one test after another to prove his mettle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK George\", Hank growled, \"take a look at this case we are trying to crack for the longest while. For all our surveillance, we just cannot catch the bastards. The DA is going ballistic and we are at our wits end.\" George took the files and began to read. He was however not prepared for what he saw next... </span></div></div>",

George's hands shook as he held the picture and read the information on file.  He was tempted to slip the fuzzy photo into his pocket and return the file with an excuse, but George continued reading.  Frank was a prime suspect in this unsolved case but as far as the police knew, everything about him was a mystery.  First off, the name ascribed to the photo was not \"Frank Hood\", but one of the many aliases that Frank uses when he engages in criminal activities.  Little else was written on file about him and George was relieved that the file offered nothing to link this case to the Hood family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe file refers to one of the biggest narcotics heist in the history of the Precinct.  The problem was that the case had gone cold as many of the principal players in this heist were either dead, or have gone deep underground.  George himself had not seen nor heard from his uncle in over three years and whenever the subject came up in family conversation, it was quickly dropped and the subject changed to other matters.  No one talked about Frank, although family legend had it that he was the most skillful and daring thief in the family.  Uncle Frank was also ruthless.  Frank Hood was credited for some of the most daring yet mystifying robberies, many of which remained unsolved by the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat makes this case more baffling was that the heist involved the removal of two shipping containers of high grade Colombian cocaine from under the very noses of police surveillance. The shipment was destined for the distribution network of the notorious Throat Cutters Cartel and since the heist, bodies with their throats cut had surfaced.  The police believe that these killings may have been in retaliation for the brazen robbery from this criminal underworld.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked around to see if anyone was watching him before slipping the photo of his uncle in his pocket.   </span></div></div>",

With that, he handed the file to Hank.  \"What do you mean by that George?\", asked Hank, growling in annoyance.  \"You are the best man I have, can't trust anyone else with this case so don't let me down.\"  Hank handed the file back to George who took it without saying a word.  \"You have forty eight hours to come up with leads we can follow.\", said Hank as he turned his attention to his computer, dismissing George.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home took longer than usual as George pondered how he was going to conduct the investigations without getting on the wrong side of his family.  \"Damn it!\", George fumed, \"this is tougher than I thought. Why is Uncle Frank involved in this? Who else from this family is involved?\"  The traffic light turned red and George had to brake hard to avoid running it. The screech of tires followed by the blare of horns showed the anger of the motorists behind him.  George mumbled \"sorry\" to no one in particular and as the lights turned green again, he drove slowly forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree blocks later, George spotted the dark blue sedan two cars behind him.  \"Isn't that the same car I saw a while back?\", he thought as he  picked up speed. The sedan behind him picked up speed.  George took a sharp right turn.  So did the car.  The thought that this might be hit men from the Throat Cutters Cartel crossed his mind but George dismissed it as irrational since no one knows yet that he has been asked to investigate an unsolved crime.  Before George could think of anything else, the sedan suddenly swerved from behind the red Nissan and sped toward him.  George pressed the gas and his engine roared in response.  The chase was on.   </span></div></div>",

The cop was convinced that if he did not elude this car he would run out of options and the end might not be pleasant for him.  George pressed the accelerator pedal, willing his car to move faster.  Swerving to avoid crashing into slower moving vehicles, George drove hard, the sedan not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his police radio and spoke frantically into it, \"Officer needs back up!  Officer needs back up!\", he said, checking to see where he was and how far behind the pursuing car was.  The sedan was dangerously close.  George tried to drive harder, but in that instant his car jerked forward as he was bumped in the back by the sedan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\", he swore, swerving to avoid colliding with another car in front of him.  The sedan bumped him again and George almost lost control of his car. He glanced again at his rear view mirror and could see the two figures in the car behind him.  George tried to discern their features to see whether he recognized any of the occupants, but could not. They were strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop suddenly swerved into a side street and shot his car forward.  The sedan shot passed the turn, before spinning around in the middle of the road a few meters ahead.  Tires screeched and horns blared as drivers tried desperately to avoid colliding into this sedan which was now pointing in the opposite direction toward the side street George had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge drove harder and was putting distance between himself and the pursuing sedan.  He clutched the police radio again, \"Officer needs back up!\".  The radio crackled with a voice on the other end, \"Car eight responding.  ETA five minutes...\".  George was relieved but he continued to press harder as he approached the end of the street where there were two turns, a left and a right.  The sedan was again gaining on George and he glanced in his rear view just in time to see one of the occupants pull a gun and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge instinctively ducked but luckily there was no impact from the bullet, it had missed his car. <i>The second shot might not be so lucky,</i> he thought, as he heard sirens in the distance.  By the sound of it, car eight was in pursuit and it would be only a matter of moments before George would have back up.  The cop reached into the console beside him and gripped his gun.  <i>Time now to show those bastards what it means to mess with George Hood</i>.</span></div></div>",

Another shot rang out but it did not connect with his car.  \"I must keep ahead of these guys\", George thought.  He was now able to see the approaching vehicle with siren blaring.  To his dismay, the approaching car was not a squad car, but an ambulance.  \"Damn! Where is car eight?!\", George growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned sharply to the right and the tires immediately protested, screeching and smoking.  George accelerated and glancing thought his rear view, saw that the sedan also turned and was closing in on him.  George decided to take the offensive. After all running like this is not helping and he was getting impatient with the slow arrival of back up.  \"Screw this shit!\", George growled.  He put his hand through the window and squeezed off a shot.  It hit the front grille of the approaching sedan, and George smiled as he saw the sedan momentarily lose control and swerved erratically to the other side of the street.  It was a good thing that there were no oncoming traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few seconds during which the occupants of the pursuing car were trying to regain control were enough for George to gain some distance, although small, and at the same time squeezing off a second shot.  This time, he was able to hit the windscreen, shattering it.  He saw the occupant in the passenger side rock back before slumping forward.  \"I must have hit him\", George thought with some satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard another siren approaching at the same time as his police radio squawked to life, \"This is car eight coming to back up, we have visual...\"  George picked up the radio and barked, \"It's about time!  These guys are about to have me for lunch! Get here now!\".  George glanced at his rear view in time to see the driver pointing his gun to shoot.  The cop swerved evasively just as the shot was fired.  He quickly maneuvered his car into a 180 degree turn to now face the oncoming sedan.  Before the other driver could react, George fired two shots directly at the driver's side even as the sedan was speeding toward him.  The figure behind the steering rocked violently back, blood spewing from his throat.  The sedan swerved away from George's car and crashed into one of the trees lining the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, car eight screeched to an abrupt stop and two uniformed cops jumped out, weapons drawn.  \"What the hell?\", the first cop exclaimed, \"What happened here?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late!\", George growled as he stepped from his car and walked over to the car with the two dead men aboard.  \"I wonder who these guys are?\", he muttered.  \"Huh?\", the other cop asked, still taking in the scene before him.   </span></div></div>",

Thanks anyway.\"   As the cop from Car Eight nodded agreement, a cop from the Forensic Team came over to where the two cops were and asked, \"Can any of you tell me how this happened?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge relayed what had happened but also said that he did not know who these hoods were.  \"Perhaps this might help you\", the other man said handing George a piece of paper, \"we found it tucked under the driver's seat, it was so well hidden, you could not have seen it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge took it and immediately recognized it.  \"What the hell?...\", he gasped, much to the surprise of the other cops.</span></div></div>",

Tell me who you are and why I should trust you!\" he demanded. The Microwave gave a beep, but George ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did two men try to off you earlier?\" the voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge thought for a moment. The news of what had happened had not yet hit the airwaves, so this could only be one of two possibilities, either this person was a cop, or he was someone with close connections with the hoods who tried to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that to you?\" George rasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that I know who is after you and why....\" the voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? How will I know you are on the level?\" George asked, his interest piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are investigating a new case. Lots of heavy hitters involved. You are in their cross hairs right now...\" the other man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was stunned. As far as he knew, the only other person who would have known about the case he was investigating was the Captain who gave him the assignment. Could the Captain had said anything to someone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Where can we meet?\" George asked.</span></div></div>",

He was intrigued that the Vice Cop would take the time to meet him and risk blowing his cover and he was curious about what he had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening\", George said as he took a sip of his own coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to be seen in public with cops, that's why I insisted that you did not wear uniform\", the man continued. George nodded and took another sip.  As he did so, he took a quick glance around the room but did not see anything suspicious. For all appearances, George and this stranger were just two customers enjoying a friendly cup of coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say anything about what I'm working on, but someone within your Precinct is dirty, but so far, we have not flushed him out...\", the Vice Cop said.  George regarded the man closely, \"What has that go to do with me?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in danger, my friend...\", the man said in so low a tone that George had to incline his head to hear him.  \"Word on the street is that somehow, the Throat Cutters know you are working on that old heist case, and they had put out a hit on you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was stunned, \"How did those hoods learn about this so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that you have enemies within your own ranks, so you better keep things close to your chest for now...\", the Vice replied.  He looked at his watch and quickly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to go.....  Remember, keep your eyes open and watch your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Vice Cop casually walked out of the Coffee House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge did not immediately get up, as his mind was in turmoil.  <i>Who could have betrayed his case like this, and why? </i>  A thought occurred to him that sent shivers, <i>What if the Mole actually found out he was a part of a criminal family and has sold him out to the Throat Cutters? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\", George muttered as he got up from his seat.  He knew that the dangerous Throat Cutters Cartel hated the Hoods, ever since that heist. They might send out other hit men to finish him off.  One thought puzzled George, <i>Why was the hit instruction written on police stationery?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs George drove away from the Starbucks parking lot, he wore a grim expression his mind resolved on his next step...<i>whoever this Mole is, and whomever he or she is working for, they better watch THEIR backs! ...Time now for some answers!</i> <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The episode at Starbucks was still fresh on George's mind the next day when he reported to the Precinct.  He had not said anything to anyone yet and he was still running the last few hours through his mind.  The one question that bugged him was, \"who was the mole?\".  He could not believe that anyone in his own Precinct would have sold him out to the hoodlums as he had no reason to believe that anyone there would want him dead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as George knew, the Captain was the only on who would have known that he was working the old Heist case and no one else should have known about it.  Yet the word was already on the street and an attempt was already made on his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge dropped his bag on the desk at his cubicle and turned on his computer.  Nothing out of the ordinary yet.  He was a little early so not many officers were in the Precinct yet.  George checked his emails and voice messages.  Nothing in the messages struck George as unusual.  He was about to close his mailbox when George saw a message that sent chills down his spine.  It had no subject line and the message itself had no email address in the \"from\" field.  It was cleverly hidden.  The message itself was anything but ordinary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge swore under his breath as he read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"We know you are working the Heist case.  If you want to stay alive, keep your bloody nose out of this case!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge read the message again and was so engrossed he did not hear his Captain enter.  When the Captain cleared his throat, George spun around, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Captain, you almost scared the shit out of me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Hank Brodin laughed and thumped George on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it takes this much to scare you shit less, then things are really heating up for you George!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again Captain.  Did you.....Did you tell anyone else about my being on the heist case Captain?\", George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I didn't.  Whats this about George?\" the Captain asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.  Just that somehow somebody else knows I'm on the case.\", George replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzatso?  How did anyone else know as I for one did not tell a soul about this case.\", the Captain replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see for yourself Capt'n\", George said as he showed him the message on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain looked at the screen for a long moment before he finally asked,  \"Who else could have figured this out?  Did you say anything and forgot that you did George?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know captain,  I almost got my ass killed day before yesterday in what looks to me like an attempted hit, and later someone from Vice called me up with a tip.  Yesterday morning I met the guy who told me to keep my eyes peeled\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  So who do you think has anything to do with this tip you got?\", the Captain asked.</span></div></div>",

That's why I'm assigning you to the Theft and Robbery Division, specifically, Sargent Jason's squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, talent like yours shouldn't be wasted giving out tickets.\" The captain offered his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sir,\" George said, as he stood up, and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Oh, and when you get back to your desk, tell Lucas I'd like to see him; one of our Parking ticket ladies is out on Maternity Leave- he can take over for her until she's ready to come back. That should chastise him sufficiently for that stunt he pulled at the party. Just glad no one outside the force found out about the true reason why half the force was sick with the flu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen George gets to his new squad, he finds out that his assignment is to....</span></div></div>",

He specialized in dealing with thieves- for some reason, he could determine how the person broke into a place, and acquired the object that was stolen. Reason is, he comes from a family of thieves. They had taught him everything about stealing, and then some. Now he uses his family\u2019s teachings to capture criminals. However, he struggles everyday- caught between duty to his family, many of them active criminals- a few of them being highly wanted, and the oath he swore to uphold the law at all costs. He also struggles to keep their identities secret- no one would trust him if they discovered that he comes from a long line of criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something happens, and now he is forced to use both his thief training, and officer training, in order to capture a highly dangerous criminal. At stake is the reputation of the Police Department, and the Hood family, for this foe is no ordinary thief. Apprehension of this person would make pick-pocketing an expert pickpocket, and giving the item to the original owner, without either of them noticing anything different, child\u2019s play by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tSpelling and Grammar are a Must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tStory is to be in 3rd person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tStory is to be Realistic Fiction.<br>\r\n</td>",
