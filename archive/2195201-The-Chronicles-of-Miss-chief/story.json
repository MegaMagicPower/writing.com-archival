See, he had been applying for jobs at several local places, in order to contribute to his upcoming college tuition in the fall, and in the high volume, he sent a few out to places he barely glanced it, just to put feelers out. He had assumed that <i>Chez Aphrodite</i> was a hipster bar or coffee shop. On the same token, the owner of the salon misread his resume, and based on his name, thought he was a young woman. Color them both surprised when the clearly male Alex showed up for the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the initial confusion, the owner, Emilia, was impressed with Alex's resume and offered him a job sweeping up hair as a start, perhaps moving him to taking payment once he was familiar with the place. As one of the only actual interviews that Alex got, he quickly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few weeks, everything was going well, Alex was sweeping, the other employees, like the hair stylist, Camille, and the manicurist, Rosie, were friendly to him, getting on well. But there were a few stray comments about the \"young man\" and how some of the clients (mostly women) were uncomfortable with him being there. Now, because the employees liked him and didn't want to have to let him go, they started thinking of how they could make the clients more comfortable, and restore the formerly feminine atmosphere to the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, shortly after Alex arrived, and an hour before the salon was due to open, the three women got together to decide what their first step would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where do they start with Alex?</i></span></div></div>",

But...\" Rosie grabbed Alex's hand and examined his nails. \"Our clients won't be inclined to let you do their's if yours are all ragged and dirty like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I guess.\" Alex placed his hands onto the table, watching Rosie as she got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first,\" Rosie lifted Alex's hands and placed them into a basin, fingers first. \"This is to soften the cuticles. Though if this was a client, you'd be removing their old polish first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex watched on in curiosity as Rosie showed him the ins and outs of a manicure, not something Alex ever thought he'd be interested in, but there's a lot of technique involved. It of course helped that Rosie was only a few years older than Alex and was very pretty. Rosie pulled his hands out of the basin and placed them onto the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to push your cuticles back.\" Rosie said as she broke out a small tool and started using it on each of Alex's fingernails to push the cuticles back. \"And now, it's time for the file and buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie then took a file to the nails and began shaping them. Alex's nails weren't very long, so there wasn't much shaping apart from rounding them off at the fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally...\" Rosie picked up a bottle of polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure about that.\" Alex started to pull his hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, it's clear, and it's for protection. Otherwise I have to do this every day. Plus, how else will you learn? Come on.\" Rosie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex placed his hands back onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Rosie uncapped the bottle and started polishing each nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finished, she put Alex's hands under the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can handle that?\" Rosie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, doesn't seem all that hard.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Rosie exclaimed as she turned off the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex pulled his hands out and examined them. A little cleaner, but not obviously manicured in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun time's over, you two,\" Emilia joked as she walked up to the nail station. \"We're about ready to open. Oh, and Alex, you nails look lovely. Rosie, another great job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you pay me for!\" Rosie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex got up from the chair and returned to his broom.

Instead of classes, he was taking a series of odd jobs, his current one being house-sitting for his great aunt Agnes, who was on a world cruise tour for summer. Kyle was Eric's best friend, and the two, not being particularly lucky in the dating department were mostly sitting around the house bored out of their skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast week, they had been snooping around in the attic (despite explicit instruction to not go into the attic) and had uncovered a trunk of books. One of the books claimed to be a spell book. Neither of the two young men were superstitious, but Eric had remarked that Great Aunt Agnes seemingly lived an idyllic life, and with magic, that would be easy to achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the two were bored again, and decided to light up a joint to pass the time. In their marijuana-induced stupor, their conversation had been derailed to talking about their lack of relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you know why we don't have girlfriends? Cause no girls get us, you know?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, dude.\" Eric agreed. \"If only we could like, find a girl that gets us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\" Kyle sat forward. \"What if we made one? I saw in that spell book yesterday that there was a... what was it, transfiguration spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It like, means to create something. And if we use it, we can create a woman, just by thinking about one.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for, let's do it!\" Eric got up and started to rush to the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that they were sitting around and reading the book, Eric had sobered up somewhat, and was having second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we're gonna get in so much trouble!\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, no one will ever know we stole your great aunt's spell book. We use it, create our woman, and put it back.\" Kyle said as he laid an old book onto the couch. \"Okay, let's see what we've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened the book and flipped through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... create fire, create water, gain riches, see the future... aha!\" Kyle exclaimed. \"Transfiguration Feminam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Female transfiguration. You're sure that means create? Cause it looks like transform.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it means create, if it meant transform, it'd say transform, right?\" Kyle insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's place our hands on the book and read out these words while imagining out perfect women.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Kyle placed their hands onto the pages as they read the words aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spiritibus, transfiguret in me hanc femina imaginem!\" the two said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, there was a flash of light and both of them were thrown back onto the ground. They stood up and tried to steady themselves as they looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Kyle replied. \"They should be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it was a bust.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so...\" Kyle sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" one of them exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened?</i></span></div></div>",

He used his hand to wipe his face, before noticing that it seemed... smaller than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle? What exactly is your <i>perfect</i> woman?\" Eric nervously asked as he observed his fingernails growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas and stealing this when we get the spell working.\" Kyle didn't look up from the book. \"She's gotta be shorter than me, even in heels, I wouldn't want her to tower over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed the room starting to grow around him.... no, he was shrinking from his typical 5' 9\" to a much more compact 4'11\". Eric immediately stood up and rushed over to a mirror hanging on the opposite wall. Kyle scarcely noticed and continued his summary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she's gotta have nice tits, obviously. But really, I'm more of an ass man, so that has to be tight.\" Kyle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's chest began to bubble as two breasts slowly inflated around his nipples, stopping at the higher end of the B-Cup spectrum. Nearly C, but not quite. His ass also started to expand until it was straining against his, until very recently, comfortable pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, stop looking at the book and look at me!\" Eric demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle waved him off, too lost in his own world to realize the true magic that was going on in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long hair. Redhead. But not an unnatural shade, auburn, you know, like a reddish, brownish.\" Kyle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's hair started to grow rapidly as it expanded outward before settling onto his shoulders, with the coloring emerging from the roots and changing his formerly blonde hair into an auburn shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light voice, and she's gotta be into gaming and stuff, a nerd-girl.\" Kyle continued. \"And her face would be pretty, cute nose, but that plain sort of pretty, the type of girl who doesn't need makeup, but probably wears it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his face shifting, with his facial bones cracking as they restructured. As all that went on, his body slowly started to transform to match the specifics of Kyle's explanation. His body hair retracted into his body, and his male anatomy had been abruptly replaced with its female counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more energy left to stand, Eric collapsed to the floor, finally breaking Kyle out of his reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric? Dude holy shit!\" Kyle leaped up and rushed over to his fallen friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle lifted Eric up to find a pretty girl staring back at him, wrapped in clothes that were far too large for her. Like she was wearing her boyfriend's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, moron?\" Eric replied, before holding a dainty hand to his mouth. \"Is that... oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Kyle exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it didn't! It was supposed to create a woman, you said!\" Eric stood up and waved his arms around, causing the sleeves of his hoodie to go flying every which way as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I got the translation wrong, but it did work!\" Kyle insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't it working, and how come it didn't work on you? Why aren't you my dream girl?\" Eric demanded, hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but you gotta find some new clothes. You look ridiculous.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need new clothes, I need you to find the reversal spell!\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... It might take a while. Better to be comfortable, right?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that, you just want to see me in something that'll flatter this figure, right?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't blame a guy for trying.\" Kyle shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor hours, they pored over the book, unable to find anything about a reversal spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is hopeless!\" Eric whined, moving a strand of hair out of his face repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... Nothing about reversal.\" Kyle said. \"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe what?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's that store at the mall. The weird curio store, I remember hearing back in high school that people thought the owner was a witch or something.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm not leaving the house like this!\" Eric insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about calling your great aunt?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work either. She doesn't do technology, no phone and it's not like I can just call her cruise.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that settles it. We're going to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they can reverse it, it'll go faster with you there. Now, do you want to change, or do you want to just head out now?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pondered for a moment before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eric wouldn't say that Aunt Agnes was overweight, but she certainly wasn't the size of an eighteen year old girl. And she was one of his Great Aunts who was a lifelong spinster, so she never had any kids to have kept clothing from either. After failing to find anything, he sighed and laid back onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kyle ran in and tossed a bundle of clothing at Eric, who started looking at the clothes now strewn about the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Eric said, holding up a bra by its strap. \"What's all this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Went back up to the attic. I think this is from when your aunt was our age.\" Kyle remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric checked over everything, a pair of light blue panties and a matching bra, a pair of bell-bottom jeans and a 70's style white blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I can't wear this!\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, this was as masculine as it got in there.

The fact that it was the literal wet dream of his best friend however, did a lot to prevent him from trying anything too experimental for the time being, worried about Kyle walking in. He hoped that Kyle wouldn't take advantage of the situation but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished dressing, finding the clothes to fit rather well. Eric frowned in the mirror as he played with his hair a bit, wishing it wasn't as long as it was. He exited the bedroom, seeing Kyle waiting in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. A little retro, but I admit, I like the style.\" Kyle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it,\" Eric retorted. \"Did you find me a pair of shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try these on for size.\" Kyle tossed a pair of platform shoes into Eric's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not wearing heels.\" Eric refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all that was in the chest, just put them on!\" Kyle shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay. If that's all there is...\" Eric meekly said as he put the shoes onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few experimental steps before a fog cleared from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that? Why did I agree to that?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... might be me again. Part of my dream woman is a submissive personality. One who'll defer to me.\" Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerk!\" Eric shouted, pounding weakly on Kyle's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we're gonna fix this.

Make it to the witch store \u2014 where is located god-knows-where \u2014 ask the witch for help \u2014 who may or may not be a phony \u2014 and hope that she doesn\u2019t ask for their souls in tribute. It wasn\u2019t the best plan, but it was a plan. Kinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Kyle\u2019s footsteps reached his ears, lighting a nervous fire in Eric. Maybe proximity was the x-factor in all the pink, bubbly thoughts in his head. He yanked the door to make his escape inside, away from the cloying musk of his friend\u2026 but the door didn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave it a second tug, trying to brace his left foot against the other door for leverage, but he was not nearly as competent in heels as he\u2019d like to think sending him toppling backwards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight into Kyle\u2019s (<i><span class=\"chotpink\">warm, well muscled</span></i>) arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked. \u201cWhoa man, you gotta be careful. Also, it\u2019s a push door.\u201d He gave the door a demonstrative shove, sending it open easily. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eric couldn\u2019t hear anything, between the thumping of his heart and the heated argument in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay \u2018Thanks, dude!\u201d said the incumbent Eric-brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"chotpink\">Say \u2018<i><b>I love you!</b></i></span>\u2019\u201d squealed the lovelorn Erica-psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric choked out an \u201cI L\u2014 thank you, dude.\u201d after a few <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><span class=\"chotpink\">amazi</span></span> uncomfortable seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rubbed the back of his head, oblivious to the near-confession. \u201cHey, it\u2019s no problem. And you\u2019re super light now, so it was eas\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eric had already turned and started tic-tak-ing his way inside the mall, trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to suppress the wide grin across his cherry-red face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost instantly, an older woman, maybe in her thirties, walked out from behind a beaded curtain leading into a back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the owner?\" Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was last time I checked.\" she chuckled. \"Before you ask, we don't do returns.

Is it true?\" Kyle bluntly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends.\" she replied. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Kyle immediately explained their situation, as the owner listened intently, remaining silent until they finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very irresponsible, playing with magic that you don't understand. Do you have the book with you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I took pictures of the spell on my phone. We couldn't find any reversal spell.\" Kyle said, handing his phone to the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Transfiguration Feminam. Not particularly common, but one I've seen before. I assume he said it, and you happened to be in the room?\" the owner asked, first pointing at Kyle, and then Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both said it!\" Eric exclaimed. \"At the same time. But only I was transformed... for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic relies on belief and desire.

This wasn't like say, turning into a frog or something, which is just a simple reversal. This requires an inverse spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inverse spell, like a transfiguration for men?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Unfortunately, while I have seen it before, I'll need a few days to locate it.\" the owner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do for a few days? I can't walk around like this!\" Eric shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation, you make a very pretty girl.\" the owner said, before turning to Kyle. \"You have wonderful taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blushed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" Kyle said. \"We really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet, I haven't fixed your friend yet.\" the owner said. \"I'll call you when I find the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Eric muttered as he started to walk out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Kyle asked. \"If you're gonna be stuck like this for a few days, you're gonna need some clothes.

Suspecting it was the firework, or whatever trick he'd played to make the flash Eric stood back still suspicious of further trickery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in moments it was clear the flash, wasn't Kyle's doing... Or rather what followed was beyond him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't...\" Kyle's voice was cracking. High and piping the distress in his eyes, as he tried to rock himself upright, to try to return some sensation, some control to his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as hair cascaded freely from Kyle's scalp. His short hair soon spilling over his shoulders, and onto the bed. Clearly able to feel the flow of his hair, it's growth at the periphery of his vision was making his eyes dart from side to side, to catch the actual motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's real... The damned book's real!\" Eric stuttered in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only roll his eyes, and give the weakest attempt at a shrug, the obvious fact far, far clearer to Kyle than Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess, you know.\" he confessed, as he took in Kyle's transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aim of the spell seemed to hit them both at the same time. Their sense of humour now feeling like the deadliest of games. But, it was Kyle whose face was softening. Losing it's harsh male edges, and taking on an almost feline beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.... No...\" she mumbled, even now, her soft pleading tones sounded like a tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer features became perfect, Eric's dream woman. He felt himself stiffen at her sight, at her vulnerability, as those full lips darkened, and plumped too inviting to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to meet Kyle's eyes, his gaze drifted away. Not far, as the reason for Kyle's protests became clear. His nipples were spreading, becoming thicker, riper, fuller. Her eyes telling of a sensitivity and alertness that terrified him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, as Kyle's breathing shifted, his chest rose and fell. Rising higher each inhaled breath, and not sinking quite so far with every released gasp. Fingers twitching, as life and freedom was restored to them. Kyle's elbows flexed weakly, as they fought for movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocking of Kyle's head was feeble, but the denial was clear. A quick glance, just as quickly averted told that Kyle was now a woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips trembled, the change not needing to be mentioned. She was intimately aware of her new sex. Her breath coming in shallow gasps, as she battled the nervous flip-flopping of her stomach. An ache... A need... A hunger, she didn't understand, but knew too well was building within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free to, Kyle's hands belatedly came slapping into place covering her new bust. A proud, firm bust, such as only fantasy could want, or deliver. Kyle winced at the speed and pain of the impact. Those nips reminding her sharply they were new, tender and deserved care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/ce/9b/3ece9b3143ce797822088ce6cfad972b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/ce/9b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's tongue darted out, wetting those inviting lips.

Sure, there's the hit to your masculinity, but you were more worried about your lack of style or grace that might endanger the show.

You looked around, and the models were alternately averting their gaze, and sneaking peeks and giggles at your expense. You were a slight, lanky man, and so you could understand why Ellie would believe that you could pull off the dresses that Jessica designed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we have to get rid of all that hair.\" Ellie scrutinized you. \"Jess, help me with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie grabbed a jar of cream and started to rub it over your body, on your arms, legs, back, anywhere below the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I'd suggest shaving or waxing, but we've only got a few hours.\" Ellie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god for small mercies...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the cream started to tingle, and Ellie and Jessica wiped it off, along with your body hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go put on a robe and take a seat, we've got to start with your...\" Ellie started.</span></div></div>",

Once she seemed finished, you got to see your face, which was a far cry from what you'd  expected to see. You expected to see yourself, but what you saw was a completely different person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't <i>look</i> like she was wearing makeup, but you could feel it on your face. In fact, with the hair and nails, the only thing giving you away was your lack of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Ellie was about to rectify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I had this rushed over from my studio, sometimes I work with transgender clients, or the occasional drag queen, so I keep a few of these around.\" Ellie reached into a box and pulled out two breasts that you estimated were probably only a B or C cup, but seemed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are huge!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around for Jess, but she must have been out and about doing the final touches out on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think those are huge, I should introduce you to some of my clients.\" Ellie giggled. \"Now, the glue is gonna be cold, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glue?\" you cut Ellie off. \"That's a bit too permanent for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it can't be helped. Some of the dresses are strapless.\" Ellie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realized that, while you'd seen many of Jess' designs while she had perfected them... she didn't tell you exactly which ones you'd be modeling, you didn't really remember which ones might have fit you, since you'd never tried them on before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the robe and lay down.\" Ellie motioned as she lowered the chair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied and flinched as the cold glue touched your chest. After a few seconds of holding, the breasts were in place, and you were shocked as you looked down them, while Ellie touched up the makeup around them to ensure that they blended in perfectly with your skin. The seams were nonexistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie quickly pulled a 360 degree curtain around the chair as she opened another box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you asked. \"Isn't this it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. There's just one small problem left.\" Ellie said, pulling out something that you'd never seen before, but you could guess its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'd call it a small problem...\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this one doesn't need glue, I can strap you into this and hide it under the panties.\" Ellie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, she pulled the curtain away as you pulled up a pair of panties over your now hidden male bits, and a bra over the breast forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Felicia, the hard part is over.\" Ellie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want anyone overhearing us call you Felix, right?\" Ellie reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix! You look... amazing!\" Jessica exclaimed as she walked backstage. \"I almost didn't recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you blushed. \"Everything going okay out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... except now we need someone to do the AV equipment.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" you smacked your head with your palm. \"I forgot about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hard is it?\" Jessica asked. \"Could you teach me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you'd need to be at the computer, and you can't direct the show from out there...\" you pouted as you tried to figure a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute when you're thoughtful.\" Ellie remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ha!\" you shouted. \"I can program a remote to control everything. The remote's labeled fairly simply, so you could change the lights from a distance.

The place looked enough like a college,  vaguely castle-like, there was even ivy growing up the side of the building. Nothing to imply anything less than a reform school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the gates, the cuffs were released and the guards departed, getting back onto the train. But you and the rest of the group had already been turned over to the school's private security, who all wore little earsets like secret service agents. Before any time for pleasantries, they had you funneled into an auditorium where you were checked in by name and put into a seat, where a metallic collar was strapped around your neck. On the stage, an older woman, looking very much like a stereotypical headmistress, stepped up to the podium, and as she did, everyone's collar beeped and clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the locking mechanism. The collars are designed to ensure that you remain on the grounds. Any dissent or disruption will be met with a light shock, that slowly graduates to becoming more painful the more you disobey and any further disruption will lead to you being put into the... accelerated program.\" the woman stated, coldly. \"I am Madame Sybell, the headmistress. You now all answer to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't answer to anyone, bitch!\" someone shouted near the front of the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further shouting was quickly quelled as it was replaced by a yelp and the sound of someone falling to the ground. A few guards rushed over and dragged the offender out of the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other remarks?\" Madame Sybell asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You are here because you are among the worst offenders that society has to offer. And that's because of how you were raised. But you're still malleable and we intend to do what the school system should have done. Turn you into proper members of society.\" Madame Sybell stated. \"You will all be assigned a roommate, a student who has been here for nearly the amount of time that you will be, to guide you on your way. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one responded again, and Madame Sybell clapped her hands happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you will be escorted to your rooms, where your roommates await your arrival. Good luck.\" Madame Sybell stepped aside as the young men were all corralled together again in order to get to every room.</span></div></div>",

She was also wearing a tartan-style skirt, a pair of knee socks and a pair of black high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uniform featured the exact same blazer, blouse and tie, but featured charcoal shorts (which were a little short for your liking) and a pair of... black Mary-Jane flats?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f...\" you hesitated. \"Heck is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shock, so light profanity was okay. Good to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the school policy. All students wear identical uniforms, well, mostly. At least mostly at first.\" CeCe said. \"But just put it on, class starts soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what she meant, but you reasoned that if they were providing the entire uniform, they probably saved money by having everyone wear the same stuff. Plus she seemed really eager for you to change, so you pulled a hanger down. You looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there somewhere to change?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel embarrassed on my account.\" CeCe said. \"Nothing I haven't seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still prefer if you turned around.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" CeCe made a show of turning around and covering her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly stripped out of the prison jumpsuit you were in and changed into the provided uniform. The shorts were indeed shorter than you were used to, stopping at your mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these supposed to be this short?\" you asked as you slipped your feet into the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about.\" CeCe said. \"But before we go, there's something you need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeCe handed you a pink disposable razor. You looked at it in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get the handbook in class, but I want to save you the demerits. All students must be clean-shaven below the head on any visible extremities. So no facial hair, or leg hair.\" CeCe said as she opened a side-door into a small bathroom with a shower stall, toilet and sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" you entered the room and found a can of shaving cream in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, and caused a few nicks, but you managed to get it done. Returning to the main room, CeCe was standing near the door, bouncing on her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we have to go now!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need books or anything?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she grabbed your hand and dragged you out of the room and down the corridor, before quickly running into a classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was full, with the entire class seated, save for four open seats. There was a clear divide, with half the room being girls, and the other half, the boys you arrived with. Rather strange. CeCe motioned for you to sit in one of the seats. You followed her lead and sat at attention like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, a bell chimed and a teacher walked into the room. As she set her things down on her desk, another set of students rushed in, only to both collapse to the floor seconds later as their collars began shocking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to CeCe, who only glumly nodded. That's why she was so eager. What type of school was this place? As you wondered, the teacher began to speak:</span></div></div>",

After a while, the cash would roll in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trickster in you then presented an even better idea: why not disguise yourself as a FEMALE star. You\u2019d be sure to attract a sizeable male viewership with your girly physique despite being a man. All of them would be drooling after a pretty girl, with them none the wiser to your truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the plan was settled, you decided that the first step was to either set up the accounts or get all of the necessary \u201csupplies\u201d.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're merely a vessel for my princess to return, I owe you nothing. Be quiet or I will silence you myself!\" the courier ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly much more than a run of the mill courier. You wanted to continue, but your mouth was again taken over by the \"Princess\" whoever that was, and your speech was muffled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your highness. He was getting rather tiresome.\" the courier replied. \"Shall I administer now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, unwillingly, nodded and the courier plunged a needle into your neck, causing you to fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You suddenly awoke in a haze, still dressed as you were, but you were in some sort of castle. You weren't sure what it was until you heard a soothing voice speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all started centuries ago. Long before you were born, of course. There was a small kingdom ruled by a Queen, and the throne was passed down to the first daughter of the family. This continued for countless generations, and usually, there would be a daughter and then a son, so no worries about any attempts to seize the throne, the sons understood. They typically became trusted advisers and ran the kingdom alongside their sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unable to move as the room faded and was replaced with a castle courtyard, with a little girl running around with her father, and her pregnant mother sitting off to the side. This must be the \"Princess\" that the courier was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, one time, there was a second daughter instead, and she didn't like the idea of her sister holding all the power, refusing even an appointment as regent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene shifted to one of the pregnant mother, the Queen, sitting with her older daughter, now fully grown, and her younger daughter, a teenager, angrily throwing a desk to the side in fury. The scene then shifted to the Queen's deathbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When their mother passed, the younger sister orchestrated a poisoning that left the Princess dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene showed the older daughter, the Princess, dying, while her sister watched from the doorway with an evil grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had suspected her duplicitous sister had done it, so she made a deal with the court magician to pass her aura into another, a royal guard willing to lay her life down for her Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene became the sickly Princess lying next to another figure as the court magician read a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, the sister broke into her chambers mid-ritual, and all was thought lost. But it turned out that the ritual could be completed without the magician, guard or the Princess present, and several generations later, while looking over the spell book of the long forgotten kingdom, a local archaeologist, an unknowing descendant of the court magician, accidentally triggered the end of the ritual. But without her initially chosen receptacle around, her aura was forced to enter into the next available receptacle that it could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"That's me!\" you thought to yourself as you watched the scene unfold.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The courier was tasked with tracking the vessel down using photos enchanted from the spell book and giving the vessel items enchanted with the same spell book in order to unlock the Princess and allow her to return and finally take her place as ruler.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that explained all this, but as the scene ended, you awoke in a cold sweat...</span></div></div>",

It was hard to make out, since it wasn't in focus but it looked like... a sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sleeve to a suit jacket, most likely!\" you exclaimed. \"But that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought of being embraced by a man while dressed like that. You immediately threw the items back into the box and tossed it across the room. Sure, at this point that was futile and you knew it, but you didn't have to take this sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and started fighting with the clothes once again. If you tried hard enough and used enough willpower, you could get these accursed things off, you were sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to struggle until...</span></div></div>",

Local businesses loved having her beautiful and bright smile to promote themselves.

With everything going on it was getting harder and harder to keep the business going for Chris\u2019s aunt and uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a way of stepping up and trying to help Chris offered to take Sam\u2019s place for awhile.

Both just for family, but also because he couldn't stand idly by and let something that Sam loved get destroyed. There wasn't much talk apart from pleasantries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival at the house was the same level of awkwardness. Aunt Michelle and Uncle Bob lived above the restaurant in the middle of town, it always made the most sense to them, since they had loved their work so much, that they'd stay close. But being relatively small, there was limited available space. Which meant that there was only one room for Chris to stay in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry about this, but we don't have any guest rooms.\" Aunt Michelle said as she helped take Chris' bags into Sam's room. \"I know it might be hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay there, it should stay untouched. I'll just sleep on the couch.\" Chris insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" Uncle Bob said. \"Sam wouldn't have wanted us to keep a shrine. She'd want her room to go to good use. We didn't clear her things out, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem at all. Actually, it might be nice to be reminded of her and the good times we had.\" Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris moved his bags into the room and set them down, looking around the room. It was mostly similar to how it had been when they were kids, but with some mature flairs to it. Her computer was still there, too. Chris delicately placed it into a drawer as he started to unpack his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was likely going to be there for a while, since not only were his aunt and uncle losing their joy of running the business, but the people in town were equally disinterested in eating at the restaurant since Sam died, and Chris was determined to get them back into the booths and tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting set up at the house...</span></div></div>",

As Chris rushed around making sure that everything was running smoothly, Michelle called him over to a table she was waiting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Chris asked as he walked up to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was inhabited by two people, one around Aunt Michelle's age and one around Chris' age, or actually, exactly his age, because as he would soon find out, Morgan was Sam's best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, this is Stacy Jones and her daughter Morgan.\" Michelle said. \"This is my nephew Chris, I was telling you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Chris politely introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed nice, though Morgan was predictably sullen, it was hard for Chris to be here in general, but he didn't have a choice. To be eating where your best friend used to work... it had to be tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can definitely see the family resemblance.\" Stacy said. \"I bet you've heard that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that much actually, but then again, I don't think we've looked alike since we were kids.\" Chris remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you're relatively new in town, right?\" Stacy asked. \"Morgan, you should give him a tour, take him to all the local sights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not necessary. I spent a lot of time here as a kid,\" Chris started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! You can't spend all day in here and then go straight upstairs. You need a social life.\" Michelle remarked. \"We won't be busy once lunch is over, so you can take off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Morgan replied, clearly not enthused, but seemingly understanding why the two women were so insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your current experience with Morgan was anything to go off of, she definitely needed something to take her mind off of Sam, hell, everyone did, but at least Aunt Michelle and Uncle Bob had work to distract them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Chris?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pondered over his decision for a moment before...</span></div></div>",

Honestly, getting a better look at her, she was pretty cute, what with her good figure and brown hair. Still, that was hardly appropriate for the moment. This was meant to just be a fun outing, not a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....um, hi,\" he said, trying to muster a smile. Admittedly, talking with strangers had never been a really strong point. Sure, he was okay enough to handle the restaurant so far, but this situation was a bit different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Morgan replied simply. She didn't sound rude or angry or anything. If anything, it seemed like nerves much like his own. Clearly, she wasn't sure how to handle this little walk of theirs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....um.....\" Chris already felt like he was repeating himself with how he was talking. \"Sorry if...this is really awkward for you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no it's okay...\" Morgan trailed off a bit. \"I'm the one being a stick in the mud. I just....haven't figured how to handle this yet....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, neither have I...if that helps,\" Chris chuckled just a little, which actually got a little smile out of Morgan. Wow, a pretty cute smile at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, despite me appearing otherwise, thanks for agreeing to come along,\" she said. \"Things have just been a lot quieter of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Chris nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them didn't really set much of any real destination, just enjoying a little walk around town. Chris of course did know a lot of the stuff around, but not so much around some of the newer developments, to which Morgan was better off explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually have a pool in the area that used to be run-down. Pretty popular too. Sam and I always hung out there a lot during summer,\" Morgan explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun,\" Chris nodded. \"I admittedly haven't been to one of those in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's only going to get hotter so maybe we'll check it out,\" Morgan smiled a little. \"On that note....there actually is a spot Sam and I would often go to. Want to see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...that okay?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be better to,\" Morgan replied. \"Might actually help to put some things to rest rather than just trying to ignore my feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounded like reasonable logic to him. Putting all this out in the open might help them to move on. Besides, it was a prime chance to learn a little bit more about them.</span></div></div>",

Chris really was looking to go into a nature hike but Morgan assured him they weren\u2019t going far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan led Chris down a old hiking trail mostly forgotten by the looks of things. The trail finally led them to a small clearing in the woods. It was nice and secluded, a peaceful little hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was our spot. As kids Sam and I used to come up and break all sorts of rules.\u201d Morgan said with a slightly cheeky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was a bit surprised.

As kids we used to paint our nails or braid our nails here. As we got older we would sneak up here with drinks or bring boys.\u201d Morgan said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...perfect little Sammy used to drink underage and mess around with boys in the woods?\u201d Chris said a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh not just boys.\u201d Morgan said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...you two?\u201d Chris said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just a little bi-curious. We both had boyfriends at the time.\u201d Morgan said blushing a little amazed she admitted this to someone she just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey its all cool. I won\u2019t say anything. Those memories are precious I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil them.\u201d Chris said looking around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thanked Chris for his discretion as she led him back to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long to you plan to stay?\u201d Morgan asked him as they headed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few months a least, maybe a year. It depends on the Bob and Michelle.\u201d Chris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this was kinda nice. Maybe we should do this again?\u201d Morgan asked a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come by the restaurant some time and we can make plans.\u201d Chris said as they arrived back at the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan nodded as the two went their separate ways.

Not just about Sam and Morgan as they had their walk through town, but also their talk in the woods. Still, it was charming all the same to learn a little more about his cousin. Morgan seemed like a really nice girl too. He was actually quite anxious to spend more time with her. It helped to have someone his own age to talk to in this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, it was time to get ready for work again. In what was already becoming a routine, he got ready and showered. Kind of surprised him at how fast he was getting accustomed to being in Sam's old room. Being in a girl's room was kind of weird, yet kind of humbling all the same. In any case, he didn't think much on it. It wasn't like he spent a lot of time in it anyway so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he showered, he noticed the same thing he had the last couple days, that being how smooth his skin was. Honestly, it didn't seem all bad. His skin had never looked so clean and blemish-free, despite all the hair loss. Maybe it was just a combination of stress and the shampoo being used or something. Oh well. It wasn't exactly something that was hindering him. He could live with it until everything returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, he did also notice this time how much fuller his hair was, not to mention longer. It was long enough to cover his ears, looking a whole lot bushier than it used to. Then again, it had been a while since the last time he had gotten a haircut, so perhaps it was just that time. It wasn't exactly hindering him all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he got all dressed, heading down for some breakfast. Bob and Michelle both said good morning to him, asking him how the walk with Morgan went since it was a little bit late by the time Chris got back. He replied that it went very well, much to the delight of both his relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Morgan really needs the support,\" Michelle said. \"She and Sam were practically inseparable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Chris smiled, digging into breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time for the restaurant to begin its day. At the very least, Chris was starting to feel more comfortable in the role. Certainly helped when everyone was pretty nice.</span></div></div>",

Chris wondered if that was even possible, but he hadn't really been himself since Sam died, so maybe he'd just been neglecting it so long and he was only noticing it now, since he was finding new ways to cope, and being in town was helping with that. Before his shower, Chris made a mental note to ask Aunt Michelle about a good barbershop in town, and after his shower, he grabbed a hair tie off Sam's dresser and used it to pull the hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed that his skin seemed smoother, especially his arms and legs. Not just because the hair had fallen out because of stress or whatever the reason was, but there was little evidence that hair had ever been there in the first place. No remnants of any follicles. But it wasn't a big deal, so Chris elected to ignore it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed and heading down to the restaurant, Chris got to work. Today was the best day yet! Even more customers, and as Michelle and Bob noticed, they were all former regulars. Seems the town is finally getting over Sam's death and doing their part to make sure the restaurant stays in business. In the middle of the day, Chris was fumbling around behind the counter with the hair tie, since strands kept falling out and getting in his way as he tried to work the register. Michelle noticed and walked over to Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble with your hair?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's never done this before, but I guess I've never had it this long.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the curse of our genetics. Unruly hair, your mother and I went through the same problems. So did Sam, now that I think about it.\" Michelle got misty-eyed for a moment before shaking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get a haircut on my break. Any good ones in town?\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there's a barbershop and a salon right down Main Street.\" Michelle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his break...</span></div></div>",

It was pretty odd though, as he never had this much difficulty with it beforehand, and its growth seemed oddly quick even though he knew it had been a while since his last cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, guess there wasn't much point in cutting it, given that problem would be taken care of. Eventually, he came across what he was looking for, which seemed to be a barbershop and salon mixed together. Well, it made things efficient at least. Someone getting a haircut may feel like getting everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he walked inside, getting the attention of the woman at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Diana,\" she smiled. \"How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my name is Chris. I'd just like to get a simple haircut today,\" he introduced himself. Diana nodded, though briefly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris....you wouldn't happen to be the same Chris from the restaurant, right? Sam's relative?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh, it was like being related to a celebrity, which Chris supposed Sam was to these people more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm her cousin,\" Chris wryly smiled a little. Might as well take it in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so. Sam really did a lot for everyone,\" Diana smiled. \"She was a regular here as well whenever she needed some fixing up. Here, come on in. How about we give you the full works for your hair? On the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Chris asked, not wanting to take advantage of them. \"I don't really want to trouble you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Diana said, bringing Chris inside. \"I think it's the least I can do for how much you're helping out. Really, I've been seeing more people with brightened spirits since your family's restaurant got going again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that seemed to be the end of that. Chris was in for this one way or another. He supposed he could allow Diana and the others to do what they please, so long as his hair looked nice in the end. The last time he had been at a salon was to get his hair straightened out for high school graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from what he could tell, this was shaping up to be just like that, feeling Diana messing around with scissors and washing his hair and the whole works. She was certainly doing a lot of pulling from what he could feel, though it seemed to loosen up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually....</span></div></div>",

Seeing it in the mirror brought up several different emotions for Chris, especially when he was shown the hairstyle from the back, since it reminded him of how Sam's hair used to be. Memories flashed of following behind Sam and seeing her hair shining in the sunlight. Almost like the light reflected off of Chris' hair right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" Chris started. Truthfully, he felt it looked a little girly, but there was something about it that he really liked. \"Really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. Though it helps that you have great hair. Unruly, but in the right hands, easy to style. I admit, I wasn't sure what to do when I started, but this seemed like the right path to take.\" Diana said. \"How do you take care of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing special really.\" Chris said, telling her the name of the shampoo he'd been using lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I recommend to all my customers. Keep on using it and if you ever need more, let me know.\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" Chris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, this is a bit of a weird question but... I really like how this came out. Would you mind if I took a picture for our social media?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Chris started, surprised by the question. \"Sure. You like it that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my best work in a while, I'll tell you that.\" Diana said. \"I like to post ones that come out really well, you know, entice potential customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great.\" Chris smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana pulled out a camera and started to take photos from several angles of the hairstyle. Once she finished,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for the haircut.\" Chris said, standing up out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. It was very nice meeting you, Chris. Brought back a lot of fond memories of Sam.\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris just smiled and walked out, content that not only did he get a free haircut, but he also got to help yet another local business through Sam's death. He thought he was just helping his aunt and uncle, but it looks like his presence was doing good for the whole town. As he walked...</span></div></div>",

Bob and Michelle both liked it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his shift was over Chris went up to bed and called it a night. He felt rather nice considering how depressed people had been recently. Today was the first day he was starting to see some form of happiness return to the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Chris yawned and woke up like usual as he got up and jumped into the shower. As he cleaned his hair he noticed it felt even longer than before...How was that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out of the shower Chris dried off as he looked in the mirror and saw indeed his hair had grown longer. The tips were now past his shoulders. Upon closer examination he also noticed his roots were lighter, they seemed to be turning a bright blonde color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy...\u201d Chris said looking to his hair. This couldn\u2019t be possible...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris went back to his room and looked at an old photo of Sam. She had long bright blonde hair down to her waist right before she passed away. Looking back to his own he noticed a few similarities but that had to just be a coincidence right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way There was nothing he could do about it now. Chris combed his hair and tied it up in a ponytail not even realizing he was doing it perfectly with no prior knowledge of how to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed Chris felt his clothes were a bit awkward. He noticed they felt a bit baggy. Had he lost weight? Shrugging it off for now Chris went down to the restaurant and was a bit surprised at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was already a line starting to form outside as a few regulars had already returned smiling at Chris as he put on his work apron and began to open up. Everyone was greeting him and smiling at him as they entered. Even Bob and Michelle looked happy for the first time in months.</span></div></div>",

Not that this was a bad thing of course, as his relief for things turning better for his family outweighed any potential awkwardness. Perhaps just a little spark was all that was needed for things to really get going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it certainly caught him off guard at how many people were willing to talk to him now. Not that anything was particularly wrong before, but people seemed to be more outgoing now. He began to learn the names of a lot of people, ranging from a lot of little kids to some teens and young adults to more elderly people. It was actually kind of overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew.....what a day,\" Chris wiped his forehead during lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, he had put aside any potential oddities regarding his appearance. The ponytail seemed to work well enough with his hair, and no one seemed to find it odd. Guess it was alright, although he probably should get it cut sometime. Speaking of hair, he actually looked through his phone and saw an advertisement for Diana's salon, showing off the pictures taken of him front and center. He actually kind of blushed at the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....at least it's helpful,\" he said, chuckling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, his clothes were certainly a little baggy, though not to the extent that anything bad would happen. He felt his torso through his shirt, feeling just a little slimmer overall. Granted, he did feel like he could lose a few pounds from the summer snacking he did before, but this was kind of new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, if there was an issue, it might be with his shoes, as they were feeling incredibly loose, no matter how much he tied them up. Now that was particularly odd. Perhaps he should bring that up with his family or Morgan. Maybe get some new ones since his current ones were kind of old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Morgan, he and her did have some occasional talk through texting. Nothing too big, just ordinary stuff. It helped to have someone else to talk to. Of course, she did remind him of the get-together happening tomorrow on Saturday. Although, she did say she wanted to stop by after he got off work. Perhaps enjoy some time together, which was okay by him. He honestly really wanted to see her again. She was pretty cute...not that that had anything to do with it of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the time work was beginning to slow down, Morgan made good on that deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Chris,\" she gave a bright smile, perhaps her biggest yet since meeting him.</span></div></div>",

On their first encounter Morgan looked like she just gotten out of bed. She had worn baggy clothes, worn out tennis shoes, no real effort put in at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however he noticed she had cleaned up a bit. Her hair was combed, she was wear hip hugger jeans, a decent blouse and flats. Nothing too special but Chris noticed it helped a lot in bringing out her cute feminine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the coffee shop the two talked about how things seemed to be improving recently around town. The energy and life of people seemed to be returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan also made mention of Chris\u2019 hair saying how nice it looked on him. They talked for about an hour confirming the get together tomorrow evening. Morgan said her and Sam\u2019s former friends were really excited to hang out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging out Chris went back to his room and hung out until bed.

Supposedly, Saturdays weren't too bad here and thing we're already less desperate with the increase in customers over the past couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave Chris some measure of relief for things to be working out, though he wondered if the quick turnaround meant he might not spend as much time here as originally intended. Eh, that would surely work out on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that, Chris went in to shower. However, as he did, the awkwardness of his appearance came back to light. He really was thin. Not unhealthily so, but still significant enough to be noticed. Plus, was it just him or was his hair now fully past his shoulders? It appeared to be between his shoulders and waist now, with streaks of blonde being a lot more prominent. Okay, this looked considerably weirder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" He wondered as he showered. He couldn't figure out why. He didn't feel bad, but didn't feel great either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, keeping it in mind, he finished up and got dressed, pulling his longer hair into a ponytail again. The difference in his clothes was more prominent though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, his shoes slipped right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it....\" He groaned. He couldn't exact go out with nothing.</span></div></div>",

The connotations of gendered footwear aside, he didn't want to start rifling through Sam's things. Besides, what if they didn't fit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris picked up a slipper that was sticking out from under the bed and held it up to his foot. A perfect match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, get a move on!\" Michelle shouted from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I don't really have a choice.\" Chris reasoned as he started looking through the various shoes set about the room for something suitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a few pairs of heels, mostly for formal occasions, some sandals and flip-flops, and a pair of sneakers, but they were fairly worn and weren't presentable to be wearing at work. Almost like fate, the next pair his eyes glanced over was a pair of shiny black dress shoes with a sort of a low wedge heel at the back. Thinking back, Chris could remember seeing Sam wear a similar pair of shoes while working a few times when he had visited in recent years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris slid them onto his feet and tested them out. The fit was good, and they completed the ensemble in a way that he felt gave his outfit a spark of professionalism. Like he wasn't just working there out of familial obligation. He was a team member. It felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled as he took a few steps towards the door.</span></div></div>",

He was practically swimming in his shirt and pants now. His belt tightened as much as it would go. He figured he would have to find new clothes soon but now he had to focus on work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the busiest day yet at the restaurant. Chris didn\u2019t even have a second to spare as people started flooding. The strangest thing however was everyone seemed to know his name. Even people he had never seen before were calling out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first this made Chris feel really awkward. How did all these people know him? Why were they so happy to see him? What had he done to deserve their attention? It made him feel really uncomfortable at first but soon he stopped caring and began to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he worked Chris noticed a bit of a tightness around his waist that he was trying to ignore. It started off small but as the day progress it was starting to hurt and get really annoying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay Hon?\u201d Michelle asked noticing Chris was wincing in pain as he cleaned off the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...fine...I\u2019m just...oops.\u201d The pain distracted Chris as he dropped a plate causing it shatter on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I got it...\u201d Chris said bending down when suddenly he heard a loud ripping noise behind him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris\u2019 jeans had split right down the middle. Embarrassed he stood up quickly and excused himself before anyone could take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning upstairs Chris went to the bathroom and got out of his pants as he looked to them confused. They felt so much bigger than what he was used to why all of sudden did they fee tighter around the hips? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the ruined pants Chris stood there confused when all of a sudden his eyes went wide. He saw the culprit behind the pain and rip. It was his own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his hips and backside in the mirror. Somehow his hips were much wider than before. Not only that his butt looked bigger. It was rounder, almost perfectly tear drop shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...isn\u2019t right.\u201d Chris said as his head began to feel a bit fuzzy. He knew this wasn\u2019t right but for some reason he wasn\u2019t totally freaking out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard his Aunt calling his name as Chris knew they needed him back. His pants were ruined though so there was only one real choice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pulled out a pair of Sam\u2019s old pants. There were right hip hugger jeans that hugged his new hips and behind perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back downstairs work became much easier now with the pain gone as Chris found himself back in the strangely comfortable environment of the restaurant. </span></div></div>",

Wait, that didn't count as hitting on her right? \"I-I mean....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Morgan just giggled again, not seeming offended in the slightest. Actually, while Chris wasn't sure if it was intentional or not, she ended up holding his hand, making him blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That's sweet,\" she smiled. \"Come on, let's go have some fun together while you have your break. Some special time before tonight's get together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she asking him out or something?

By now, he was kind of getting accustomed to how quickly everyone seemed to know him, which was still really awkward even though it made things a lot easier to deal with. Some customers tried to hold some little conversations with him all the while, to which he wasn't able to carry too much but he tried his best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes bothered him a lot less, at least below the waist for the most part. Sam's pants actually seemed to hug his legs surprisingly well all things considered, with the wedge shoes supporting his feet well. It was a surprising sensation, if not unwelcome. His shirt was still baggy as heck though, although not as bad. Perhaps he would have to sub that out at some point as well. Well, for today at least, it wasn't too much of a concern. Granted, that little point about his fingernails still stick with him, especially whenever he used his hands to help customers to their tables. They really did look longer, and like they were well-maintained. Not that Chris didn't care of them beforehand but this seemed like a whole lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, this whole thing just felt so weird, only helped by the fact that everyone was being so nice to him and that felt good at the least. Plus, Morgan was a whole lot happier, and that put a considerable jump in his step above all else. Oh, and while this was going on, he made sure to ask Bob and Michelle regarding Morgan's water park idea, to which they happily said Chris should be free to go to it, assuming of course nothing unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was happy about that, and decided to text Morgan about it as quickly as he could regarding it. The quick reply came bearing a whole lot of excited emoji's plus hearts and kisses and such, which was pretty cute. Chris felt his face heating up again at it all, but it felt nice. He'd have to make sure his swimtrunks still fit though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after the restaurant was done for the day, Chris set about getting ready. Granted, he wasn't too sure what to do. Maybe just dress really casually? Problem was that his clothes were getting really weird with him. His old pants absolutely refused to cooperate with his wide hips, which he wondered if they were even bigger now compared to earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, since he figured simplicity was best, he stuck with the same hip bugger pants as before, which felt just a little tighter now. Honestly, his underwear underneath felt a little strained by this point, but not much he could do there. Putting aside the wedge shoes, he decided to go with the worn sneakers, which also seemed to fit well. As for a top, well he wasn't sure about going through more of Sam's belongings, but they seemed to be all that would work so far. He hoped she wouldn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he found a blouse, though a really plain one all things considered. He figured it was close enough to his typical stuff and chose it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Around 9pm Morgan came to pick up Chris. Heading down to meet her Chris was actually surprised at how dressed up Morgan was. She was dressed up more than he had ever seen her before and actually looked rather sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a black dress that clung to her body tightly and barely came to her mid thigh. Along with matching black heels her hair and makeup were also fully done. She even painted her fingernails and toenails a shiny jet to match. The dress showed her neckline nicely and showed off a decent amount of cleavage. It was clear she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra underneath which was showing off her perky C-cups nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly seeing her all dressed up made him feel weird. Not weird in the traditional sense like he was used to. Almost like a strange jealousy feeling he couldn\u2019t quite explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you.\u201d She said with an almost wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey yourself...Damn you went all out.\u201d Chris replied a little shocked still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...Sorry to pull this last second but there has been a small change. Joey, one of my friends got us into the new club downtown. It\u2019s hot and hip with good music and drinks. Is that okay?\u201d Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...uh...sure.\u201d Chris replied now feeling really underdressed. His own clothes didn\u2019t even fit anymore so what was he supposed to do about going to a club?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wanna change? I can wait. I can even give you a hand.\u201d Morgan asked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Chris asked thinking that sounded like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris invited Morgan inside and up to Sam\u2019s old room. It was the first time she had been inside since she had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh...it\u2019s just like I remember...always the goodie goodie on the outside but a total party girl on the inside...\u201d Morgan said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Chris asked. Morgan has mentioned Sam liked to do stuff before but hadn\u2019t gotten too specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think Sam would keep her good stuff just lying about?\u201d Morgan asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan got on her hands and knees and went under the bed. Tucked way in the back was a suitcase that Morgan pulled out smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was her special case. Full of all the stuff she never wanted her parents to see.\u201d Morgan said unzipping the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was a bit shocked at what he saw. The case was filled mostly with clothes. All of them really sexy and revealing. Mini dresses, mini skirts, tube tops, crop tops, high heels, thongs, g strings, lingerie, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...I never knew Sam had such a wild side.\u201d Chris said as he picked up a lacy bra examining it. 36 DD, wow he had forgotten just how busty Sam was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly it\u2019s not surprising to me. She had to always be such an Angel to everyone all the time. It only made sense to me that she had a real Wild side deep down to compensate.\u201d Morgan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should i wear?\u201d Chris asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan looked through the bad and tossed him a pair of jeans and a black shirt. The jeans were full of tears and rips that were obviously made there on purpose. They almost showed more leg than they covered. The shirt of a black mesh crop top. It would obviously leave the belly exposed and be partially see through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...sure?\u201d Chris asked feeling a bit weird about wear this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah take these too.\u201d Morgan said tossing him a black thong and match black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...I\u2019m not so sure about this.\u201d Something was definitely off here. Why would she be asking he wearing these sexy girl clothes. Also...why did he sort of want to wear them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay...trust me.\u201d Morgan said with an almost hypnotizing stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed as he agreed and put on the clothes. To his surprise they were a perfect fit. They hugged his body nicely. The heels too felt really awkward. He expected them to hurt or feel weird but strangely he actually sort of liked them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look amazing...come on...\u201d Morgan said taking his hand as they went off together.</span></div></div>",

It was odd just how well they fit. The thong seemed to settle on his butt rather easily, while the heels didn't hurt even when walking on the sidewalk. Still, he kept those concerns to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan eventually had them cross another street, leading to a decently sized structure that you could hear from the outside. Chris had been to clubs with friends before, even if he didn't go crazy at them. However, this had to be one or the loudest ones he had ever seen. For such a quiet town during the day, it had quite the night life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took care of getting them inside thanks to her friend, allowing Chris to get a view of the place. Certainly, it was as lively as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Morgan giggled as she took Chris's hand again. \"Everyone's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took them well into the club, eventually meeting with a few other people Morgan introduced as her friends. They all seemed to be pretty outgoing, all giving Chris large welcomes. It was kind of overwhelming, though not unwelcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it was a bug case of drinking and dancing around, to the point where Chris lost sense or time. He got to know the names of all of Morgan's friends, and they all crowded Chris constantly like he was the highlight of the party. Heck, even see random passerbys wanted to stop and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of overwhelming, yet not too bad for Chris, given how it seemed to make everyone happy. When it came to dancing, he was reluctant at first, but got roped into it at everyone's insistence. Surprisingly, he seemed to be pretty good at it, at least everyone else seemed to think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shake those hips!\" shouted another of Morgan's female friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, he ended up doing just that, moving his larger hips and butt around like had them forever. Honestly, he couldn't help but marvel at their size while he was doing so. The large hips well contained within the tight jeans with the thong riding up his butt a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" Morgan asked as they danced next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah honestly. More than I thought,\" Chris smiled. \"This is far more lively than any I had gone to before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. Everyone was so eager to see you,\" Morgan giggled before getting a little closer. \"Nice to have some time together too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris agreed with that, despite still feeling kind of odd about all this. He had noticed through his dancing that his hair got in his face a lot. When he combed it back, it was flowing down to his waist, and looked considerably more blonde as well. Was it just the lighting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure, but decided not to bring it up with Morgan and possibly ruin the moment. They just enjoyed their time in the club. Speaking of time, once Chris actually got a moment. He saw that it was nearing midnight, which Morgan also noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, want to go to the special spot soon?\" She asked. \"It's got a marvelous view at this time of night. It'd be a nice place to wind down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost sounded like something out of a romance novel when out that way. Eh, he was making too much out of it.</span></div></div>",

Kendall read the sheet and smiled as she thought of an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe this won't be so hard after all...\" Kendall thought to herself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is a character sheet, and basically you just fill in your attributes, species, name, stuff like that.\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall made a show of pursing her lips and scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what to put for any of this. Can you teach me?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, uh...\" Billy wondered how to teach her, after all, all his games involved people who already knew the ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you make a sheet and I copy off of it, like homework?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" Billy exclaimed as he pulled out a sheet for himself. \"Okay, so I usually pick names later, so I'll start with the species. You've got elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, what do you want to be? I usually go elf, so I'll do that here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly notated on the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then gender, you can just put what you want. Self explanatory.\" Billy started to write in \"Male\", but Kendall stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever like... I dunno, play as a girl elf?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, I usually stick to male.\" Billy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is it different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm a girl, why don't you make this new character a girl, so I know what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Billy said, erasing male and replacing it with female. \"Although gender is different for the elves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall endured the entire spiel as Billy filled in his character sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think the name for a female elf archer should be... Faelynn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faelynn? That's pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.... I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totes a compliment.\" Kendall smiled and played with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character sheet ate up most of the afternoon, and Kendall had to go to a hair appointment, so she started to leave, but before she did...</span></div></div>",

After gloating a bit to Penelope, Kendall quickly made her way to Billy's locker and headed back to his house, where she was introduced to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your pretty new friend, honey?\" Mrs. Howard asked as they walked through house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly profusely blushed as he tried to push Kendall towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friend, mom!\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall pushed past Billy and walked up to Mrs. Howard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kendall. And it's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Howard.\" Kendall said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And polite, too! What brings you here?\" Mrs. Howard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy's been teaching me Dungeons and Dragons.\" Kendall replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I wouldn't have guessed.\" Mrs. Howard said. \"You don't seem the type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to try new things, and this seemed fun. And Billy is such a good teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better go upstairs before I embarrass him to death.\" Mrs. Howard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Howard chuckled as Billy got even redder than before, and that wasn't the acne cream doing that. Kendall giggled and followed Billy up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce up there, Billy got out the two character sheets, and laid down his latest campaign onto the table, grabbing a few figurines off his shelf. Kendall picked one up and scrutinized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miniatures for the games. I like to paint them and customize them for our games. That's your character, an Elf archer. Mine's an archer, too, but I made my own for her.\" Billy showed off a much more detailed figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Kendall remarked. \"You paint these yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Billy beamed. \"I might have gotten carried away, but I usually do with my characters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start the game, then!\" Kendall placed her figure back onto the table, but not before making another mental note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly started to DM, and also played along as Faelynn, since a one-person campaign was rather boring. He ended up spending most of the game teaching Kendall about dice-rolls and initiative, but it was still a fruitful day for the two intrepid adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more fruitful for Kendall, who was getting far more of a grip onto Billy's interests, and ideas for how to manipulate them for her own gain.</span></div></div>",

Not only was Billy's face clearing up, but her subtle influence had started to take hold, and she'd convinced Billy to bring his D&amp;D stuff to her house, course she'd only decided that during school, so he had to rush home to grab his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich gave Kendall just enough time to set up in her room. When Billy arrived, let in by Kendall's mother, who knew to expect him, Kendall was set up with separators on her toes, and an open bottle of nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Darn!\" Kendall hissed. \"I thought you'd take longer, I wanted to redo my pedicure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Billy insisted, putting his bag down. \"I'd have to set up and stuff, so take your time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall pouted and looked thoughtful for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although... you paint those figurines. How about you do my toes and you can remind me what happened in the last session.\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno.\" Billy looked down. \"Figurines are pretty different than toes, I don't think I'd be any good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I showed you?\" Kendall asked. \"Take off your socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly hesitated, but Kendall batted her eyelashes and made a pout that broke through his defenses easily. Billy pulled off his socks and sat on the the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really easy... of course it helps if your toenails aren't ragged and dirty...\" Kendall giggled as she grabbed Billy's left foot. \"Allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Billy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall started to file and trim each of Billy's toenails. Before too long, he was the owner of ten expertly pedicured toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, pay attention.\" Kendall picked up her bottle of pink polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started moving towards Billy's big toe, but Billy pulled his foot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you use something... I dunno, less noticeable?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could... but you wouldn't be able to see what I'm doing to learn.\" Kendall reasoned. \"Plus, it's my favorite one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly thought it over for a moment, and with another bat of her eyelashes, Billy accepted Kendall's reasoning and extended his foot back into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so watch closely.\" Kendall started to paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Billy's feet both had identical separators to Kendall's in between the toes, and Kendall was lightly blowing on Billy's right foot to dry the polish. Billy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickles.\" Billy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I'd do a clear coat, but I think you've got it down by now, right?\" Kendall released Billy's foot after checking the polish again. \"Just be careful not to smudge it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll remove it before I leave?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scout's honor.\" Kendall replied. \"Now, let's see if I'm as good a teacher as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall passed the bottle of nail polish to Billy and he got to work, as he summarized their last D&amp;D session, explaining the grand exploits of Faelynn, and Kendall's character.

You had lived in this city your whole life and never before had you seen this structure before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is that?\u201d You said squinting as saw the old looking tower in this strange meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was unfortunately not improving as dark clouds began to appear over head. A loud book of thunder indicated a storm incoming as you felt raindrops starting to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat...I\u2019m gonna catch pneumonia if I stay out here long...\u201d You said as the rain started to pour down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the pace you hustled to the tower pounding on the door for someone to let you in. You just needed to dry off and use a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise the door swung open as you hit it as you almost fell inside. Quickly you moved inside the tower to get out of the pouring rain as you shut the old wooden door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you were surprised to see lit candles lighting the staircase that seemingly led to the top of the tower. There was no other pathway as it seemed this tower was very authentic on its old school medieval design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this a movie set or like a real old tower?\u201d You asked yourself seeing there was no working electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody had to be home because these candles couldn\u2019t light themselves. You called out up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Anybody home?\u201d You called out only to hear an echo return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaking wet you tried to dry off near the candles as you were shivering from the cold. You could feel a warmth coming from upstairs however. Hoping you could dry off you made your way up the old stone staircase as you climbed your way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took forever. You were panting and exhausted by the time you reached the top of tower. When the stairs finally did level out you saw a large wooden door opened into a large and lavish looking room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking your head inside the room you saw a large fireplace with logs burning as you immediately felt the warmth start to soothe your soaking wet body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d You called out not seeing anybody around at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite large. It looked like somebody quite well off, or as well off as one could be in medieval times. You saw lots of fancy old school dresses hung up on the walls, a vanity set and a fancy bed, you saw hair brushes...lots of hair brushes. On almost every cabinet or table there was a hair brush lying around. You saw a bookcase filled with old looking books. The only view of the outside however was a large window over viewing the valley and meadow you came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like the set of some kind of fairy tail.\u201d You said laughing to yourself as you warmed up by the fire. You assumed whoever was here earlier to set the fire would return and you could explain your situation then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked around you notice there was a small podium with a large book already open on it. Looking at the cover you saw it was labeled \u201cClassic Fairy Tales.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the pages you paused for a moment as you saw a drawing on one page. It was a picture drawn of a beautiful woman who was naked but had incredibly long golden hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://data.whicdn.com/images/10168105/original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://data.whicdn.com/images/10168105/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRapunzel and her tower.\u201d The page said as you remembered the story from you were young. There was a Princess who was locked in a tower by an evil witch and was never allowed to cut her hair because it was magic and allowed her to live forever. One day a prince showed up to save her but the only way into the tower was the princess window. So she let down her hair as the prince climbed it to rescue her. The two embarked on an adventure together as the evil witch chased after them to recover her lost prize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said the story description out loud as you yawned since you had hear this before. As you were about to turn the page you suddenly winced in pain as you realized you had gotten a small paper cut as a single drop of blood fell from your finger onto the picture of Rapunzel in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked on your finger as you noticed something odd. The blood that dropped from your finger didn\u2019t stain the page. In fact it was as if the picture was absorbing it. The blood was sucked into book as it faded away as the letters on the book began to glow gently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...okay this is getting weird.\u201d You said slamming the book shut as you turned to leave the room. Maybe you were just imagining things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to leave the tower when all of a sudden the door leading downstairs suddenly slammed it self shut! You tugged and pulled as hard as you could but the door wouldn\u2019t budge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d You asked as you suddenly began to notice something odd...</span></div></div>",

Once you managed to get it, and managed to get your hair into some semblance of order, you looked out the window. The rain had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally the door was still locked, but you knew how Rapunzel worked. Her hair was indestructible, and the only way in or out of the castle was through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the prince can climb up... why can't I climb down?\" you reasoned out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the door and checked the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sturdy.\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly tied the end of your hair to the handle and knotted it for good measure. You grabbed an armful of hair and headed to the window. You weren't quite comfortable in this body, but given that the tower had transformed you, you wanted to get as far away as possible. You hopped up onto the ledge and started to scale down the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, you finally ran out of hair, just short of reaching the ground, and were left hanging. Thankfully, it didn't seem to hurt, however, you were humiliated, but thankful you decided to wear clothes before doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while...</span></div></div>",

If your hair wasn\u2019t indestructible you could have cut yourself to freedom but sadly you were stuck there dangling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sighed hanging there you suddenly began to hear something...Growling...It was low and sounded like a wild animal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you saw it. A pair of glowing yellow eyes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grew bigger and bigger as a shadow emerged from the darkness. Emerging from it was the largest wolf you had ever seen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t even really call it a wolf it approached you on all fours but stood up on its hind legs standing over seven feet tall. His fur was jet black and his paws looked strangely like...hands...? He had the body of a wolf but the figure of...a man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know much about werewolves but you assumed this was one. It leaned in and began to sniff you with its large muzzle as it let out a blood curling Howl. Apparently it had no intention to harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact it actually seemed to help you. It leaped up on the tower using its brute strength and agility to cling to the stone walls. Putting your hair in its mouth it actually began to pull you back up to the tower until you were inside again. Then with a single inhuman leap it leapt from the window and landed on the ground before disappearing into the darkness....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see your friend again? The Big Bad Wolf is your guardian child...Not your pet. I taught that pathetic human a life long lesson he will never forget.\u201d The voice of an older woman said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around you saw an old looking woman wearing a black coat carrying a basket of what seemed like was various food and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will never learn child...Your gift is for me alone...The world would tear you apart if they knew it\u2019s true power.\u201d She said walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful of your hair she began to chant a strange sounding spell of sorts. It was like singing in an ancient language. As she did your hair actually began to glow lighting up the whole room and actually warming you as your wet body dried off instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held your glowing hair her old age began to vanish as she returned to the age of a beautiful woman with long black hair but a cold and evil looking presence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil next time my child...\u201d She said giving you a small kiss on the forehead which creeped you out massively...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and before you could even ask what was happening she opened the door which immediately slammed shut leaving you stuck here again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized you were not just stuck in a traditional fairy tail...It was like this world itself was a fairy tale. Combing aspects of all sorts of legends into one. </span></div></div>",

Your hair was neatly and expertly braided into a single, long braid, done with hands that had been doing it all their life. You noticed that you seemed younger, somehow. While you had been in your mid-twenties when you got lost in the forest, you looked to be closer to being a teenager now. As you beamed at the mirror, you heard an excited voice approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!\" the voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed to the window, your heart racing. It was him! Frederick, a young man who had stumbled upon the tower a few months prior, and always came to visit. You had exchanged small gifts with him, mainly trinkets that you kept in a secret, hidden spot in your vanity, and you always lifted him by your hair, into the room. He was also unable to open the door, but at least you had company. And over the months, you had grown to love him, after all, he was only the second person you'd ever met!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the two of you had made a crucial mistake. On this day, as he was about to depart, giving you his customary, chivalric kiss on the cheek, and his daily promise to one day free you from the tower, the door burst open. The old woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you could enlist the help of this boy to help you escape? Don't you know that he only wants you for your hair's power?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong, I love her, and I want her to be free!\" Frederick shouted, stepping in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How heroic...\" the old woman sneered. \"If you want to protect her so much, so be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stretched her fingers out and lightning seemed to shoot out towards Frederick. He doubled over in pain as hair began to grow on his body, and he began transforming into a wolf! As your love's face contorted and grew furry, you recoiled in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!\" you screamed as the dream ended.</i></span></div></div>",

Cursed to be your protector for all time. As he awoke he let out a loud wolf like yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to yourself and then back to him. The dreams...the memories...were they yours? Or were they just part of this curse to begin with. Either way you had enough of being trapped here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFredrick...we are leaving!\u201d You said with a sudden stout confidence in yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick\u2019s ears perked up as you looked to you like a confused dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to protect me right?

Curse or no curse you would rather be naked forever then spend one more day in this damn tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to braid your hair. The time you had spent here making you an expert by now. Once your hair was put into a single long braid, it was still the length of your body, but now more manageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t use my hair to escape...but I don\u2019t have to...You have to save me...\u201d You said as stepped closer to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick got worried as he stood up on all fours inching closer to you ready to catch your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before he could react you turned around your back facing the window as you let your hair down and closed your eyes. Letting your arms out freely you suddenly lept from the window no support to save you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick panicked as you leapt to what seemed like your doom. With an inhuman leapt he leapt from the tower after you using his inhuman speed to fall faster as he landed on the ground mear seconds before you were about to hit the ground. Leaping out he dove as you barely landed into his hands.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes your feet touched the soft grass as you sighed happily as Fredrick looked to you with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I know your instincts make you pull me back up by the hair. I realized the only way out was by removing it from the equation.\u201d You said petting him gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick looked mad, putting yourself in such danger did not please him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally touching the soft grass even naked as you were the freedom you felt was more than worth it. It was a beautiful warm spring day out and the pure green grass meadow lay before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your first steps out of the tower in weeks you felt a tug as Fredrick had your braid in his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Fredrick. I don\u2019t care what she does to me anymore. She had taken both of our lives away at this point and we deserve more. I\u2019m leaving I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m naked forever! We are going to find a way to remove our curses and go home!\u201d You stated proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick paused for a second....he didn\u2019t want to go out there. The world was scary place and for a cursed werewolf and a naked princess it wouldn\u2019t be any easier. However he was still sworn to protect you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his head he released your braid as he began to follow you giving an approving barking noise as his tail began to wag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the meadows behind you embarked on your first adventure in this messed up fairy tale adventure you were now in. </span></div></div>",

He worked full time at a large company call center doing IT work and customer service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never been very successful with women pretty much all his life. While he wasn\u2019t a virgin or anything, he had a couple girlfriends in his past, things never seemed to work out for him. Right now he felt like he was stuck in a rut, just a simple cycle of work, home, and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all that changed one day as he came home from work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was coming home one day when he saw a package waiting for him at his door. He hadn\u2019t ordered anything so he was a bit suspicious. The package was decent sized, and weighed a decent amount. It wasn\u2019t heavy but there was definitely some solid stuff in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off Jesse took the package inside and opened it up. It was addressed to him so maybe he had just forgotten about something he purchased online. As he opened the box he saw a note on top of the stuff inside. It was written in huge bright letters with a header reading. \u201cRead Me First!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the note Jesse read it to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to BabeCrate! You have been chosen to the newest member of our amazing monthly service! Inside you will find clothes and a profile for first months Babe. Simply put on the clothes and you find your life magically changing all around you! For the next month experience a whole new life and new perspective. In another month a new crate will arrive with a new profile in it. Simply switch into the new clothes and a new babe\u2019s life will be available to you for the next month. Repeat this process as many times as you like! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisclaimer! If you fail to change into a new babe after a month or refuse to turn back to normal during our select \u201creversal\u201d period, then the changes will become permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you and welcome to BabeCrate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he read the note. This had to be the most elaborate joke he had ever seen. Who would believe such a thing honestly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the box he saw there was a female outfit inside along with a note. Picking it up he saw it had a woman\u2019s name and information on it. Age, hair color, bust size, current job, and personality information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow whoever set this up really went all out...\u201d Jesse said laughing to himself. Reading the profile information he saw the clothes were for a profile of a woman called... </span></div></div>",

Your Babe is Jennifer, a twenty-five year old busty blonde barista. Huh, what are the odds that she'd be my age?\" Jesse read as he started to look through the rest of the box. \"She's an expert on hot drinks, and always gets great tips, thanks to her endowment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse pulled out a D-cup bra and rolled his eyes. Of course that's why \"she\" got great tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's outgoing, and makes friends wherever she goes, sometimes more than friends.\" Jesse read. \"Make sure you have your coffee order ready before you slip into Jennifer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse put the note back into the box and laughed to himself. This was preposterous! A monthly crate that featured what, enchanted clothing that could transform you into a woman? It was ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but Jesse had never had any predilection to try on women's clothing in his entire life! And that wasn't going to start now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough... The crate was promising an utter miracle, and to waste that opportunity because of his obsession with his own masculinity would be terrible! And after all, he was in a rut. Maybe this would prove to be the thing that gets him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What does Jesse do?</i></u></span></div></div>",

They can\u2019t be serious here....can they?\u201d He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost absent minded Jesse held up the Bra to his chest as he chuckled a bit as he clicked it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Jesse\u2019s phone buzzed as a text came through from an weird unknown number. It showed as ??? In his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations Jesse on becoming the newest member of Babecrate! Your boring life as a call center agent is over! Please standby as Reality changes around you, please use caution as the transformation can be a bit exhausting, and enjoy the next month as Jennifer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...This has gone too far...\u201d Jesse said as he read the message. At first this was a cute joke but now it was getting weird and personal whoever was doing this had crossed the line...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was about to reply with a nasty message when his eyes suddenly went wide as he dropped his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingernails were growing right in front of his eyes! Jesse felt paralyzed as he watched his fingernails growing out longer and longer until they looked like very well manicured feminine nails. To make matters worse they were also changing color! They began turning a bright pink color!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse wanted to scream but a strange force seemed to be freezing him. He could feel and see everything but he was powerless to stop what was happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse watched as his surroundings were beginning to change. It started with his phone as it began to turn from his black to pink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around him was changing...His entire apartment. The decor, the furniture, the pictures, it was as if reality itself was reshaping all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn\u2019t improve from there, soon Jesse starting changing too as his clothes began to vanish as his y started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew shorter and thinner as his body hair disappeared. His hair grew longer cascading down his shoulders and stopping at his mid back. It also changed color becoming a golden blonde color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse\u2019s body soon began to restructure itself as he wanted to cry out but the strange force holding him in place prevented him. It started at the base and began working up his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet grew smaller and dainty as his toenails changed to a the same bright pink color to match his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs grew thinner but also shapely and more well defined. Feminine muscle and tone rippled throughout them. His thighs also grew fuller and more luscious and seductive. His hips then widened out cracking and popping as he developed new curves. His butt also began to grow and reshape gaining new proportions as it turned into a tight and supple bubble butt. However the worst part happened rather quickly as his manhood shrunk and slithered away leaving only a smooth and moist slit behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext his stomach flattened out leaving a sexy and smooth tummy behind as his ribcage and chest began to shrink and adjust to fit his new frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext his pecs began to soften as swell as his breasts began to grow right before him. They quickly surged past As and Bs and moved quickly into Cs. They continued their growth even farther pushing forward into D range as they finally stopping at a large D cup. They hung from his chest perfectly as well. Perfectly tear dropped shaped and perky while still remaining natural looking and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Jesse\u2019s shoulders and arms began to change as they grew thinner and more narrow fitting his new body perfectly. His face soon then changed as his Adam\u2019s apple disappeared and his face softened as his lips grew plump and his eyelashes longer as his face became that of a very attractive female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly the clothes remaining in the bag appeared on Jesse\u2019s new body as he was wearing skimpy panties, a sexy bra, with tight yoga pants and a low cut top on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the force holding Jesse vanished as he regained control but fell down feeling woozy and dizzy as he collapsed from the exhaustion of the changes just like the phone warned him.</span></div></div>",

He had indeed transformed into the woman he had read about. Jennifer, the busty blonde barista. As he examined himself in the mirror, his phone suddenly started ringing, the Caller ID identifying the caller as \"Work\". Jesse picked up the phone morosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Jesse asked, expecting it to be the Call Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, sorry to bother you, I know it's your day off, but I really need someone to cover my shift.\" a nervous female voice said on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I uh...\" Jesse debated it for a moment. </span></div></div>",

There were lockers with names on it as Jesse spotted one that said Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jen, thanks for covering for Alesha, her kid is really sick.\u201d One woman said. She seemed a bit older and wasn\u2019t wearing anything sexy, maybe she was the manager?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Karen.\u201d Jesse responded almost by reflux. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse opened up his locker as his eyes went wide.

The weight of them was not something you were expecting as it felt like two heavy weights were now attached to your chest.

You made sure to bend over showing your cleavage multiple times. They each paid and gave you a heavy tip. This process followed at the next table, then the next, and the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew little about coffee but making the orders was second nature.

On the other hand, he felt a bit of excitement as he thought about going to the club with Mandy, which served as a distraction as he absentmindedly texted back his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there. Just gotta go home and change.\" Jesse texted, before putting his phone into his purse and driving off for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived, he quickly returned his attention to the crate, searching for any sort of contact information that might be on any scraps of paper left behind, or even on the box itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" Jesse muttered. \"No email address, their number from before was blocked... What if someone had a problem? How did they get in contact with the company, if there even is one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was quickly becoming convinced that this was a single person targeting him alone, but how could he be sure? He opened his laptop, which had mostly survived the change, though changing from a high-performance rig into a more conservative notebook computer for doing basic tasks. At least the password was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to Google \"BabeCrate\" but his phone started ringing. Another text from Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Calling an Uber tonight, cause I plan to drink. Will swing by your place shortly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auto-pilot started to rear it's ugly head once more as he stood up and started browsing his closet, which was now full of skimpy outfits, though thankfully ones that were more tasteful than what was in Jennifer's work locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, or was it Jennifer, ended up selecting a tight black mini-dress with matching heels. After adjusting his hair in the mirror and giving him reflection a once over, Jesse got a text from Mandy that said she was outside, and he grabbed his purse and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the club, Mandy started to make a beeline for the dance floor. Jesse hesitated as he realized how far the personality had gotten him to go, which Mandy misread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming? Or are you getting a drink first?\" Mandy asked.</span></div></div>",

Some instructions, a punchline for the gag, or something. He wasn't even sure he was holding the outfit the right way around. Either it had a low cut neckline that displayed a mile of cleavage, or the back was down to the base of the 'Babe's spine'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn either case, he'd love to see her in the flesh. As Jesse bend forward, his clothes pressed against the outfit. In a flash, his own outfit disappeared, and he was in the black dress. LBD, he corrected himself, drawing the knowledge from somewhere. Every girl should have a Little Black Dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse took in the changes with stunned amusement. It was all too surreal, as he ran his fingers through the chest hair that was filling the front of the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought barely occurring before Jesse felt it's wrongness deep in his soul. In moments, that chest was bare, and the finger tracing their way across the silky smooth skin, were tipped with deep crimson nails. Snatching his hands back, Jesse stared at them. Distantly wondering what he'd been dosed with... It felt <i>Incredible! </i>So real!... So Intoxicating! But he hid his hands behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome instinct made him want to sway his shoulders back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another wave of wrongness built and built, Jesse was powerless to resist. Dreading the next change, and fighting to not imagine it... Jesse knew what was needed to correct the wrongness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Jesse was fully a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleavage overflowing, the girls threatened to leap from the top. Hips that stretched her dress, without overstraining the fabric. Jesse also knew, she was gorgeous. Her lips full and everything in... alignment. She didn't want to think about... <b><i>it!</i></b>... About being a proud owner of her own pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new mane of hair, the cleavage, the hips... all screamed to Jesse that she was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8f8418b46c0a296e94a68248ad4fd3b/tumblr_pjxe0q60lo1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8f8418b46c0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping against hope, Jesse desperately wished for it to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the male Jesse still had fantasies to fulfil. A whimper escaped Jesse's lips, as she took in the damage. The female Jesse had her own insecurities, and a hunger for power, and the control a sexier body would grant her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still shaking her head in denial, as the changes ripped through her body. A giggle spilling from her lips, a bimbo was so disarming to any male, and dismissed by women as vacuous. Jesse was whorified to see her new body. The curves too ripe, the ambition too obvious, her charms to eagerly displayed... But, another giggle dispelled her worries. Swaying her hips, and her shoulders, as she stood still. Jesse knew her place, and purpose in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcd804b621f2066408b42dd457ea2d4a/tumblr_pjxe0q60lo1w2lwkto5_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcd804b621f2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled enticingly at the thought of her man.... and any man could be hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother successful 'Babecrate'!</span></div></div>",

Eh, perhaps he shouldn't have put so much stock into it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" he shrugged while thinking about it, smirking a little. With that said, he went inside his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis apartment looked pretty normal for the most part. He didn't like to put much of his own stuff out in the open. No, that was reserved for his bedroom. Even then, he tried to keep it a little classy. He had some posters of various anime he liked, many of them some of the more popular ones and such like that. He had plenty of manga volumes too in some of his bookshelves as well. Suffice to say he indulged in his hobby often when he had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not tonight though, as he was feeling a little off from the sake. Thank goodness they were good enough to make it back home from how much they drank. It wasn't their first time going there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he got into his usual sleeping clothes, deciding to just head to bed. He could use a good amount of sleep anyway since he hadn't had much of late. He did his usual routine before heading to bed. As he was settling in though, he could swear he smelled something funny, kind of like that fake fortune cookie he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's nothing,\" he humbled. Probably just smelling whatever was left on it on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had actually looked before closing his eyes, he might have noticed the walls beginning to look a little brighter.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Next Morning</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the sun came too quickly, making Charles yawn as he slowly opened his eyes. Funny, he thought he closed his blinds the other day, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily getting up and hardly paying attention, he began to slowly make his way to the bathroom. Though, he nearly ran into a corner, which kind of confused him as he didn't think he had a corner there. Whatever. Some other things felt off too like he couldn't walk properly or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I did have too much....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused a bit as he heard that voice, which sounded very squeaky for some reason.

Not just a cartoon but a flow blown anime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire apartment had been changed to a more traditional Japanese style apartment with the sliding doors and traditional Japanese decor. Looking out the window Charles also saw the bustling Tokyo Metropolis in the in distance as the sounds of bikes, trains, and cars filled the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever none of this compared to the most shocking change of all. Staring back at him wasn\u2019t a cartoon or anime version of himself, but an incredibly cute and sexy looking anime girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl staring back at him was something out of one his favorite shows. She had long flowing silvery white hair that seemed to sparkle in the sunlight as grew all the way to her waist. Her eyes were a stunning bright blue color. Large and framed her perfectly symmetrical face in a cute way that was both innocent looking yet also sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long and toned legs that framed her perfect hourglass body. Her large plump tear drop behind stuck out perfectly. Her creamy skin was silky smooth and it complimented her petite frame perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever like many Anime girls you liked you also possessed a pair of almost supernatural breasts. They were large and full sized. At least DDs or bigger. They were pillow soft yet perky and had no sag. They seemed to bounce and jiggle with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly your manhood had definitely vanished as you only had a smooth slit left in its place. After a brief examination it was clear that you were in truth a full female...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head began to spin this was all too much to handle. Not only were now a girl but you also in an actual anime! The stress of this sudden change was a bit too much to handle as you ended up fainting from the shock.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charles wasn't quite sure how much time had passed as his eyes eventually opened, once again witnessing the abnormally brightened up bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What just....happened?\" he asked out loud, his eyes getting fully open at the sound of his high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, everything came back to him. Everything looking like anime....anime girl.....stuff like that. Sprawling a bit, he used the sink to get himself back on his feet. Looking into the mirror, he saw everything that had been there before. The silver hair, the figure, butt, breasts, and everything in between. Even his eyes, so much larger than what would be normal. It was enough to make him feel light-headed again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....this can't be real,\" he said to himself, leaning on the sink. \"Magic isn't real. This is just.....a really bizarre dream....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it didn't feel like one. Even the old pinch yourself trick didn't change the scenery at all. He looked outside again, overlooking Tokyo. Was that...really it? Honestly, going to see Tokyo was something on his bucket list. It was quite a sight to see, even if it all looked like something out of a cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about that brought Charles back to himself, flexing his fingers a bit. Honestly, aside from being a girl, nothing felt out of the ordinary. The \"anime-ness\" of everything didn't make it feel any less normal, as if it was natural. The silver hair didn't seem like it was dyed at all, completely natural color. Admittedly, there was a certain cool factor to this, if not for how uncertain he felt about it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was basically a whole new world. Whole new country. Whole new people. It made him wonder just what he could do. Well, the first thing was probably to actually get cleaned up in changed. He was still in the clothes he woke up in, which was just a bra and panties, and it was getting closer to midday with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, best to at least try to retain some kind of normal routine. Charles figured that was the best way for now to keep himself from going nuts. Funny enough, he could feel as if his emotions were being made obvious to anyone who would be watching, just like whenever you saw an anime character get all stressed or depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird...\" he said, finding it hard to find enjoyment in this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he tried to shower up and get changed as he would typically do in the mornings. Thankfully the shower wasn't too different from normal, so that was easy once he figured out how to get the warm water. However, that's when he began to realize other things that came with being a girl. For one thing, his skin was a lot more sensitive, and the breasts were especially so. Water falling on those got him to squeak out, bouncing on his feet a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm a girl in those high school animes,\" he mumbled to himself, trying to get himself cleaned once he calmed down. Granted, the long hair didn't make things easy either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting through it was rough, but get through it he did. Eventually it came to getting himself dressed. Seemed to have quite a bit of clothing, with a lot of casual and dressy stuff. Heck, even stuff like a kimono which made him laugh a bit at the absurdity. In any case, he dressed himself up best he could, which took a little bit of time, especially given the unfamiliarity with getting a bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, he actually ended up crashing and having stuff fall on him, making him cry out again comically.</span></div></div>",

The ringtone was a random J-Pop song that sounded like the intro to many different animes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the phone you noticed the name was Kiki. You had no idea who that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What you didn\u2019t notice was you were actually reading the name in Japanese yet everything appeared as though it were still in English to you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnswering the phone you heard a sudden girl yelling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiharu where are you? Ayana-San is pissed! You were supposed to be here two hours ago! Are you coming in today!\u201d She said in a really fast talking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yeah I\u2019m on my way!\u201d You said realizing this must be your new work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to scramble tossing on some jeans and a basic top and shoes as you scrambled out the door. You looked like an adorable yet clumsy mess as you hustled outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was weird was you had no idea where you were going but yet you knew exactly where you were going...You had never seen any of this stuff before yet you knew the exact train to take and which stop to get off at. It seemed somewhere in the back of your mind this information you needed was there somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally got to your new work you suddenly paused and almost fell over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy Time Bikini Karaoke Bar!\u201d The building said above it with the image of a smiling cartoon cat giving a peace sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...\u201d You said poking your head through the doors to see what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brightly karaoke bar with several really cute severs all wearing bikinis as they took orders, delivered drinks, flirted with customers and even sang karaoke with people who paid enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chiharu! Are you coming?\u201d A voice said as you saw it was coming from the alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a really cute looking girl waving at you from the back door into bar. Taking a deep breath you walked over as you realized this must be Kiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki had semi long hair that was a bright blue color. However just like your silver hair it looked totally natural and not dyed at all. She had a much more petite figure than you did and was currently wearing a bright blue bikini that matched her hair perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are...the manager is furious. You remember she told us the business team was coming today! Here get dressed!\u201d She said talking lightning fast as she suddenly hurled a tiny silver bikini at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...uhh...I\u2019m not sure if....\u201d You tried to say just taking in this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo excuses!\u201d She said grabbing you and with lightning speed like in the anime she tossed you into a dressing as she began tapping her foot waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the bikini in your hands blushing a bright red. It was very skimpy and revealing and didn\u2019t even seem tailored to your larger bust.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mind was having trouble just trying to keep up with it all. Somehow knowing the exact way to come here despite never being to Tokyo, dealing with such rapid talking. It was all so much to take in, which was funny given how often you saw this stuff in anime. Kiki looked very much like the young talkative girl you would always see in anime, the kind that always looked especially young for their age. The petite figure certainly sold that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it really seemed like you weren't going to get out of this, and you whimpered cutely as it dawned on you. This would be great from an outside point of view, but yourself going out there all scantily-clad just seemed so embarrassing. Still, much like your trip here, you felt like you had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One question gets answered and a million more take its place,\" you mumbled as you put your stuff into a locker that had your new full name on it: Suzumiya Chiharu. Boy, seeing your name even that way was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, now nude again, you began to put the silver bikini on. The bottom went on well enough, though it showed more of your butt than you would have liked on yourself. The top was a different story of course, and you were barely able to slip it on. Like you expected, it was not tailored to your large bust at all, barely being contained. You wondered how in the world it was even staying on without ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it was anime. Go figure. One look in the mirror and you sighed, face incredibly flushed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man....why me...\" you groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHIHARU!\" yelled Kiki, so much that it seemed like the whole room was shaking from the soundwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming! I'm coming!\" you cried out instinctively, rushing out with near inhuman speed. You ended up outside before your mind could register it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\" Kiki winked, smiling a little as her mood was a little improved. \"Just make sure it doesn't happen again. Ayana-san will forgive you if things go well. We've got a little more time before the business team comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you should know who they are, but it didn't quite connect in your brain. Guess you would know in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right, sure...\" you said, your face still red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki just giggled at your face before racing behind you and pushing you out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you. No wonder you get so many customers. Sexy one moment, and cute the next,\" she said. \"Oh, gotta run! Don't want to get yelled at too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said all of this in her lightning-fast way as usual, not before grabbing your hand and dragging you along with her. You could swear your feet had even left the ground at how fast she was moving. Was it weird to say that it didn't feel out of place even with out over the top it all looked? Yeah, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Kiki had zoomed you both out to the floor. Seeing it up close, you had to adjust your eyes a little bit with how flashy it all was. It was a miracle to hear anything with how loud everything was, from all the conversation to the karaoke and everything else. Kiki didn't seem fazed of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, gotta run!\" she giggled, patting you on the shoulder. \"Good luck. See you at lunch as usual, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked again before running off as if she already knew the answer, leaving you on your own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping out onto the work floor your body immediately froze up. The sight of all the customers, the girls in bikinis, everyone moving so fast...it was too much as you began to panic..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this...I can\u2019t do this!\u201d You said terrified to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you can...\u201d A sudden voice said echoing in your mind back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second. Where did that voice come from? It sounded like your own but more...seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you began to feel something. A new sensation, a strange new burning kind of desire deep inside you. It was sexual in nature but it was so much more...It was a desire to be seen, a desire to be wanted, a desire to show off and prove you were the sexiest girl here. A desire to win...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist this powerful calling deep inside you the only choice you had was to let out a cute little whimper and gasp of pleasure as you gave in and followed your instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there work was easy...Once you stepped onto the dance floor it was like you were a whole new person. You felt this strong sexual confidence driving you, telling you how to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began your job taking orders and serving drinks, your voice was now sultry and seductive as customers couldn\u2019t keep their eyes off of you. You could see the heat rising from them as their cheeks turned red as you brushed against them ever so slightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat next to customers and playfully flirted, playing innocent and sweet. It became clear quite quickly that you were the preferred favorite of all your co workers as more requests came through for you as more and more tips were left behind for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of your shift after the bar closed down your manager Ayano called you over as she was counting down the till.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyano looked similar to a lot of mentor female types in Anime\u2019s you can seen. She had long fiery red hair once again looking natural. She wore dark classes and a white button up blouse and black business skirt but it seemed like this was almost a parody as her body was almost comically over sexualized. Her breasts were massive, even bigger than yours as was her but and hips. Her whole body was a giant hourglass shape as she seemed to have a stern yet caring personality about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are lucky Chiharu-San...I thought about firing you today for showing up so late and being so awkward earlier. Fortunately you found yourself and made more tonight than anybody. Keep it up and don\u2019t be late again.\u201d She said with a stern tone handing you your share of the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bowed and nodded as you went back to the locker room and immediately blushed. All the girls you worked with were naked together either showering together or changing back into their street clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna shower Chiharu-San?\u201d Kiki suddenly asked you as she was blushing a bit as she stood naked beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to star as you gently nodded. You didn\u2019t want to offend or be seen as a prude after all. You undressed quickly as hoped into hot shower together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you do it Chiharu? How do you go from being so clumsy and awkward to being so sexy and seductive? I\u2019m honestly jealous...\u201d Kiki said a bit depressed all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you began to realize what was happening...You were in an anime now and this was fan service...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...uhh...not sure.\u201d You said gently with your cute voice again. Apparently whatever seductiveness you had earlier had worn off as you felt awkward and shy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...is...it because I\u2019m not as pretty as you?\u201d Kiki said a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have the biggest boobies like you but maybe I\u2019m just not that pretty...\u201d Kiki said as she lifted her breasts in her hands as her sadness began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now trapped in an awkward place. All you really wanted was to go home and figure out what was going on here. The other part felt really guilty about Kiki\u2019s apparent lack of confidence...</span></div></div>",

To an extent, you had tried to think that all this wasn't real, that everything was made up like the cartoon it was. If you thought of it like that, then it made things kind of simpler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, seeing Kiki's depressed face and clear lack of confidence made you rethink on it a little. It certainly didn't seem fake, more like you were facing someone as real as anything you knew before. It even kind of reminded you of your own bouts with confidence issues back in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, it allowed you to take Kiki at a glance. She looked perhaps a little bit younger than you, though probably not by much. Then again, as you learned long ago, tryijg to determine ages in anime based at a glance wasn't always easy. Still, she did seem to play the part of a girl looking up at her sempai for lack of a better word. Made you wonder if her earlier excitement and rapid talking were more of an act or if it was who she was without the confidence problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you really felt like you couldn't let this go yet. You couldn't allow her to linger on her sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not that at all!\" you said, perhaps a little louder than you intended. \"You're...very pretty in your own right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't lying, but you tried to think of what else you could use to cheer her up. Okay, come on think! Kiki was busy the whole day as well. There had to be a good example that you saw as you were doing your own business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! That's it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just today, you remember those School boys? There were tons of them and you did a whole music number with them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Kiki had been left to cover a whole group of young boys earlier and she was a bigger hit than she gave herself credit for. The sight was absolute adorable. Plus, her singing voice was the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah....that...that was fun...\" Kiki said, wiping away a couple tears that had fell, a small smile showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus you...you have the best singing voice in the whole bar. No one else was even close,\" you smiled a little wider. \"Seriously, you're beautiful too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki's face turned a little red, but she didn't seem sad or distressed. Rather, she dove and wrapped you in a big hug, surprising you a bit. She didn't even wait for you to return it, but her earlier smile was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Chiharu-san,\" she said. \"You are the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit it was nice to see her happy again. Looking a sad didn't suit her looks. On that note though, that left nothing to distract you from the awkward situation of being in a shower with a lot of naked girls. It was kind of overwhelming actually, though you managed to hold it in. Didn't help when Kiki offered to wash your back, which you allowed her to do and returned the favor when she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was really weird the entire time, making you glad when you got changed back into the messy clothes you came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiharu-san,\" Kiki bounced over, wearing a sleeveless top and skirt. \"What to go out for a drink? We can even catch dinner somewhere if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, that felt great right now. After how long you just spent here, food and a drink or two would be nice. And heck, Kiki was the most familiar person you knew at the moment so why not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...Kiki-san,\" you said, the suffix kind of coming out on it's own. Boy, that was weird too, getting used to actually saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Kiki giggled and clapped her hands, and you could just see the aura of happiness behind her. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she grabbed your hand, reinacting what happened earlier with you getting dragged out by her.</span></div></div>",

Finally you came to your destination. There was a bright Neon sign above as you read the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Scarlet Lotus\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the building was a large man wearing a dark black suit as he was determining who could get in or who had to wait in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both walked up the bouncer looked to you and eyes you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are fine...busty chick need to change.\u201d He said pointing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized now the price for dressing in such a messy manner. Not that you planned for any of this in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I was in such a hurry I didn\u2019t think of going out tonight. \u201c You replied suddenly embarrassed at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I do have a change of clothes on me.\u201d Kiki said as she went into her purse holding up a black mini skirt and another sleeveless button up blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t like the idea of wearing such an outfit in public but you did promise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the clothes you hid in the alleyway as Kiki covered you up from wandering eyes. You slipped on the mini skirt and buttoned up the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was your new large bust wasn\u2019t built for the smaller top Kiki wore. You could feel the buttons straining as the top few buttons suddenly popped off revealing a large valley of cleavage you were comfortable displaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you didn\u2019t have much other choice as you went back to the bouncer who looked at you now with Kiki who smiled brightly as he grunted a bit and gave you both the go ahead to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the club you were amazed at how popular it was. A huge bar and dance floor playing all sorts of Japanese pop. Kiki was taking your hand as she found what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was booth full of girls that you immediately recognized. It was all the girls you worked with at the bikini bar. They were all dressed up in fancy and sexy dresses and outfits with their makeup and everything all done up to the Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s Kiki! Wow look at that she brought out the Angel/Demon herself. How\u2019s it going Arko?\u201d One of the girls at the table said. She was a feisty looking girl with bright Violet hair wearing a very provocative looking black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered her...She was named...Miako...but everyone called her Mia. She was the most popular girl right after you at the bikini bar. She had a figure similar to yours with long hair and big boobs, however it seemed like her figure and size was just a tiny bit less than yours. Her boobs were just a bit smaller and her figure just a bit less hourglass shaped.She seemed to be the defacto leader of the rest of the girls. All expect Kiki who seemed more attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArko?\u201d You asked confused looking to Kiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your nickname with the rest of the girls. It\u2019s short for Arkosios...It means half Angel Half Devil.\u201d Kiki whispered to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...hey thanks for having me.\u201d You said trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just surprised you came out, we all thought Arko was too good to hang out with us.\u201d Mia said sipping her Martini, her words were little needles digging into you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...uh..I just wanted to have some fun and Kiki needed cheering up.\u201d You replied trying to stay positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww...isn\u2019t that sweet we definitely have Angel Akro out now don\u2019t we? It\u2019s so hard to compete with Devil Arko...The customers just love her don\u2019t they?\u201d Mia said digging the knife in a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMia-San please...we all just came to have a good time.\u201d Kiki said in her quiet voice as it was plain to see she and the other girls at the table were scared of Mia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two other girls sitting by Mia, Haru and Iwa. Haru had short black hair cut to frame her frame perfectly and a very thin athletic build. She was a bit cold and stand off like by nature. Iwa Had bright green hair of medium length and an overall nice frame. She seemed totally bored however constantly distracted and not paying attention to much of anything around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you girls chatted and talked for a bit. Mostly about work and guys. It seemed everyone here was single but there were always flings and flirts going on. Mia seemed like kind of a slut to you. She would joke about all the guys she has slept with recently and talk about guys more like toys and disposable pleasures. Haru barely talked and Iwa would not chime in whenever she felt like it. Mia definitely was the alpha of her little pack here. If this was an anime it was becoming clear to you she was either your rival or the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three girls got up for a bathroom break as you leaned in and whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is everyone acting so scared of Mia? She kind of has a power complex to her...?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh:..I forgot you are new...Mia is the heiress to the company that owns our work. Her grandfather owns the company. She has gotten girls fired before she doesn\u2019t like and even ruined their reputations so they can\u2019t get hired anywhere good. She is threatened by you...Your beauty is almost unnatural and you do have kind of Umm...well a unique personality. You are super sweet and innocent at times but you become well...kind of a sexy demon at others. That\u2019s why you are so popular at work. They love that dark naughty devil side.\u201d Kiki said embarrassed to admit this to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized what was happening now. If this was an anime it your story and it was starting to form its story in place. You could see yourself, the mysterious beauty with a hidden dark talent, your best friend, your rival and her henchmen...That just meant there was a villain lurking around that had yet to reveal themselves...</span></div></div>",

Seriously, everything you knew turned upside-down in just one day. It was weird, and perhaps ironically funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....a rival. Just my luck,\" you groaned instead. This was the kind of anime you'd love to watch when you were your normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well....h-hopefully it works out!\" Kiki tried to say encouragingly, granted the uneasiness could be seen on her face as well. \"And I'm here too right?! Even if the other girls follow her, I'll support you if anything happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was certainly nice to see the girl's earlier enthusiasm back in full swing. It actually helped you to relax and smile a little bit, at least more than before. Honestly, whatever light amount of memories you had didn't give you too much on Kiki beyond what you learned today. Perhaps you'd have to learn that on the fly or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to have one person at least,\" you smiled a little wider. \"You're certainly attached to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Kiki smiled, blushing a little but still looking prideful. \"After what you've done for me, of course I help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, like what?\" you asked, your large eyes blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't forget did you?\" Kiki raised a finger. \"Just a little while after you joined, you actually defended me from Mia-san. She was picking on me because of my....well, size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, something about that seemed to tickle in your brain, witnessing Mia harassing Kiki, practically bringing her to tears in the process. But then you came in like some knight in shining armor, or shiny bikini, whatever. Somehow, none of this seemed surprising to you given what you had witnessed today, and Kiki seemed to become your best friend ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice little tale, if a little cliche. Still, you smiled a bit, even giggling softly after Kiki stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice...Kiki-san,\" you said, still getting used to that. \"I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the three other girls had been in the bathroom for a while, though you figured Mia probably wouldn't be disappointed if you both were gone by the time she came back. Besides, you and Kiki had already gone through some drinks and she was beginning to look wobbly. Actually, it was incredibly adorable how loopy she was looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we get out before the princess arrives?\" you smiled a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Kiki sing-sang a bit. \"You know, there's somewhere I'd like to show you if you're interested. It looks wonderful at this time of night.\"</span></div></div>",

Getting there was no problem at all, and you allowed her to let herself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chiharu-san,\" she smiled widely. \"See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" you waved a little back before she closed the door completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you began to follow your brain on the path back to your apartment. Funny how relying on such a thing felt so natural after just one day. Guess it was because you were using it so often. Still, as weird as things were, it honestly wasn't too bad. Being a girl didn't help but it was an interesting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train ride back home allowed you time to think on things. How did you end up here? That fortune cookie must have had something in it after all. It couldn't be coincidence. Made you wonder just what that old sensei guy was up to when he gave it to you. Furthermore, how would you be able to get home? Or was there any way at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it didn't seem like those answers would come anytime soon. You sighed as you got off the train, making your way back home. Still, you had to admit that the place looked really nice. You looked out over the lights of the Tokyo skyline, and boy was it a beauty to look at. Perhaps it was anime, but dang did it look cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's not all bad,\" you smiled a little, before getting to your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you just settled in, suddenly exhausted from how the day went. Guess that was how things were so long as you were here. You turned on the TV for a little bit, not even caring about how all the Japanese seemed so natural to you, before beginning to turn in. You wished you could cover up a bit more, but you guessed the bra and panties would have to do for sleep wear. At least you would keep cool during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with the day's events fresh in your mind, you fell right asleep.</span></div></div>",

You honestly thought you were one of the cutest and sexiest anime girls you had ever seen as you winked at your reflection and giving yourself a peace sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked your schedule and saw it was your day off so you wanted to spend the day exploring Tokyo and seeing this new beautiful anime world for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went for the door you suddenly paused...It was like you were suddenly frozen as your body refused to move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten our deal have you?\u201d A sudden dark sounding voice echoed into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat....what is this...:?\u201d You said trying to fight back but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to look back at yourself in the mirror as you suddenly let out a loud yelling noise as you saw your bright blue eyes suddenly flash a deep dark blood red color...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scare and shock actually managed to cause you to fall over as you shook your head.

You made a whole lot facial expressions, and actually laughed a bit when you could even see symbols around you that signified emotion, just like in every anime ever practically. Heck, you even made a \"shocked\" face that would be completely impossible in real life. It really showed you just how out there all of this was, and yet you seemed to be getting a hang on it despite only being here a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your apartment, it was weird how directions just seemed to come to you. Granted, it certainly made things a whole lot easier. Imagine if you had been here with no sense what so ever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll take what I can,\" you shrugged, before getting on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train wasn't too busy this time, so you had some room to yourself. In the meantime, you had time to think for yourself. Honestly, you wondered if things were going to get even more hectic soon. If this really was an anime, and from what you had already seen, some kind of plot was in the works, meaning you might get into even more crazy situations and not for the best. Being the protagonist sounded great and all, but living it instead of just watching meant the potential danger could be all the more real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you looked out over Tokyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I don't get myself killed,\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, hopefully this could take your mind off of things. As the train got to a different stop this time, your mind seemed to lead you towards the mall that Kiki had replied you both try out first. It certainly seemed like a great opportunity to learn more about Kiki and this world in general. If things might get rough, actually having a grip on things instead of relying on instinct would be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiharu-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped out of your skin as you suddenly got dramatically hugged from behind, a loud giggle filling the air as you ended up spinning a bit. You got a little dizzy from it, to it you just heard more laughter. Settling down, you looked around to see Kiki, which giggling. She was wearing a nice dress as well, which was pink in color. She had sandals as well, though hers lacked the heeled parts. Still, she looked adorable all the same. She even had her hair done up in a cute pair of twin ponytails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised to see me?\" she giggled still, seeing your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was....a little surprising yes,\" you sighed, smoothing out the sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to make a good first impression,\" Kiki smiled. \"I felt a lot better after we talked yesterday, so I want this day to be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good,\" you smiled back. Boy, Kiki was sure enthusiastic once her worries are set aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Kiki motioned towards the mall that she had suggested you both check out, and grabbed your hand to take you inside. As she did though, something came to mind. You had a little bit of how suffixes worked in Japanese, and \"-san\" as Kiki used it was perhaps the most generic. Stuff like that tended to indicate much about the relationship between two people. Perhaps that sort of stuff was something to keep in mind for future reference.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your time with Kiki was spent both learning about each other and you learning about this new world as well. As you begun to find out this world was very....very...different from your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the obvious, this being a anime version of Japan the rules and history of this world seemed to vary greatly from your own. It seemed to be mostly ground in reality but where were definitely strange new supernatural elements to this world that simply didn\u2019t exist back in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first things you learned simply through discovery was how culture and society worked here. Simply put this world seemed to very sexually focused. Not too unheard of considering many anime\u2019s you had watched in past but here it was more than simply pervy fan service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently this over abundance of sexuality in society all stems from the greatest difference between your world and this one. It is because of some called...\u201dThe Blossoming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you had no idea what this term meant but upon doing some research you found out exactly what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blossoming is a physical transformation that\u2019s affects all human women in this world. Apparently it\u2019s a like a super Puberty effect that triggers in women right around adulthood. There is no exact timer on when but it usually affect young women right around their 18th year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring The Blossoming a woman\u2019s body undergoes a remarkable transformation rapidly developing in all sexual characteristics. Their busts grow, their hips widen, everything about them sexually drastically increases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explains why there is such hierarchy and caste system amongst women in this world. Because The Blossoming is not an exact science the effects of it vary greatly from woman to woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people like your rival Mia were blessed with an amazing Blossoming and became sexual goddesses while others barely had any effect on them at all. This explains why Mia is so revered and power driven, as with many people their status goes to their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also explains why you are the protagonist of this Anime. You were able to look up older pictures of yourself and found that your character Chiharu was a sad little orphan girl with no memory of her past. She was unattractive even by normal standard and left alone by most of society. However all that changed after her Blossoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chiharu Blossomed she became the absolutely amazing sex dream that were now. Even by this world\u2019s standards your appearance stood out. Not only that before the Blossoming Chiharu had dark brown hair,  now it was a pure silvery white. Something that you haven\u2019t found on anyone anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis incredibly abnormal Blossoming is what has led to Chiharu\u2019s nickname of Arko. Meaning half Angel half demon. She looks like an Angel now practically perfect in appearance but there is something dark inside her. Something that makes her an absolute sexual monster, yet it has never fully come out. This is why many are so afraid of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki it seemed didn\u2019t care about all these stories and rumors. She seemed mostly focused on just being your friend. You were able to learn something interesting about Kiki during your time together. Kiki is what is known as a late bloomer. Even though she is in her early 20\u2019s she hasn\u2019t blossomed yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explains her petite body and small breasts, also her shyness and insecureness, because many of the other girls tease her about it. Treating her like a child and demeaning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis world was definitely a strange one but you were beginning to see how the anime pieces were being out together.</span></div></div>",

You could only imagine how suspicious you might have seemed if you knew nothing about the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to that point, suddenly how all the women looked in this world began to stand out. You actually hadn't thought much of it before, but all the women in this world seemed to be mostly pretty busty, just as you had read up on. Frankly, it was all kind of spooky to see that there was some kind of supernatural force in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMade you kind of wonder where it came from. Such things always had an origin somewhere, but you decided not to think on that for now. Heck, whatever it was would probably make itself known in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of that dress in the window? It was so cute! Oh, and I saw this thing on TV where....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and Kiki hadn't stopped talking all throughout this adventure so far. Seemed like she was a real mix of energetic yet shy. You had to guess that her energetic self was how she truly was, with her shy side coming whenever her being inadequate to others came up, and admittedly that actually came up once during your walk with her through the mall. Some random passerby got a jab at her, which did make her sad, to which you tried shooting her a nasty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it seemed to have its desired effect and the woman left quickly. Kiki had apologized for being a bother, to which you said it was fine. She went back to normal after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time for some lunch, and you could use it after all that walking. Suffice to say, there was quite the food variety, Japanese and otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was fun!\" Kiki smiled as she took bites of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" you smiled back. Funny enough, being like this was sort of becoming more natural for you, despite having only had a couple days like this.

We should be heading out it\u2019s getting dark.\u201d Kiki said carrying her bags of clothes she bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a problem when it gets dark?\u201d You asked carrying your bags as you both went out of a side entrance of the store into an alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...no...but you know...This isn\u2019t the safest of neighborhoods and they say night is when the monsters come out of if you believe in that kind of thing.\u201d Kiki said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on you don\u2019t really believe in monsters do you?\u201d You asked teasing her slightly as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s just...There are stories.\u201d She said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you walked down the alley way you suddenly heard a deep male voice call out behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there ladies...\u201d He said stepping out of the shadows. It was a rough sounding guy wearing a dark hoodie to cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding boys...Look at that silver Angel. With such a cute little late bloomer. What\u2019s wrong sweetie, nobody every wanted your flower?\u201d He asked as two more hooded men appeared behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh...\u201d You began to think. You had seen this in Anime\u2019s before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki was shaking nervously as you stood between her and the creep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off Jerk! We aren\u2019t interested so get lost!\u201d You said standing your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch...so rude...A lady so pretty and sexy as yourself should be nicer.\u201d He said getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to get nervous as the three men were closing in. Each of them much taller and stronger looking than either of you. For the first time in your life you Began to feel powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden the man in front of you reached out with his hand to grab yours as you pulled back and slapped him. That\u2019s when you noticed his evil looking smile as he and his friends each pulled out knives as they quickly grabbed you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiharu-San!\u201d Kiki called out as she was grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried with all your might but in this body you were so much weaker you couldn\u2019t do anything against the mans strength as he pushed you against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo rude...how about we teach these girls a lesson in humility boys?\u201d He said laughing to his gang as the other two men laughed as they began to touch Kiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop this right now!\u201d You called out but you couldn\u2019t do anything to fight back. You were powerless to resist....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pathetic mortal! We had a deal and you are ruining it! Fight this pathetic jerks!\u201d A sudden dark but familiar voice echoed in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I can\u2019t...\u201d You said unable to fight them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well...So be it. I am taking control...You can make it up to me later.\u201d The dark voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-From Kiki\u2019s Perspective\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki was whimpering begging for this all to be over when all of a sudden there was a scream from down the alley way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the other man holding Chiharu as he was screaming in terror before it sounded like he was grabbed by the throat as his voice muffled. Suddenly the man went flying as he was hurled down the alley way gasping for air as he was almost suffocated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d One of the men holding Kiki said as they let her go and stared down into the shadows of the dark hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out slowly Kiki\u2019s eyes went wide as she saw Chiharu stepping out of the shadows but something was different about her....She had an evil looking grin on her face as her eyes were sudden a blood red color. Her fingernails and toenails had also grown longer and turned her black. They were now pointed like claws...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter boys? I thought you wanted to play?\u201d Evil Chiharu said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d One of the men said as his comrade was still gasping for air on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d He said lunging at Chiharu with his knife in typical over the top Anime fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiharu simply laughed and with one hand grabbed the wrist of her attacker and with the other grabbed the man by the neck lifting him up like nothing as he began to get strangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonster huh....that\u2019s gonna hurt my feelings...You wanna see a real monster?\u201d Chiharu said laughing evilly as she tossed off the attacker like he was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last gang member stood there frozen in fear holding up his knife to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...what the hell are you?\u201d He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard them right? I\u2019m a monster...A true demon...\u201d Chiharu said laughing in her deeper darker voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki stood there frozen in fear as she watched as Chiharu began to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin turned dark red as her body grew causing her dress to rip. Two devil like horns began to sprout from her forehead as a long spaded tail erupted from her spine. Her long silver hair grew evil longer almost touching the floor as her body turned into that of a true demon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis demon walked over to the last attacker grabbed his knife and with only two fingers she bent it like it was made of paper....Leaning in closer and closer the attacker was paralyzed either by fear or the strange demonic aura coming from her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in closer to the mans ear she smiled revealing sharp fangs in her mouth as a long tongue came from her mouth and she devilishly licked the mans ear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo!\u201d She said with a cheap laugh as the man dropped his knife and took off screaming. The other two men were barely able to stand up as they took off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon Chiharu stood there laughing and reveling in her devilish delights as she turned back to Kiki and only smiled with a wicked grin. Slowly her body began to revert back to normal as normal Chiharu stood there standing in a strange daze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Your perspective\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had gone dark for moment. The last thing you remembered was that horrible man grabbing you. You had somehow blacked out as you stood there in the alley way your dress now in tatters barely holding itself to you now and your shoes totally destroyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there barefoot and almost naked confused as Kiki could only stare at you in both a mixture of fear and confusion...</span></div></div>",

She had no idea what just happened. They just got attacked by some thugs, and then Chiharu just became....that thing. Was that even real? Well it didn't seem like she was dreaming in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind raced with just what she was supposed to do. There was an eerie silence, nothing by the wind coming by as the two girls just stayed in place. Fear and confusion continued to race in Kiki's mind, though it clashed with the other side of her that Chiharu was always nice to her, and when she thought about it, everything that just happened seemed to be in defense of her, considering that demon thing didn't come after her after scaring off the thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, it was all too confusing.....but Kiki didn't want to leave Chiharu all alone out here. What kind of friend does that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Your POV</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind still felt out of it, like you were half-asleep. What in the world just happened? And...how did your clothes get all destroyed? Barely enough of your chest and down below were covered, not exactly ideal for the night air. It felt like your mind wasn't quite connecting the dots on what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly, you felt your hand being grabbed. You turned your head to see Kiki gently pulling you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiki....san?\" you said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We should...get you home,\" Kiki said with a small smile, albeit one that still held her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, some of the bought clothes worked well enough to cover you, as well as a pair of shoes. It was haphazard but it got the job done, despite getting some odd looks. Kiki had a bit of amusing panic trying to cover up what was going on, and eventually people just starting going back to their own business. Your head was slowly getting better, though still a little foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you two got off the train and towards your apartment.</span></div></div>",

What just happened had you somehow shaking both from fear and adrenaline. Kiki used your kitchen and both of you some hot tea to drink and calm the nerves down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rest Kiki replayed the entire incident from her perspective to you. You couldn\u2019t believe your ears but you also didn\u2019t believe she was lying either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to piece it together more clearly now. This is why you are the protagonist of this Anime. A girl that holds a dark secret and a hidden power. Many questions still remained unanswered but the general idea is there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes so much sense now. I just can\u2019t believe it...You really are part demon...I just didn\u2019t think it was literal.\u201d Kiki said a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this happened to me.\u201d You said looking at your reflection in the mirror. Waiting for something to suddenly pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither...You say you have no memory of it either?\u201d Kiki said curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head you were beginning to understand why so many things made more sense now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason you felt compelled to dress sexy and why revealing clothes were so much more comfortable for to you wear. There was a reason why you were so popular at work. There was a demon inside you, a demon of lust to be specific. At work you were unknowingly tapping into its power, giving off a subtle lustful aura that increases their desires toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anyway to get rid of it? To banish this thing from me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...I\u2019m not even sure it is even a separate thing. It seemed more like it was part of you...Like the dark side of your soul coming out.\u201d Kiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...You don\u2019t have worry...I\u2019m not going to tell anyone. It\u2019s just I\u2019m worried for you. If there is anything I\u2019ve learned about situations like this it\u2019s that the demon inside you is only going to grow stronger with time.\u201d Kiki warned as she finished her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will control this for now. I just need to understand why this happened and how to deal with it before it gets worse. Thank you for understanding.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki got up and hugged you goodbye. She was hesitant to leave you alone right now but it was clear you needed some time to collect yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Kiki\u2019s POV\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki left Chiharu\u2019s apartment and quickly disappeared into a small public bathroom before locking herself in. Leaning over the sink she was panting as she was trying to fight something off it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had obviously been holding something in for awhile as reached up and cupped her small breasts letting out a rather loud and embarrassing moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was hot and her breasts were throbbing. She hadn\u2019t said anything but when was in the presence of that demon she could feel it, her blossoming wanting to come out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki had wanted nothing more than her blossoming to happen naturally for years now but this was the very first time she had ever felt it stirring inside her. For normal girls they usually feel it coming a day or two before it erupts giving them some time to prepare. This however hit her like a total surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings soon faded away again as Kiki sighed. Part of her mind began to wander and think if perhaps this demon side of Chiharu could be the key to awakening her blossoming but would what would be the cost of such a thing?</span></div></div>",

Ugh, that was certainly one of the more inconvenient tropes in anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you weren't sure if you were going to get any more answers tonight. Perhaps it was time to turn in for the night. Still, it did bring kind of a downer on what had been a rather fun day with Kiki. At least she seemed to take it in stride more or less. Guess a world that already had weird things like the \"Blossoming\" gave way to some unbelievable things in the world. Come to think of it, it made you wonder just what caused the Blossoming to begin with. Still, that was probably enough for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should get to bed,\" you said finally, not in the mood to watch anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, already getting a sort of night routine, you turned in and ended up in a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next day</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, it was the next day.

Well, that's what you decided on as you called her number again. Though, you wondered if she would even pick up.

Her hair was tied up in a simple ponytail. She wore jeans and t shirts and even a sweatshirt over that. Even her underwear was boring underneath. That with some simple flip flops completed her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014Your POV\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were not too different from Kiki\u2019s as you wanted to make sure nothing tempted you or made you think of the demon inside you at all. Since this was a demon of lust you figured dressing conservative and simple and avoiding anything feminine or sexy was the way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dressed in layers as well. Unfortunately you didn\u2019t seem to own anything not sexy so you had to put on yoga pants and a blouse and a dress over them. You grabbed one of the only coats you seemed to own and tossed it on too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kiki finally came over it was nice to see her. Both of you seemed to take notice of your outfits as it was clear there was an elephant in the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...Chiharu-San...do you know anything about this demon?\u201d Kiki asked as she sipped the tea you made her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing...only that I paid a price when I was young to get her and this body, but it came with an agreement of some kind. She wants something but won\u2019t tell me what.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be easy living with such a burden...\u201d Kiki said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...guess not. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about this.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continued to talk for awhile. Mostly about trivial things like work and gossip. Kiki decided that avoiding anymore awkwardness was probably the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile it was starting to get dark as Kiki looked at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I think maybe I should be going.\u201d Kiki said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...no problem let me just...let me....let me just....\u201d You said as you began to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a pulsing heat suddenly beginning to overwhelm your body as a sudden dark voice echoed through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is time...Your offering is acceptable. We shall call forth her dark blossoming and make her into one of us.\u201d The dark but familiar voice said echoing in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiharu-San are you okay?\u201d Kiki asked getting a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I think...she is coming...\u201d You tried to say as you fell backwards.</span></div></div>",

In fact, I've forgotten it already.\" Eli shut his eyes tightly. \"Wow! An empty mansion!

I have discovered another solution to this problem. It would only bring us shame and bad fortune to spill blood on this holiest of days. Therefore we shall obey the texts another way. We shall begin the rite of conversion!\u201d She proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Rite of Conversion! He hasn\u2019t earned it! To him it would be a curse!\u201d One of the sisters spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoanna...You are our senior sister, we will obey your word. However I must ask, is this truly the best option? The rite is permanent, we are changing a life forever.\u201d Rosalind said speaking up again in Eli\u2019s defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the way....It is that..or death. We will let the male decide.\u201d Joanna said staring back to Eli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey listen whatever you need to do in order to not take my head off I\u2019m down.\u201d Eli said trying to force out a smile and show of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe choice is bed. Bring forth the male!\u201d Joanna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards pushed Eli into the circle as the women surrounded him. At first it was rather nice as the women placed their hands on him but soon they began to rip and tear at his clothes pushing him down until he was stripped totally naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna stepped forward looking upon Eli as she held out a small sacrificial dagger and took Eli\u2019s hand. With a quick slash she made a small cut into his hand taking the bloody dagger over to small basin of water kept on a stone pedestal near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the goddess we envoke the Rite of Conversion upon this male. By his blood will his true form be revealed to us.\u201d Joanna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna took the dagger and dropped the small droplets of blood into the basin of water which soon began to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely the water soon began to bubble as if heating up...Eli saw no heat source red still red stream soon began to rise from the basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goddess! Reveal to us the true form of this male! Read his hearts desire!\u201d Joanna called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli swore he must be hallucinating because the next thing he saw was the steam began to create an image in the air. It was the image of a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of a woman appeared above the basin. The woman was stunningly in appearance. She had long platinum blonde hair down past her waist. Large perfectly rounded DD breasts. Amazing curves with an hourglass figure, bubble butt, long legs, and perfectly smooth skin. She was something right out of Eli\u2019s fantasy. The image soon faded as the water returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the ladies soon began to make hissing sounds like a snake as they looked towards Eli in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTypical male...\u201d They began to whisper to each other saying slurs like pig and jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough! His heart has made its choice! It is not for us to<br>\r\nJudge. It it only our job to welcome our sister....Now...begin the ritual.\u201d Joanna said calming the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna stepped into front as she began to chant as the others followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReborn to us...Change the flesh....Reborn to us...Change the flesh...\u201d She began chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sisters began to recite this chant over and over again until Eli began to feel something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a powerful sensation of heat hit his body causing him to fall to his back and stare down at his body as he was unable to move.

The plane was entirely motionless, all those people, passengers, flight attendants were as still as still could be. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started moving, and the bustle of disembarkation started.

Better head there.\" you said, using the phone to call a ridesharing app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the driver drove, you searched through the phone.

What are you a whore?\u201d The mom said suddenly slapping you pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap suddenly woke you up the reality of the situation.

The part has been cast. It\u2019s going to Sam Aris.\u201d Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam Aris was another young actor and sort of a rival with Dexter.

Was there a change or something to the character?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...not exactly. The character is still as described...However...Our sponsor...GGC has asked us to try and experiment a bit with this role.\u201d Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGGC stood for Global Genetics Corporation. They were currently one of the largest companies dealing with genetic engineering. It was new and very controversial science. Everything from cloning, age fighting, even gender changing and race changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany people loved and applauded GGC for their advancements in genetic technology but others saw them as tampering with the human genetic structure and accuse them of playing god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter looked to the casting director as he was almost afraid to ask what GGC wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGGC has asked that the main lead played by Madison represent the growing numbers of \u201cChanged\u201d peoples. They feel like representing this character in this way will not only show off the safety and strength of their genetic technology. It will also give off a positive message to all people who has changed their outsides to better match their insides.\u201d Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...are you asked me to have a Gender Switch done to obtain this role?\u201d Dex asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...it would only be required during filming weeks.

We are advertising this show as the first major sitcom with an openly changed actor in it. You could be that actor Dexter. Think about the doors this would open for your future.

He doesn't hide it as he looks you up and down.

Any plumbing or lights not working or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, but... something does strike you. \"Well... I was having a <i>little</i> trouble with the autocloset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, allow me.\" Without hesitation he moves to a wall control panel \"I take it the closet is on the home network?\" You nod. \"So, I'm guessing you don't have a profile set up for the machine. They can be a bit finicky if profiles aren't set up correctly. Let's see... yes, you have Jane, John and.... right, I'll just create a new Jenny profile, make some settings....\" He looks up, \"And you should be good to go, try it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try, make sure it works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, maybe you should go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if I screwed it up you'll have to call me back to fix it again.

The illusion of your breasts looked even more convincing with the mesh on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the black miniskirt, not even reaching your knees as it was snaked up your forced together legs. A pair of black thigh-highs were next, as followed by the the red high heels that completed the look alongside a black choker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stand in shock at what had happened.

With your luck, messing with something you're wearing is likely to lead to more complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you move towards the closet exit, a small step you stumble on with your heels. Cursing them, you gently open the door and make sure Jane is still silent. Her form seems still.. then the blankets move.. you freeze, worrying she'll look this way and see your made up face and body in HER clubbing gear, but she settles again and you ever so slowly step carefully to the exit door, using tables and doors for balance, the skirt rubbing against your thights. Quietly, you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like its better then new!\" said Derek with a wide grin. As you try to make sure the bedroom door is closed behind you, Derek looks you up and down, taking every part of you in! \"Ready to hit the town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, \"All I need is my purse!\" you reply sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift motion, Derek opens a closet, takes out Jane's clutch purse and offers it to you. You're stunned for a sec on how to react, but thinking Jane's items are better in your hands then a stranger's, you take it and sling the narrow loop over your shoulder. It swings slightly and rubs against your bare midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" he comments, \"hey, do a twirl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you gather your words, \"Everything seems fine.

That's as far as you can move though because while the closet is spacious for one person, with two people you're starting to feel cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek smiles, he's blocking the only exit to the closet. He turn towards a panel, taps a few things and look up agin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's happened is that the closet doesn't have any clothing for Jenny; only for John or Jane. That's why its not giving you any clothes, it doesn't have any on file for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why didn't you tell me this before?</i> you think. \"So what am I to do? Walk around like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek grinned again, \"Well it wouldn't be the worst thing in the word, you walking down the street like that, strutting your stuff, shaking that ass!

An attractive girl wearing sexy lingerie in the apartment of a couple, the girlfriend sick in bed, the boyfriend absent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrunch your eyes in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its either a threesome, or the girlfriend is more then 'friends' with you, but I think the real winner is that John is having an affair with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely process the thought, \"An affair.... right here in the apartment.. with Jane still asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes it all the more exciting doesn't it? Probably gives him a thrill knowing at any moment his mistress and girlfriend could meet! Probably why he left you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, that would destroy his relationship, in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's what he wants... think about it.. leaving you here with only his girlfriends clothes. He probably sabotaged the autocloset to made sure it couldn't give you any of your own clothes. He's left the apartment so that he's not here when you and your girlfriend meet and the sparks fly. He just can't keep living a lie so he's trapped you here just so his girlfriend can finally find out the truth without him having to tell her himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look....\" you take a breath, your arm skiming against raw skin on your side, \"... that its... crazy. I don't know how you came up with that story, but it definitely isn't true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then where are your clothes? Where's your purse? Your ID? Your keys? Your jacket? Anything that would let you open the apartment door and walk out right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to say something, but exhale in frustration...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face it, you've been left high and dry. And even if you meet Jane and get it through that eruption, she's hardly then going to give you her coat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.. maybe... maybe if you just leave me to deal with my own issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't leave a damsel in distress. Besides, can't have unnecessary stress on our tenants, especially since it much more trouble to manage. So here's how its gonna be: One, you leave John. He's no good for you, he has a girl, and meeting him again is just going to lead to more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, \"Well, I'm sure no one will see us both together after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek smiles, \"Great! Secondly, you stay in here, I'll get you a change of clothes, and when you're dressed, we walk out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I won't be able to get back in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... wait, I can fix this myself, I just need a moment with the autocloset!\" You look around you and the clean formed interior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do you'll be stealing from a tenant and I can't have that. Police could get involved and that's just going to be a headache for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolice? This was escalating way too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek continued, \"Look stay there, sit tight, don't worry your pretty little head about anything, and ol' Derek will sort out everything for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a strong surge of annoynance, and take a step up to him in your bare feet. \"Look, I'm not some..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand had swung down around you and smacked you on your panty clad bottom. Your eyes widen in shock! Your words left hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa girl, no need to be feisty. Just stay there like a good little girl and I'll be back before you know it.\" With that and another big smile, Derek slid out the door as you stood in shock.</span></div></div>",

You stare in the mirror wondering what Derek is thinking, but quickly admit that this is far better than being mostly naked.

A bubbly, blonde, bimbo named Blair. So cute, so shallow, so boy crazy, and oh so stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a needle in your butt and see one inserted in your chest, injecting you with some sort of pink liquid. They begin to heave and grow, and you whimper in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, of course, the machine is making sure you have all the proper parts. A girl without her girly bits is no good. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s gonna make sure you\u2019re a curvy one. We wouldn\u2019t want your poor bimbo self to be stranded without a man because her body wasn\u2019t big enough. You\u2019ll need big boobs to get money anyways, cause your intelligence won\u2019t be getting you anywhere. Trust me, you\u2019ll be little more than eye candy once the auto-closet is finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your chest and butt continuing to swell bigger and bigger as hands begin to pull at your hair. You try to swat them away, only to then begin to claw at your face as you feel it beginning to shift beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d You manage to choke out as your lips begin to puff up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Jane echoes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sick of seeing you ogle me and everyone else. You\u2019re vapid and shallow, and so i\u2019m giving you what you want. Besides,\u201d Her voice turns dangerously low, \u201cI\u2019ve ready your diary, James.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to tell her that you didn\u2019t mean those things, that that wasn\u2019t the kind of girl you actually wanted, but you don\u2019t think she\u2019s eager to listen to your voice right now. </span></div></div>",

Your skin crawls as they enter, using your body for fuel. They breed within you, multiplying as the change you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin ripples, as they work. Rolling, and tightening, as your body shrinks. The small hairs vanish revealing a smoother pinker flesh behind. Bare of the hint of muscles, it's smoother, and more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be Iris Candice, when you emerge.\" She taunts, \"You'll literally be Ms. I. Candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes appear to evaporate. Instead consumed by the ravenous nanites, using everything available to drive their insatiable drive. The need to convert you to your own fantasy woman, as ordered by Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling a hand into a fist, you see it's futile. A tiny fist, with nails like claws tipped with peachy pink tips. You know she's out to humiliate and degrade you. The hint of the innocent and virginal, the inexperienced. As your body is revealed, you see the changes across your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itching in your legs matching that of your arms, revealing petite feet, leading up slender legs to lush, smooth thighs. Swelling out into impossibly full and firm ass cheeks. A lower body than only science rather than nature can produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are scrawny in comparison. Slender and feminine beyond measure, leading up to narrower shoulders. The changes move towards your torso. A tightening sensation, feeling like an elastic band being wound too tight, .... snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slim hands, darting too late to a new crotch, your manhood now only a memory. You cup and cradle it, afraid to press too deeply to discover its' new sensitivity to reveal that you're truly a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hopes for denial vanish, as you feel your bust develop. As Jane promised, threatened, taunted, you grow and grow. Sliding your hands away from that crotch, you discover those wide, wide hips. Accentuating the tiny waist above, rising higher, your torso remains svelte. But it's the immense, disproportionate bust you've got that makes you a caricature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mane of midnight hair erupts cascading over your shoulders, and tickling it's way down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ticklish sensation passes over you. Not the same itch suggesting changes, but a teasing silken caress. The nanites work to create the perfect panties to cleave to your curves. Looking painted-on, they're delicate and flattering, suitable for the epitome of womanhood. The teasing twitch, sends you onto your toes, as you feel the thong back weave it's way between those sumptuous ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get a chance to settle back, as heels are formed, forcing you to thrust out your ass, to throw forward your bust, displaying both burdens as if proud of your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promised nausea threatens, as the nanite prepare you for the final stage, for your public reveal. Black fabric springs into existence, straining over the width of your hips. Clinging to your bust, barely containing it. The urge to pull the fabric wider, to expose a deeper cleavage, to tug the hem higher and expose more of your legs takes all your effort to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill grips you as the nanites evacuate your body, rising in smoky tendrils back towards the vent in the ceiling their work done, a new beauty crafted for the world of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/7c/84/977c8447313909991ab1681ad4b6ed8e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/7c/84/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door hisses open, and you're revealed in the flesh to an appreciative Jane.</span></div></div>",

The goal already terrifyingly too clear, you hate to check, but brushing the back of your hand across your chin you confirm. It's smooth as a baby's bottom. The hand doing the caressing, just as transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rap of her knuckles against the outside, has you re-orient yourself to where you imagine the front of the machine is... To where the exit will appear that'll end this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your thoughts that are guiding this.\" Jane's voice coming through, dulled by the machine's thick walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you're not going too...\" she draws out your torment, \"too exotic, after a 'Plain Jane'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck by a thought, you hadn't considered <i>'going exotic'</i>, You try and guess if you've changed race. Surely naked and alone, you can tell. But with the light inside, it's hard to tell. There's nothing to compare yourself against. Besides, you've noticed the biggest difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body, now entirely feminine. The swell of your hips, the roundness of your ass are far beyond anything you knew as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder runs down your spine, as you think about, your new pussy. Fingers fluttering nervously, you avoid even accidentally brushing your hands over ... it. Clasping them together, you hold them slightly away from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a losing fight against reality, as you feel your nips tighten, crinkling into diamond hard points. They press against the thin, satin cups of the bra the machine has given you. Even through the bra, and top your 'agitation' is showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spontaneous morning erection was tricky enough to handle, but this is just as weird, just as humiliating. Just as natural?, you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with the machine finished dressing you, you feel more comfortable. Your new body is easier to deny. At the same time, there's an alienness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, it feels foreign as if it's taking you even further from your simple, masculine life. The changes have made you 'exotic'. You recognise it as Arabic. The scarf around your neck, not just a scarf.... It's a hijab, and modesty requires you to hide your beauty, to avoid the temptation being a woman means in a mans' world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you do feel safer, as you play with the idea. Hiding your face, hiding your fear from the world has it's appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not thinking about your new life.... About what you wanted in a woman... It might be different if you are that woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taunts, make you want to squirm. It was the thought running through your mind at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you didn't fantasise of women with lush blow-job lips sealing their perfect, pouting lips around your cock. Leaving that tell-tale smear of lipstick on the shaft of your cock. Well...\" Jane pauses, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll be your lipstick, and your lips now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head in denial, you can't dislodge the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/7b/a1/4b7ba1c6bca2eda8ea9038ef55bbe4b1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/7b/a1/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour agitation making you want to smash your way out of the machine. You remain determined not to give Jane the satisfaction of your futile attempt at escape. As your lips tingle, you feel them swelling larger, plusher.

You don't want to encourage Jane to make things any worse. If she could see, you dread to think what degradation, what feminisation you'd face next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P<i>w</i>ease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word comes almost unbidden.

Those caressing fingers would confirm what your eyes are telling you. The tingling doesn't ease, even restrain yourself. Your arm brushes over your chest, sending shivers of excitement from your nipple, racing up and down your spine. A hunger, an ache in the pit of your stomach springs into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same shiver of excitement coming from your lips too. Just as wired into making you horny as the rest of your body. You try to imagine an ordinary life, even a meal being eaten with lips as sensitive, as erotic as these will reduce you to a quivering wreck of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/f0/dc/1bf0dc02f93922cc4a08f4ab588fd731.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/f0/dc/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands curling into tiny ineffectual fist, you fight back the tears welling in your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Mostly because he was usually the smartest and most level headed of the group. He was currently single and working an entry level administrative job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was the party guy and least sober of the group. He wasn\u2019t opposed to getting drunk or high at almost any time and was kinda known for being the burn out of the group. He loved music however and had great sense of loyalty for his friends. Currently single and working at a music store as a guitar salesmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was the spoiled one. His parents were rich Investors and the only reason Tom even went to public school was he dropped out of private school. He cared about almost nothing except having fun. Sometimes he could come off as an arrogant jerk but deep down he was a good guy. While technically single he always has girls After him and his family money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant was the shyest of the group. He was the smallest as well only being 5\u20196 and was really skinny. He made up for it with his quick wit and sharp tongue however. He didn\u2019t mind proving people wrong and letting you know when something was off. He was single as well although he had been in a long term relationship that recently ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into Newtown Charlie was driving as they headed for the downtown area. The buildings were all nice and the town itself looked really fun. Not too big or small. He noticed many various types of shops and buildings all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much traffic huh?\u201d Grant said from the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah where is everyone?\u201d Tom said looking from his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably headed to the concert!\u201d Rick said with a laugh as he smoked a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie noticed it too. The town seemed empty. All the stores seemed open however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop and get some food.\u201d Charlie said taking the initiative. He parked right out front of a bakery that looked nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte\u2019s Bakery\u201d it said outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone else not getting a signal?\u201d Grant said as he noticed his phone was not getting a signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah me neither....\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither...This down a dead zone?\u201d Rick said tossing away his cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie checked his phone too. Nothing...No signal at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside the bakery Charlie first noticed how amazing it smelled. All the goods behind the counter looked fresh. Cupcakes, donuts, cakes, and pies. All sorts of delicious goodies were available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Charlie called out to no answer. The place was empty. Save the old time jukebox that was playing really old school smooth jazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude where is everyone? There a town meeting?\u201d Grant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this...we should leave.\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChill out guys it\u2019s not a big deal...Besides I\u2019m hungry....ohh....\u201d Rick said before pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the counter was a delicious looking cupcake, red velvet with white frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music from the jukebox suddenly stopped playing as a really old times radio voice announcer suddenly began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome travelers to Newtown! The town where everyone gets to start a wonderful new life! Please feel free to explore the town and chose your new lives! Be careful though you can only choose once! Also don\u2019t try to leave...Have fun and welcome!\u201d The voice suddenly ended as the smooth jazz returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Grant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gotta be a prank let\u2019s head out.\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...I agree. Rick lets go.\u201d Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick however wasn\u2019t listening...Something about that cupcake was calling to him...it was like he needed it....he had to have it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much warning Rick grabbed the cupcake and devoured it rather quickly. Ever bite was amazing to him. It was by far the best cupcake he had ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Charlie asked as everyone yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir words suddenly all fell silent as they all saw something they would never forget...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was changing...his short brown hair was growing rapidly own his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s...what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d Rick called out as his voice cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began to reshape rather quickly. He lost height and weight as his hips began to widen and his butt began to swell. A pair of modest but still full breasts began to erupt from his chest as his body reshaped into a soft and feminine form. His entire body had soon reshaped into that of a very attractive woman. Her clothes also changed. A pair of black pants followed by a white bakers shirt and even a cute white chefs hat appeared on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god Rick! Is that you?\u201d Charlie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot any more! I\u2019m Charlotte now!\u201d She said with an excited voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Grant said confused and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Rick remember who you are!\u201d Tom said called out to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...I do remember being Rick! I also remember growing up as Charlotte. I remember opening this bakery three years ago and I also remember my amazing husband Bobby and our two kids Jason and Cindy at home. I love my life! Please you guys have to join us here in Newtown!\u201d Charlotte said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of here!!\u201d Charlie said leading his remaining friends outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be answers to what just happened. They had to search for answers and try to get their friend back. The problem was they had no idea where to go...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In all honesty, Charlie had some reservations about coming through this town to begin with. First of all, his cellphone didn't immediately recognize the area, though he had initially waived it off as perhaps an oversight on the GPS. The only reason they had decided to stop off here was to make sure they had enough gas and food for the longer trek of the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewtown seemed to be decently sized. Certainly no Los Angeles or New York or anything but not tiny either. It only made him more confused at the lack of information he could figure out about the place. Still, the other members of the party wanted to stop so he went with majority rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, he was scared out of his wits, along with Tom and Grant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lets get back to the car!\" Grant cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we didn't have much gas left,\" Tom reminded him. \"Who knows if we'd make it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't that radio lady say something about not trying to leave?\" Charlie asked, barely containing his own fear just to keep the group together. \"Then again, it might just be a prank....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what we just saw...I don't think we can take that chance..\" Tom said, a hand to his head. \"This....has to be some kind of nightmare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.... There's no way...Rick just changed like that...right?\" Grant spoke up, almost sounding like he was trying to convince himself more than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked back down the street at the bakery. Rick, or rather \"Charlotte\", didn't seem to be pursuing them. \"She\" seemed to just be minding her own business, going about the bakery like anyone else would, which looked all the more bizarre with the lack of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, what was up with that? How could a town look so clean yet deserted? The more Charlie thought about it, the more supernatural it felt like. Not having gas or cell service made it feel like they were stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....we have to remain calm. Otherwise, we'll get nowhere,\" Charlie said. \"Also, we need to be careful. Rick changed after eating that cupcake, so we might need to be weary of anything we see around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no food?\" groaned Grant. He had gone the longest without eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so,\" Charlie confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the trio began moving as a brisk pace, hoping to find something to get them out of here. It wasn't easy though, as all of them kept getting these weird sensations every now and then, like something was beckoning them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like there are ghosts everywhere,\" gulped Tom. \"Like something keeps grabbing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" said Charlie.</span></div></div>",

Look even a box of fresh donuts is left here on the desk....a box of fresh.....sweet...donuts.\u201d Tom began to say almost trance like as his hand went to grab one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Charlie said running over and giving Tom a hard slap across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwww! What the hell?\u201d Tom said being slapped out of his trance like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was obviously a trap dummy...You would have ended up looking like this guy probably.\u201d Grant said showing a photo hung up on a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo was an an older man in a police uniform. early 60s. Balding with a grey mustache and a huge beer belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...\u201d Thank you. Tom said shaking off the feeling. His good looks were something he valued massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...I think I remember seeing a photo of Charlotte at the bakery. Before Ricked turned into her. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until now. I bet you that\u2019s a clue we can use...Be careful of photos...There are probably items associated with those people who\u2019s roles the town will try to get us to Become.\u201d Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking...it\u2019s probably not just food either. We have to be careful what we touch.\u201d Grant added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod this sucks...why did we skip breakfast I\u2019m starving....Damn I could use a drink right now.\u201d Tom said complaining. It was no secret Tom liked to drink, he and rick made it their mission to get drunk on every trip they took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked around and to his surprise actually found a old school landline phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019ve got a phone!\u201d Charlie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautious Charlie used his shirt to pick it up slowly as he heard the dial tone and immediately dialed 911. He heard a ringing on the other end as a sudden automated voice picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for using the Newtown public service. It seems you are currently an unregistered member of Newtown. Please chose your role and return once you become a valuable member of our amazing town!\u201d The auto voice hung up the line as Charlie looked back to Grant and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long do you think we can keep this up?\u201d Grant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno but I\u2019m not giving up yet.\u201d Charlie said trying to keep the hope Alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back out Charlie and Grant soon noticed Tom was missing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell did he go?\u201d Grant yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn him...we have to find him.\u201d Charlie said as they back out to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I see a bar.\u201d Grant pointed out. Knowing Tom loves to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also see a restaurant, he was really hungry too.\u201d Charlie said.</span></div></div>",

Selection seemed super big, lots of games and TV's around, all of which just as empty as the rest of the town. Looked pretty nice actually, kind of like the rest of the town. Amazing how something that looked so nice held such a dark secret, whatever this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Charlie's guess turned out to be right, as they saw Tom behind the bar, his back turned to them as he was clearly putting something together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Charlie cried out, which didn't seem to surprise Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thirsty, dude,\" Tom said as if it was natural, turning around with a half-drunk cup in his hand. \"Gotta say, this is some pretty good stuff. Better than what I've had in a while. You should try the gin and tonic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie and Grant's faces paled instantly. What happened to Rick sped through both of their minds, and this seemed very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot!\" Charlie cried out again. \"Did you already forget what happened with Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the odds of....that.....\" Tom began saying, suddenly putting the mostly done drink down on the counter. Some how, his stomach just seemed to be acting up. \"Ugh...maybe my stomach didn't like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graugh!\" Charlie groaned loudly. \"Did it really drag you in that easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry....it just seemed really tempting, and I really wanted something...\" Tom said, now feeling a little queasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh guys, who could that be?\" Grant pointed at one of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over there, there was a picture of a woman. Very much the trophy wife type. Tanned and beautiful with a dynamite figure and big breasts. The whole works really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like the owner,\" Charlie said. \"Perhaps his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's face paled at the sight of that. A woman who looked like she had all the wealth in the world and loved to show it off. It reminded him of how some people perceived him to be and it disgusted him. Even reminded him of some of the girls he dated who were just after his family's money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no no no no no!\" he cried out, his panic rising. \"That's the worst possible-UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom suddenly doubled over, making Charlie come over and help him up. However, as he grabbed him, he gasped as he saw Tom's hands changing, them becoming much smaller with the nails growing out. The change was continuing from there, his arms beginning to thin and smooth out as his body was becoming smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!\" Tom cried out, looking at his womanly arms. \"No no no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Charlie cried out, not sure what to do. \"We gotta stop this somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?!\" Grant cried back. \"We barely know anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well figure it out!\" Tom cried back, partially from the emotions he was feeling from the changes. \"I don't want to be...this person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom groaned as he felt his hair suddenly growing out, becoming longer and blonder as it was beginning to stream out from his head, touching his ears and neck as it kept on growing. Furthermore, his clothes were rapidly changing, his legs quickly becoming more shown off as his pants were merging with his shirt, becoming tight against his body as the sleeves and top disappeared to show off his collarbone and allow his hair to fully go over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...oh god....oh god....\" Tom was getting more emotional, particularly when he began to feel his chest itching. \"Charlie...help me.....help me please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare to see Tom get emotional, but the guy was practically crying out as what he perceived to be the worst thing was happening to him. Two round orbs began pushing out from the now complete minidress, pushing out more and more with each breath with their tops fully exposed thanks to the dress. Tom kept taking in deep breaths of air, pushing them out more as they were rounding out into large DD-cup breasts.</span></div></div>",

Charlie and Grant could only watch their friend Transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s skin turned a nice deep bronze tan color. The kind of tan one only gets from visiting a tanning salon frequently. His long blonde hair was also turning bleached platinum color like she went to the salon all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoes turned into a pair of white high heeled sandals as his new mini dressed turned into a matching white color to complete his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lifted up the mini dress in horror and saw his underwear was now was lacy white thong as the last vestige of his manhood was slithering away back up inside him as a clearly feminine slit formed in its place....His butt soon swelled and inflated as well as his hips pushed out giving him a total hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final aesthetic changes took place as a fancy diamond ring appeared on his finger. Fancy designer sunglasses appeared on his head. A golden necklace and even golden bracelet  appeared on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was reforming as lipstick and makeup appeared on him as Tom walked over and grabbed Charlie by the shoulders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...help...I can feel my mind...oh god...my...my...husband always works and it\u2019s frustrating! I always look so sexy for him yet he still flirts with his waitresses! No...no this isn\u2019t me!\u201d Tom cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Tommmm.....Miranda! I\u2019m Miranda! Im a former cheerleader who married my high school sweetheart and football captain! He started this bar and we have two boys Zach and Josh! My Husband Bill is such a tool! He flirts with his young waitresses and I know he is banging them on the side! It\u2019s okay though cause I\u2019m also known to seducing young hot men I like....\u201d Miranda said with a sudden seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie pulled Miranda off of him saw Tom was now a 40 year old bimbo housewife named Miranda. A total cougar stuck in an unhappy marriage with her husband and bar owner Bill. She does everything in her power to look and remain as sexy as possible as she knows her best years are behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom you have to snap out of it! Remember who you are!\u201d Grant called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda only chuckled a bit. \u201cI remember who I was just fine Grant. This life though it is filled with drama, betrayal, and backstabbing is mine! I\u2019m the queen of this bar and my neighborhood! All the housewives look to me for leadership!\u201d Miranda said chuckling to herself as she went to the bar and began to finish her drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets get out of here.\u201d Charlie said taking Grant with them as his mission now was to avoid this fate at whatever cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie and Grant let the bar and began to look around for anything else that could help them. The streets of Newtown were filled with more buildings of all types and businesses of every kind.</span></div></div>",

Just like that, both of their friends had fallen victim to this bizarro town, and they were no closer to getting a way out themselves. Stranded in a town that felt like it was out to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now what?\" Grant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Charlie sighed as the two of them kept on walking through the streets. \"I just don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick becoming Charlotte was one thing, but the look on Tom's face as he suddenly shifted into being Miranda was at the front of both of their minds. It sounded like such a horrible thing to be taken over like that. Tom never would have liked that kind of life, despite it ironically being the kind of perception some people had of him. Whatever was causing these transformations seemed to have a pretty big effect on the mental state of the one being changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the only way to avoid it would be to get out obviously, which they were no closer to solving. Every building and kind of business felt like it was tempting in every sense of the word. Charlie could feel it with every step they took, and it was taking all he had to not let his mind wander on any of them. He wasn't sure if Grant was holding up though. The often shy guy wasn't a stranger to being lead around by enticing words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was on that note that Grant stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about there?\" he pointed to a large office building. \"Maybe we can find a better phone in there? At least a computer or something would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, but how would we know that won't change us?\" Charlie asked. \"At this point, we have to wary of everything. Not just food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but wouldn't that basically be doing nothing?\" Grant asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, he kind of had a point there. Nothing would get done if they just walked around. It wasn't like they could walk to whatever town was after Newtown on their trip. That would be hours away by car. Sighing, Charlie realized they had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's go in,\" he gave in to it, following Grant inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked inside, finding it as pristine as the other shops they had been in so far. Immediately, they tried going for the nearby receptionist's desks as they had computers. However, try as they might to turn them on, nothing seemed to be working. On the plus side, at least Charlie didn't feel any changes so perhaps they would be alright there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try another floor,\" he suggested, getting a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them continued to go up floor by floor, exploring just about every section they could. However, they kept on getting the same result each and every time. Eventually, they were getting to the last floor. Grant was honestly pretty frazzled by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay,\" Charlie tried to reassure him. \"We'll find something...and perhaps it'll all be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...though if we get out, what about Rick and Tom?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps once we get out, we can find something,\" Charlie suggested. Honestly, he wasn't sure how realistic any of this was, but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the elevator doors finally opened up to the top floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up on the top floor Charlie and Grant saw the executive offices. All large and reserved for tops heads in this company. Everything from the CEO, Vice President, CFO, treasurer, etc. each office was in a different corner of the room while several smaller desks all lined up the middle of the room. By the looks of things these were meant for the various aides and secretaries working underneath each department head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty Fancy.\u201d Charlie said looking around. He wouldn\u2019t mind working here if situations were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know.\u201d Grant Said walking around. However he suddenly paused when he saw something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the office of the Vice President. The name said Jason Mathews. Curious Grant went inside the office as he saw several pictures of a very handsome and well built guy. He was late 20s by the looks of it, six feet tall at least and in great shape. It seems he was into extreme sports like BASE jumping, sky diving, and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRich entitled asshole...probably the son of the CEO, spends all his time and family money to look good and have fun...probably gets all the women he ever wanted...\u201d Grant muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Grant stopped...His mind had been so hell bent on getting out of this cursed town he never stopped to think of what would happen if maybe he just...embraced it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a Grant saw the obvious trap of Newtown on Jason\u2019s desk. It was a protein bar. Something someone like Jason would obviously eat a lot of. He could even feel the calling to it so he knew it was a trap....or...was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was his destiny? His chance to live a better life, embrace Newtown and be the kind of guy he always wanted to be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Problem was Charlie...He would never agree to turn himself into someone...He has too much pride and self respect...but...what if the choice was made for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant\u2019s wheels began to turn. A villainous plot was forming in his mind. It meant betraying his best friend, dooming him to a life as some girl, a secretary, but in return he would get the life he always wanted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant pocketed the protein bar and went outside and began looking around at the secretaries desks he began to search for pictures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first picture he saw was of the desk closest to the CEO. It said \u201cJessica Samson.\u201d She must be the top and most senior secretary here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant found her photo by her desk and was not disappointed. She was still young. Maybe 30? She had long silky black hair and wore small black glasses. Her skin was tan and she had a great body that obviously she worked out on a lot to maintain. She had large breasts probably D cups. She was wearing a tight black dress and wore plenty of jewelry to show her wealth and status. She wore stiletto heels and her nails were painted her black like her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she certainly was sexy Grant got kind of a bitchy vibe from her. She would be the type of person to always boss others around and do whatever it took to her way. This wasn\u2019t the kind of person Grant wanted Charlie to become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on Grant check out all the desks and was impressed. Most of women there were very sexy and attractive in their desk photos. However one desk made him stop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the desk that was messiest and most unclean. It looked like the person working here just started and had barely any idea what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the cluttered mess Grant found a photo book tucked away as he almost dropped it in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in the photo was stunning....sexier than damn near any girl he had ever seen in real life. She looked like something out of a movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was fiery red, however Grant could tell it was natural and not dyed. It was also super long, it seemed she normally wore it in a long braided ponytail that touched her waist but If let out it would probably reach her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was a creamy smooth white, practically flawless. Her lips were supple and rose red. Her nails long and also painted a deep red color both hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was something of a sex goddess. It seemed to ooze sexuality. She had long toned legs, great hourglass figure, large bubble butt and huge perfect round breasts, they must be at least E cups yet were perfectly framed on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her photo she was wearing a tiny black mini skirt that barely went to mid thigh along with black high heeled sandals at least three inches. She was also wearing a tight low cut red blouse that showed plenty of cleavage as it seemed designed to push up her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant saw something else that interested him...In the photo she was smiling....yet scared...her expression was not that of comfort...unlike all the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis girl is hiding something...\u201d Grant whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to himself he realized that this place was empty...He had free access to all the files he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant was always the brain of his group and new basic hacking and was able to log into one of the executives desktops with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took him a minute before he found the employee files. He searched for the girl he was looking for. Her nameplate said \u201cSarah Rosewood\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRosewood...probably the reason behind her being all color red oriented.\u201d Grant thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant found her file and clicked on it. He found several pictures of her again and it seemed like she was a recent hire, actually it was supposed to be her first day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe file also had a history tab as he clicked on it as his draw suddenly dropped....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the tab was her history and pictures of her years ago. Sarah was also in her early 20s and her picture were her in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a scrawny ginger teen...Freckles....barely any boobs and skinny like a twig. She had big glasses and braces and even played clarinet in band...she was a total awkward nerd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant kept reading as he smiled more and more. It seemed after high school Sarah was in college studying accounting and music when she was in a car accident...drunk driver hit her car and put her into a coma for 3 weeks...she was horrible scared and doctors feared she would never fully recover....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden a miracle...JM Pharmaceuticals shows up and offers her a full entry into their rehabilitation program. It includes, drug treatments, surgery, everything...Sarah\u2019s family is poor and from the Midwest they can\u2019t afford anything so they eagerly accept...However there is a catch...if this treatment works Sarah must commit herself to a job at JM and act as their poster child for successful treatment therapy for a number of years...The family agrees and 6 months later Sarah is reborn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theory worked better than intended...partially because the company went above and beyond fixing her. They gave her breast augmentation, skin treatments, hair growth treatments, surgery to enhance her figure...:they turned her into the sex goddess they wanted to use her as an example...a very exaggerated example of what they can do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Sarah loves her new body but soon realizes the price she paid for it...she now finds herself in the employ of the company who saved her, she is told, how to dress, how to act, and how to behave...she has almost no free Will and the other women don\u2019t like her out of jealousy. She knows she is a sex symbol now but has no real desire to be one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfection...\u201d Grant said exiting the screen as he went to put his plan into motion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant headed for the break room and as he hoped he saw all sorts of food in there, all of it labeled, like most high end offices do. It took some searching but he finally found some yogurt with the label on it saying \u201cSarah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant pulled off the label and put it in his pocket, he took a deep breath before going out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was on another floor going through computers and phones trying anything that would get him contact outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man!\u201d Grant said suddenly calling out from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dude...any luck...?\u201d Charlie asked feeling defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot with getting help but I did find something. Check it out. They had a break room upstairs with food in it. Most of it was labeled and and obviously a trap but in found a couple things that weren\u2019t. No names and nothing means it has to be safe right?\u201d Grand said handing the yogurt to Charlie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno man...I don\u2019t trust anything right now...\u201d Charlie said not wanting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude I get it but we have to keep our strength up...I\u2019m starving aren\u2019t you? I won\u2019t eat anything unless you do okay?\u201d Grant said holding up his protein bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...\u201d Charlie said taking the strawberry yogurt and opening it as he dipped in his fingers and began eating it. Normally Charlie didn\u2019t love yogurt but he was starving and anything tasted good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant only smiled and watched his friend down the whole yogurt in under a minute as he didn\u2019t open his protein bar at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I thought you hungry?\u201d Charlie said finishing up his snack as he saw a strange villainous grin on his friends face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Charlie...But it\u2019s time we face reality...we are both going to live here...we might as well pick lives worth living...\u201d He said showing Charlie the label that said Sarah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was about to curse when all of a sudden a tight pain suddenly hit him right in the stomach as he realized all to late he had been betrayed by his friend...</span></div></div>",

You can enjoy being Sarah, and I can enjoy protecting you.\" He swallowed a bite, and took another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be Jason, the CEO, and then I can protect you from that nasty Jessica Samson.\" he chewed, giving her time to consider it. to appreciate his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed the silence drawing out, Charlie wasn't reacting. Grant made to step towards her, and found himself stuck in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes darting wildly about, he was terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought. His eyes landed on a figure, as she swayed into the room. Her hips wide, and an enticing amount of cleavage on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was incapable of apologising as he recognised Jessica Samson. His most senior secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think I'm a bitch.\" she gave him time to squirm, powerless to answer, to lie, to deny his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/8f/a2/768fa27d0a1e13f60adad8c16300218d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/8f/a2/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, you betray your friend, you doom him... <i>well</i>, her to a life as a trophy, a corporate possession.\" Her words disturbing his hair, making him smell her perfume, \"It's you that's the bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plucked the protein bar, from Grant's limp grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah already has the protection of her lover... and. that's. not. you!\" She tapped Grant on the nose with the wrapper with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it up, inches in front of Grant's frozen open eyes. It filled his field of vision. The name marked on the base 'Mandy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jessica Samson, but you can also call me, Miss Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've chosen your future Mandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back on you, she sauntered casually over to Charlie. Paused mid-transformation, his shirt not yet a blouse, but already a sumptuous bust pushing it forward. A hint of lacy bra strap visible between the gaping buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are safe.\" She nodded towards Grant without looking at him. \"However, Bandy Mandy is another matter. She's slept her way as high as she can... and well, you can't escape a reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned close, as if confiding a secret, \"That's what all the secretaries call her. The 'other' secretaries, and even they don't know how much she loves sucking cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Grant a suggestive wink, as she said the word 'cock'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out an arm, she snapped her fingers in Grant's face. He blinked and stumbled released from his hold... Or rather Mandy was released. Wobbling like a newborn, in her new heels Bandy Mandy struggled to keep her footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/08/17/cf/0817cfd0ab4201bb3c149b1719394e3f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/08/17/cf/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she makes a convincing secretary?\" Miss Chief asked, \"Flaunting her presents.\" She gestured to the expensive jewellery.

Mandy was backing away, new memories allowing her to move with feminine grace, and manage those heels. But she was still struck by the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandy Mandy gasped, a sensual moan, as her bust surged forward. The extra heft bouncing into existence, with a humiliating burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as bad, was the extra straing put on her pants, as her rump expanded to counter the top-heavy look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/09/ca/0b09cad13fd0949c5faf27a3ad8278d5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/09/ca/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, she has more to flaunt.\" Sarah agreed, with vitriol.</span></div></div>",

It made her squirm, pressing her thighs together she tried to crush the doubt and fear. Instead only feeling the lacy panties imprint themselves onto the supple flesh of her inner thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing, timidly from face to face, she looked for support from her friends. Charlie was eyeing her suspiciously, his eyes fixed on her bust. Oddly, it wasn't sexual. He was looking to spot some padding, or other trickery or deceit. For a moment Charlotte doubted herself, a hand wandering south. A brushing pass, smoothing an imaginary wrinkle confirmed she was fully a girl. No trace of manhood was discovered by her swiftly moving hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tom's gaze was sexual. And, it caught Charlotte's quick check. She tried to ignore the sudden awkwardness in his stance. But, as she worked it out, her cheeks started to burn. That was the final clue for Tom, who tried to hide his growing erection. Too clearly a response to her... and her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo aware of her effect on the guys, she couldn't bring herself to even look at Grant. Panic gripped her, as her modest bust surged. Unwilling to stay here and risk further transformation. Charlotte heaved the car door open, and leapt inside. The locks engaged, before any of her friends could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant only now noticing how much she'd grown. Leaving behind those modest dimensions. She was beyond blessed, with over-ripe curves. That even now, thrust upwards, and forwards demanding attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte was stacked and mortified by her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/ab/1d/d5ab1d5c795ea0b6b3a57ea6aa3b791e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/ab/1d/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the key in the ignition, the car roared into life. As much as a fifth-hand station wagon can roar. The radio screaming out, the first bars of 'Poison' by Alice Cooper. It was better maintained and upgraded than the car, or it's engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheels squealed in protest, as she jerked it into gear. Driving for the city limits, as Charlotte tried to flee her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart pounding in her chest, and terrified it was visible to anyone capable of looking into the speeding car. As Charlotte drove it out, reality flickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte was in a pink, open-top convertible. Top down, the radio shifting to 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun', while a generous chunk of pink bubblegum appeared in her mouth. Charlotte chewed on the gum, with every appearance of vacuous bimbo concentration.</span></div></div>",

Panic guiding them to blame the former Rick for guiding Charlotte's new body, behaviours and insecurities. The flash of pink that washed over the boys, came from the direction Charlotte had haired off to, in the car. Their only real hope of escaping town, or of getting far enough away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were uncertainly nodding in agreement, that that wouldn't be their fate. That they had a higher opinion of women.... or a better history with women, or whatever was settling them into their new fates, bodies and roles. The look on each face was a mask of doubt, and shallow hope. Each desperately trying to convince himself, and them that they weren't doomed to be vacuous eye candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in a tight knit group down the street. Each trying to monitor their behaviour for girly mannerisms. A certain sway in his hips, or a skip in his step. Even a certain way of holding their hands as they walked. The three also kept a watchful eye on their friends too. As if afraid of contanimation, or some other risk of catching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, the first store they came to gave them pause. Reaching the open store, with the whistling assistant inside. They look through the wide, tall glass windows to the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stumbled awkwardly to a halt, bumping against one another as they looked in. It was a clothes store with rack upon rack of clothes for sale. The whistler was an attractive woman in her twenties. \"She's pretty.\" Tom observed, before slapping his hand guiltily over his mouth.

Charlie's gaze drifting to see if any breasts were budding beneath that simple T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom caught their worried looks, \"Perhaps, I'm just more honest about my opinion. She is cute.\" He still looked worried about being struck by pink lightning, or punished in some similar manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, not being honest with yourself is the trigger.\" He mused aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought becoming a worry in Grant and Charlie's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't be too cowardly to act... we can't be too...\" Charlie lowered his voice to a whisper, \"...too girly, or that'll guide us to that kind of body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you could be... you both could be wrong.\" Grant said, his eyes darting about, \"Your macho, sexist bullshit sounds like something Rick would've said...\" He turned to Charlie, \"And you're sexism might make you a girly girl... who loves micro-miniskirts, and taking it up the ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom raised a calming hand, detecting the fear whirling out of control behind Grant's eyes.</span></div></div>",

That was only a brief afterthought because your main concern was to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nOf course, there were other parties that occurred throughout your first week, and to your delight you were invited to each and every one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second night in college, you had intended to go to the party, but after you finished your classes and returned to your dorm you found yourself surprisingly beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I must\u2019ve overdid myself at that party last night\u201d you say to yourself before you collapse on the bed.

One thing leads to another, and you get a pretty good idea of where things are going to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing soon stops as she leans up and begins to remove her top. Right as she\u2019s about to pull her top over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeo!\u201d Your dorm-mate wakes you up, \u201cdon\u2019t you have class in ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Paul!\u201d You sleepily yell in frustration and close your eyes trying to return to the dream...before the message Paul conveyed to you slipped in. \u201cOh shoot! Class! How long have I been asleep?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to class and just barely make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\nYou once again finish all your classes for the day, with no further slip ups. During your classes, a girl comes up to you and flirtily says, \u201cI missed you at the party last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I was still exhausted from the first party\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to be at the party tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll be there, then so will I\u201d you say, surprising yourself with how smooth that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiles and responds, \u201cI\u2019ll see you there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege is great, you think to yourself and smile all the way back to your dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get in, you once again get really tired. \u201cWhat?! Where did this come from?!\u201d Each second makes you exponentially more sleepy. \u201cI guess a short nap wouldn\u2019t hurt\u201d you wonder to yourself as you collapse onto the bed. Once again, you immediately fall asleep as soon as you land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nOnce again, you find yourself making out with the girl on the bed. It was just as joyful as the first dream. Once again, she leans back and is about to remove her top when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG BANG BANG comes from her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLEA?! Are you in there with someone?!\u201d Yells a man from the other side of the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn no!\u201d Lea quietly screams, \u201cyou can\u2019t be here! You need to hide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately puts her top back on and climbs off of you. She then grabs your hand and drags you off of the bed and leads you to the second door in her room, \u201chide in here. I\u2019ll collect you when it\u2019s safe. Just Stay In Here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opens the door and pushes you in. And you find yourself in a large(and well lit) walk-in closet. Just as you\u2019re calming down, you hear a click from the door. Lea just locked you in this closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and notice a few things. One, how does a dorm have a closet this large? Two, how is it that the closet allow for all the dresses to be facing outward instead of at their side? It\u2019s like the hangers of this closet were intended of laying out clothes intending to be worn instead of just being efficiently stored. At the end of the closet was another dress hung on the wall with a few extra light to shine a spotlight on them- as though it were the most special dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected to be collected soon. But it felt like hours had passed since you were locked into this woman\u2019s closet. No matter where you looked there were articles her clothes. Trying to look at the floor revealed open shelves of dressers revealing undergarments. The ceiling held racks of jewelry. Everywhere you looked there was more articles of feminine attire.</span></div></div>",

You threw the panties aside. Grabbed your boxers.

The boxers back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stop it!\u201d You yelled. Once again grabbing the boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were prepared to make sure you didn\u2019t get mixed up anymore when there was a knocking at your dorm room, \u201cLeo, are you decent in there?\u201d Your dorm mate asked from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m naked.

Today was your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to class, you stop at the cafe and pick up some coffee- you were on top of the world and you wanted to give this glorious day all you\u2019ve got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeo?!\u201d You heard someone yelling- you thought it was the barista with your coffee, but when you looked up you saw a girl you had seen before but couldn\u2019t place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d You feigned familiarity you avoid awkwardness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Natalie!

I guess I need coffee too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, college is intense\u201d you said in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Here\u2019s a thought!

The coffee here blows anyway, I\u2019ve got better stuff at my apartment, just outside of campus! Plus, what are you going to learn in those classes? Just textbook bullshit- they\u2019re not going to teach you anything about life. Isn\u2019t that why we are born? To live? Let\u2019s live, Leo. Blow off your responsibilities and have some fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you put it like that...\u201d you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick! There\u2019s the shuttle that can get us there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving you a chance to respond, Natalie grabs your hand and pulls you along towards the shuttle. You didn\u2019t even have a chance to grab your coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014you both make it onto the shuttle and sit together in the back of the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Natalie explains, \u201cwe\u2019re going to Elsterbrook Way. We can\u2019t miss it, it\u2019s the last spot on their route and they wait five minutes before circling back around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie then yawns again and then lowers her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt awkward sitting there while she took a nap but you\u2019ve come this far and she really seemed to want to see you. You figured you\u2019d just let her get her rest in, she said she needed coffee after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes on the shuttle the driver yells \u201cElsterbrook Way! Last stop before we turn back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected Natalie to wake up at the sound of her stop, but she was still out cold. You gave her a light nudge, and then shook her shoulder a little bit. \u201cNatalie...we\u2019re here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, she looked almost startled to see you, before her expression shifted to a look of confusion, and then recollection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d She exclaimed- reality settling in. She shot up and you followed her off the shuttle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, I was just having the craziest dream\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been having a bit of that myself,\u201d you confess, \u201cWhat was your dream about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first!\u201d She demands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...ugh...no...

She then hops off the couch and starts talking about the books on her bookshelf. Listing off her favorite books one by one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and that\u2019s why she\u2019s my favorite character of any book ever. She just seemed so sexy, but also rebellious and dignified all at the same time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to read it,\u201d you nod along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, she\u2019s a big inspiration for my own personal sense of style. Whenever I buy clothes a part of my mind would think \u201cis this something Samantha would wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d You feign interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!\u201d She confirms, \u201clike, here, let me show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got really excited seeing her disappear into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m getting a fashion show,\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a second later, Natalie returns to the living room wearing the same thing she had on, but with a handful of clothes in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the spot on the couch next to you and laid the clothes out across the coffee table. She then took each article of clothing and explained how it reminded her of Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd thing she would do with each blouse, skirt, dress, bra, and panties is that- while, at first, she would hold it out to the side so that both of you could see it, she would orbit the article in front of her while she was facing you. Almost as though she was aligning it with you. Though, she was probably just really emotionally invested in the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it about half way through the pile when she said, \u201coh no! I\u2019m boring you aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ease her worries, \u201cno, it\u2019s fine. Really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! I\u2019m boring you, I know it.\u201d She continued, \u201chere I told you to abandon your lectures, only to come here and lecture you about these clothes!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine! Don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d She sternly said, \u201clet me put these up and we\u2019ll do something fun, I swear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered up all the clothes back into her arms and slid past you on the couch, knocking down your backpack in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the collision with the ground, the contents of the backpack spilled out onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get that!\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine! I can get it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I knocked it over, I can clean it up. You stay right there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really assertive about it, so you guiltily let her and you took another sip of your coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she placed the backpack back on the couch. You noticed it looked a bit more full than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d You pondered, \u201chey, where did those clothes you have go? You couldn\u2019t have put them up already...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat clothes?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unzipped the backpack to, sure enough, reveal all the clothes she showed you- overflowing out of the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared slack jawed at the backpack. \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was probably an accident?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I do that?\u201d She asked her self. You began to worry hearing someone else ask these same questions that you had been asking the previous few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie...what was that dream that you had? ...on the shuttle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you concerned and did and scanned your body with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it, Natalie? What did you dream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering you she leapt towards you and started kissing you dragging you by your shirt into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let it happen.\u201d She said, ripping off her blouse and then continuing to pull you deeper into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet what happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began unbuckling your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie, I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore your pants down around your ankles along with what was under them and began working at your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so exciting, Lea!\u201d She said, finishing pulling off your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she stopped, \u201cI just called you Lea, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She looked startled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat has gotten over me?\u201d She sounded startled while continuing to undress and tossing her clothes right next to where your clothes laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie...I need to tell you what you dreamt.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought about how this whole thing began, with Mr. Takahashi and GeneXCorp discussing a significant business move. Mr. Takahashi had been associated with the company for some time, but this was the first time he was making this much a contribution. As one would expect of course, the request didn't come cheap, but it was something the top brass at GeneX were more than willing to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was one of the top scientists involved with what they did, and this particular matter wasn't too unfamiliar to her, even if it required some special work. What they were going to make was going to take a little bit of time, but apparently the top brass weren't too patient, trying to push things along faster. At the very least, she made sure it all happened smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd frankly, she had her eyes on you from the very start. She always kept an eye on any potential people that could work for the products they made and you were no exception. Once the specific request three months ago came in, she had you pegged from the start. Fresh out of college with little work experience and no one who would immediately notice a disappearance. It was all too perfect. All the while, she formulated what her excuse would be for you to not notice anything odd about signing a waiver or getting a shot, and she had just the right idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>In the Mail Room</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped your forehead a bit as you kept on working.

However, as you were going along, you heard a little knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vince Mars,\" you heard a female voice, turning to see a woman in a lab coat right by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am?\" you asked nicely. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be all serious,\" Rachel smiled, bringing him a little closer. \"I just came by to tell you that we need you for something. Particularly with your registration here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked out of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our database is getting updated soon, so we'll need some information for your employee profile. I just need you to come with me to get some things done and then you can get back to your work.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing nothing wrong with that, you agreed to her offer. Hey if it was the law, what could you say really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now, just to get this out of the way, how about you go and sign this now,\" she suggested, putting down a waiver sheet on the table where you were sitting. \"Nothing unusual. No different than signing your name when doing an application.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over it briefly, seeing nothing with it at all, not that you really knew all that better to be fully honest. Something was mentioned about some lab work necessary, but nothing too unusual from what you could tell. With that in mind, you signed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right....there you go,\" you said as you gave it back to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" she smiled. \"Now, if you'll come along with me to the lab, we can get that out of the way too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just for blood work or something?\" you asked as you got up to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. It's basically something all our employees are getting. Pharmaceuticals are no joke you understand,\" Rachel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense to you. You kind of figured something like that would be the case with such a company. With that in mind, you began following Rachel through the building. You honestly hadn't seen much of their lab before to be honest, so this would be quite a treat in addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....\" you said when coming out of the elevator. \"This is huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to for everything we work on,\" Rachel said, taking a slightly roundabout route as to make sure you didn't see anything all that unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you ended up in another room, and were offered a seat. You sat there as Rachel went through all the usual precautions, reading your left arm as you often used that when getting any shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't feel any different from a normal shot. I'm sure you can handle it,\" Rachel smirked a little, making you grin amusingly. Yeah yeah very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, something felt kind of weird about this lab, but you shrugged it off, thinking it was just your imagination. Rachel seemed to be a very well certified doctor so there didn't seem anything to be worried about. Against your notice, Rachel slipped the serum inside, ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we go,\" she said, partially to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading your arm out a bit, you watched as she injected you, making you tense slightly. Yep, definitely like a shot, and kind of tingly as well....and taking a while....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little longer...\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut up after that, letting her do her work. After what seemed like a while, she finally pulled the needle back, allowing you to relax finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew....that took a while,\" you said.</span></div></div>",

It was a really weird tingling sensation that was spreading all over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right...\u201d You said to yourself wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had stepped out for a moment leaving you alone in the lab room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious as to why your body was feeling so strangely when a suddenly you were hit with a sudden wave of discomfort and pain. It felt like your body and insides were in knots and twisting all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching your sides you began to cry out as you were about to call for help when you felt a pulsing sensation in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your hands you saw they were beginning to change. They were popping and shifting around as your eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour normal fairly average pink skin tone was shifting on your hands as the skin color was shifting becoming paler and more of a porcelain white creamy color. The kind found on many Asian models. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands were also shrinking becoming dainty and very feminine looking at your fingernails grew longer into well manicured nails. After a few minutes a pair of very feminine hands were now attached to your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream but your shock wouldn\u2019t allow it. You immediately jumped up and opened the room to go find Rachel and ask her what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise the lab was empty when you stepped out. There was nobody around....anywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be good.\u201d You said worried as you heard a muffled noise coming around the corner down another hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking around the corner you saw Rachel on the phone have a rather suspicious conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir...stage one is complete. The subject is injected and the serum is taking effect. Within a few short minutes he will be fully transformed into the Asian profile you sent us. Once that is done we will take her to processing and wipe her memories and speed up the mental changes so she had no knowledge of her former life and will be ready for transportation to become your new bride....Yes sir...I understand. Don\u2019t worry he is a nobody, no one will care that he is gone. Your new wife will be exactly like you asked.\u201d Rachel said as she heard something around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know you had already bolted...You had heard enough. This was no accident this was a set up! They played like a flute and were planning on turning you into some rich dudes trophy wife! Whatever mad science was at play here at to be exposed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rachel returned to your room she was shocked to discover you weren\u2019t there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...There must have been a delayed release on the serum...\u201d Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was expecting you to be incapacitated from the serum and helpless but it seemed you had a resistance to the serum which was slowing the changes down from a few minutes to a few hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Back in the elevator\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting as you were in the elevator rushing down to the bottom level. You barely managed to get out before you were discovered as you had to get out of here and find help. However where would you go? Who would believe you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elevator reached the bottom level you were in the parking garage looking for your car. You could hear footsteps getting louder as security guards were being dispatched to find you. As you spotted your car you began to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as you ran your felt a familiar pain return this time focused on your feet. You couldn\u2019t see it but your feet were shrinking as you stepped right out of your shoes and socks not stopping to look as you jumped in your car and sped off right before the guards were about to circle you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly drove away breaking about every traffic law there was as you were now barefoot trying to figure out where to go next...</span></div></div>",

Some discomfort was visible on her face, though surprisingly not much panic. True, this probably wouldn't make Mr. Takahashi happy in the slightest, but the die had been cast anyway. Even if you had some kind of lucky resistance to the serum, all it would do is just delay things a little longer. Everything would take hold eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it would make things much better to just get you back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Meanwhile</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you didn't have the police tailing you. Guess you were lucky in that aspect too. Driving barefoot wasn't exactly easy but the adrenaline was pushing you forward anyway. You tried to think of somewhere to go, and admittedly that Rachel person stuck a bit of a nerve when saying no one else would miss you. I mean, it was true that you didn't have any family that was particularly close....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean you had nobody, and the one and only person you could trust with this just so happened to be home at this time of day. Perfect! Julian didn't live too far from where your own apartment was, so you could commute there rather easily. Thanks to his usual work hours, he would be home at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking another left, you made it to the parking lot of his apartment complex, running out as soon as you got the car parked. Again, running barefoot wasn't ideal, especially with the stairs. Still, you had to make do given the craziness of the situation. Making it up to one of the higher floors, you banged on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian! You better be there!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear slow steps coming. Figured that he would take his time. Kind of lazy he was, and he looked appropriately lackadaisical when he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what's with the yelling?\" he said slowly. \"You're not usually the type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can discuss that later!\" you cried out, getting inside and closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now Julian was definitely fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going on!\" you cried back, putting out your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian was about to roll his eyes at how nuts you were acting until he actually laid his eyes on your hands. At that, his glance turned to confusion, seeing long manicured nails and a distinctly different skin tone. Furthermore, was it just him or was that tone expanding beyond your wrists?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.....what is that?\" he asked, pointing that out to you, startling you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no no!\" you cried out, really freaking out now. \"L-Listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began recounting everything from today, from start to current. You told Julian about Rachel, the waiver, the serum, and everything else leading up to where you were now. You even cemented it by showing him your changed and smaller feet, and just like your hands, the creamy porcelain skin was beginning to spread up your calves. As the skin began to spread over your arms and legs, any trace of hair began to disappear, leaving nothing but fair skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....okay, I believe you...somehow,\" Julian gulped, having a hard time believing this himself. \"Okay....and....did any of them follow you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard security guards, and I imagine they're after me right now,\" you said in fear. That actually made Julian pale a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means they might be coming here right now!\" he cried out. In a sense, he was getting caught up in whatever this madness was right now. \"We should leave soon! We have to be anywhere but here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually felt a little guilty. It didn't really occur to you that coming here would involve Julian in this conspiracy too. Still, it sounded better to have company than to fight this alone</span></div></div>",

Given how pressed for time you were, you couldn't risk trying to get stuff from your apartment. Besides, it wouldn't surprise you if they had already gotten to your apartment. Guess you just had to make do, although Julian didn't have much extra to give. He had an old pair of shoes from a while ago to give, which could work a little bit. You subbed out your pants for some of his older shorts as well, if nothing else than to give a better look at your legs for when they changed. Similarly, you changed your shirt out too for a slightly smaller one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think those older clothes would have any use,\" Julian said as he closed his car up. \"I usually just use those for working in around the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it'll do,\" you sighed as you got inside the car alongside Julian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Julian got the car started, and you both were on your way. Even now, it was so bizarre to be thinking about this, like the idea of a company doing such a thing that seemed like it was right out of a comic book. That actually reminded you of how Julian once joked that GeneX sounded like something out of a Marvel comic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, as you got doing, Julian brought that very thing up, even chuckling at his own joke before getting silent at your glare. You didn't mean to be angry in all honesty though. Julian was a guy who often tried to uplift the mood a little even if the joke didn't always land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Julian tried laying out what he could as he drove, thinking as much as he could as he went. It was of course kind of clumsy doing so. Perhaps they could stop somewhere to get a more solid plan but that could wait. He also asked how much cash you had. Luckily for you, you had a decent amount kept on hand for emergencies. Julian had a little as well. It might be enough for a couple days if you were lucky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, you also wanted to get to work on recording. There was a good amount of recording time on the video camera. Should be more than enough to get good evidence. And the timing was perfect as you were beginning to feel more of that creeping feeling on your legs. God it was weird thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fumbling the video slightly, you turned it down to look at your legs. Right there, you could see the creamy color crawling further upwards, shaping your calves as it did and removing any trace of hair along the way. Already it was up to your knees, making you wince at it all. It didn't feel good, it was like something crawling inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....uh.....at least a Japanese girl isn't the worst thing in the world right?\" Julian said sheepishly as he drove through a green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the time for one of your anime girls,\" you huffed back. \"I doubt that's happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that crazy,\" Julian replied. \"Just...trying to lighten things up is all....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that of course, and you weren't mad. One just hoped this little adventure would succeed.</span></div></div>",

What is the status of the subject now?\u201d Takahashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurrently the subject is adapting to the serum mid-transformation. In a matter of hours his body will fully change to match out model. Once that is complete the subject will then begin to slowly experience the mental changes. It will start small with feminine desires and thoughts. However it will grow, the subject will be only able to wear sexy and revealing outfits, she will feel compelled please and obey the dominant male in her life.\u201d Rachel responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...You are telling me she will stick out...A busty Asian beauty in sexy clothes is an easy thing to spot...I\u2019m deploying the bounty hunters....Professionals. They will blend in and look like normal people. They will capture the subject and return her to us. We know where they are going. We tracked his car to a friend of his. After a background check on this friend Julian we found he has a relative in the media. They are likely to try and contact him to expose the serum operation.\u201d Takahashi said with his fists clenched so tight they were turning red...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir...\u201d Rachel said in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou best hope we can track them down...or else it is you that will become HIS next bride.\u201d Takahashi said as he had his guards take her away.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014-At a Gas station\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man you like Cheetos or Fritos?\u201d Julian called out as browsed the sunglasses and hats. Anything to cover yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither...\u201d You replied Honestly You haven\u2019t been hungry since the injection, and for some reason American food didn\u2019t sound very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter loading up on gas and snacks you two back in car as you grabbed the camcorder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere....Take it.......\u201d You said grunting as you suddenly felt another change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax quickly took the camera as you began to cry out. This time the change wasn\u2019t as subtle as before...Your entire body frame was changing as you quickly ripped off your shirt. To examine yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was actually shrinking and thinning out all over. Your 6\u20192 body was shrinking and shrinking until you had lost at least a foot in height. You were barely 5\u20192 now. Also your masculine frame and muscles were vanishing. It was like all the strength you had worked so hard your whole life to acquire was vanishing before you eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally stopped you looked like a prepubescent little boy. It was like you were suddenly a kid again, you hadn\u2019t been this small and thin since middle school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell....tell me you got that....\u201d You said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it....damn....I can\u2019t even imagine I\u2019m sorry man.\u201d Julian said stunned as he put the camera down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief rest period the two of you hit the road again taking off into the distance. </span></div></div>",

Julian suggested finding a motel soon, and there happened to be one not too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your clothes to function took some work. Julian had an extra belt packed and that barely kept your shorts on. Your shirt was pretty much hanging on one shoulder though. Your shoulders were so much thinner now compared to how wide they were before. How short you were now was also stunning, though it seemed like some height was added to your legs, making them longer. Speaking of the changes, you had the video camera on hand as you felt your skin continuing to change. You actually had to discard the shirt for a bit as the creamy skin color completely covered you now from head to toe. This had you dreading whatever was going to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to get you new clothes at this rate,\" Julian sighed. \"But....I'm not sure if our money will cover it, let alone last the rest of the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might just have to skip any stops aside from gas and just keep going,\" you said. \"A day without much food wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" Julian nodded, obviously not liking it as you didn't either. It was a cruddy situation all the same, but it was what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Julian found the motel as advertised, getting off the main roads towards it. All the while, you were slowly snacking though mostly just forcing yourself. None of these snacks tasted good at all, though not horrible if that made any sense. Still, you knew you had to eat through whatever weirdness this body was doing.</span></div></div>",

You had to strip down naked which normally in front of a guy like Julian would have been uncomfortable but considering the circumstances neither of you said anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair started by changing color becoming a pure jet black as it became softer, silkier, and well groomed. It was growing down your body getting longer and longer until it stopped mid way down your body as it touched hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body continued to become more feminine as your hips and hurt began to expand. Your hips widened and your butt swelled turning into a perfect tear drop shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands and arms finished their changing to fit your new body as new long feminine nails were now attached to your dainty hands and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest finally began to swell as you wanted to cry out but nothing at this point was going to help you. Your chest began to rise as a small pair of A cups soon began to form on your chest as your nipples grew and expanded. They continued their rise growing into B cups as they seemed to match your feminine body. They refused to quit however pushing to C cups, now looking like fully developed breasts. You hoped it would end here but they still refused to stop. Another surge sent them into D cups as they were now more than a handful. As you cupped them you felt their increasing weight on your chest. You prayed for the end only to feel one more surge as they finally stopped at full DD cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached this size however They sagged and tugged at your body becoming more of a burden and not looking good compared to the rest of your body. However they did not stay like this for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new huge boobs began to bubble and shift and the flesh underneath was starting to rise. Their shape changed from large saggy tear drops to perfectly rounded spheres. They looked tight and supple, perfectly crafted as they rose and shifted on your chest. When they were finally done you couldn\u2019t actually see your toes anymore as they blocked your vision looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis theme of perfection seemed to echo though out your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face shifted as well becoming perfect formed and feminine. You now had the face and high pitched voice of a young Asian beauty, someone who could easily be a model or on tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final and worst change of all happened before you could realize it. Your manhood slithered and shrunk until it was all gone and replaced by just a perfectly smooth slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body seemed to ripple as the final changes settled into place. Your flawless creamy skin covered your body as not a single hair could be found anywhere on you other than your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done you laid there naked and exhausted. Panting as you tried to catch your breath. Standing up slowly the weight of your new chest caused you to trip over as you looked at yourself shocked and stunned at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked like some kind of Anime girl come to life. One of those exaggerated females with huge boobs and a perfect body. It was clear this form was designed by a man as you had never seen a girl formed this perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian has finished his recording as he brought you a blanket. There were no words right now he could say as to what he just saw. He simply took the tape out of the camera and showed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this...with this we will bring them down.\u201d He said trying to encourage you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped the tears from your eyes and mustered a smile. The best you could. It was difficult to be optimistic at a time life this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted from the change you crawled into bed and fell asleep after what had to be the worst day of your life.</span></div></div>",

Yet, despite all that, you slept like a log, probably because of all that exhaustion. At least it was a temporary reprieve from having to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the morning came all too soon, and the sight of your large breasts in the morning did nothing to comfort. Julian was already up, giving you a small smile and greeting as if trying to maintain some level of normalcy. It was at least appreciated, something you expressed before getting a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, even that was an entirely different experience. Your long black hair made things even more difficult considering you couldn't even see your feet underneath your breasts. Not to mention, your skin was all sensitive, making even the water feel differently. It was just one thing after another, which you sighed and tried to deal with. Not like it had to be perfect anyway. You just did the best you could with what you had and got clean before drying off and putting on your clothes from before, which felt even more ill-fitting now though your large firm breasts ironically held your shirt up better as did your large hips with your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, being like an \"anime girl\" was a fairly apt description. Heck, even your eyes seemed more expressive in that sort of way along with everything else. Sadly not everything was all sunshine like in some of the anime Julian liked to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure as to regarding new clothes,\" Julian said as he gave you some food, which tasted just as unremarkable to you as before. \"Our money will really start to disappear if we go too crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it comes to it, we can just speed through, only stopping for gas,\" you said, inwardly disliking the food. \"The point is to make it to your uncle's house by any means. We can take it easy afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" he said as he began to pack up the stuff they had. \"Well, I suppose we'll have our options. I'm all set to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and assisted in getting ready to leave. The two of you tried your best to ignore the elephant in the room regarding your new appearance, but perhaps it was better that way to maintain sanity.</span></div></div>",

Pretending your breasts weren\u2019t there, even though their weight and presence was more than obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite awhile of silence and uncomfortable awkwardness Julian finally decided to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...Maybe we just get the elephant in the room out of the way.\u201d He said glancing back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a chick now...a ridiculous hot sexy Asian one at that.\u201d Julian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo....what\u2019s your point? You think I\u2019m just gonna fall for you or something? Start giving you road head? Make that cute innocent whimper that anime girls make when they are embarrassed by pleasure?\u201d You said feeling a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No no...I just want to get the obvious out of the way. I meant I feel like if we talk about it, it will be less awkward for the both of us.\u201d Julian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine...honestly...I have been trying to ignore it...The weight of these damn boobs though is killing me. I haven\u2019t even touched them yet.\u201d You said giving your new boobs a sudden firm squeeze just to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAHHH!\u201d You suddenly cried out. Your voice was high pitched as your moan turned to a whimper....A strangely familiar sounding whimper that anime girls make all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bright red so embarrassed....You had no idea the reaction that would come out of you. It was practically involuntary. The second you squeezed your breast a rush of pleasure hit you causing the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust....don\u2019t...just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d You said sinking in your chair bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled together in silence for awhile after that. You didn\u2019t want to think about anything but turning back to normal and getting revenge on GeneXCorp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and the two of you were entering a small town. A simple little town nothing special really. You did notice a small strip small coming up however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we stop please? No offense I really need to change clothes. These really don\u2019t fit and for some reason they have been itching me like crazy recently...\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure just don\u2019t go too crazy.\u201d Julian said as he said he would fill up on gas too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the center you got out of the car and counted your cash. It was enough to get at least one decent outfit. Maybe some girl jeans and a shirt, maybe some flip flops. You thought about a bra and underwear not even knowing where to start....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian\u2019s old clothes had been bothering you a lot recently you needed a normal outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, going off of what you could figure out, you tried heading over to the women's section, which felt weird in and of itself. From there, you could see rows of so many different types of clothes, honestly far more than the men's section. Guess it kind of made sense with the different varieties you saw women wearing on TV and such but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you had little idea on what to go on for underwear, though you did look over the various kinds. You held on to a normal bra and panty set you found, though something in you felt odd about it. Like some kind of eh feeling regarding these items, kind of like how you felt regarding the food earlier. You weren't sure what it meant though, even as the feeling made you put the stuff back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" you asked yourself before your hands happened to land on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a white lacy bra, bit of a push up kind as well as if you'd need one with the breasts you had right now. For some reason though, your eyes just wouldn't leave it, and before you knew it you were also carrying a set of panties to match. You wondered just what in the world was causing that. I mean, the garments did seem nice. The stuff you would likely love to see on a girl if not for the fact that you were one right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as things would have it, you ended up trying the bra on, really clumsily as one would expect. Still, through some work since you figured you'd have to for now, you got it to work, and it surprisingly felt super snug on your breasts. The panties even felt nice too, snugging around your curves and butt. Looking in the mirror, it was bizarre looking at this young beautiful Asian girl and remembering that it was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go along with it, finding some regular clothes got no easier. You tried numerous shirts and jeans, and even a skirt at your own embarrassment. Yet, everything just itched. You wondered just how much time you had spent here making Julian wait on this. Taking this long wasn't going to help your trip much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, your eyes landed on a light blue mini dress, one with a decent amount of cleavage that would also show a lot of leg. On a whim, you decided to try it out, if nothing else than to find a solution and move on. As luck would have it, your body felt fine with it as you slipped it on, the dress really showing your chest and legs as expected. You grumbled to yourself a bit at this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nan demo....\" <sup>Whatever</sup> you grumbled in such a low tone that you didn't really hear what you said. Felt a little strange but what didn't at this point. \"So...just shoes now.....god I hope I don't spend too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, flip flops didn't seem to suit your feet either, making you more than a little antsy. Looking around, you actually found a set of heels along the same color as the dress for a somewhat decent price. Putting the whole ensemble together rounded up to....well a little more than what you had budgeted for. You could afford it for sure, but it might mean having to cut down on some stuff later. Eh, you only needed another day and a half or so to reach Julian's uncle anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you decided to get everything, wearing the clothes out after doing so. The heels felt so weird though, making you kind of regret getting them in the first place. Still, they were the only thing your feet didn't itch in, making you sigh. With that said, you got back to the car, dreading Julian's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.......you uh....\" Julian was speechless, as you figured would probably happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah....it just kind of worked out this way,\" you said as you crossed your arms under your breasts. \"Just felt like the only comfortable thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not going to question it if you think you need it,\" Julian said with a nod. \"I just hope the money holds out.\"</span></div></div>",

Julian\u2019s words cut deep into however...You would really turn into some Asian trophy wife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you noticed however that as you left there was a man sitting in his car taking photos of you...He took multiple photos of you and the car you were in as he sent them in a message simply saying.....\u201dI found them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Say.....\" Julian tried to think of something off the top of his head. 'Um....how do those heels feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best you could come up with?\" you huffed a bit, though inwardly smiling a little. That was Julian in a nutshell; pretty awkward coming with stuff on the fly. \"Very strange. Like walking on sticks or something. I feel like my calves might have been adjusted for them though, as I haven't felt any pain like all those girls at school said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that makes sense,\" Julian nodded. \"I'd imagine nothing is off the table with what these people are doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, and I hate it,\" you groaned. \"I don't get how they made it so only clothes like these don't itch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if a school girl outfit wouldn't itch,\" Julian chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny,\" you inadvertantly puffed your cheeks out cutely, to no one's notice. \"That'd be even more embarrassing. Aren't you supposed to be a little more supportive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sorry,\" Julian said, a hint of a smile still there. \"Just that we...might as well make the best of it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, though you weren't unhappy about it. Julian never could handle things super seriously for long. He was the kind of guy who'd brighten things up if he could. Perhaps that was why you had such a good friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it helped to keep your mind off of how awkward this dress felt. It showed off so much leg, highlighting how long they were despite how short you were. Seriously, you were miniscule compared to Julian now. The breasts were harder to not think about though with how much your vision below was obscured by them. The bra and dress only made that more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour though, you felt something you had been dreading. Nature was calling and you were experiencing first hand why going to the bathroom was more eventful for women. That being that they couldn't hold it for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Julian figured that as well and understood quickly as he got off the main road and towards a small establishment where you could do your business. Perhaps amusingly, you didn't even think about running in those heels. Knowing that you couldn't stand, you did your business sitting down, kind of frustrating having little control over doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was eventually over mercifully, and you got cleaned up and ready to meet up with Julian. He had been looking over some stuff and waved you over as you got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" He smirked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smarta-AHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happened to accidentally trip as you neared Julian, and your momentum took you right in to him, heading you both hurtling towards the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww....\" You groaned, really lamenting wearing heels now. \"How are....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were interrupted by some muffled words. You were about to ask what he said until you realized something....rather embarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts were practically smothering the guy right now. Immediately after noticing, you shrieked a little, getting off him and putting your arms across your breasts to cover them as best you could, face as red as a tomato as Julian got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just....?\" Julian began to ask with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask!\" You cried back, your squeaky voice not carrying much anger in it.</span></div></div>",

What did come out was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem is I\u2019m getting turned on!\u201d You said before you suddenly grabbed your hair and tried to hide your face like a little girl does when she is embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian really didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. He knew this was an awkward situation, he had no idea how awkward is was still going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....I\u2019m just gonna he quiet for awhile...\u201d You said slumping in your seat. At this point you were just thinking how could this get any worse? </span></div></div>",

Given what you had heard of what Rachel said regarding your appearance, it was likely another intentional effect of the transformation. Julian's theory about it forcing you to act differently seemed to be more valid by the minute. Heck even now your cowering reaction seemed so girly. All of it just made you feel worse about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian didn't feel much better about it. He couldn't deny how cute you looked, but his better judgment knew better than to do anything of that sort. This was his best friend of many years after all, and you had even told Julian on a couple of occasions that he was a big help in your life when you had no one else. That was the kind of friend you needed right now, and Julian resolved to keep it that way. He wouldn't hold any of your growing odd mannerisms against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I...\" he began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZRRG!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise rang out, certainly not a natural one which got both of your attentions. You yelped a bit in surprise, while Julian recovered and took a look at his instruments. The car's speed was going down pretty quickly, so he took the next exit off the main road and to a nearby parking lot. The two of you had recently just entered a small town, intending to cut through it on your way forward. Right as Julian turned the car off, it felt like the whole thing just died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?!\" you asked, more than a little startled as you both got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I'll take a look,\" Julian said as he got out. He had some basic car knowledge, enough to at least figure out what might be wrong even if he couldn't fix it himself. \"Hard to tell which one specifically. Might have overheated but I can't tell where. Or maybe it's the oil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....what now?\" you asked, crossing your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever the problem is, I don't have anything to repair it with out here,\" Julian sighed. \"And without phones, we can't just call someone up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was certainly inconvenient. Granted, you knew Julian had good reasons for his actions back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do? Just hang around here?\" you asked. \"We don't have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Julian replied. \"We'll just have to find some way to get going. Either get some other transportation or find a repair shop around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian checked his watch. It was mid-afternoon now. Someone might still be open, but even if they did and started working on the car, neither of you would be going anywhere today. You'd likely be spending the night here at the minimum.</span></div></div>",

An older rather creepy looking old man took the car as you stood outside as to not draw crude stares and attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking in the car Max came outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he said best case scenario is tomorrow morning so we are stuck here until then.\u201d He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat...Small town with a bunch of creeps looking me up and down...\u201d You said not liking this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there is a motel nearby let\u2019s get a room and chill out. Nothing crazy okay?\u201d Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d You said wanting to just avoid this whole craziness for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of you walked to a nearby motel. Once again a rather creepy clerk couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off you as Julia booked you both a room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey only had a single bed. We will have to share but there is going to be a barrier between us.\u201d Julian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement. Honestly just right now all you wanted was to lie down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the room it definitely wasn\u2019t 5 stars but it would at least get the job done. You were about to sit down and get some rest when all of a sudden you saw a spider crawling on your hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEK!\u201d You suddenly shrieked in such a high pitched and over the top girly tone it was practically right out of a cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Julian said before he turned to see you leaping into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was almost involuntary for you. You felt this strong desire to be protected that caused you to leap into Julian\u2019s arms. You were so much lighter now he carried you without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpider!\u201d You said pointing to a tiny little black spider crawling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously....\u201d Julian said squishing it with his boot like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for the two of you to realize the situation you were now in. Jumping into Julian\u2019s arms liked this caused the dress you wearing to hike up all the way as his hands were now cupping your perfect booty as your panties were clearly on display...,Your huge boobs were pushing into his chest and your arms and legs were wrapped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.....uhhh....\u201d Julian said not sure what to do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands suddenly went so wide once you regained control. You weren\u2019t letting go yet mostly out of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh.....\u201d You said terrified of what to do now.</span></div></div>",

Let go, let go, let go!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay!\" Julian cried back, just as started as he eventually got you down, albeit with difficulty thanks to your constant movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as your feet got back on the ground though, you ended up rushing right into the bathroom, long black hair flying behind you thanks to the movement. The door closed with a loud slam, probably enough for anyone to hear. Your heels fell off as you just sat on the toilet seat, legs folded up to your chest. Ugh, even doing this felt so weird with how big your breasts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vince....you alright?\" Julian asked through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come in!\" you ended up crying up. \"I'm too embarrassed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god....\" Julian sighed to himself as he leaned against the wall outside. \"It really is like dealing with an anime girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian wasn't so obsessed with anime that he dreamed about stuff like that, though one couldn't help but think on it out of curiosity sometimes. He always thought the over the top way girls in those shows reacted would be harder than most think to deal with, and this was proving him right. Still, it was kind of adorable in a sense. Heck, he'd find it kind of cute if not for the fact that this was basically his best friend dealing with some bad issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't any easier on your end. You could remember every sensation you felt even when you didn't want too. Julian's hands on your butt could still be felt well after the fact, as was the feeling of your breasts against his chest. Somehow the idea of a nice man holding you in such a protective way felt kind of good. And Julian was a good man. Not an overly strong man, but a good man. Ugh, even everyday thoughts were starting to feel weird. It was like hormone overload or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, things stayed like this for a good half hour or so, just the two of you letting the tension die down after a while. Granted, you didn't feel like leaving the bathroom. Eventually, Julian spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't we actually try to find some food you like? I know you haven't liked much of what we've eaten so far,\" he asked through the door. \"Maybe it could help calm you down, and the sun's about to go down anyway.\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately there was a sushi place not to far off and for the first time in days you felt hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never one for sushi before but this tasted amazing! You even got a second serving. Julian was finally smiling and relaxing a bit as you shoved the food into your mouth just like his anime girls did in those exaggerated scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner the two of you talked and cooled down a bit. No sexual awkwardness or anything. Mostly just chatting about the same stuff you used to as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it got dark you both returned to the motel and sat on the bed together and watched TV. However...It didn\u2019t take long before the closeness and warmth of Julian\u2019s body began to make certain feelings return...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me...I need to use the restroom.\u201d You said standing up and going to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get your cool...You needed to calm down and get your thoughts together. These new emotions and feelings were getting harder to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this body...I have to overcome my fear of it...\u201d You decided standing up with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the mirror you looked at yourself pointing to your own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a female body but this is still MY Body damnit!\u201d You said to yourself. It was like you were trying to intimidate yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am in control here!\u201d You said as you needed to overcome the awkwardness around this body. You smiled thinking of a way to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached behind you and unzipped your dress as you took off your underwear and bra. You stood there standing at your naked body striking a weird looking confident pose that honesty looked really dorky if someone could have seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is MY body!\u201d You said taking in deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had avoided really observing yourself at all since the change. Both out of fear and self control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my hair...It is long but it is mine. This is my face these are my arms and hands.\u201d You said as you touched your body parts in tandem with your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your soft skin and body for the first time was actually kind of a relief. You felt a bit more at peace with yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese..:these are my breasts. They are mine...They are large...perky...and sensitive...\u201d You said cupping them as you gave them a light squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to hold in your moan this time but the pleasure they gave you was still intense as you felt weaker in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched yourself all over except for the the true thing that actually made you a female. You were dreading this as you took in a deep breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...you can do this...This....This....This is my puss.....No! This is my....womanhood? No! Don\u2019t chicken out!\u201d You said giving yourself a little motivation slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...is...my...va...va...vagina....it is mine...\u201d You said smiling in confidence as you reached down and touched it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your immediate shock an incredibly intense feeling of pleasure hit your body so hard and fast you couldn\u2019t contain yourself as you let out a sudden load moan of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-outside\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian was watching TV signing as he was wondering what was taking her so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarely a woman and already eating up the bathroom.\u201d He said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes passed Julian suddenly jumped up as he heard a loud shrieking moan almost squeaking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up out of bed Julian rushes to the bathroom and opened up the door only to pause as his eyes went wide at what he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of your naked body as you were touching yourself displayed right in front of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d He asked shocked and confused. </span></div></div>",

He didn't have much time to recover though, as a towel was soon thrown right in to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-MMMPH!\" he groaned while getting the towel off him, only to get hit with another among some other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERVERT! GET OUT!\" you just yelled some more, throwing whatever you could at him, which wasn't much to be honest since the motel bathroom wasn't exactly stacked. \"I\"M SO EMBARRASSED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could only wonder if people from outside heard all this. If they did, it was probably best to stay away from whatever was going on. You slammed the door shut after throwing everything, still steaming as you leaned against the door, still nude by the way. You had to catch your breath a little bit from the outburst which eventually lead to you sighing and sliding down the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....another reaction.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, you redressed and got out, seeing Julian on the bed. He didn't look offended to be honest. He looked over at you and smirked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down yet?\" he asked snidely. \"That was probably the most cliche reaction yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least Julian was smart enough to know it was likely the transformation doing this as opposed to you wanting to do it. That saved a lot of explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" you sighed, coming back over. \"It's like more reactions like that are coming more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure we can deal with it long enough to get through this,\" he said, before smirking again. \"Thank goodness that bathroom didn't have anything hard in it. I might have gotten bruised otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, for what it was worth, it was kind of cute though,\" he chuckled a little. \"It's like I'm a protagonist....except if I was I'd have a ton of girls like in all the shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" you pushed him a little, getting a little laugh out of the both of you.</span></div></div>",

The mechanic kept saying it looked like someone cut and destroyed certain cables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good.\u201d Julian said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy car was doing fine...The only reason for what he is saying is somebody cut the cables.\u201d Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying....it\u2019s them?\u201d You asked a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be...we need to be cautious. \u201c Julian said as the two of you sat and contemplated your options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed with nothing. You both talked about how to get to New York but with limited funds and no technology it became apparent that traditional methods weren\u2019t an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to step out for some air as Julian needed to think. To shock and surprise you actually saw a huge bus parked at the gas station across the street. What caught your eye was not only the size of the bus but the fact that a beautiful woman in a dress similar to yours was exiting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of you. After a quick walk across the street you made your into the mini mart where you saw two bimbo looking girls arguing over which chips to get. One was a bright platinum blonde the other a redhead. Both wore skimpy mini dresses and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked in however they both immediately took notice of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...like who are you?\u201d The blonde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...I don\u2019t remember seeing before...did the band just pick you up?\u201d The redhead responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to act innocent and cute. \u201cUhh...no...I\u2019m just visiting...who\u2019s bus is that?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls paused for a second before laughing. \u201cReally? You don\u2019t know? That\u2019s the party bus for Electric Phoenix!\u201d The redhead said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name sounded familiar...Then it struck you. Electric Phoenix was a super popular electric music and techno part band right now. Their stuff always played at raves and dance clubs. There were three members of the band if you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the girls arguing with each other as they looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...like normally we never do this. I\u2019m with Jason and she is with Derek, but Mike just dumped his last roady girl. We could see if you want him to bring you along?\u201d The blonde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...roady girl?\u201d You asked a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...a road chick. We get to tour the country and get into the shows for free. We also get you know...\u201d She said winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you guys headed?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we have two stops on the way but we are headed to New York eventually.\u201d One of the girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears immediately perked up as you saw your outing here. A free ride on a huge party bus with a massive popular band. Only problem was...certain things might be expected of you. You would also have to play the role of a dumb hot party babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...let me talk with my friend he is with me.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...a guy...that might be a deal breaker sweetie.\u201d The blonde replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! It\u2019s not like that he is just my friend. We were heading to New York together when our car broke down.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls rolled their eyes a bit but shrugged as you rushed back to Julian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn as fast of words as you could you explained the situation and opportunity to Julian. At first he hated the idea but when he thought about it more he realized it might be their only chance to make it to New York.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize we might on the roads for days before actually landing in New York? You okay with pretending like this for that long even if it means....you know?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...I don\u2019t like this anymore than you but we need a ride and this is our only chance. I\u2019m already having these....urges...I can just give in a little but I will do everything I can to avoid...that.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell fine...I will leave it up to you.\u201d Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the party bus you were gonna have impress this singer Mike if you wanted on, and to bring Julian with you, were you ready for this?</span></div></div>",

You look like your in hiding or something?\u201d Jeff asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa seemed afraid....scared even...Like she was trying to hide something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff...I\u2019m...sorry...I\u2019ve...Ive been lying to you.\u201d Lisa said trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean lying?\u201d Jeff said getting really defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis last week...I have been avoiding you. I told you I was sick...well that\u2019s not exactly true. I mean I was sick...well...am sick but....well.\u201d Lisa said deciding it was best to just show him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off her beanie cap a sudden long flowing mane of platinum blonde hair came cascading down her shoulders all the way to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem with this display is that Lisa has always had short dark brown hair. She barely kept it past her ears before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked to her shocked. Had she been hiding her Femme Flu from him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey diagnosed me a week ago and I stayed away trying to fight it and avoid infecting you...I...I\u2019m sorry I just couldn\u2019t stay away anymore the final changes....They\u2019re coming and I\u2019m scared...can you stay with me?\u201d She asked pleading with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was conflicted....He didn\u2019t want a bimbo this close to him...But his feelings for Lisa couldn\u2019t be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god I\u2019m horny I can\u2019t feel it coming!\u201d Lisa called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff heard a ripping noise as he saw the thin gloves Lisa was wearing were tearing at the tips at bright pink long nails were growing from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took off her coat revealing she was just wearing a sports bra and tight yoga pants with no underwear beneath. She started wearing heels because it felt better nowadays as she was panting and moaning. Small giggles started to come from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike...it\u2019s...it\u2019s happening!\u201d Lisa cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was rippling as her flesh was starting to shift her small B cups were throbbing as her small ass was shifting along with her other assets as the changes were ready to burst forth any second....</span></div></div>",

Some chose to use the roving clouds of infection as an opportunity. Craving the chance to experience the feminine side of life. Others dreaded it, as the most humiliating form of contagion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's double damage on infected men, and the impact it had on born women, meant that some argued that simply being a woman, was a lowering of status. With bimbodom following as a natural consequence. There was a strong swing towards rejecting infected men, as not real women, and a political will to back them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne political fire-brand, had disappeared rather suddenly from the limelight. Only to be discovered by the press after a few months. She'd apparently worried so much about discovery she been careless, and infected a second time. At least, she no longer cared about her sex, or any political opinions. Barbi Braithwaite was a happy bimbo, and oblivious to her own history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, some viewed that as a conspiracy to silence a political view.

But it was undeniably a beautiful country. The people were polite, even if he couldn't understand them. Nor they him. But as his journey was reaching the last day, he returned to his hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the balcony windows open wide, the still air refused to circulate. Even the ceiling fan might as well have been stationary. Lying back on the bed (atop the sheets, naturally) he closed his eyes for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pull of the glass of icy water drew him back from actually sleeping, and he downed the entire tall glass in a few swift gulps. Looking out the window, the clouds suggested rain. Jack turned back to the TV, and flicked through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't understand most of what was being broadcast, but eventually settled on a dubbed episode of Star Trek, the original English was still there, in a vague whisper beneath the Vietnamese actors' voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, Jack blew his nose. He didn't want to stuffed up in this climate. The trip through the red-light district was enlightening, but naturally he didn't indulge in any of the offered services. It was a mix of depressing, the poverty and desperation. But, oddly countered by the general cuteness of what was being offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 6' 2\", Jack was taller than average, but here. He was a Giant! A figure visible through any crowd. It was an effort not to stop his way through the crowds... Feeling like Godzilla. He knew that was Japanese, rather than Vietnamese, but it still felt tempting, around all these petite people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stabbed the button on the remote, finding concentrating on the programme, just too much effort. It wasn't one of the best episodes either, and he knew the ending.</span></div></div>",

Her english was stilted and laced with childish expressions. Having served as an au-pair and nanny before she returned home to tend to her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was knocking back his second beer, when the dizziness hit him hard. Shifting on his bar stool, he felt disconnected from his body. Adjusting, and over-compensating for his shifting balance. He half slipped from the stool. But managed to get his feet beneath him. Rising unsteadily like Bambi, he gave a soothing smile to Kimiko, and gestured to a nearby arm-chair, and gestured with two fingers for a couple more beers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair was well padded and inviting. More falling into it's leathery embrace rather than a controlled descent. Jack figured the heat was making him more vulnerable to the alcohol. A snigger spilled from his lips, at the idea of the tiny people lifting him back to his room like some drunken Gulliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he'd placed his beer on the table beside the chair before slumping into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko elegantly approached with two beers resting on a plate. Concern still on her face. Jack wasn't creating a reassuring image for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing for her to put the beers beside the still half-full glass. He gave her a smile, but his hand crashed awkwardly against the ornate carved edge of the table. Setting the beer sloshing heavily in the glass. Jack had to admit he looked drunk... and felt it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something else... too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head to look up to Kimiko's porcelain face. Again another snigger spilled from his lips. He so rarely had to look up to these petite people.

The first attempt, just bending his elbows to reach his face left his arms falling limply back to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not been this drunk, in a while...\" he rasped to himself. His voice scratchy, and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not drunk...\" A voice told him in awkward, accented English. \"You weren't drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched, as something touched his face, his eyes, the voice giving him no warning, but as water leaked he recognised it as a piece of sponge. Finally, with a couple of gentle swipes the dirt was cleaned from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Jack saw the ceiling of his hotel room. Raising his head from the pillow was too difficult, as his neck strained. It felt as if only his hair shifted, at the microscopic lift he achieved. With a frustrated groan, his head sank back down.
