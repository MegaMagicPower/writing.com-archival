The purple and gold dragon stretched slowly so as not to wake the lovely black and red dragon female beside him. Smiling down at her still snoozing form. Spyro took a moment to look out over the unusual landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been several months since Malifor had been defeated and Spyro still couldn't get over how the land had changed. With the planet nearly having been distroyed, it had taken all the power he could muster to stop it from flying apart. As such, somehow he'd caused the large landmasses that had started pealing off the planet to now hover at varying levels above the ormer surface of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now the pair were resting on a small green island that was floating easilly two hundred yards abouve the surface of the world below. Spyro glanced over the edge of the tiny island and looked at the changed landscape. One sight in particular caught his eye...</span></div></div>",

Something in Spyro urged him to examine it, that it was important somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Cynders still sleeping form and gently nudged her awake. Yawning the black and red dragoness stretched as she awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter Spyro?\" she asked sleepily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cave down there,\" he indicated the one he'd seen, \"I think we should check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder looked at the gas dissipating from the entrance, \"I don't know, that air might be poison. It looks a lot like my poison breath.\" Cynder demonstrated, breaking away from Spyro. The small cloud of her breath attack and the one below were similar, but not quite the same shade of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we won't know until we get down there,\" Spyro shrugged, \"If it is poison, you can just use your wind power to blow it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder wanted to argue for caution some more, but Spyro was eager to explore and had already leaped off the floating island. Sighing, Cynder followed as they swooped down to the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, the entrance was bigger than they expected, easily large enough for two adult dragons to enter side by side, so to the two of them it was quite large. Thankfully the gas also seemed to have dissipated by the time they landed, leaving only a few wisps remaining as they too continued to vanish into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gave a tentative sniff, \"It doesn't smell like poison,\" she mused, \"It doesn't smell like anything I've encountered before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to look into this.\" Spyro smiled and strode forwards. Once again Cynder wanted to protest buy could only sigh and follow him as they entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir powerful dragon eyesight took only moments to adjust to the dim light and once it had they were amazed by what they saw...</span></div></div>",

Spyro could only watch as Cynder seemed to grow fuzzy as if he saw her through a foggy glass. But then the room started to turn fuzzy for Spyro and there was a sensation like being slurped up a long straw and dumped into a mixing bowl. After an uncertain amount of time the sensation that followed was akin to being dumped out with the force of a cannon being shot into a brick wall at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the machinery began to cycle down, the two platforms that had once been occupied by a pair of dragons were now devoid of any sign of them. However on a third nearby platform another figure was stumbling to their feet. Black scaled across their body with golden belly scales and horns, the dragon stumbled a bit in place, blinking a mismatched pair of eyes. The left iris colored a light green the right a soft lavender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyn... Spy...\" The dragon tried to talk but wobbled as a wavering voice went up and down in their throat. Finally the dragon sat down hard and took a few minutes to simply lay there and collect their thoughts. At which point they made a rather shocking discover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both Cynder and Spyros memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock almost drove the dragon to their feet bot again the loss of balance hindered them and they stumbled to the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but how...?\" The voice was more controlled now and less warbling, but still sounded faintly like two voices speaking as one.Searching their mind the dragon found two sets of memories, whole lifetimes worth even. Both Cynder and Spyros minds were joinfd together in one body. One shared body made of both dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had merged together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new dragon, felt worry and concern from both sides and yet as the minutes ticked by they also felt more like a singular being as well. There was a strange overlap. Cynder and Spyro were each part of them, but somewhere in between this new dragon had been created. And, though they were unsure if it was a good idea or not, the first thing they did was give themselves a new name: Spydra. A bit odd but it would do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing they decided to do was to discover more about their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly examining themselves Spydra found that they were a good deal thicker than Spyro or Cynder, a bit taller too. Probably the result of mashing two bodies together into one. All that excess mass had to go somewhere. Perhaps the most shocking and embarrassing though was Spydra discovered they weren't a 'him' or a 'her'. They were both. Below Spydra had an impressive pair of male parts but tucked behind them and below their tailhole was a female vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShi was a herm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" the dual gendered dragon heaved another long sigh, \"This... is freaky. We... I need to figure out what's going on. Maybe there's a way to undo this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpynder then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sets about examining the cave/lab. maybe there's some answers to be found. or maybe they just bump into more machines or chemicals that mutate them further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Leave and go back to the dragon temple. Maybe there's a spell book in the library that can undo this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Embarrassing as it is, perhaps seek help from the Dragon Elders. They might known an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else?</span></div></div>",

Some small part of her was disappointing as she felt her old height gradually approaching. It had been fun to be so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as she grew she noticed something else. Spyros thrusts were becoming weaker and the jets from his member seemed smaller too. Looking down at the still thrusting dragon Cynders eyes widened. The pair were only just then passing the same size, and yet Cynder was continuing to gradually grow while Spyro... seemed to be shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes closed in lust the purple dragon had yet to notice as he worked to get all his pent up fluids out. Cynder found it strangely cute as she watched him dwindle under her and worked her sex with strange ease, milking his member for all it was worth. She actually creamed herself again watching him dwindle under her, the sight was so strangely sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Spyro had finally spent himself, he was nearly as small as Cynder had been just minutes ago.

How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and shushed him gently, placing a clawed finger to his lips that was nearly as thick as his whole arm. \"I don't know,\" she smiled, \"But I'm liking this.

Now it's my turn to be the big, strong protector of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Cynder, this isn't right,\" Spuro gasped even as his member throbbed again under the breath from her nostrils, \"We need to get help. What if this doesn't stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that really be a problem?\" Cynder smiled and nuzzled her tiny dragon mate, \"I can think of so many ways to have fun with this.

The whole city glittered with golden towers of various heights, and wherever it wasn't gold bright silver seemed to shin as trim for archways and the streets between buildings. More impressive it seemed that everywhere he looked various jewels were studded into walls and the sides of the towers. The total effect was the city looked like one gigantic treasure.<br>\r\nSomething was awoken in Spyro then for the first time, the desire all dragons possessed for treasure. Not a form of greed as most beings assumed, but to a dragon treasure was a reflection of strength, and Spyro despite all his strength had never had any treasure in his life (not materialistic anyway). As such his desires drew him to the city, and it took all his willpower to resist for the moment.<br>\r\nA soft snort from Cynder alerted him to her presence again and for a long moment he debated whether to wake her or not. Unfortunately curiosity won out and he told himself he would fly down just to look and maybe bring her back a few jewels as a surprise.<br>\r\nAs he approached though the question came as to how to get inside. The whole city was covered by a great clear dome, and much as Spyro wanted in, he feared breaking it might be very dangerous. Flying around the edges of the city he finally spotted what looked to be a great gate at the base of the dome. Landing before it on the rocky former seabed, he approached cautiously. Such a huge treasure of a city, and yet there appeared to be no guardians in sight. <i>Surely the ones who had built it would have left some form of protection</i>, he mused.<br>\r\nStill, as he managed to claw the doors open and slip inside there was no sign of anyone or any traps in the least. After passing through a second, more intricately carved pair of doors, these opening inwards, he found himself on the main street of the city.<br>\r\nEverything looked so much bigger once inside, the streets could have held three of the Elders walking side by side with room to spare. Spyro wandered deeper and deeper into the city, the air smelling slightly dusty as it tickled his nose. Eventually he came to what looked to be the town square and in the center was poised a great statue of a dragon. The statue itself was gold, but had been covered head to toe in gems carved and placed so intricately it looked as if the creature was covered in scales made of the precious Amethyst stones. What's more there seemed to be some magic in the statue as it seemed to change shape depending on how Spyro looked at it, the features shifting slightly depending on where he stood.<br>\r\nSuddenly his breath caught in his throat as the shape looked all too familiar. The curved horns, the red stones for it's eyes, the dangerous fangs. Spyro would never forget that face.<br>\r\nMalefor.<br>\r\nStill before Spyro could even get over the shock the statue changed again, this time actually seeming to shrink a little and once more Spyro gasped as the statue took on his own features and he finally understood. The statue was somehow showing all the purple dragons of history, from the very first to the last two, him and Malefor. He shook his head, wondering what this could possibly mean.<br>\r\nAgain, before he could dwell on the subject a faint noise cause him to start, and he looked around for the source...</span></div></div>",

That dragon statue!! Its alive!!\" cried Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro switched his gaze back toward the dragon statue he had observed earlier. It had emerged from its perch, resembling the dragon statue back at the temple, looking proud, ancient and powerful, its eyes glowing golden. He figured that he shouldn't be too surprised; if the statue could already change its form to resemble any dragon, then he supposed that it being able to speak telepathically and move. He wondered what he should say to it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...umm.... sorry if we intruded here unannounced,\" apologized Spyro, shifting his gaze downwards, remembering how he had originally intended to go treasure hunting, \"We didn't mean to disturb you or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>On the contrary, I am glad that you two came. In fact, this city would not be here today were it not for your efforts...</i> responded the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... it really wasn't anything really...\" answered Spyro, feeling a bit awkward at the gushing praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place anyhow?\" asked Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue rounded its gaze on Cynder, and its golden gaze seemed to darken for a moment, before it seemed to shift away its gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why, this was once the great city of Vanguard!! Unmatched in its power, its legacy and wisdom. I was the Protector of Vanguard, watching over countless generations of dragons throughout its glorious history!!</i> said the statue, in fond remembrance. A vision flashed in Spyro's mind, as he imagined it filled with dragons and bustling with activity, however, he knew there was a darker part of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never knew about such a place until now. What happened to Vanguard and all the dragons that lived here?\" asked Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Protector's gaze grew dark for moment. <i>It was destroyed, its existance sundered to another dimension, its people likewise exiled... Not only Vanguard but other lands and countless peoples throughout the Dragon Realms during those dark times</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro feared it would be something like that, \"Was it the Dark Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes...</i> said the Protector, <i>However, the individual who brought forth its destruction is the dragoness standing right next to you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro blanched, instinctively switching her gaze toward Cynder, who looked ready to implode with shock and despair. \"I...I...\" she stammered, as if trying to quash a horrifying nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't responsible for what she did back then!! You've definitely have to know that!! She was being controlled by Malefor!!\" he shot back, wings unfurled. Holy Protector or not, he wasn't going to let anyone make these kind of accusations about Cynder. However, he didn't want to unnecearrily anger the Protector either, so he took a deep breath to calm himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for Cynder, I'd never would have been able to defeat the Dark Master... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro...\" said Cynder, holding out a wing, and then stepping forward to confront the Protector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't shirk my responsibility toward what happened to Vanguard, or all the pain and agony I have caused in those days. Nothing can change what has happened, and if the Ancestors decide I should never be forgiven for what I have done and that my name should be cursed for all eternity, so be it. Even so, I shall put for my best effort to atone for what I have done, even if in the end, it proves to be futile, but I have accepting this about myself, and bear it willingly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro stood there gaping with awe at Cynder's resolve. Before, such an accusation would have tormented her and crushed her spiritually, yet now it seemed as if she had accepted who she was and what she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that so then Cynder? I admire your determination, and see that you are sincere in your sentiments.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said earlier, how all the dragons were exiled, just like Vanguard was. Well, the city is back but its inhabitants aren't? Where are they?\" asked Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When the Dark Master's forces came, The Guardians used the City's Portal to transport its inhabitants to another dimension, away from harms way. Though many still died, a good number of the original inhabitants managed to escape through the City's Portal, and afterwards the Guardians sealed them to prevent the Dark Master's forces from following. Thus, the dragons of Vanguard have remained relatively safe, but while the city itself has returned the portal itself remains closed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded. The fate of the dragons had question that had been bugging Spyro for a long time, and the Protector's explanation of the portals was as credible a circumstance as any. He had feared that they had all been killed, as the only dragons Spyro had known in his life had been the Guardians and Cynder, and that having so few dragons in the world would have been fairly lonely. So of course, there was only one thing that could be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want us to reactivate the portal is that right?\" said Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That is correct. I would go so far as to say that you two are the only ones who can... Yet I warn you, it will not be an easy task, and there will be many obstacles and challenges standing before you.</i> said the Protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about the sudden propostion put forth by the Protector. So soon after defeating the Dark Master, he and Cynder were called upon to save the Dragon Realms. After thinking it through for a while, he decided</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sounds fun!!\" said Spyro. He had enjoyed the lull after the defeat of the Dark Master, yet lately he had been growing a little bit bored, and this new task put forth by the Protector could not have come at a better time. Was it going to be easy? Of course not. But then again, no worthwhile adventure was supposed to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder, while not demonstrating the same exuberance as Spyro, was also 100% on board, \"I shall accept this task, to repent for my sins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro grinned nonetheless, knowing that Cynder would be going with him on this quest. He supposed that he kind of missed Sparx buzzing around, making smart-alek comments, however the Dragonfly was spending time back at his home to catch up with his own parents and the other dragonflies, and take care of whatever dragonfly-ish affairs that needed doing. Of course, he knew that there were moments that Sparx could be valuable on such an adventure, but he wasn't going to take the long flight back to the swamps to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I hope that you would explain how it is we re-activate the portal. Of what may lie in store for us in doing so...\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Very well then. When the Guardians sealed the Portal, they did so knowing that one day that the city itself would return from the darkness, but that only worthy individuals would be able to activate them. The journey to find the portals themselves would be a trial in and of itself; designed as a way to prevent just anyone from finding them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then, within each portal, the Guardians created an alternate dimension that is designed to test whoever enters through a series of obstacles, trials and foes... Once these are overcome, only then will the portal be reopened,</i> explained the Protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get what's going on. Find the portal, enter the portal, defeat whatever 'bad guys' are in the portal, and then it'll reactivate the portal,\" said Spyro. It was very practical in Spyro's mind to try and simplify a complex and monumental ordeal as much as possible, as it allowed him to stay focused on the task at hand far more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder huffed, finding Spyro's exuberance a little corny at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but where exactly do we start looking? Vanguard is not exactly a small city,\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's enthusiasm was momentarily stifled at that moment. \"Err...yeah... that could be a bit of a problem there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around, the city seemed to extend as far as the eye could see, as not only were there a seemingly infinite number of buildings, but that the larger ones also had several floors. Even if they limited their search to the buildings that had facilities large enough to house dragons, as after all, for every dragon, there were perhaps 10 times as many moles, cheetahs and other anthros living simultanously within the city, if they tried to search every single one it would be a task that could take days or even weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we can find someone who has a map of the city?\" suggested Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder rolled her eyes, \"Spyro, the city is abandoned!! All the people who would have a map are probably sealed away in that portal!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right... well, there goes that plan...\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protector, could you give us a hint?\" asked Spyro. However, the Protector had returned to its pedastal, not responding to Spyro's question, frozen back to the statue that it once was. He shrugged. He figured that the Protector was leaving the two to try and find that answer for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder gaze Spyro another quizzical look and rolled her eyes. Spyro shrugged, \"Again, it was worth a shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took some more time to think about a plan, and then decided...</span></div></div>",

We should look from the sky. I bet we can find it easier from up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro nodded in agreement, and both dragons took to the air. Their eyes remained sharp as they scouted from the skies. Hundreds of infrastructure passed below them, none looking like anything searching for, but then Spyro cried, \"There it is!\" pointing a claw towards a very large round building, a dome to crown it's head, made out of solid gold, glittering in the sun. From the looks of it, this building did seemed important with all its grandeur, but Cynder was unconvinced that this was the right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, I don't think this is the right building,\" she called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro snorted a puff of smoke in irritation. \"This is the right one,\" he insisted, a slight amount of frustration audible in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder glared at him, but said nothing.

She was still asleep.<br>\r\nIt had been 5 years to the day since He, Cynder and a few others had stopped Malifor from Destroying the Earth. <br>\r\nIt was the 7th time in a row that Spyro had woken up with an Erection. He let his hand stroke the 8 inch purple extention. \"ohhhh.\" he moaned quietly. It felt so good to have that area of him touched like that. A couple of times, Spyro had woken up to find himself masturbating. He suspected that Cynder knew about his urges. She complained that Spyro was moaning in his sleep. Though, Even Cynder had her urges in the middle of the night. He could also hear her moaning in pleasure as she played with her Womanhood. Spyro even helped her once by putting his finger in her once. She squrimed and moaned in absolute pleasure. But she never woke up untill the dream was done.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" spyro said quietly to himself, \"I might as well get some Breakfast.\" Spyro was in one of the Cheata's villages. Though Hunter was still at his colony trying to rebuild. Malifor had caused so much destruction.<br>\r\nSo Spyro got up and Got some breakfast for himself and Cynder, whenever she would wake up. He got back to see that Cynder was masturbating again. Her eyes were closed and she was moaning deeply. He went inside and closed the door to the hut. He decided to wake Cynder.<br>\r\n\"Cynder. Cynder! Wake up. It's time for Breakfast.\"<br>\r\nCynder opened her eyes and saw spyro standing over her. Her hand was inbetween her legs. Spyro was partially exposed, but not fully erect.<br>\r\nCynder blushed and pulled her hand out of herself. The pleasure wave hit her again but she did her best to ignore it.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhmm, hi Spyro. Did you get breakfast for me?\" She said, looking at the bowls.<br>\r\n\"Yes i did. I was waiting for you to get up. and i saw that you were, uhmm, playing a game.\"<br>\r\nCynder blushed once more. this time, she felt the heat of the blush on her face.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah, i guess. well, i think we should eat Breakfast and get started on those repairs again, don't you?\"<br>\r\nSpyro almost forgot about the repairs. \"Yes. I think we should.\"<br>\r\nLittle did Spyro know that Cynder was barren. Cynder knew this truth. Her Ovaries would produce cum, but it was only lubricant. It was put there by Malifor as a punishment, and a Garuntee that Cynder stayed by his side. So in other words, she felt all of the pleasure of intercourse, but she would never, ever fall Gravid. and that is what caused her the most pain. She decided not to tell Spyro that little bit of crushing info. That way, she wouldn't be labeled as a sex toy for spyro, and Spyro wouldn't abuse her like that. Not that Spyro would ever do that to her, but it was still best that he did not know. She and Spyro were dating and have done for several years. Cynder was pretty sure that Spyro was going to propose soon. But she didn't know when, and she was kind of getting tired of waiting. So, she would finish the repairs on the village and then she would ask Spyro to take their relationship one step more serious. not intercourse, she hoped, but at least not so reserved as they have been. So, after the repairs were completed, Cynder and Spyro were absolutely exhausted. They ate dinner together and were just about to fall asleep, when Cynder decided to ask Spyro to take their relationship a bit farther.<br>\r\n\"Spyro?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah Cynder?\"<br>\r\n\"I have been thinking that we should become more than just friends and start dating more seriously.\"<br>\r\nSpyro paused for a few minutes and then replied.<br>\r\n\"Cynder, i have been trying to distance myself from you because puberty on dragons is very difficult to handle. Especieally when you like someone alot. It could lead to having children. And I am not exactly ready to be a father. I mean i feel for you, but most of it is hormones right now. I think that we should keep the love to a minimum untill we have finished puberty.\"<br>\r\nCynder was crushed by his words. She didn't know what to think. She was mad and in love with Spyro, but Spyro was right. Distancing themselves was the best thing to do. Though, she knew that spyro wanted to have her more than anything. Since she couldn't become Gravid (That stil hurt her emotionally.) she thought that she might as well have a bit of 'fun' with Spyro. She waited untill Spyro had fallen asleep to make her move. She silently pulled back the covers from the Purple Dragon. and her hand found the purple dragons Dragonhood. it was exposed and Cynder guessed he was having a sex dream. So, she 'helped' him along. She ran her hand up and down Spyro's Member. Back and forth her hand went. with her other hand, she went between her legs and started rubbing. it felt so good. Once her womanhood was ready and needy and Spyros member was fully extended, and just a little wet, Cynder let her weight fall on top of Spyro's member. She moaned in deep pleasure when her vagina was inflitrated. Spyro moaned in great pleasure as well. Spyro was feeling great and thought it was a dream. But when he opened his eyes, he saw that Cynder was on top of him and his member was inside of her. <br>\r\n\"Cynder!?!? What are you-\"<br>\r\n\"Ssshhhhh...\" Cynder silenced him with a gentle sound and put her hand to his mouth. Both of their heads reached eachother and they started a very passionate kiss. Cynder and Spyro were feeling pure pleasure and were making great love. Spyro started to speed up his motions and Cynder followed suit. They kept on going faster and harder untill they both climaxed.<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOHHHHHHHHH......\" they moaned loudly. their hearts were beating loud and fast. Spyro's member was throbbing with pleasure. Cynder was full of hot goodness. They had made love.<br>\r\n\"Cynder, aren't you going to get pregnant now?\"<br>\r\n\"No, Spyro. I can't fall Gravid. Malifor put a curse on me. I will never bear Children.\"<br>\r\nThe horror of her words hit spyro like a baseball bat. Sure, he could do her anytime, but they would never experience the joy of raising Hatchlings.<br>\r\n\"Cynder? Why did you not tell me this?\"<br>\r\n\"Because, i didn't want to. Please don't get upset. Now you and i can do this all we want.\"<br>\r\n\"But we won't ever have kids.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, i knew this for years, Spyro. And it hurts more than you will know, but i love you and now you and i are going to get through this. We are a team.\"<br>\r\n\"We were a team, even before this, when we beat Malifor. And now, we are a team that loves eachother even more.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Spyro.\"</span></div></div>",

Well, since they had another night here, they didn't want to get out of practice if anything else were to come their way. So, thankfully, Spyro and Cnder convinced the village to keep the training equipment. So, for the whole day, Spyro and Cynder were out training. They practiced elemental moves, slashing, biting, clawing, all of that stuff. (forgot to mention, a couple of Malifors minions are still around.)

Spyro and Cynder looked at eachother.<br>\r\n\"What do we do Spyro?\" Cynder asked in a concerned way.<br>\r\n\"The only thing that i was taught to do, Fight!\" He growled the last word.<br>\r\n\"I am scared Spyro, but we should fight.\"<br>\r\n\"I know you are scared Cynder, but yes, you are right, we should fight. We spent too long repairing this village to see it fall.\" Spyro said. Nudging Cynder Protectively and Lovingly.<br>\r\nSo Spyro and Cynder fought back most of the Grublins from the Chiefs house first, since that was where most of them were. Then, they fought off the Wyverns near the huts and housing. But there was one little problem: There was a shortage of Power and Mana Gems. So Spyro and Cynder were getting tired now. But they kept on fighting and fighting. Biting this one, clawing another, using an enemy to smack another enemy, using all of their elemental powers to kill the Grublins and Wyverns there in the Village. The Grublins and Wyverns may be stupid, but they are persistant. They just kept on comming and comming and comming. From all different directions, they came. It was overwhelming. Then while Spyro was fighting off 12 Grublins and 9 Wyverns at the same time, Cynder was trying to fight off 3 Elite enemies and 25 other enemies. It was just too much for her. She collapsed in exhaustion.<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOO!!!!\" Spyro shouted. \"You are NOT gonna take my girlfriend away!\" He growled menacingly. Then, his skin grew dark, his eyes glowed white with rage, and his body emmitted an eerie blackish purple energy. \"You are gonna pay for what you have done!!!!\" Spyro shouted. Now, Grublins may be stupid, but they can still feel fear. And they were defenately feeling fear right now. Spyro rose into the air and did every single fury attack: Fire, Ice, Earth, Wind, Electricity, Fear, Shadow, and Poison. That created a new type of fury: Hell Rage! <br>\r\nSpyro unleashed all of his power on the enemies. Strangely, it didn't hurt any buildings or any of the allies. But it did disentigrate all of the enemies. <br>\r\nOnce Spyro's power gauge was depleted, he sank back down to the floor. Every one was amazed at Spyro's power. They all Cringed when he walked by. Spyro limped over to Cynder. She wasn't moving or breathing. <br>\r\n\"Oh. no. no no no no no no. This is all of my fault! I should have told her to leave. Then she wouldn't have died!\"<br>\r\nSpyro sobs and cries. All of the warriors in the village gather to make her Funeral. <br>\r\nSpyro stops crying to look at Cynder. Spyro Isn't ready to let her die yet.<br>\r\n\"I won't let you die in Vain Cynder. I will..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spyro started climbing up the giant stone pillar close to the valley river. Cynder was right behind him. Gaining on him, actually. Spyro clenched his teeth and clawed his way up. Finally, he got to the top, panting, but not from climbing the pillar. Spyro and Cynder had spent the whole day training, using the old wooden dummies and fake weapons the Cheetah tribes had lying around. After beating the dummies senseless (and accidentally destroying a few), the two dragons decided to test the limits of their physical strength with a series of brutal exercises, the last of which being the rock climb. While the rock wasn't very tall, the climb was slow and painful. After a whole day of swimming, flying, climbing, and a great deal of other things, both Spyro and Cynder were near-fatally exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haah...haah...haah...\" Spyro panted. He could feel the sweat dripping down off of his face and onto the grass. There was a lot of it, too. Not too long after Spyro had reached the top, Cynder appeared. As she clambered up the last few feet of rock, she dug her claws into the soil atop the pillar and pulled herself up and over the ledge. She only took a few steps before flopping down next to Spyro, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Spyro began, \"Looks like we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder took a minute to get her breath back before responding. \"Yeah...haah...guess we did it,\" she said, faintly smiling. Spyro had managed to stay on his feet, but he had immediately let his head fall down into the grass upon reaching the top of the monolith. Now that he had recovered somewhat, Spyro pulled his head up and looked out over the valley. When he moved, Cynder looked up at him. Spyro's body had definitely matured over the last few years. His scales were slightly thicker, his horns were a little longer, and his body...damn. Spyro's physical condition was unbelievable for a dragon his age. His muscles were wiry yet solid, and his body looked very strong. It was strong. Cynder of all people knew that. As she looked up at him, the sun began to set, casting a red-orange ray of light on Spyro. Cynder just stared. The purple dragon was covered in sweat, his muscles rippling with tension, and the light from the setting sun made Spyro's countenance appear god-like. At least, that's what Cynder saw. She is in love with him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's not all he has to offer, either...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Cynder.\" Spyro's voice managed to break her out of her own trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Oh. What is it, Spyro?\" she asked, half-dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were staring at me again.\" Cynder blushed and looked away. She knew that. Why'd he have to go and point it out like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it,\" she said as she got to her feet. \"Looking out over the valley...into the sunset...makes you look...very stoic,\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoic, huh? Guess I'm getting closer to adulthood if I'm already stoic.\" Both of them laughed at that. \"Heck, I might as well marry you right now!\" Spyro's blood rushed to his face the second the words left his mouth. <i>Why in blazes did I say that? Cynder might just up and take me up on that offer if I'm not careful!</i> His eyes widened as he waited for Cynder's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cynder just laughed. \"Yeah, right. No dice, cowboy!\" Spyro sighed with relief. For a second there, he was almost certain he was a goner. Cynder couldn't help but be tantalized at the thought of marrying Spyro, though. But, as they weren't exactly going to have any children any time soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Spyro said, \"looks like we're just about done here. Wanna head back to the village? It <i>is</i> our last night before we head back to Dragon City.\" Cynder shook herself out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, might as well.\" The two dragons walked over to the edge of the monolith, facing the Cheetah village. Looking down, Spyro began to wonder if his wings would even carry him far enough to land without breaking anything. He needed some red crystals. Luckily, there were quite a few jutting out from the grass near the river. Still, they had to make it down there, first. There was no easy way to do it. The stepping stones that had once leaned up against the mighty stone were now gone, as the village has used them for some of the repairs. The only way to get down now was to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ladies first,\" Spyro said jokingly. Cynder laughed her sparkly yet dark little laugh that Spyro adored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be ready to catch me!\" she chuckled, \"I don't think my wings can carry me out far enough to make a good landing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you fell, I would catch you,\" Spyro said, glancing at her. \"There's no doubt about that. But don't try anything yet. I would use my earth abilities if I could, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're out of mana, I take it?\" Cynder smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not.\" Spyro jumped. It wasn't too much of a surprise. She did have more mana than him, after all. But still, what was she saying, exactly? That was when Cynder used her shadow element to disappear into the monolith. \"Wait, Cynder, what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Cynder leaped out of her pool of shadows and into the air. She really made her way up there before she started to fall back down. \"Catch me, flyboy!\" she exclaimed with a mocking glint in her eyes. Spyro didn't waste any time. He immediately jumped off the edge and flapped his wings. He winced. It hurt, but he wasn't going to let her get hurt. Cynder continued to fall. Spyro gathered up as much strength as he could before he took off, catching her just before she hit the ground. After that, his wings gave out and the two tumbled through the tall grass, laughing as they did. They eventually stopped rolling, but not before they smashed into a red crystal. The crimson gem shattered when the dragons crashed into the side of it, and while it hurt, the fragments began to heal them at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow,\" Spyro said, wincing, \"talk about bad medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was terrible,\" Cynder said, laughing. \"You're right, though. How can something hurt you and heal you at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure tumbling into a red crystal can do that. After all, we are pretty beat up. Which reminds me,\" he said, glaring at her, \"what in blazes were you thinking, jumping off the edge like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see if you had the strength to catch me,\" she said in a matter-of-fact tone. But her expression softened as she looked into his amethyst eyes. \"I'm glad you caught me, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" The sun managed to disappear behind the mountain ridge as the two leaned into each other. After a long kiss, the two started to make their way to village. Seeing all was well, the two young dragons took to their 'lair' and turned in for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, Spyro had another dream. As he opened his eyes...he saw...something. What was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you would, I'd like to use the second option. Don't worry, the 3rd option will appear again later on. I just want to write in a fight scene! Please don't steal option 2.)</span></div></div>",

But luckily, the fight ended as quickly as it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked and surprise, Cynder quickly jumped off the the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so, so sorry,\" she apologised, taking a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame only glared at her and Ember still looked a bit shocked, but they quickly gained there composure. Realising Flame was about to yell at the poor stranger, Ember quickly asked: \"Who are and why did you attack us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder sighed. \"I'm terrible sorry. I didn't mean to attack you, but I was hunting and thought that you where prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon snorted, a black puff of smoke coming from his snout, turning away from the dragoness. Cynder stared curiously at Flame as he stopped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he isn't mad at me,\" the black dragoness said concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, don't you worry; My mate Flame is always such a hothead,\" the pink dragoness said, \"Anyway, My name's Ember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her paw in greetings and Cynder took it, shaking it firmly. \"Please to meet you, Ember. My name is Cynder,\" she said, \"Might I ask you what you are doing around these parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, where heading off to Warfang - the dragon city,\" Ember said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, hate to tell this to you, but you still have quite a distance to go,\" said Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's eyes grew wide. \"I knew it!\" she exclaimed, \"I knew we where going in the wrong direction. Flame, get your tale back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame came lumbering back at the dragonness' call, mumbling under his breath. \"Flame, Cynder says that we where going in the wrong direction. I told you that we should've taken a map.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" the red dragon mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness sighed, saying: \"Great, by the time we reach Warfang, it'll be nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder stared at the dragoness sympathetically. \"You know what, why don't you come to our gave and spend the night there. We don't get a lot of visitors,\" the black dragoness suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber's eyes seemed to light  up. \"That sounds like an excellent idea. Come on, Flame,\" Ember said.</span></div></div>",

She reached down to her aching womenhood, rubbing her swellon lions, wet and warm from the mix of her and Spyro's seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a pleasured sigh, wishing the semen would quicken inside her. She stared at the doorway where Spyro stood outside on the balcony.

After that, he would come back, laying down next to her slumbering form, whispering \"I love you\" while she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder layed against the pillows, feeling how exhausted. She never knew how Spyro could outlast something like this without collapsing. Perhaps it was because he was male. But yet again, she had heard of many males you could not withstand a normale mating process without falling asleep. He was something specail, Cynder reflected. Though it sould be obvious; he was the purple dragon, afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyelids, falling into a half-sleep, thinking of all the things they had in their lives. Yes, things had repaired nicely after the war; Spyro and Cynder where living in complete comfort in the swamp's temple, who had been rebuild with the help of the moles' ingenius architecture skills, restoring the temple to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe later heard Spyro's pawsteps approuching her bed. A small smile spreaded across her face. But just as he climbed on the bed, a sudden knock came on the door. Cynder lifted her head wearely, looking towards the door. 'Now who could be awake this houer,' Cynder thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, i'll get it,\" Spyro assured her.

Malefor had been at long last, completely defeated!! The world was now, evidentally, at peace. That wasn't to say that all evil and all darkness was eraticated, or that there would never be trouble again, however, there would never be another threat such as the one the Dark Master had posed over the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he always did, he watched over Spyro. He felt... overwhelming pride in his heart, but also a measure of regret, because admittedly there was so much he still wanted to share with Spyro, things he had wanted to do together that they couldn't while Malefor was still on the loose, but now he couldn't. For all intensive purposes, Spyro believed Ignitus dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was fine for Ignitus... So long as Spyro was happy, so was Ignitus. Of course, the presence of Cynder undoubtedly contributed to that happiness; since that day Spyro had freed her from the Dark Master's curse he'd known in his heart that they'd end up together. Yet once again, watching Spyro, so happy with her, also made him feel a measure of regret. Ignitus had once known that wonderful feeling that Spyro had now; it was a pain that Ignitus had held in his shattered heart ever since that day... so long ago when Gaul had attacked the old Dragon Temple. It had not gone away even now as the Chronicler; it only meant now his pain was all but eternal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd thought now that he was Chronicler, he would know of what exactly what had happened to her; if she was dead or alive... Yet when he pulled the book with her name... it was blank... It didn't say alive or dead, but a blank, somewhere in the limbo between life and death. It was one of the few loose ends; the fate of his once beloved mate, that still bothered him to this day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus sighed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Katarra.... now, even now... I still don't know what became of you... I suppose on that day way back when, you became something similar to what I am now... a being, neither living nor dead...

May I never fall into Darkness as Malefor has, and when the time comes for me to pass, may my spirit keep the Dark Master entombed in Convexity for all eternity...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarra rose up from her nightly vigil. And like every night, every night since the day she was born, the purple dragoness returned to her room. It was a wonderful room, adorned by soft torches, with a large pool in the center which reflected the moonlight. Besides that was her bed, soft and comfy. It was very much a throne for a queen. Yet for all these luxuries that her life at the Dragon Temple provided, it didn't change the fact it was a prison... And thus, when she was not praying to the Ancestors, or reading texts or scripts, Kata found herself deeply bored. It was not a new feeling for the young dragoness, but it was a frustrating one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish... I had not been born purple...</i> she sighed to herself, staring at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing born purple, it was both a blessing and a curse. She'd studied the scrolls for her entire life; how the purple dragon was born once every ten generations, and had the ability to control all the elements. However, the Dark Master, who currently slept in Convexity, had also been purple.  The Elders feared that if the purple dragon were released to the world, the purple dragon would risk becoming corrupted, and thus fall into the same dark fate as Malefor.  Thus, every purple dragon born since then spent their entire lives sequestered within the Dragon Temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the temple gave her respect, and worshipped her, yet Kata had absolutely no friends at all. Her parents... the moment her egg was laid it had been sent to the Dragon Temple, so who knew who they were? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, she would give a vigil as always. However, it would be a special occassion, as it would celebrate the 2000 anniversary of the Dark Master's imprisonment. She'd heard, that there would be a grand carnival held at the city of Warfang, in which there would be dragons, cheetahs, moles... everyone.  There would be dragons, her age, speaking and talking together, having fun... and while that was happening Kata had to be trapped in the Temple, praying... and feeling lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata had always been curious about what other dragons did, outside the temple, and despite the priests less than flattering portrayal, it only made her that much more curious. However, it wasn't as if the Dragon elders or the priests were ignorant of Kata's curiosity; they'd increased the watch on the entrances this time of year in anticipation that she'd try and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast year, she had been caught while trying to escape. Thus, for the entire year leading up to this 2000 anniversary ceremony, Kata had gone over all the vast archives of the Dragon Temple, researching everything she could think of, just so that finally, this year, she would be able to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year, she had a plan, and even if her plan failed, well, she would try and escape anyhow. Of course, the watch dragons would almost immediately gone, but she had to find a way to make sure they couldn't find her. The easiet way to do that was to blend in, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even before that, there was always surveillence of her room in the form of magical mirrors. Honestly, as a young dragoness, she couldn't describe how violated she often felt at that fact, but it was something she had to deal with. Thus, she had devised an illusion spell for that night upon the magical mirrors, that to the watchers would give the illusion that she was sleeping peacefully on her cot, while in reality she was plotting to escape her guilded prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past few months, she had been gathering red volcanic dust; the droppings of the burnt cinnabar she used for her vigil, and combined with several ingredients she dared not reveal, would form a paste that could cover her entire body. Thus, she would become a red fire dragon, and escape immediate suspicion. Over the next few hours, she thoroughly spread this 'paint' all over her body, missing not a single spot... She stared at her reflection... She'd make a passable Fire Dragon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second part of the plan was to escape the Dragon Temple itself. This required a much more complex use of her abilities. Over the past year, she had taught herself, in secret, how to make herself all but transparent, and thus she could sneak past the watchers. She took a deep breath, right as the moon reached its highest point in the sky, at midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its now or never Kata...\" the purple dragoness told herself, \"If you don't go for it, you'll never get another chance again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe silently made her way from her room. It was quiet... Too quiet. She looked down the hallways, and was surprised to find that all the watch dragons were mysteriously gone... What... what had happened? This was strange, very strange. Maybe... maybe the elders had found out she was going to escape, and prepared a trap for her... It was too late now, too late to turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she noticed a light from down one of the hallways. There were several shadows, speaking in soft, hush voices. Kata recognized the outline of a dragon, and the voice that accompanied it. It was Red, the Guardian of Fire, and was speaking to shadows belonging to figures Kata could not begin to imagine. What was he doing up at this late hour? Why was he speaking to these strange individuals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata shook her head. It hardly mattered now. All that mattered was that she needed to escape and then when she returned from the Festival she'd find out what was going on afterwards. Thus, she made herself to the exit.  Again, there were no guards, but she remained in the shadows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere!! There was the ledge!! And beyond that open sky!! Elated, Katarra made her way to the open air, before taking off into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a wonderful feeling it was to finally spread ones wings!! They had gone so stiff from lack of use, but now she could feel the air against her body as she ascended upwards into the sky, leaving the Dragon Temple behind, finally free to decide what she wanted to do, even if only for a day!! It would be a long flight to make it to Warfang by the morning, but she was so excited that finally she would be free from the Temple and off to see the world!! Finally!! She was free!!</span></div></div>",

In one of them, was a young red dragon, currently asleep, dreaming of the festival that was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the city, the bells rang, celebrating the commencement of the festival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignitus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Ignitus!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young red dragon groggily shifted in his bed. He rose from his cot, smoke billowing from his nostrils as he yawned. Suddenly, a blast of light invaded into the room, as Ignitus' eyes snapped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!! I hate it when you do that!!\" moaned Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' mother, Firaga, blew out a plumb of smoke, gazing fiercely and crossly at her oversleeping son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think I had to hear you talking all night about how you were going to attend the opening ceremony. I bet you were so excited you didn't go to bed until way past midnight now did you?\" she snapped, in her typically nagging tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Ignitus hazily, \"Wait a sec, what time is it anyhow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say it is less than three hours before noon in fact...\" said Firaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors!! I slept in!!\" cried Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a surprise...\" answered Firaga. Of course, Ignitus' mother could have easily woken her son up earlier, but that was not the way she had raised her son. Ignitus' father had left her not soon after he hatched, leaving Firaga alone to raise him herself. Thus, she had to be even tougher and more deciplined than your average mother dragon was. Yet at the same time, because Ignitus was the center of her entire life, she adored her son, and was a kind and caring dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Firaga decided to take the moment and wrap her wings around her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? What was that for?\" asked Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I felt like it... That's all. You've become a very handsome dragon Ignitus,\" said Firaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could only imagine how understandably awkward Ignitus felt at having her mother compliment him like that. \"Er... thanks mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can find a pretty young dragoness to take to the carnival this time,\" added Firaga for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say mom...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus didn't consider himself particularly good looking, or exceptional really in any shape or form, rather that he was generally well liked amongst the other dragons his age. As for dragonesses, well, he never really felt the need to push himself hard, and that wasn't to say there weren't pretty dragonesses flying around, it was just that... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow Ignitus,\" said Firaga, \"Volteer left you a note while you were still asleep,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus grabbed the note, careful not to rip it with his claws. Volteer was Ignitus' old friend from hatchlinghood, and though all the others considered Volteer a nerd, which he largely was, Ignitus always felt inclined to defend the strange, overly-talkative Lightning Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes... yes... yes... I would have especially expected that you would take the time to oversleep. In any particular case, Uncle Jolt, Gunther and I shall be waiting for you with the greatest expectation at Ironscale Square. As for the ceremony, you should not worry one bit, as I will inform you what exactly went on. In any case, we've completed our most ingenious invention yet!! We're going to have our grand demonstration exactly ten O' clock, so do well to arrive promptly!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten O' Clock...\" said Ignitus, \"But that's only... Fifteen minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Great Dragons Above!!\" cried Ignitus. He rushed toward the exit, giving a brief goodbye to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that on this day, Ignitus' life was about to change forever...</span></div></div>",

Little had that dragon known, was that day, on the 2000th anniversary of the Dark Master's imprisonment, his life would be irreversably changed forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then switched toward Kata's book, and could not help but find it amusing at how simultaneously thrilled, curious, confused and somewhat frightened she had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall correctly, a group of Earth Dragons were the first dragons her age that Kata had ever first met outside the temple, and I seem to recall that you rather rude to her Terrador...\" Ignitus recalled with some amusement. \"One must endlessly wonder how things might have gone had she decided to desguise herself as an Earth Dragon rather than a Fire Dragon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata had flown throughout the night to reach the city of Warfang, without a single moment to rest. She figured that she would be tired by now, especially having never flown this long or so far her entire life, however, when she saw the huge stone structures of Warfang, all her exhaustion vanished in an instant, replaced by excitement, ancticipation not to mention a little anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she was struck by just how many dragons were flying around. Dragons were not the smallest creatures around, obviously, yet that only served to emphasize just how immence the city of Warfang truly was. She would undoubtedly get lost on her own... So she would have to ask someone. However, there was a problem, as while she had read countless lore and practiced hours upon hours on her ability, she was all but clueless concerning how to socialize with other dragons her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kata... you've come this far... It can't be too hard...\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly took a moment to clutch the large gem on her lucky bracelet, praying to the Ancestors that things would go well this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she spotted a small group of Earth Dragons swoop by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... hey!! Wait!!\" she called out, reaching out with a claw, flying up to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth Dragons stopped in midflight, turning around and giving her a strange look. All of them were males, around her age, and as Earth Dragons were, they possessed large, bulky frames and rather intimidating facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest of these young Earth Dragons, who looked to be the leader of them, came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Fire Dragoness?\" he growled with a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata recoiled at the bluntness of the Earth Dragon's response. She had never been addressed so rudely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I was wondering if you knew which way the fair was...\" Kata asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you not know where the fair is? Has your family been keeping you in a cave all your life or something?\" the Earth Dragon grunted. Now that she thought about it, it was obvious, as she only had to follow the huge throng of dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right, I knew that... but... um.... do you think I could come with the rest of you?\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth Dragons began discussing amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors are you blind? We can't take you, you're a Fire Dragon!! Everyone knows that Fire Dragons and Earth Dragons don't hang out together,\" growled the leader. \"Besides, if we're seen with you, we'd look pretty bad won't we guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Earth Dragons nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Kata could do was turn away in dissappointment. She wondered if she had tried to desguise herself as an Earth Dragon, if these dragons would have been friendlier. No doubt they would have been. However, she also realized there was also a great deal of profound ignorance on her part in socializing. She let out a sigh. Perhaps it would just be better to observe the ceremony at a distance... Because as the Purple Dragoness, she was destined to live a life separate from all the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus she flew aimlessly about the city, simply observing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ignitus was late, really, really late. He needed to get to the square and fast, or else he'd let down his Volteer. Briefly, Ignitus wondered how Volteer had managed to convince him to help partake in their latest inventions. Most likely, there would be some type of malfunction and literally explode in his face as it always did whenever Ignitus was dumb enough to volunteer to try out Volteer's inventions, but he'd already agreed to come, so as a friend, it would be the honest thing to do. Thus, he swept between the buildings, intent on reaching his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so focused that he didn't notice until the very last moment there was another dragon right in his path. Ignitus' eyes grew wide as he violently veered to the right at the last second, avoiding the dragon, however, he couldn't stop from crashing right into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Merde!!\" cried a mole in dismay at the pile of crushed wood that had been his shop, \"My precious merchandise iz ruined!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" said Ignitus, feeling woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mole simply threw up his hands, before digging underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus tried to push to get back onto his feet, attempting to shake himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... are you okay?\" said a sweet sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus curved his face in the direction of the voice, and froze in surprise when he was a young Fire dragoness only a foot away from his face. For a few moments, all he could do was lost himself into those stunning magenta eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By the Ancestors... she's gorgeous...</i> thought Ignitus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus blinked a couple of times and he forced himself to snap out of his stupor. Mom always said that it was rude to stare at dragonesses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah... I guess I'm all right... Sorry about that. Guess I wasn't watching where I was going,\" said Ignitus sheepishly. It was fortunate that he already had red scales, or else she would have seen his deep blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. Really, it was my fault too,\" the dragoness answered. Ignitus exhaled in relief. Most Fire Dragonesses would have hissed and berate him for his clumsiness, mom would have, but fortunately she didn't seem angry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire Dragoness reached for her neck in what seemed to be an instinctive fashion, and then let unfurled her wings as she let out a high pitched yelp. Her head began to look frantically on the ground as she cried, \"By the Ancestors!! My pendant! I lost my pendant! Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Ignitus, a bit inquiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...its my lucky pendant!! And... and....\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus thought about it for a moment. Of course, his first instinct was to want to help her out, but that would take time, as after all he had agreed to take part in Volteer's experiment, and while he wouldn't be completely dismayed, he would be somewhat dissappointed. It was quite a dilemma.</span></div></div>",

Of course he was going to help her find her pendant! It was the right thing to do of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Ignitus found himself searching the ground on his belly, keeping his gaze focused for anything shiny. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a sparkle nearby the pile of wood that had been the mole's shop. He reached into the rubble and pulled it out. It was a beautiful bracelet, made of the purest platinum, dyed red to match the dragoness' color. In the center was a intricately carved gem. At first, he thought it was a ruby, but upon examining it with his claws he realized it was worth far more, perhaps more than his families belongings put together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Ignitus, being the chivalrous young dragon that he was, did not hesitatte for a moment to give it back to the young dragoness. Her eyes grew wide and she let out a gasp of relief as she snatched it from Ignitus and held it close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pendant!! Thank you so much!! It has a lot of sentimental value to me!!\" she cried. \"Um... if you don't mind could you help me put it back on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' heart skipped a beat, \"Sure!!\" he cried. He hoped that he didn't look overeager, or that she didn't get the wrong idea as he made his way behind her and gently clipped the chain back around her neck. She purred with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!!\" said the dragoness, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime,\" answered Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm just curious, why were you in such a hurry anyhow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' eyes grew wide. He had almost forgotten. He prepared to take off once more, but before he could do so, was stopped by her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. I'd agreed to help one of my friends with something in the square,\" said Ignitus. He really did feel sorry at having to end their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I can come with you then...\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm running really late...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait!!\" she insisted, more desperately and pleading this time. Ignitus stopped in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not from around here, and I've been pretty lost so far, and... and you were really nice to me giving me back my pendant, so... I was wondering if you could show me around the city,\" said the dragoness.</span></div></div>",

I suppose it was because while all the other dragons picked on you when we were hatchlings, I didn't really see the fun in it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could have only imagined how quickly the red dragon's resolve melted under her sweet request as his jaw curled into a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Its good to have company anyhow,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarra squealed with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!! You're a real gentleman!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet, we've still got to go to the square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I don't think I've introduced myself yet. I'm Ignitus,\" said the Fire Dragon, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarra froze for a moment. If she told him her name, then there was a chance that he would know she was the purple dragon, and then... well, she thought he wouldn't act as nice to her anymore. But then again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I'm Kata...\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus tilted his head sideways, \"Kata... that's a pretty strange name for a fire Dragon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors, Kata's a nice name!!\" said Ignitus, seeming to panic momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, you said that you were headed to the square or something like that... You said you had to help a friend?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah... We're probably way late now, but I did promise that I'd be there for Volteer,\" said Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been my friend since I was a hatchling. Anyhow, you'll met him in a sec...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata followed Ignitus between a series of buildings, being careful not to bump into anybody this time, until reaching a large courtyard. A small crowd of moles, cheetahs and other mammalian anthros that Kata had only read about but had never seen in person had gathered around the square, as had a few curious dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as they toughed down, there was a powerful burst. The pair stopped as several pieces of metal, screws and bolts went flying in all directions, while the crowd fled from the scene faster than Ignitus could say 'Ancestors'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there goes their invention...\" said Ignitus, staring at the billowing smoke. Kata could only nod nervously, perching herself behind Ignitus. What type of strange dragons did Ignitus have for friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, two thunder dragons with their bodies covered completely in black soot emerged from the wreckage. The pair wore two identical pixieglass goggles over their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Ancestors!! Our Revolutionary Portal Deluxe 9000 seems to have malfunctioned!!\" said the younger of the two Thunder Dragons, not sounding all too upset at all. \"And, after all our checks and modifications!! Dear me I suppose I wasn't thorough enough I suppose?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...well nephew, that's the risk one takes when striving to become a great inventor!! It is the failures one goes through that makes the triumph all the more breathtaking!!\" said the older thunder dragon, with a resigned grin on his jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...did we come at a bad time?\" said Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older dragon, curved his gaze toward Ignitus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why!! Not at all Ignitus!! In fact, you arrived right on time!!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most definitely!!\" said the younger dragon, \"You see, the audience just bore witness the largest explosion ever produced by one of our inventions malfunctions!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Thunder Dragon shifted his gaze toward Kata, \"By the way, may I so possibly inquire who your new friend is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus stared blankly for a moment, before shifting his head in surprise as if just realizing she had been watching the odd scene unfurl the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!! Yes... well...er...\" he stammered, seeming flustered. \"This is Kata... We just... happened to bump into each other, that's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never actually been to Warfang before. Ignitus was nice enough to show me around the city,\" said Kata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" said Ignitus. \"Well of course I did!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the older dragon, \"I suppose I can't hold that against him now can we? Now then, I'm Jolt, the greatest inventor Warfang has seen yet!! And this is my nephew Volteer!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed!!\" said Volteer affirmatively, \"Or rather we would have been had our revolutionary invention not short circuited at the moment!! For you see, we strove to create a revolutionary new device, one that if successful, would be able to teleport any dragon, or mole, or cheetah or faun or whomever, instantaneously to the other side of the machine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portal!! Those two were indeed far more ambitious than she thought. Then again, one had to be rather mad to attempt to create something so revolutionary. She could only gaze in wonder as Volteer described in great, intricate detail how the machine worked. She never would have learned of something like that back in the temple, and though she hardly understood any of the scientific terms she came away impressed at the dragon's ingenuity and intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata shifted her gaze back to the wreckage, and she just had to ask... \"So...what went wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a mole clad in a blackened lab coat jumped out of the wreckage, his thick glasses askew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell, it vas really zimple you ze?\" he said with an exaggerated Franco-Germanic accent, \"Ven I vent to turn on ze machine, I suppose I accidentally pressed ze self-destruct button!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, I do not seem to recall there being a self-destruct button as part of the blueprints,\" said Volteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you're telling me you actually installed a self-destruct button on the machine?\" said Ignitus, struggling not to laugh out loud. \"And goggle eyes pressed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goggle-eyes?\" said Kata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it is merely the nickname Ignitus has bestowed upon my foster brother Gunther,\" said Volteer, \"He is truly a prodigy I must say!! However he always seems to make these rather trivial errors that sabotage all our experiments!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like pressing the self-destruct button instead of the on switch?\" chortled Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near-sighted mole waddled forward toward the group. \"Indeed!! It zeems that I did press ze self destruct button!! A slight miscalculation on my part, however, an aspiring genius such as myzelf shall never be fazed by zeese mere setbacks, for I shall be ze greatest inventor of all time!! Zen, ze world shall know me as 'ZE PROFESSOR!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right....\" said Ignitus dismissively at the eccentric mole, \"Whatever you say goggle-eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer, his Uncle Jolt, and his adopted brother Gunther the mole. They were an eccentric lot any way you looked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't mind speaking up, but how long do you think it'll take to repair the invention?\" asked Kata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based upon my intricate calculations I estimate it will take exactly four hours, twenty-six minutes and forty two seconds to repair the machine back to operational status,\" said Jolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKata had trouble seeing how the three would manage to put back a complicated machine back into operating condition from a pile of wrecked metal and parts in four hours, but then again, perhaps that had something to do with being master inventors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the implausibility didn't seem to faze them at all, \"And then, you shall witness an invention unlike any other!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus meanwhile cheered inwardly. The three could take all the time they wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Author's note: Gunther the Mole is supposed to be the same character that appears in the original Spyro series; 'The Professor', an old, near-sighted mole inventor who first appears in Ripto's Rage, when he summons Spyro to Avalar from the Dragon Realms to stop Ripto.

Inside Ember's castle, which stood outside the great city of Warfang, the deafening thunder was muffled by the thick stone walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way down the dark corridor, holding a candle firmly in her right hand to light her way, Ember held a large black book under her left arm. Tonight was the night. The pink dragoness was finally going to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor months she had been plagued by odd dreams, dreams where she was a well-built, busty dragoness with a large member and swollen testicles, penetrating the swollen lips of other busty dragonesses. She would plow them roughly before waking up, finding her own neither regions wet from arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was losing sleep, and dark rings were forming under her eyes. It was the last night that something like this would happen to her. Now, dressed in her white night gown, she was making her way to her small library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she would search and find the spell she wanted in the black book she carried under her arm. Ember made it to her library, smacked the black book on a nearby table, and began to leaf through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped when she finally found it, and Ember began to read the words. While she did this, the pink dragoness felt a tingling sensation at her crotch, and a bulge appeared underneath her gown, pushing it to the point where it looked like a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ember finished, she lifted her gown and beheld her new cock. It was as pink as her scales, shaped like a spade at the tip. It was stiff from arousal, and Ember couldn't wait to try it out.</span></div></div>",

Adjusting the belt of his loincloth so that it rode a little lower, the well-endowed black dragon sniffed and grinned smugly as he reached his destination. Two grumblings holding spears standing guard at a thick wooden door watched him approach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up!\" he ordered, his voice smooth and arrogant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently they did as he commanded, unlocking and shoving it for him. His grin growing wider, he eyed the figure in the room. The naked, petite yellow dragoness was sitting on the bed, looking startled by the sudden intrusion. For a moment he saw a flash of fear in her eyes, but she quickly hid it behind a wall of defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding her arms, she pouted and looked away, determined not to give him what he wanted. He couldn't help but chuckle, knowing that she was only putting on a brave was for the other Guardians' sake. He knew she was very scared and could be broken in easily. Though, he had to admit, she looked cute trying to act tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, come now, Electra,\" he said coyly, licking his lips, examining the curves of her body with increasing arousal, his cock hardening, the tip pushing against the flap of his loincloth, \"Work with me, not against me. Give me what I want and I'll set you free, how does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectra snorted. \"Go to the Well of Souls, you diabolical vermin of our home world!\" she exclaimed, \"I'll never in a thousand years give you what you seek! Never, Cinder, never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder only smiled, amused by how stoic she pretended to be. \"I believe you have no choice, dear,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked closer, placing a clawed hand on her trembling shoulder while the other ran its index finger over a pearly white collar. It was a special artifact given by Cinder's master. It stripped the wearer of whatever elemental powers the had, and could be used as a mind control device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder knew she was completely at his mercy, and from the way her brave face dropped he knew Electra knew this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm offering you a chance,\" he said, running his large hand down and up her back in a almost comforting fashion, \"Do this willingly, and you'll might enjoy it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for several moment. Cinder watched Electra's expression turn thoughtful. She was timid, he knew, but she was far from stupid. She would take the offer, if she knew what was good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" she finally said, turning to him, \"What is my fist task that I should perform for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder grinned. \"Wise choice,\" he said, \"I was thinking that we should take this slowly. As much as I like to please my, I want to get to know my captives better as well. Perhaps some oral would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you the most civilized being in the realm,\" Electra said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone the less, she got to her knees in front of Cinder. Lifting away the flap of his loincloth, Electra eyed his erect, throbbing penis with growing awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, incredible, unbelievable!\" she exclaimed, genuinely fascinated, her hand running down his length, \"You reproductive tool's size is ample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder murred in pleasure. He liked it when someone acknowledged his size, especially when it came to his privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" he said, enjoying Electra's praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly he gave a jolt of surprise when he felt his ball sacks being squeezed hard. \"And this!\" she said, squeezing his large testicles, \"This size should also be impossible for a dragon to achieve, even for a dragon with your testosterone level. I suspect Dark Aether is the cause of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to give me a blowjob or not?\" Cinder said impatiently. \"Seize, has anyone told you you tal waaay too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Electra said, \"I got carried away. The size of your groin did truly surprise me. And yes, they do say a speak far too much, especially that bombastic old hag Cyrilix. But I think she's just jealous that my vocabulary spans for more than hers. Last time she froze my maw shut just because I giving a subtle explanation about gems and giving a little more information than necessary. Why, I couldn't eat my favorite berries for a week, so numb was my to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what,\" Cinder said through clenched teeth, cutting her off again, fighting his growing frustration, \"let's forget about the oral play and skip to the main course. We've wasted enough time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectra shrugged. \"Whatever you say,\" she said, \"I'm the captive here; you have absolute, undeniable control over me. Your wish is my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, just get up on the bed!\" Cinder snapped, \"Ass in the air, tail out of the way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as he asked, for ones remaining quite, which Cinder was grateful for. Electra lifted her rear end high and tail up in the air, and he brandished his large cock, walking to her, licking his lips, sliding his shaft into her plump folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardian of Electricity moaned as Cinder began to thrust, in and out, in and out, his cock glistening with her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, proceed to increase your thrusts to a very high velocity!\" she exclaimed in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder wasn't sure what she was saying at that moment, but he guessed she was telling him to go faster. He didn't need telling twice. He moved his hips faster and faster, bending over and groping her breasts, playing with her aurolas. The sound of skin slapping against skin, mixed with moans from both Cinder and Electra, filled the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his climax approaching fast, and by the way her walls of her vagina clenched around his shaft it was obvious that she was too. He straitened himself, and with three hard thrusts, he came, and at that exact moment so did Electra. Cum spurted from her vagina, soaking Cinder's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the climax continued, the black dragon filling up her womb to the brim and inflating her belly a little from his massive amount of semen, enjoying every second of the climax, he felt a new sensation course through his body. He felt tingly all over, a cold chill moving up his spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something claw its way up his throat, and he sighed, a puff of yellow mist leaving his mouth. Cinder grinned triumphantly. He had sampled her element. He pulled his member out of her womanhood, and more cum came rushing out, forming a puddle on the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Electra. She was panting, clutching the cum-stained sheets of her bed. Her tongue was lolling out of her mouth, her eyelids drooping. She was truly fucked silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, sweet cheeks,\" he said, slapping her ass hard, causing Electra to yelp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the chamber, the grumblings locking the door behind him. Adjusting his loincloth, Cinder made his way down the hallways of his dark castle, grinning smugly to himself. One down, three more to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cinder could feel that there was something wrong, for the temperatures were dropping steadily as he descended lower into his dark castle. The smug grin he wore only moments ago was replaced by a very serious, frowning face, and his brisk, confident strides grew cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder's castle wasn't a very warm building, for it was breezy and cold in some areas, but there wasn't a place that where the temperatures were so low that it felt like you stepped inside a refrigerator. Something very suspicious was going on. The black dragon was on his guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he descended the last few steps, his breath beginning to steam in the cold air, he saw, to his alarm, that the door to her room, and a few feet of floor surrounding, was frozen. The grumblings that stood guard were turned into statues of ice. Their eyes darted frantically around as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon grit his teeth in annoyance. \"You lot are completely useless,\" Cinder growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir faces twitch oddly under the ice as they tried to give him a sheepish grin. Cinder snorted. He'd get to punishing them later for their incompetence. Right now he had more urgent matters to attend to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the handle of the doorknob, he tried to open the door. It wouldn't budge. Cursing, Cinder put more force into the door, chips of ice raining down on him due to his effort. Using his shoulder, he gave one mighty push and the door burst open. But as he came stumbling into the room, he felt his feet lose grip on the floor. With a cry of surprise, he fell to the ground with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Cinder groaned, sitting up, rubbing his sore head and back tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around himself to figure out why he fell, and what he found shocked him. The floor was completely frozen. In fact, the whole room was frozen! The bed, the walls, the furniture, the curtains. There was even, for some reason, little flakes of snow drifting from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time!\" he heard someone say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the dragoness that was the cause of all this. She was blue, tall, curvy and naked. She breathed out a small stream of ice, which formed into a perfect shape of a rose in her hand. She placed it into a vase that had others that looked very similar to the one that she just made. Smiling, she did a few more adjustments to the ice-flowers before turning to Cinder, her hands on her hips, scowling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how long I've waited for you?\" she said angrily, \"I've been demanding all day to see you! But no, I've been stuck in this wretched room all day, which was far too hot for me! I had to make a few improvements of my own! I know your evil, but you could at least make it a little bit more hospitable for me! Need I remind you that my blood has royalty coursing through it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be grateful,\" Cinder mumbled, grabbing a nearby table for support and pulling himself up, \"I could have thrown you into the dungeons, Cyrilix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrilix snorted a cloud of ice. \"A dungeon would have been better than this lousy room,\" she said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me,\" said Cinder calmly at first before his voice grew louder with every word he spoke, \"how the hell do you have access to your powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible. The necklace she wore stripped it away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrilix shrugged. \"Dunno,\" she said, \"I guess it must be broken or something. I can still use my powers to a certain extent. Just too bad it isn't any more broken or else I would have left a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder growled in annoyance to himself. Now he knew what was going on. He could remember that one of the many enchanted necklaces he had were faulty. The black dragon wanted it destroyed, but somehow it managed to make its way to Cyrilix. He was going to kill the minion that was in charge of handing them out. It nearly allowed one of his captives he worked so hard to capture to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that thought aside, Cinder's grinned his usual smug grin. \"You said that you had been waiting for me?\" he said, \"Are you that eager to have me sample your element.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his biceps and his hand made its way down between his legs, where he fondled his rapidly hardening penis. Cyrilix looked at him with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" she exclaimed, \"Never in my life would I want you for that filthy reason! No, I wanted to know what you did to the rest of my comrades, especially Electra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder raised an eyebrow. \"Electra?\" he said, \"You're concerned about her? Last when I visited her she called you a bombastic old hag. It doesn't sound that there's a very warm relationship going on between the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did visit her first,\" said Cyrilix accusingly, \"Shouldn't surprise me. You wicked always go after the weak and small. And yes, Electra and I do get into fights often, but ten spite that we do have a good relationship between us. I almost regard her as a younger sister. So, you better not have harmed her or so help me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax!\" Cinder cut in, \"I was gentle. I'm fact, she allowed me to sample her element willingly, and she liked it quite a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" he continued, grinning again, \"I'm going to offer you the same thing that I offered Electra: do this willingly and enjoy it along with me, or let me sample your element by force. Either way, I get what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Cinder's cock was fully erect, pressing against the flap of his loincloth, his balls churning with seed. Cyrilix folded her arms across her breasts, squashing them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said defiantly, \"You think that you might had your luck in with Electra, but I'm a much harder nut to crack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder's grin grew wider. \"O really?\" he said, raising his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe extended his index finger and began to flex it several times. The necklace around Cyrilix's began to glow faintly, and she felt a overwhelming sensation to walk towards Cinder. Next thing the blue dragoness knew, she was in his muscular arms. Cyrilix found herself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne large hand was squeezing her left breast while the other grouped her rear. Her boobs were larger than Electra's, but her ass was smaller. She was nearly as tall as him, and he gazed deeply at her with his poisonous green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you have no choice,\" Cinder whispered, his toned dripping with lust, \"You're stubborn and brave. I like that. But you need to be reminded that I'm the one in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrilix frowned, snorting again and blasting a mist if ice in his face, but she didn't say anything. She felt his right hand move away from her rear, sliding across her skin, traveling between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now,\" Cinder said, \"I don't like it when people are unwilling. It sucks the fun out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her face turn even more red as he began to play with the folds of her vagina, his fingers running over her clit and her juices trickling down his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eager,\" he said, his muzzle an inch away from her's, \"Why are we fighting this? You want me, I want you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder kissed her. He expected her to flinch by his sudden movement, but to his surprise she kissed back, her tongue making his way into his mouth. After a few moments they broke apart, gasping for air. No longer was Cyrilix defiant and arrogant. Now she was grinning at him mischievously, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to sample my element?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice,\" said Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should make the most out of it then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrilix's hand gripped his penis and began to stroke it, which sent jolts of bliss through Cinder's body. He stood there for a while, watching her give him a hand job, becoming increasingly aware of the cold. The black dragon began to shiver and Cyrilix noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold?\" she asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess s-so,\" Cinder said, his teeth chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised,\" she said, \"You lot are great lovers of tropical weather, understanding nothing about how true cold feel. Anyway, do you want to climb into bed? It might be warmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was indeed warmer, but only a little though. The cold was making Cinder's skin incredibly sensitive. Cyrilix climbed on top of him, pressing her ass against his throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my element?\" she whispered, raising her rear end and positioning her womanhood above his cock, \"Then take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned loudly along with Cyrilix as he felt his cock enter her cunt. She bounced up and down, his penis sliding in and out of her vagina, covered in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're *Huff* big,\" she said, panting, \"Has anyone *Huff* ever told you *Huff* so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Cinder said, panting as well, fondling Cyrilix's large breasts, \"Electra *Huff* did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments of intense riding, Cinder could feel his climax approaching fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to cum, I'm going to cum,\" he heard Cyrilix mutter above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bouncing began to intensify, the walls of her womanhood clenching around his member tightly. It was enough to send him over the edge. The both roared as they climax, Cinder shooting a large amount of seed into Cyrilix's wombs, so much that her belly, like Electra's, began to inflate a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that tingly sensation again, a shiver running up his spin. Cinder opened his mouth and breathed out a blue mist. Cyrilix didn't notice this. She was lying on his chest, panting, hugging his muscular frame. He had a feeling that she wanted after-sex cuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he couldn't do that. He was freezing and had other things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, hot stuff,\" Cinder said, giving her a quick kiss on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooted her off and left the room, Cyrilix watching him leave with a disappointed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two down, two more to go,\" Cinder thought to himself, rubbing his arms to gain heat as he made his way down the hallway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many strange changes await them in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 'do anything' story. Feel free to play around with it. Cynder and Spyro can either be the age they were at the end of the game, adolescents, or full adults. HOWEVER, if they have kids keep the number minimal to keep things from getting confusing, no more than one or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, other characters may be featured from the games such as the Elders or Hunter's tribe. HOWEVER, /if/ they are to be used they are to be treated with a certain amount of respect. The Elder dragons can have some changes effect them too (weight gain, inflation, etc), Hunters tribe on the other hand is to be largely excluded from such things. An original tribe member may be used for inflation, weight gain, and the rest, but Hunter himself and the tribe leaders are to be left out due to the extreme 'Out of Character' state they would be in then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while it's preferred Sparx be left out of most of the stories, he may be used if need be. (I found him annoying, so sue me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's the basic run down of DON'Ts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No excessive violence save in action scenes.<br>\r\n- No gory sights (blood may be used for injuries, but no characters are to be graphically killed)<br>\r\n- No popping<br>\r\n- No bringing back already dead characters (Malifor and the others villains are dead, so no sudden resurrections of them without good cause)<br>\r\n- All transformations and alterations must have a good explanation, no 'OMG tehy gain 10,000,000 lbs' chapters will be allowed.<br>\r\n- Keep it within the Spyro universe. Preferably the Dawn of the Dragon trilogy and not Skylanders. I won't crack down hard on Skylanders stuff, but I would like to dissuade it since (contrary to popular belief) not everyone can afford to buy thousands of little characters to play all the possible creatures in the game. (Plus I find Spyro and Cynders redesigns for it simply hideous.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I reserve the right to delete any chapters I feel inadequate to the story and more of a distraction/waste of space than actually reading material.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone, so read, write, be creative, and enjoy.</td>",
