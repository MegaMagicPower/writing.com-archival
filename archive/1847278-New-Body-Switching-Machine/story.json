Within the confines of your two car garage, on the side with the broken door, rests a massive, metallic machine. In the center is a terminal, and on either side is a large metal pod, with a locking door, a bench inside and even simplified control panels for activation from within. In the center, beneath the terminal is a metal door which hides the machine's core, which can be removed to either disable the machine, or bring its powers on the go for a short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's finally complete- You've created a body switching machine of your very own. Humans are no longer limited to one body in their lifetime. You can experience life from a variety of different shapes! At least... That's how it's intended to work. You haven't actually tested it on any humans yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're exhausted. It's been a long night. As anxious as you are to test out your new machine, you need to get some rest. In the morning, you'll run a proper test, and then move the machine to a more secure location where no one will tamper with it. You're so tired that you forget to cover the machine with a tarp before you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the first person to get to the machine the next day?</span></div></div>",

It's been at least two nights since you actually slept and you have a little catching up to do. When you wake up, it's nearly four o'clock. You take a shower, get some food, and return to your laboratory to decide on the next step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic sets in when you get to the garage and see that you left the machine uncovered last night. Everything seems relatively undisturbed, so you just hope no one messed with anything before you got here. It would be heartbreaking if your siblings screwed something up, or stole the first test run from you after all of your hard work. Even worse, what if Dad found the machine and decided to end your experiment before it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's car was gone, though. You opened a pod, and sat on the bench, racking your brain to figure out who you could test the machine out on. Mom was home, and would probably love to help out. You could hear your sister upstairs. She always proved to be a valuable lab rat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of lab rats, it would be very interesting to transplant your mind into an animal. You could switch with Jake, the family's dog. You're careful with this thought, though. If you become a dog, you'll lose opposable thumbs, motor skills and the ability to communicate with human beings. You can't count on Jake to switch back when you're ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you switch with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

According the the laws of the universe you reside in, sitting there inevitably meant you were going to be using it soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light drains from the pod. sensation returns to your limbs, or the limbs you now possessed, and you step forth into the sunlit garage. You don't have a mirror on hand, so you just glance down. This is definitely the body of a woman, but you're not sure who. You don't feel old, but you're wearing a long skirt and a very clearly, carefully chosen outfit. You see your body emerge from the other pod, and after quickly glancing over itself, crosses its arms and smiles at you. \"Who are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so rude, Luke,\" says a voice from behind you. It's your brother, Kyle. Which means, the body you're inhabiting must be Robin, Kyle's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you switch with me, Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" your body says, \"I'm not Robin. You left this thing right out in the open. We got to the machine way before you woke up. Props, Lu'. Good work.\" Your brother, in Robin's body, was the one who jumped in the other pod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, haha.\" Kyle's pranks never amused you. It pissed you off that he was always messing with your stuff. \"Now hop back in, and let's get everyone right back where we belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother's arms wrapped around your stomach from behind. You screamed eek, like a girl. \"Come on, Luke, Robin said in your ear, as gently as she could with a man's voice, \"You built a machine that can do this, and you're not the least bit adventurous? Come spend the day with us. You'll have fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just... Don't forget your purse.\"  Kyle and Robin snicker, and head for your brother's car. Robin's purse is on the ground, so you pick it up. You feel ridiculous carrying a purse, but it looks normal to the rest of the world. Plus you need something to carry the portable core of the machine. No pockets in the skirt, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you expected, Kyle spends the day mocking you. His impersonation of you is... probably more spot on than you'd ever admit. Robin's getting a good laugh, too. A socially awkward boy in the body of a well groomed woman is apparently a hilarious, and adorable, combination. She treats you like a girlfriend, and repeatedly forces you to act more girly, using  the sanctity of her reputation as a guilt trip. While at the mall, she even forces you to try on clothes. Wearing a skirt down to your ankles no longer felt awkward after wearing bikinis, short shorts, mini skirts, prom dresses, and even a few Halloween costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, Robin and Kyle enter the men's room together, leaving you with a moment to yourself. You regret coming with these two to the mall. If you were going to go for the girl experience, you at least wanted to have the freedom to experiment on your own without two hecklers aware of your true gender. Reaching into Robin's purse, you confirm that the machine core is still with you and functional.</span></div></div>",

I was actually hoping you would say that. Prodigy or not, Making a child my partner is a very sticky situation. Legally, and as far as others would see it. The press would have a field day, and I don't know that my employees would show you the respect you deserve.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"I've spent a day in this body. I can understand why this guy was so desperate to get out. There's not much left for me in my old life anyways. You're right. It would just get in the way. Can you find me some people who may be willing to switch bodies with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald puts his hand on your shoulder, \"I hope you're not upset, but I already took the liberty of it. People are far more willing to believe anything when you have the kind of money I do.\" He winked at you, and then paged his secretary to send in the first candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person walked in, and it was a woman. You exchange a glance with your new boss, and he smirks, and whispers in your ear. \"As a man, the first thing I'd want to switch with would be the other half. Am I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands firmly in front of you, unamused by the comments. The woman is wearing a dress suit, with glasses, and has her hair up in a bun. Her black pantyhose seem to shine in the sunlight. She looks to be about 35, and is in excellent shape for her age. \"My name is Clair Palmer. I just recently quit my job. I'm not married, I'm not close to my family, and I have few friends.\" She glares through her glasses at you. \"I'm a clean slate, perfect for starting a brand new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you interested in switching bodies with me, Ms. Palmer? Money?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs. \"Though, I expect to be thoroughly compensated for taking on that body that you clearly have left to waste, it's sexist clowns like you that have driven me to despise my life as a woman. My sex does not mean a thing to me, yet I've been forced to endure sexism in the workplace, and on the streets. I have no interest in starting over as a woman. With hard work and proper care, even that body of yours can be raised to my qualifications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp leans to you. \"She's feisty. I hope you'll make that face of hers a bit more... Agreeable, no? What do you say? Want to switch with her?</span></div></div>",

Of course I made sure to tie up all of my loose ends before trading in my body. Didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope you don't take on any of this girl's attitude when you switch with her. She's insufferable. The two of you climb into the pods of the machine, and Mr. Tramp activates it, causing you to swap. For a moment, you think something went wrong, but that was just the sound of a little stress on the machine. That body was too much weight for it. The swap works perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stand up, you feel as if you could leap to the moon. You're so light, and physically fit. Though this is the body of a 35 year old woman, you feel like you're in the best shape out of all five of the lives you've experienced in the fast 24 hours. Even more than yourself or Robin! You throw a few punches in mid air, and impress yourself. She's strong, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize just how large the bodysnatcher's body had been, because you had never seen it from the outside, but it loomed over you, now with Clair inside of it. \"Certainly, you've never felt like that, given that you were always stuffing your face with fast food.\" Clair braces, and catches you off guard by slamming you with rolls of fat. You're knocked back, having no experience balancing on high heeled shoes and fall on your butt, breaking a heel in the process. \"Try not to do to my... Never mind. Do whatever you want with your body, it's not mine anymore. Inflate like a balloon for all I care.\" Clair stomps across the office, looking over her monstrous new form. She actually seems kind of amused by it. \"So who am I? What's my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald Tramp steps in, and takes over. \"Muchas Gracias, Former Clair Palmer. Unfortunately, we don't know the identity of this body, so I'm taking the liberty of sculpting a new identity. I won't give you everything, but I'm providing you with an identity, a bank account loaded with ample funds to start over, a letter of recommendation that should get you any job you apply for, and...\" Mr Tramp laughed a little, \"A gym membership.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClair nodded. \"I suppose that's good enough compensation. Thank you very much, Mr. Tramp, Ms. Palmer.\" Ronald directed the former woman to her secretary, so the details of her, rather his, new identity could be ironed out, and she left the office, leaving just you and Ronald together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Luke. How does if feel to have a brand new body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had managed to stand back up, after ditching the shoes. You wiggle your toes in the stockings. \"She took great care of her body. I don't know if I'm going to like being a woman, but for now I'm happy. I can always change later.\" Clair's voice sounded a little different coming from the inside, but you gave it a warmth that that cold woman never did. You almost sounded friendly! \"What about you, Mr. Tramp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald Tramp folds his hands behind his back, and walks over to the window. \"It might be nice to get a younger body, but it's more important to me to keep my company going. If I switched with anyone, I'd lose my identity. It would be too suspicious if someone random suddenly gained control of my empire. I need to stay in this body, for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Makes sense, though you feel bad for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, however, can join my company without suspicion. By tomorrow, I'll have you in the system, and we can work on the paperwork. I'll arrange to have a laboratory set up for you to continue your work. In the mean time,\" Tramp extracts a credit card from his pocket. \"Take this card, and go break in your new body. Clothes, food, whatever your heart desires. I'll see you for work in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald Tramp leaves you with his credit card, the key and address to your new apartment, and about 24 hours until you were due back for work tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you get inside, you're not surprised by how clean and neat the <i>previous tenant</i> had left it. You expected even the furniture to be cold to touch. You leave your broken heels be the door, and slide along the carpet in your stockings. The living room and kitchen were connected, with only a small island separating them. Everything is clean, and the fridge and freezer are nearly empty. Which sucks, because you're kind of hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to look around, seeing a small bathroom without many noteworthy aspects, and the bedroom, which was as neat and tidy as the rest of the house. The last room was an office, and held the only surprising thing here- Her computer was pretty powerful! It was a gaming rig! Either she had inherited it from someone else, or Clair was a closet PC gamer! The hard drive has been wiped, though, so you can't confirm your suspicions. There were some documents and paperwork crucial to your new identity, but otherwise there were zero real personal items in the entire apartment. You wonder if she had disposed of them before handing her life off to you, or if she just didn't have any sentimental value for anything, period. Either way, she was right. Her life is a clean slate, free for you to build up as you please. It was an unusual feeling. Kind of like re-starting a video game after the fact. You don't even know where to start with your new life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into the bedroom, and lie on the bed for a few minutes to soak it all in. A day ago, you were a monstrous fat man, running around a shopping mall like a psychopath. Hours before that, you had been a cute teenage girl, getting dragged around a mall by two boys. Before that, Luke, the scientist and inventor of a body swapping machine, which now rested in Ronald Tramp's office. You're a little uncomfortable with your creation outside of your control, but you think you can trust your new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get off the bed, and look over the dress suit you've been wearing. \"Time to take this off, you think to yourself.\"  You unzip the black skirt, and watch it drop to the floor. You see dark panties through the black stockings, which you peel off next, letting the cool air touch your legs for the first time. You unbutton the jacket, toss it on the floor, and then quickly unbutton the blouse, anticipating what was underneath. A black bra! You parade in front of the mirror in your undergarments, getting a laugh. If Clair saw what you were making her do, she would... Not care? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're having a little trouble accepting that all of this is yours now. This is you. Hell, you should probably start calling yourself Clair, or maybe change your name, but something in the back of your heart makes you feel that you're still Luke, and that your body is still waiting at home, occupied by your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the closet and gasp! The closet is filled with... Plain clothes! You sigh. So much for playing dress up. Although, you remember the card Tramp had given you free reign with. Time for a shopping spree.</span></div></div>",

You threw on a pair of jeans and a simple shirt, along with a jacket, and headed out into the city with your trusty card in hand. First things first, you needed to fill your belly, and Mr. Tramp was buying! You went to that expensive Mexican Buffet you had always wanted to try out, and ate about ten tacos more than you were able to. It was so good, and even better when you weren't paying! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed, you had to delay your shopping spree a little longer, with your first trip to the ladies room. It wasn't anything special, though you were audibly surprised, even though you were well aware of your new gender, that the penis wasn't there when you pulled your panties down. It was a strange sensation, having nothing there. You could swear you still felt it, but you knew it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Surprise aside, it was an okay experience. The same stuff comes out of girls that comes out of boys, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first impulse was to go to the mall. The same mall where you had been two days prior. The first thing you do when you get there is buy that brand new smart phone you've had your eye on, and off the bill a year in advance with your card. Before you have a chance to play with it, a shiver runs down your spine, and then you see it. Kyle. Robin. Luke. Wandering around the mall, looking for something. Robin looks unenthusiastic, but Luke and Kyle are frantic. You remember how you really left them. Kyle is in your body. Robin is in Kyle's. And the fat man is in Robin's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approach you, and you flinch. <i>They've caught me!</i> But they haven't. They've never met Clair in their lives. They don't know you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mam, we're looking for something. It looks like an MP3 player, but it's decked out in some odd machine parts.\"Robin, in Kyle's body asks you, \"Have you seen it anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tomorrow, I'll give you a call when I'm at work, and I believe I'll be able to sort things out for you. Just trust me.\" You do as you said, and arrange to bring them in to the office tomorrow, so you can get Kyle and Robin back in their bodies. Who knows? Maybe you can dish out a little revenge to the bodysnatcher while you're at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your brother and the others, put that mess out of mind and resume what you came here for: Shopping! You make a circuit around the mall, going to each shop and grabbing anything you found interesting for clothes. You had memorized your new sizes before you left, so you can just grab as much as you can. There were all sorts of outfits, in ranges of styles. A lot of them probably not appropriate for a 35 year old woman, but frankly, you did not care. You just grabbed everything, and you could sort it out later. Unable to resist the power of infinite money, you end up picking up a few things for your apartment, too, which you arrange to have delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you were unable to carry any more, and had to make a trip home to drop it off. You didn't stay long, though, because it occurred to you that you had been buying just cheapo mall clothes, and there was a street not far from here known for its fabulous stores, with high priced items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd spent the last twelve hours shopping. Something you had never imagined you would ever do. Your living room in the apartment was loaded with plastic bags, boxes, and hangers of clothes everywhere. <i>Maybe the next thing I should buy is a bigger apartment</i>, you joke to yourself.  You don't even know where to begin with this huge mess, and end up falling asleep on the couch before you get a chance to try on a single outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling groggy the next morning, and look around anxiously at all of your purchases that you haven't yet been able to play with. Yet you get up, and prepare for work. </span></div></div>",

He willingly volunteered because of the previous mistake of making him age 10 years older.  After a trial run, Tom lost 5 or 6 years and was almost back to his original age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a makeshift crib in the corner of the lab, a baby babbled excitedly after seeing the results.  The baby was actually the lab tech who was accidentally turned into a baby during the original testing period.  The lab employees had all been taking turns bringing the baby home at night while they worked on a cure.  You weren\u2019t sure if you could ever duplicate the serum to make age progression possible, but maybe you would luck out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two more days, you were getting close to a better product.  Tom had tested it and lost another 10 years and was in his mid 20\u2019s.   He was now younger than when he started.  He didn\u2019t mind his more youthful body.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp was continually putting pressure on the lab to complete the project.  With the deadline nearing, you decided to test a new chemical compound on yourself.  After drinking the solution and feeling your body changing, you looked in the mirror.  You surprisingly lost about 10 years of life and were now a 25 year old version of Clair Palmer.  Her 35 year old wrinkles were gone and her body was even more tighter.  The lab erupted in applause after you showed off your new body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald Tramp came in after hearing the applause, \u201cYou look great Clair!  I see you perfected the chemical compound!\u201c  Ronald explained to you, \u201cNow that we can control this process, I am going to need a younger body too.  I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s and if I could have my youthful body again, it would look great for the company.  I could be our spokesman to advertise the youth serum!\u201d  Ronald reached for the solution and was about to drink it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly interrupted, \u201cWait!  I\u2019m not sure It\u2019s perfected yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald looked at your body and laughed, \u201cWhat are you talking about?  You lost 10 years taking this.  All I have to do is double the dose and I should be around 20 again, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly!\u201d  You tell Ronald, \u201cThis chemical compound is PH balanced for a woman!  If you take it, you will certainly become female!  And I have no idea what will happen to your age if you double the dose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald looked at you with intrigue, \u201cThis will turn me into a woman?  That\u2019s fascinating!  I have no wife or children to pass on my business to.  Would this chemical retain any of my original genes?  I need to make sure my family line lives on in this business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, Yes.  You would keep your family genes.  You would just be turned into a woman.  I\u2019m assuming you are talking about expanding your family tree by bearing your own children right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.  And with your expertise and research ability, by the time I give birth I\u2019m sure you will have figured out a way to turn me back into a man again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot guarantee anything Mr. Tramp.  But with the advances we are making in the lab, anything might be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp was pleased, \u201cThen it\u2019s decided.  I will take a double dose of the serum and become a fertile woman in her early 20\u2019s!  I will bear a child so my business can be passed down to the next heir someday.  The economic effects will be astounding for the company after customers learned what I did!\u201d  Mr. Tramp then explains, \"I trust you will assist me with advice once I am a woman.  I am obviously a fast learner but I may need some consultation with adjusting to being female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"I will assist you in any way sir.  But I will remind you that I've only been a woman myself for a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp replied, \"I keep forgetting you are also new to the female world.  That's why i chose you to lead my research lab.  You have adapted well to your new body.  If I didn't know you were a man before, I'd have no idea you weren't always a woman.  I'm going to need your professional assistance to make sure my transition goes just as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are flattered at the compliment.  You are happy that Mr. Tramp has entrusted you with so much responsibility.  Mr. Tramp grabs two bottles of the serum and takes them like a shot.  You barely have time to interject, \u201cWait!  Sir!  I\u2019m not sure what taking a double dose will do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp smiled as his body began to tingle, \u201cI guess we will find out soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly watch as his body changes.

It only took him a moment to conclude the serum had turned him into a young girl instead of a fertile 20 year old woman.  Mr. Tramp looked up at you and said, \u201cI apologize for not adhering to your professional opinion.  The serum appears to have turned me into a child.  Can I see a mirror please?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into your purse and pull out a compact mirror.  Mr. Tramp inspects his new face.  You are surprised at how well he kept his professionalism.  Mr. Tramp closes the compact mirror and continues, \u201cThis body certainly won\u2019t do.  I won\u2019t be of child bearing age for well over 10 years. \u201c  Mr. Tramp instructed, \u201cDr. Wilkins.  Please hand me a bottle of the age progression serum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilkins replied, \u201cSir\u2026. Like Ms. Palmer mentioned earlier, we haven\u2019t perfected the age progression serum either.  It may be quite some time until we figure out the chemical compound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp contemplated his situation.  After a few moments, he continued, \u201cI have full confidence in my lab personnel that you will figure out a way to fix this.  I realize this was my fault.  I was overzealous in my decision to drink the serum.  Until the age progression serum is created, I will have to get used to this body.  My situation will still positively impact the company image.  When the public sees that such a young girl can run a million dollar business, they will certainly know our products work. \u201c  Mr. Tramp instructed a lab assistant, \u201cI will need new attire before returning to my office.  Go pick me up a business skirt-suit in my size.  I want to appear as professional as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab assistant replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir.  But finding a professional business woman\u2019s skirt-suit in your size will be quite the challenge. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp realized she was right.  Fortunately, one of Tramp\u2019s other businesses was an upscale clothing company.  He replied, \u201cIn that case, take my measurements and have my clothing company create me some proper business attire.  Tell them to create a new line of business attire for children.  Once the public learns of this serum, there may be others interested.  But for the time being, I will need something to wear around the office.   Have my clothing company bring me a selection of nicest outfits for a girl my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d  The lab assistant replied as she got to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp told his assistant, \u201cIt seems silly for all of you to be calling me sir while I\u2019m temporarily in the body of a young girl.  I shall be referred to as Ms. Tramp or ma\u2019am from now on.  In fact, I will need to change my name for formal business transactions.  Have my lawyers draw up a name change for me.  My new name will be Ms. Donna Tramp.\u201d  The assistant got to work on Ms. Tramp\u2019s requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp looked up at you and said, \u201cWe have another detail to discuss\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it ma\u2019am?\u201d  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp replies, \u201cI will need your professional assistance with __________\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Until the laws are changed, I\u2019m going to need a legal guardian.  I\u2019m only 5 years old now.  I can\u2019t legally drive a car, or even own a home.  I will need to you to adopt me and act as my mother.  This will be the easiest legal way to handle this situation until an age progression serum is completed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered ma\u2019am.  I appreciate you entrusting me with the responsibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI chose you because I know how easily you adjusted to being a woman.  I will need some help getting used to my new body.  I trust you will teach me how to act like a proper girl.  As far as our living arrangements, my decorating company has already begun the modifications to my estate.  I am having a girl\u2019s bedroom installed as we speak.  You can take the master bedroom since you are the adult of the family.   I will have your wardrobe and belongings moved in immediately.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp then instructed, \u201cI have been told by my advisers that I won\u2019t be able to keep my normal schedule now that I am so young.  I will require going to bed by 7:30 every night so I am well rested for work.  I have always been a workaholic so this will be a huge adjustment for me.  I usually stay up late into the midnight hours working on business.  I give you full authority to treat me like any mother would her child at bedtime, even if it involves disciplinary actions.  I will guarantee that treating me like a child will not affect your job here.  I expect you to treat me like any mother would.  I have been told that with my new body, I will also require a way to expend all this energy.  I will need to play in a park or find some other activities to participate in that is appropriate for a girl my age.  I will leave these activities up to your deciding.  It will help you adjust to being a mother and having to get her daughter socially involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d  You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp then tells you, \u201cOur living arrangements will not be successful if you continue to refer to me as ma\u2019am.  Everybody else at work will still address me with a proper title.  However, from now on, you shall refer to me as your daughter.  Call me Donna, sweetie, princess or anything else you determine is appropriate for a little girl.  I will of course call you Mom, or Mommy.  We should get used to this right away. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay sweetie!\u201d  You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyers have you sign the paperwork immediately.  You are now officially Donna\u2019s mother.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gives you a big hug and says, \u201cThanks for doing this Mommy!\u201d before she heads back into her office.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This will be our first test of our new mother-daughter relationship.  Come on Mommy!  I\u2019ll you\u2019re your help getting dressed!\u201d   You followed Donna into her office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how fast the request was made to bring up their nicest girl\u2019s outfits, the clothing company wasn\u2019t told the details about Mr. Tramp suddenly being turned into a girl.  They assumed the request was to show off their newest fanciest outfits for a buyer of some sort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as a rack of fancy girl\u2019s dresses were wheeled into the office.    Once the door was shut, Donna eyed her clothing options.  All the dresses were obviously designed as formal wear.  They all looked like they could be worn to a wedding or dress-up party.  Donna kept her professionalism, \u201cI\u2019m rather impressed with my clothing company.  They brought up our best selection for girls.  If I must get used to wearing dresses, I may as well learn in the finest of clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her, \u201cWhich one would you like to try on first sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna replies, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.  This is why I chose you to be my mother.  I\u2019ll need your help with things like this.  Go ahead Mommy.  Pick out something for your daughter to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sift through the dresses and hold a few up to Donna\u2019s body.  You choose a blue dress with a bow in the back that matches Donna\u2019s eyes.  After examining the boxes, you pull out a pair of white tights and black mary jane shoes.  You tell Donna, \u201cArms up!\u201d  You pull the dress over her head and tie the bow in the back.  You are pleased with how it fits her.  Next you help her get her legs into the tights and buckle her shoes.  You take a few minutes to do her hair and smile, \u201cGo ahead and take a look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna turns to the mirror and sees her reflection.  She stares at her appearance for a few moments.   She turns back and forth getting used to the feeling of a dress swishing.  She looks up at you with a pleased face, \u201cThanks Mom.  This outfit will work fine.  But these pigtails have got to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026<i>Fine?</i>  You look better than fine sweetie.  You look totally adorable in that dress!  And your hair looks cute!\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.  But I\u2019m not looking to appear \u2018adorable\u2019 at work.  I want my business associates to take me seriously and treat me like the business professional that I am.   I feel a bit overdressed in this fancy outfit.  But it is the best option until my clothing company finishes producing a line of professional business skirts for children.\u201d  Donna pointed to her hair and said, \u201cThese pigtails make me look too young.  Try pulling it back like yours in a more professional manner.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and tell Donna, \u201cOkay.  You are the one who wanted my help.  I\u2019m officially your mother now. You trusted me to make parenting decisions for you right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did Mom.  I fully trust your judgment and need your help to adjusting to being a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, you are not a woman yet. You are a girl.  There is a reason why girls don\u2019t wear professional looking business suits and high heels.  Think about how clumsy that would look.   Girls don\u2019t have the right curves to look flattering in a tight business suit.  And girls don\u2019t have breasts to make a low cut blouse look appropriate.  And they certainly don\u2019t have the experience to attempt to walk in high heels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded, \u201cI understand your point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecondly, whether you realize it or not, none of your business associates are going to let a little girl make million dollar deals.  Even though you are really an experienced 40 year old man, you currently have the body of a child.  Nobody is going to take you seriously.  If you want to successfully market your age regression serum, you may want to use a different approach. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d  Donna asks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThink about the potential.  You managed to build this entire empire from scratch.  You own numerous companies and are worth millions.  That took you over 40 years to accomplish.   Not to mention the 6 years of college to get your masters degree.  Look at you now.  You are only 5 years old.  You essentially have 35 more years until you were the same age before you drank the serum.  Think about how much more you could learn and how many more degrees you could get in that time. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you suggesting growing up all over again?\u201d  Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  That could be how you market the age regression serum!  You still have all your knowledge.  Grade school and high school would be a breeze a second time.  You could get another college degree and continue to learn even more powerful business techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second.  Why would I waste my time going to grade school and high school all over again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be wasting time.  That\u2019s how you would market your age regression serum.  It\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream to be young again.  It would be a perk of taking the serum.  You\u2019d be able to experience the innocence of childhood and have fun growing up again.  People could even choose different career paths or choose a different place to live.  You would market it as a second chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are really onto something here.  What about parents?  Who would agree to raise a child all over again knowing they used the serum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, \u201cPeople of your wealth can afford anything. Look at me.  I agreed to be your Mommy.  As you know, the lawyers had to write the contract to sign over all your assets to me.  So as long as I am your Mommy, I essentially control your money.  I\u2019d say that\u2019s worth raising a child!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right.  We need to get the serum on the market immediately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t do that yet.  I\u2019m going to need more time to properly develop the chemicals.  I still have no idea why the serum regressed your age 35 years and changed your gender.  We have to get this perfect if we are going to sell it to the public.  In the mean time, I\u2019d suggest you take a break from acting as the front man of your company.  You have plenty of assistants that can run it while you are gone.  You\u2019d still be consulted for the big decisions.  But your main job would be to grow up again.  That would help market the age regression serum to prove there was a successful experiment going on.  Essentially, that means you get an extra 35 years to prepare for running the company full time again.  You\u2019ll be 35 years smarter.  You could even decide to birth a child like you mentioned before.  That way if something ever happened, you would ensure the business would stay in the family.  By that time, we will have mastered the gender serum.  You could go back to being a man whenever you wanted. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s mind was running wild.  All she was thinking about was how much money this could bring to the company.  Donna smiled, \u201cYou are a marketing genius Mommy!  This is going to be worth billions and billions of dollars!\u201d  Donna looked in the mirror and smiled at her reflection, \u201cI suppose I could get used to these pigtails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit sweetie!  I assume you would like to attend private school.  I will call them and get you enrolled in kindergarten right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna  got an uneasy feeling, \u201cKindergarten right away?   I already know how to tie my shoes.  Is that really necessary?  Can\u2019t I take a few months to get used to being a girl first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her, \u201cTrust me.  I\u2019m your mother.  The best way for you to learn to be a girl is to be around other girls.  It will give you a chance to make some friends and start socializing.  You are going to love it!\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLike I mentioned before, it will be difficult to persuade your highest level executives of your company to take orders from a 5 year old girl.  They are all men in their 40\u2019s and won\u2019t take you seriously.  In order to successfully maintain control of your empire, you will need to level the playing field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna appreciates your advice and asks, \u201cHow do you suggest I level the playing field?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you trust me right?  Call your executives into your office for a meeting.  Give me 30 minutes and I will take care of the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later, Tramp walked back into the office.  Instead of seeing all of her executives in their regular older male bodies, there was now a group of little girls sitting around the conference table all wearing dresses from the clothing rack.  Because the chairs were designed for adults, all the girls could barely see over the conference table.  Tramp took the normal spot at the head of the table.  It was easy to figure out who was who because of their regular assigned seating at the conference table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now the only adult in the office room.  You winked at Donna and said, \u201cAs you can see, the playing field has been leveled. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was pleased with your idea.  Now the entire staff of Tramp\u2019s company were also children.  All the girls clapped and congratulated Tramp on the breakthrough of the new serum.  From years of habit of addressing his executive team, Tramp opened up with the regular greeting, \u201cWe have a lot of work to do gentlemen.\u201d  All the executives laughed as Tramp corrected his words, \u201cI mean we have a lot of work to do ladies.\u201d  The room laughed again realizing that the term \u2018ladies\u2019 was also a stretch.  Donna continued the speech, \u201cI commend you all for agreeing to take the serum like I did.  Together we will show the business world how advanced and organized we can be in the bodies of such young children.  We will all be examples on how successful this can be.  CEO\u2019s around the globe will be interested in experiencing the feeling of youth again while still running their companies.  As you may have heard, I have chosen the name Donna Tramp for the time being.  You can refer to me as Ms. Tramp or ma\u2019am from now on.  The legal team is already doing the paperwork to change all of your names so business correspondence will be official with your new bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executives all clapped again at the speech.  Tramp pointed to the new business plan folders and instructed everybody, \u201cOk young ladies.  Everybody flip to page one.  We will start going over the plan immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the executives suddenly had an uneasy feeling.   She tried to quietly get up and slip out of the room without interrupting.  However, Tramp noticed immediately and was shocked that she was interrupting the meeting, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had an embarrassed face and explained, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am.  I suddenly really have to use the bathroom.   Can we take a quick break?\u201d  Mumbles began going around the room as the other girls seemed happy they might be taking a break.  Another girl jumped in, \u201cShe\u2019s right boss.  I really have to pee too!\u201d  The other girls all nodded with the same uneasy feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp looked around at the rest of the girls and laughed, \u201cIt appears that our bladders are much smaller with these bodies.  I could use the bathroom too.  Let\u2019s take a 5 minute break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls excitedly started rushing towards the door.  They all instinctively headed towards the men\u2019s bathroom that was conveniently located right outside of the conference room.  They all realized their mistake and one of them asked, \u201cWhere is the ladies restroom anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female secretary cracked a grin at seeing the confused girls.  The secretary had worked there for years and was always complaining about the lack of women\u2019s restrooms located around the building.  The excuse was always that there weren\u2019t that many women working at for the Tramp company so they didn\u2019t need as many.  The secretary got a slight degree of satisfaction by pointing across the building, \u201cI\u2019m sorry girls, but the only ladies room on this floor is way down there around the corner at the end of the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of girls all rushed down the hall in a frenzy.  Their tiny legs made the walk seem even further.  When they arrived at the ladies room, there were only 3 stalls inside.  They rushed back and forth taking turns.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finally done, they walked back down the long hallway to the conference room.  As they passed the secretary, Ms. Tramp instructed, \u201cHave the building manager remodel this men\u2019s\u2019 room to a ladies room.  I can\u2019t have my executives walking that far every time they need to use the bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary giggled and thought to herself, \u201c<i>It\u2019s about time there was closer ladies bathroom around s here</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the girls were back at their seats around the conference table, Ms. Tramp realized the break was almost 20 minutes long, \u201cOkay girls.  We are behind schedule.  Everybody open up their business plans to page one and we will continue..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can we get some sort of catering in here please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp wanted to get the meeting going but he knew his executives would work better without being hungry.  Tramp realized she could use a snack too.  Tramp instructed the secretary to have the catering company bring up 10 snack meals for the girls.  5 minutes later, the meals arrived.  They all opened the paper sacks and pulled out their snack.  An executive laughed, \u201cCool!  I haven\u2019t had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for years!  This looks delicious!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother executive pulled out the drink and laughed, \u201cSeriously?  They put our juice in sippy cups?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then from across the table, another executive tried to take a drink from the sippy cup and accidentally dropped it.  Everybody laughed and one of the executives joked, \u201cMaybe it was a good thing they gave us sippy cups!  That would have spilled all over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother executive down the table suddenly yelled out, \u201cCrap!  I need a napkin!\u201d  They all looked over and saw she had dripped peanut butter onto her dress while trying to take a bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly sprung into action and grabbed a wet napkin.  You tried to blot out the peanut butter but it stained her dress.  Looking around, you noticed the chaos of the girls trying to eat.  Sippy cups were being dropped and peanut butter and jelly blobs were falling everywhere.  You quickly dash into action trying to clean the messes.  You finally announce loudly, \u201cGirls!  Slow down!  Your bodies aren\u2019t as coordinated as they used to be.  You are going to have to eat slower and take your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls looked up at you at the same time.  They all had peanut butter stuck to their lips and cheeks.  The secretary was then only other adult so she helped you walk around and wipe their faces clean.  The executives couldn\u2019t help but laugh at how clumsy their bodies seemed.   All of their dresses now had stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning the girls and the table, Ms. Tramp finally got back to business, \u201cOkay young ladies.  Open your folders to page 1 and we will get this meeting started\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the executives jumped off her seat, \u201cSorry boss!  I gotta pee again!\u201d  Another 2 girls jumped down and said, \u201cMe too!\u201d  A 4th girl joined in and said, \u201cLet\u2019s race!\u201d  The 4 girls all ran out the door racing to the women\u2019s bathroom all the way down the long hallway.  Ms. Tramp sighed as the meeting had to be postponed again.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the 4 girls got back from the bathroom, they were about to start the meeting again when Tramp had an uneasy feeling.  He politely excused himself, \u201cSorry girls.  This is embarrassing.  Now I need to pee.\u201d    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later when Tramp returned, he was surprised to see what the executives were doing.  3 girls were running around the table playing tag.  3 girls were standing in a circle twirling their dresses around until they fell over laughing.  The rest of them were stretching on the floor doing the splits.  One of them looked up and saw Tramp was back, \u201cCheck it out boss!  Look how flexible our bodies are now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp yelled loudly, \u201cAhem!  Girls!\u201d  Everybody stopped what they were doing and quickly took their seats around the conference room.  Only their heads were tall enough to reach the table top.  Tramp made a mental note that smaller chairs and tables were going to be necessary in the near future.  All the girls had the same look that they had been caught doing something wrong.  Tramp explained, \u2018I completely understand what you are all going through.  I\u2019m dealing with the same thing.  Our bodies have much more energy now but we need to be professional and keep our composure. We have a lot of work to do and I need you all to focus your bran power and energy on our new business plan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all mumbled in unison, \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.  Now let\u2019s get to work!\u201d  Just then, another interruption happened.  The company lawyers all came inside.  They had piles of paperwork for everybody to sign that included their new names and custody contracts.  As they began reading the contracts, one of the executives asked, \u201cWhat are these custody papers all about?  Why is my wife\u2019s name on the form?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyers explained, \u201cUntil we figure out the legalities of the serum, we are going to have to follow current laws.  That means each of you will need a legal guardian.  Your wives have all been contacted about your situation and are being de-briefed in the conference room next door.  For the time being, you will all be legally adopted by your wives.  This is the quickest way to continue business as usual.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all flipped through the contracts and signed each page.  One of the girls noticed a generous check at the back of the packet and asked, \u201cWow!  What is this check for?  And why is it written out to my wife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer explained, \u201cYou all are receiving a bonus check to cover the expenses of new clothing and supplies for your bodies.  We had to make them out to your wives because girls your age can\u2019t cash a check.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everybody finished signing the contracts, the lawyers said, \u201cNow that the paperwork is finished, it\u2019s time to bring your wives in.  They are all eager to see you.  I\u2019ll let them know it\u2019s okay to come in now.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the conference door opened up, a bunch of confused women walked in wondering who was their former husband.  Some of the women were carrying babies and had other small children with them.  It only took a few moments for each of the girls to run up and introduce themselves to their families.  The room was now filled with loud talking and laughter while they all met each other.  Ms. Tramp let everyone converse for a few minutes.  It was interesting to see the families reacting to their new daughters and sisters.  Tramp noticed that some of his executives were now younger than their own children.  Over the years, Tramp had gotten to know the executive\u2019s families well.  They had plenty of work parties and events.  The entire executive team was close and enjoyed some wild parties.  Tramp knew for the time being that their wild expensive parties would be much different now.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp finally got everybody\u2019s attention with a speech, \u201cI appreciate all of you coming in on short notice.  I\u2019ve known you all for years and trust you will do your best to deal with the temporary changes in your lives.  I understand how strange this must be to see your husbands and fathers like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the executive\u2019s daughters named Madeline let out a giggle, \u201cMe and Daddy can play dress up together now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room erupted in laughter.  One of the wives also joked, \u201cMadeline is right!  Her birthday party is tomorrow and everybody is invited.\u201d  With a wink across the room, she laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s a princess theme and I can\u2019t wait to see all your girls dressed up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room laughed again and everybody began making jokes about their situation.  It was 5 minutes until  Ms. Tramp managed to get the room under control.  \u201cOkay everybody.  You will have plenty of time to continue this conversation when your husbands\u2026I mean\u2026when your daughters get home tonight after work.  For now, I need my executives to continue looking over the business plan.  It\u2019s already 3 o\u2019clock and we only have a few hours left of work.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the wives asked, \u201cWait a second.  How is everybody going to get home?  None of you can drive your cars now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the executives replied, \u201cWe could take the train or bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wife jumped in, \u201c\u2026That\u2019s crazy.  Little girls can\u2019t ride the train or bus alone.  And what about the morning commute to work?  How are we supposed to get our new daughters to work everyday while juggling our real children and their school schedules?  And how are you going to get to business meetings everyday across the city?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room got loud again while everybody started discussing transportation options.  This was a detail that Ms. Tramp hadn\u2019t considered when she turned her entire executive staff into children.   Ideas were being passed around about taking taxis to work. Somebody suggested a driving service pick everybody up.  As everybody argued back and forth, one of the wives pointed out, \u201c\u2026That won\u2019t work!  None of the taxis or diving services in town even has car seats!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room quieted down after hearing about car seats.  One of the executives looked down at her new body and said, \u201cShit!  We are all going to have to ride in car seats now aren\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executive\u2019s wife instinctively scolded her new daughter, \u201cWatch your mouth young lady!  You shouldn\u2019t talk like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room erupted again in loud arguing.  Another executive looked at his wife and said, \u201cThere is no way I\u2019m getting buckled into a stupid car seat!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tramp took control, \u201cQuiet everybody!  We need to make something clear.  I can\u2019t risk my executives being injured in a car accident or getting in trouble for breaking the law.  I don\u2019t want to sit in a car seat either, but given the size of our new bodies, we will all have to adjust to these types of changes.\u201d  Mumbles were passed around the room as everybody seemed to be taking in the reality of the new changes in their lives.  One of the executives groaned, \u201cDamn.  I gotta pee again.\u201d  All the wives gasped again at hearing such vulgar language coming from a young girl.  Tramp interjected, \u201cPlease girls!  We all need to watch our language!\u201d  Two other girls got the same uneasy feeling and had to pee again too.  As half of the room started leaving, Tramp decided to call it a day, \u201cOkay everybody!  I can see that we are all getting frustrated and we all need some time to adjust.  Everybody go home early and be back Monday morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the families left as Tramp looked at you and asked, \u201cMommy, are you sure we made the right decision?  We didn\u2019t get anything done today with all the potty breaks and arguing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consoled her, \"Don't worry sweetie.  They are all professionals.  They are just getting used to their new bodies.  This weekend will be a perfect opportunity with everybody socializing  at Madeline's birthday party tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp nodded, \"You are right Mommy.  The party will be fun and us kids will be able to run around and get rid of some of this energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wink at your daughter and give her a kiss, \"We better get to the store!  You don't want to be the only little girl at the party without a pretty princess dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp cracks a grin, \"Thanks for all your help Mommy!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scene at the start of the work day was much different than normal.  With everybody reporting as usual to the conference room first thing Monday morning, it looked more like a school drop off zone rather than a professional office building.  Since the top executives were all now 5 year old girls, all the wives had to bring them to work.  The wives were all making last minute adjustments to their husbands-turned-little girls outfits for the day.  They were fixing the girls hair, tying ribbons or putting rubber bands in.  They were also helping them take off their coats and making sure their dresses weren\u2019t wrinkled.  Because they weren\u2019t strong enough to carry their normal briefcases, all the girls now had backpacks with cartoon characters on them.  It was impossible to find a proper backpack that wasn\u2019t decorated with a princess theme or a character from a cartoon.  One of the wives was licking a napkin and wiping off smudges on her girl\u2019s face.  She seemed to be scolding her for being so careless eating in the car.  Another wife was helping her girl wash her hands.  They were still sticky from breakfast this morning.  Eventually, the wives finished preparing their girls for the day and hugged them goodbye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tramp (now Miss Tramp) was relieved the drop-off was over.  With the wives gone, they could finally get down to business.  The executives were pleased to see their meeting table had been replaced over the weekend.  There was now kid chairs and a low table so they could sit around comfortably.  Miss Tramp watched as his executive team got settled in.  They all took their items out of their sparkly backpacks and set up their work stations.  They all put juice boxes or sippy cups of milk in their cup holders that their wives had packed.  They took out their new Business Plans that the meeting was going to cover.  Miss Tramp was surprised to see that instead of the blue professional folders he handed out on Friday, everybody had replaced their folders with cartoon themed folders. Tramp also saw some of his execs pulling blankets dolls and stuffed animals out of their backpacks and setting them up around their area.  What seemed like forever, the group of 5 year old girls were finally ready for the meeting to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp took the floor, \u201cWelcome back everybody.  I trust you all took the weekend to get used to your new bodies.  I know it was quite the adjustment for myself.  You are fortunate to all have understanding wives to help you adjust.  Now let\u2019s get to business.  I trust you all went over the new Business Plan for the company?\u201d        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the execs looked around each other with nervous faces.  They all began grumbling and it was obvious they hadn\u2019t read the Business Plan.  Tramp got mad and looked at his Chief Financial Officer and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t even read it? You are supposed to be my right-hand-man\u2026or\u2026right-hand-girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Financial Officer replied, \u201cSorry boss.  I got drug around on errands all weekend with my wife and kids.  It\u2019s pretty hard to read while strapped in a carseat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother executive giggled, \u201cAnd specially when a good movie is on the DVD player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls laughed at the joke.  Tramp continued, \u201cI know everybody went to Madeline\u2019s birthday party on Saturday.  I\u2019ll admit it was nice to socialize with our new bodies to help us adjust.  But everybody had all day Sunday to review the Business Plan.\u201d  Tramp addressed his Chief of Marketing and asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t read it either?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marketing Chief shook her head, \u201cSorry.  I had dance class that took most of the morning and then\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp interrupted, \u201cDance class?  You are in a dance class now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marketing Chief nodded, \u201cI have two daughters in dance.  My wife suggested I join too because I would be bored just sitting there all day.  We are practicing for a recital at the end of next month if any of you want to go!  Oh yea, and dance practices are also Wednesday afternoons so I\u2019ll need to leave work early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp rolled his eyes finding out his Chief of Marketing was in dance class now. He sarcastically asked, \u201cDoes anybody else have any conflicts I need to know about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother exec chimed in, \u201cI have gymnastics on Tuesdays and Thursdays now.  I\u2019ll have to leave early on those days too.\u201d  Tramp sighed knowing he encouraged his execs to try and fit in with their new bodies.  He didn't imagine they would all join extra curricular activities that would take time away from work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sales Executive who hadn\u2019t spoken up yet finally chimed in, \u201cIt\u2019s bring your daughter to work day at my wife\u2019s building on Friday so I\u2019ll need a day off.\u201d  Tramp seemed irritated that one of his execs was already asking for an entire day of vacation during such an important time for the company.  Tramp noticed his Sales Exec was wearing an extremely fancy dress that looked like it was designed for a pageant or wedding.  His hair was amazingly done.  His wife must have helped him for hours getting him ready for work.  Tramp asked, \u201cUh..What\u2019s with the dress?\u201d  The Sales Exec explained, \u201cMy only two kids are sons.  My wife is taking advantage of finally having a little girl to dress up.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for her to take me to work on Friday.  She\u2019s never had a daughter before to bring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother exec raised his hand and replied, \u201cI have a doctor\u2019s appointment tomorrow at 2.  I\u2019m getting all my shots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp went across the crowd.  Another exec asked, \u201cWait a second?  Do we ALL have to get shots again now that we have new bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn exec nodded, \u201cYea.  It was in the legal contract our lawyers gave our wives.  I didn\u2019t read it but my wife told me I had to get them all over again.  You all know how fast illnesses can spread among kids.\u201d  Several of the execs suddenly started mumbling and seemed scared they about getting shots.  Tramp interrupted the gossip session, \u201cGirls!  Can we please get started with the meeting.  We need to get something accomplished today.  I have a big announcement about another company who took our new serum that was designed by our best scientists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Execs joked, \u201cSo there\u2019s another management team that was turned into little girls too?\u201d  Tramp shook his head, \u201cNo. They are all now female, but they aren\u2019t kids.  Our Scientists manage to get the serum under control and they all ended up women in their mid 20\u2019s.  They will be coming by this afternoon to thank us for the serum.  It already has benefited their stock holdings now that the company is ran by women.  They got tons of tax breaks and are able to get minority business loans and are taking advantage of their new business model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Exec piped up from the back, \u201cSo why didn\u2019t WE take that batch?  We would have atleast ended up as adults like the other company!\u201d  Tramp explained, \u201cWhen we took the serum, our scientists hadn\u2019t perfected the chemical mixture yet.  And since we all already altered our bodies once, we will need a reversal potion first before any of us can use another potion.  It\u2019s too dangerous otherwise.   Our best scientists are working on that now.  Hopefully they will have something for us to take by\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn exec stood up and looked uneasy, \u201cHold that thought boss.  Sorry but I really gotta tinkle!\u201d She practically ran out the door.  All the other execs took the opportunity to use the bathroom too and ran out after her.  Now that Tramp was the only one left in the conference room, he groaned knowing he had to go too. He quickly followed the others racing down the hallway.  The construction crew had not yet completed the conversion of the men\u2019s room outside the conference room into a ladies room yet.  All the execs ran down the long hallway and across the building to the nearest ladies room.  The secretaries up front couldn\u2019t help but giggle.  They were pleased that they were finally getting a ladies room that was much closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tramp stood at the back of the line to the ladies room, he couldn't help but think about if he'd made a mistake turning his entire staff into little girls.  He wondered if they would ever get any work done like this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days at Ronald Tramp\u2019s company seemed to go a bit better. The new ladies bathroom remodel was finally finished and there were two special stalls with tiny toilets designed for kids.  There was also a kid sized sink installed so they didn\u2019t have to use a step to wash their hands.  The Exec\u2019s loved being able to easily slip out of their offices and meetings now and use a much closer bathroom.  The other real women in the office were loving the fact there was finally a woman\u2019s bathroom located near them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach Exec also had their offices modified with small desks so they could work on their computers comfortably.  Miss Tramp looked the other way when one of the Execs placed a gym mat and a bar in the corner of the office so she could practice gymnastics during down time.  All their secretaries would help them with their hair every time a client came in for a meeting so they looked presentable.  They\u2019d also make sure none of them had chocolate milk stains on their cheeks or stains on their clothes.  The office seemed to be functioning even though the most important people in the company were all little girls now.  Tramp was still a bit mad that most of his staff would leave early for extracurricular activities like dance class and ballet. He was glad his team members were accepting their new bodies but was also getting concerned about all of their absences and leaving early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday, Tramp called a meeting in the morning.  He was about to start when he noticed one of his Executives outfit.  Tramp shook his head, \u201cSeriously?  You wore a Cinderella dress-up costume to work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Executive gave a cute smile and laughed, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?  It\u2019s casual Friday right?  Plus this tiara is really cute isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp agreed but made a mental note to adjust the company\u2019s dress code policy.  Tramp hoped \u2018Cinderella\u2019 didn\u2019t have any important meetings today.  Just as Tramp started the meeting again, one of the wives came in flustered and was practically dragging the Chief Financial Officer along.  The wife went straight up to Tramp and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for bringing her late to work.  But we had a difficult time getting out of the house.  I let her stay up too late and she was a complete brat this morning.  I have 3 other kids to get ready for school and when she refused to wear what I set out and threw a tantrum, I decided to let her dress herself.\u201d  The wife pulled off the Financial Officer\u2019s coat to reveal a pink frilly leotard and tutu skirt. The wife rolled her eyes, \u201cI tried telling her it was an inappropriate outfit for work, but SOMEBODY just had to wear it!\u201d  The Financial Officer stuck his tongue out and took a seat at the conference table.  The wife seemed mad at the attitude and snapped at her, \u201cJust for that young lady, you are going to bed an hour early tonight!\u201d  The Financial Officer crossed her arms and pouted.  The wife turned to Tramp and complained, \u201cDo you see what I have to deal with at home?  It\u2019s hard enough to get 3 REAL kids ready in the morning.  Now I have to deal with a bratty 4th kid who is impossible sometimes!  Is there any progress being made on the serum to turn my husband back to normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife\u2019s ruckus was heard from down the hall.  A company lawyer stuck his head into the conference room to explain, \u201cTechnically ma\u2019am, she is legally your daughter according to the custody paperwork you signed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife rolled he eyes, \u201cI know!  Now I have 4 kids to take care of alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer suggested, \u201cNobody said you had to do it alone.  We have no idea how long it\u2019s going to take for our scientists to develop a reversal serum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife seemed intrigued, \u201cAre you saying I could start dating again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Executives around the table all let out a gasp thinking of their own wives doing the same thing.  The company lawyer nodded, \u201cOf course you can.  You were legally divorced once your husbands were turned into little girls.  You would be well within the law to date or even re-marry if you wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife was still mad about dealing with a bratty kid this morning and glared at her former husband, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m getting a babysitter tonight!  I deserve a night on the town away from kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry wife stormed out of the office as the company lawyer opened his briefcase.  He took the opportunity to start passing out paperwork and a form for everybody to fill out.  He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again.  Everybody has to renew their health insurance coverage.\"   The Chief Financial Officer glared at the company lawyer and pushed the paperwork away with a snotty glare, \u201cGee.  Thanks a lot! Now my wife is going to start dating!\u201d  Another exec pointed out the obvious complaining, \u201cSo let me get this straight\u2026 Since all of us are legally minors now, our wives not only have full financial rights to every dime we earn, now they can get remarried?\u201d  Another exec\u2019s eyes got wide as he mentioned, \u201cUh oh!  My neighbor has been hanging out at my house a lot lately.  He stays late after I go to bed too.  You don\u2019t think they are\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company lawyer interrupted the chatter, \u201cI\u2019m sorry little ladies, but your wives can legally do whatever they want with their love life.  When\u2026Or if\u2026our scientists ever develop a serum to return you all to normal, we can deal with other legal repercussions then.  But for now, I need you all to review your current health insurance coverage and return the forms to me tomorrow.  If you want to keep your same coverage from last year just have your wives sign the first form.  If you want to sign up for a different program, have her sign page 2 under the line with the new coverage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exec wearing the Cinderella dress-up gown complained, \u201cHold on?  We can\u2019t just sign these forms ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer shook his head, \u201cNo. You all understand whenever we have employees under the age of 18, their legal guardians must endorse any changes to their paycheck.  Your wives may want to change your family\u2019s current health plan now that they all have an extra child around.  They have the legal right to decide what coverage is appropriate now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA different exec started giggling across the table while stuffing the pile of paperwork into her backpack, \u201cBetter her than me! I always hated reading these complicated health insurance forms!\u201d  The rest of the execs followed suit and stuffed the forms into their bags to bring home to their wives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the company lawyer was gone, Miss Tramp took the floor in attempts to finally start the morning meeting.  With all the distractions, they hadn\u2019t even discussed anything yet.  However, a secretary interrupted the meeting by carrying in a tray of food, \u201cWho wants cookies and milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the execs were excited to have a snack and raised their hands like they were at school.  The secretary smiled and explained, \u201cOkay girls.  But everybody has to wash their hands first! It\u2019s a good time to take a potty break anyways.\u201d  The execs all seemed relieved as they scurried off to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTramp was glad for the bathroom break too.  But he was also starting to worry about the future of the company.  With himself and all the execs now stuck as little girls, the productivity at work had slowed down immensely.  Tramp had to come up with a way to get some work done around here.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann Taylor. Guess. Michael Kors. Gucci. These designer brands and more grace your bedroom closet as you select something to wear to work today. First, however, you feel around the table next to the couch for Clair's glasses. Well... now they're your glasses, and you'll have to wear them for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm, how might you look with contact lenses? Or perhaps LASIK eye surgery? You stand in front of a full-body mirror in the bedroom as Clair's eyes stare back. Her brown irises now blinking warmly back at you in the reflection, a notable change from the piercing gaze yesterday's former occupant of this body had. Stripping out of your pyjamas, then, you hop in the shower and rinse off, spending extra time to sort through your new mane of hair and blow-dry it afterwards. Tying her hair back into a bun seems like the proper thing to do, but that was the <i>old </i>Clair Palmer. You decide the <i>new</i> Clair should let loose a bit more, opting to let her gorgeous locks flow down past your slender shoulders and tickle the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking away at your face and lips, primping for the first full day at Tramp's office, you find yourself giggling. The real Luke would never spend so much time caring about looking good. Looking <i>pretty</i>. And even though you're still new and inexperienced at applying makeup, you think back to Mom and Erika and try to copy what they do to get ready each morning. Never having thought you would be experiencing this world of womanhood so intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you slip on a thong, a pair of fishnet stockings, and shimmy your hips and arse into a tight black pencil skirt. Maybe it is Clair's legs which best showcase her toned physique? You run a hand down her shapely gams in admiration, smoothing out the skirt so it hugs against your hairless thighs. Her flat stomach and slightest hint of abs also attest to her self discipline, probably exercising almost every day. Even though she is a 35-year-old woman about twice your age, you still feel limber and energetic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you throw on a chiffon-trim cardigan over an equally lacy bra and blouse combo. Finding little trouble in fitting the cups of a new 34C bra over Clair's bosom and snugging the hooks in back. You twirl again in the mirror to get as much of a 360-degree view as possible, sighing out of satisfaction with the whole ensemble. Yes, it was way more work getting ready in the morning, but you're a woman now and that's just what women do. Especially those wanting to make a good impression on their first day of working for the renowned Ronald Tramp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a finishing touch, you slip on the sexiest pair of stiletto heels and practice mincing about the apartment. The smart clicking of heel on tile, the hypnotic swishing of hips constrained in the skirt, and the light bouncing of hair and breasts all combining to form a major turn-on. At least, that's what you presume based on the tongue-dropping looks of various men outside, as you make your way to the nearest subway station. Several of them leer at you like a piece of meat and make no disguise of training their eyes on your supple, feminine figure. Maybe this is what Clair was talking about when she was complaining about sexism yesterday at the office?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the ticket kiosk, on the platform, in the train compartment, you feel more eyes swarming over you. You've been to the city before, of course, seen beautiful women and couldn't help but steal a glance or two yourself. But it's quite different now that you're the one being visually stripped and fucked... and it's so unnerving the way some of the creepier passengers are looking too! A part of you wishes there was more in Clair's handbag than apartment keys, lip gloss, tissues, breath mints, and a few credit cards. Like a can of mace, that would be nice. Better yet, that paralytic spray you invented to deal with Chris Knudson, a meathead bully at the school you used to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, you realise how long it took to get ready this morning. Most of the morning commuters must already be at work, since the trains appear relatively moderate and unlike what you'd expect from rush hour. You curse to yourself and pull out your smartphone to confirm the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought crosses your mind: Tramp hasn't called you back since departing from his office yesterday afternoon. Not that you are expecting a busy man like him to shoot the shit... but something doesn't feel right. At the very least, you would expect Tramp to call wondering when the boy genius inventor will come to work and show him the full potential from the body-swapping machine. Tramp seemed extremely enthusiastic about its use, and you doubt he would put it off no matter what else is happening right now in his empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dial his office number and place the phone to your ears. It rings a few times before going to voicemail. Grunting, you wait a few minutes before trying again. This time, a birdlike female voice chirps on the other end:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronald Tramp's office, this is Tanya, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap... his secretary. This is the line to his secretary's office. Tramp must have mistakenly given you that number instead of the direct line to his own office. And while his secretary did help get the old Clair situated into her new life as a 60-year old obese man, you're not certain how much she knows about the machine or your agreement to work for Tramp. You clear your throat and reply, \"Um, hello. My name is Clair Palmer. I was hoping to speak to Mister Tramp. Do you know if he's available right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hold for a moment.\" Curtly responds Tanya, the secretary. You suspect she is transferring you to his line, or at least seeing if he's in a meeting. While you're waiting to be taken off hold, you feel the train compartment shift and jolt a bit. You're almost to Tramp Tower, that indelible sky-contouring symbol of the big city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the secretary cuts back in. What does she say to you??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took a step back, about to leave, but then continued forward. She was average. She wore torn jeans under a red dress.

During this time, she was part of one of our experiments which we intended to use on people who needed to forget recent memories.

I guess that also explains the blood red lips and... well these!\" you say, pointing to your new bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite!\" Mr Tramp chuckled \"Veronica is just a fan of red lipstick, and... well, shes just naturally stacked!

But regardless, all of Veronica's personal records, save for her name, have been wiped. This body is your blank slate Luke! or i suppose its veronica now? Anyway, if you follow me downstairs, i can add your pigemtn back into the body, and remove the red pigment from your eyes.\" You obbliged, and followed Mr Tramp downstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure took just over an hour, but by the end of it, you were overjoyed by the results.

You decided to take another look through her closet to see if there was anything normal you could wear to your new job tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be a business suit or anything but just something that isn't so\u2026 I don't know, kinky?\"  You said to yourself in Mary's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted briefly that Mary's voice sounded a bit odd when you were talking.  Your mind spiraled into a firestorm of thoughts about how vocal patterns worked, and you realized you were still speaking as though you had a male voice and it was sounding a bit odd with Mary's natural tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat and tried again, \"Hello, testing, testing?  This is Mary Huang speaking!  Hmm\u2026 much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds you had adjusted the way you spoke so it sounded far more natural coming out of a young woman's vocal chords.

All of the leather outfits and PVC dresses aside, her closet was full of complex dresses that she had designed herself.  There didn't seem to be much in the way of\u2026 pants\u2026 anywhere.  The dress she wore to the body swap seemed to be her most casual dress, and everything else got more exotic from there.  You started browsing through what looked like Lolita dresses that sadly were the closest thing you were going to get to normal, and the rest of the harajuku outfits were quite well designed but were not appropriate for a workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if a Lolita dress is\u2026  Oh well I guess I don't have any other options until I go shopping.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to try on the white and yellow Loli dress which was hanging up right in front, and seemed to be fairly simple as far as Loli dresses went.  First you took some time to figure out how to slip out of the dress you'd been wearing since the swap.  The dress went down to your knees, and your legs were encased in leggings and black shoes with a one inch heel that you hadn't noticed before.  You carefully removed the shoes, revealing your new tiny feet and equally tiny toes which you wiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you figured out that the dress had to come off over your head, and it wasn't one that had an opening in the back to step in and out of.  The dress came off easier than expected, and you looked down to be greeted for the first time by your very own pair of breasts.  They weren't large, the black bra underneath was labeled as a 32B, but from this angle they looked quite perky and fun to play with.  You gave them a brief bounce and squeeze as you got used to the feeling of having bags of flesh strapped to your chest, and decided you could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lucky she wasn't some big titted monster, this body is actually quite cute and manageable.  It's odd being so short though\u2026 but when has height ever stopped anyone from being a genius inventor?  Her brain is the real prize\u2026\"  You said to yourself as your mind raced and you played with your breasts without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leggings were also something new, having skin tight fabric wrapped around your entire lower half felt very alien, even weirder than the bra somehow.  The leggings seemed to also have some kind of embroidered pattern in it which gave them an elegant flair that was pleasing to the eye.  It seemed like nearly every bit of clothing she owned was personalized in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now stripped down to your bra and panties, and felt down between your legs where you found a gap between your legs, and the smooth flat surface of your black panties which sent a brief tingle through your body as you caressed it.  Your mind was already racing ahead and you decided to stop here for now, and try on the dress already.  You grabbed the white and yellow Lolita dress off the hanger, and inspected it.  It had a few frilly bits and had many little custom sewn bits around it, which looked quite professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress had a built in corset you realized, once you slipped it on over your head and it was very loose on you.  The only way to make it fit was to tie the corset which took several minutes to figure out.  Once the corset was as tight as you were willing to experiment with, you walked over to her bathroom mirror for the first time to get a good look at yourself.  You were now a short young Asian woman with black hair that came down to your shoulders, wearing a white and yellow Lolita dress that was cinched tight, giving you a very thin waist.  Your waist was contrasted by the way the skirt flared out at the bottom, but you noticed something was off about the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never worn a dress before, obviously being born a boy, but Mary's brain was going so quickly that you barely had time to even wonder why you were so willing to experiment with all of this.  Before you knew it, you were rummaging through her notes until you found her dress designs.  Shuffling through the designs you finally found the Lolita dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course!  It's the bare legs that look so weird, I can't wear a dress like this while showing my legs and barefoot\u2026\"  You cursed yourself for not seeing it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours you continued trying on different combinations of dresses and stockings and shoes, using Mary's notes to learn everything you could about fashion.  Her brain seemed to have a nearly photographic memory which made it easy to scan through all of her notes quickly, and jump straight into experimentation.</span></div></div>",

It was a black and red Lolita dress where you picked out some black knee high stockings to match.  In Mary's notes you learned of a fashion term called 'zettai ryouiki', which was the amount of bare leg shown between the hem of the skirt and the top of the high socks.  You learned how to show just the right amount of bare skin with the length of this Lolita dress, so that a small amount of leg was visible, and you had to admit it looked damn sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I'd do without all of Mary's notes\u2026 This is all so fascinating but I would have no idea what I'm doing.  I guess I'd probably just end up dressing as a tomboy if she hadn't left all this info\u2026  Also no wonder she was in debt look at all the money she spent on shoes\u2026\"  You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you looked through Mary's collection of shoes, and noticed that she had mostly high heels or platform shoes with wedges and heels and all kinds.  The pair of flats that she wore yesterday were one of very few that she had.  Of course, you decided to go with a pair of black chunky heeled pumps that went well with the outfit you selected, based on Mary's design notes.  You had practiced some with heels during the night as you tried on different outfits, but you were still concerned about wearing them to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were fully dressed, you strutted over to the bathroom and felt confident that you could at least walk in these, since the chunky heels made it easier to balance than stilettos.  Seeing yourself in the mirror was quite a treat however, as you complimented yourself on how well selected this outfit was.  You were embarrassed to realize you were thinking of the girl in the mirror as cute, and almost forgot this was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was nearly time to leave, you heard a car honking outside your new apartment, it was another cab.  It took you a second to realize that you didn't have any pockets in this dress, and you had no idea where Mary kept her keys and wallet and such.  Then you saw the black purse sitting on the counter, which was full of everything you needed for the day.  You took a second to look inside and found your new ID which read Mary Huang, 23 years old, 5'5\", though you felt like you were more like 5'9\" right now with the heels you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were ready, you hopped in the cab and ignored the extra-long look he gave you, since you weren't sure if he was checking you out or was confused by your choice of outfit.  Regardless, he didn't ask questions and started driving you towards your new job at Mr Tramp's private lab.</span></div></div>",

Mary's brain, now your brain, was proving hard to control if not given enough stimulus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the elevator, you saw only buttons to go to basement 2, through floor 35.  There was no basement 3 button, but  you noticed no one else was in the elevator.  So you quickly figured out how the elevator control panel could be rewired by removing the front plate using the plastic card in the ID badge, and the rest was a simple matter of rewiring the button to an unused socket.  When you put the button panel back on, and pressed basement 2, the elevator started going down, basement 1, basement 2, and further, until it reached basement 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator dinged and the door opened, as you suddenly laid eyes upon an impressive underground laboratory that must have been under the entire city block.  There were dozens of laboratory rooms on each side of the main hallway, and you were about to start figuring out what each one was researching, when you were stopped by a hand catching you on the shoulder.</span></div></div>",

You mean that sorry excuse for a hidden button?  You're gonna have to try harder than that\u2026\"  you said to him, sticking your tongue out as a tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not very ladylike\u2026 I see you're adapting quite well though, interesting choice of clothing\u2026\"  he commented, noticing your mostly black Lolita dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed at the hem of the dress's skirt and shrugged.  You still weren't even sure why you wore an outfit like this, though from all of the strange clothing in your new closet, this was very tame in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Tramp, this is just my usual style.  You should see my closet, there's much more where this came from\u2026\"  You said with a wink, playing along in your new role as Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it suits you I suppose.  Also you may want to work on your makeup, it looks like you haven't touched it since yesterday.\"  Mr. Tramp advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit he's right, I completely forgot people are probably going to expect me to know makeup\u2026 I guess that'll be the next thing I study in Mary's notes\u2026</i>  You thought to yourself.  You were lucky that you hadn't slept, but your makeup was definitely not in good condition since Mary applied it over a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, welcome to basement level three\u2026 Most of my employees aren't even aware of it, but this is where we do most of our top secret research.   I may as well give you the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald began walking down the hall, and you followed curiously.  The halls were very quiet aside from the distinct click and clop of your chunky heels which you were already quite good at walking in.  Ronald seemed amused by how you were adapting to things so quickly, but he kept that to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the right we have a chemistry lab where we have people working on-\"  Mr Tramp started, but you interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing in there is where they test the age reversal technology,\" you said after you had quickly weighed the probabilities in your head about what he would be doing with a chemical lab.  \"And in there is where you are testing invisibility cloaking tech, I mean there's suspiciously nothing inside.\"\"How did you?.\u2026right\u2026 I\u2019m almost starting to regret giving you Mary's body.

I'm going to have to improve my security with you around.\"  Mr. Tramp admitted, seeming almost embarrassed at how easily you were seeing through all of his secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would offer to lend you a hand in revamping your security,\" You said, \"But then I would exactly how it all works so that wouldn't exactly be fair would it?\"   You smiled and continued following him down the hallway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After your brief tour where you ended up surprising Mr. Tramp with your powers of deduction, and guessing many of his secrets, he finally brought you to the lab you'd be working in.  He opened the door for you, and motioned for you to enter.  \"Ladies first.\"  He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at him and then entered the room, holding your purse in both hands in front of you, almost like a shy little schoolgirl would walk into a room full of strangers.  However, this was a calculated move, in order to deceive your fellow coworkers into thinking you were a meek young woman who was no threat to them.  Your accelerated brain was already thinking five steps of everyone else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone, can I have your attention?\"  Ronald announced, and immediately everyone stopped what they were doing.  \"Good morning everyone, I have a surprise for you all this morning.  I'd like you all to welcome your new coworker, Mary Huang.  She will be working with all of you as a research engineer, and she is very intelligent so I would recommend you all treat her with respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was full of an assortment of men and women of many ages, the oldest man looking like he'd been in World War II, and the youngest looking like she was slightly younger than your age, or rather your new age of 23.  They all were wearing white lab coats and most of them had glasses on, though only a few were wearing safety goggles which they took off to get a better look at you.  You could sense them all judging you, wondering whether you were just Mr. Tramp's newest pet that was given a job for favors, or whether you were secretly some kind of genius that they needed to feel threatened by.  You hoped to convince them of the former for as long as possible until you could earn their loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to play up the shy girl routine some more, and be as non-threatening as possible, though they would have no idea what your brain was capable of.  \"H-hello everyone, nice to meet you.  I'm Mary.\"  You meekly introduced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a man approached who looked to be in his early 30's but was quite youthful and healthy, and he seemed to have an air of authority about him.  He reached out his hand with a smile, and you daintily shook it with your feminine hand.  \"Hi there Mary, I'm Steve Kopinsky, the lead researcher for this project.  I guess you could say I'm your boss around here, but it's really great to meet you.  You can just call me Steve, we're all pretty informal around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened which your brain hadn't predicted, you were blushing.  Your body was feeling a bit hot all of a sudden, and looking into Steve's eyes was causing a hormonal response which you couldn't seem to control.  You simply smiled and pretended like you weren't feeling anything right now.  \"Thank you, Steve, I can't wait to see what you all have been working on and meeting the rest of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled again and you had to look away to avoid butterflies forming in your stomach.  He was quite charming, and it was really starting to disrupt your thought stream which had been non-stop until now.  Dr. Tramp broke the awkwardness by announcing that he had other places to be, and let the rest of the team introduce themselves as he exited the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should have predicted this\u2026 simply transferring thought patterns to another physical brain may be enough to preserve memories, but the physical brain itself has its own chemistry which must determine physical attraction to a potential mate based on my own body chemistry.  My new body seems to definitely be reacting in response to Steve's charms.</i>  You made a mental note to yourself to tweak the body switching process to have the option to preserve the original body's brain chemistry in future versions.</span></div></div>",

The rest of the team seemed quite busy and returned to their duties for now, while the two of you sat down in private.  Being in an isolated room alone with Steve was causing your heart to race, but you forced yourself to focus on all of the science that was going on around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mary, I'm going to be frank with you.  When Mr. Tramp personally came to me and told me we were getting a new researcher, he told me great things about you.  He called you a certifiable genius, and I don't mean to doubt you, but I saw your test scores and college history, and I'm a bit confused honestly.  It showed that you have a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Design\u2026 is that true?\"  Steve asked, sounding a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So Mr. Tramp didn't even bother to forge any fake credentials huh\u2026  Maybe he's testing me again by making me prove myself to the team.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes\u2026 I did major in Fashion, but I was really good at it!\"  You said with an awkward chuckle, you needed to remember to stay in character, \"While Fashion was where I decided to get a degree in, I realize it\u2019s a pretty useless major and my actual intelligence was going to waste by doing it.  Rest assured I'm not just some airhead who went to school for parties and drinking, I just followed my passion.  I didn't have enough time to go back to school all over again for another degree, when Mr. Tramp offered me this position I had to take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have excellent Math and Science scores, and though you're right out of college, I don't know how you're going to fit in here yet.  We're a group that is full of PhDs and people that spent years getting their doctorates in this type of field.  So what I'm going to do is make you my personal research assistant.  You'll be exposed to every step of the project, and I hope you will be able to learn a lot just by being involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assistant?!\"  You yelled out briefly, before regaining your composure, \"Ahem\u2026 I was told I'd be a full time researcher, not someone's assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, if you have the skill, you will rise up in the ranks quickly around here.  Just remember to be motivated and hardworking, and try your best to learn from our experts.  Trust me, you and I are going to work closely together.\"  He said, finishing with a smile and a wink.  This caught you off guard again, causing you to nearly melt in your chair.<br>\r\nSteve's charms were starting to have an effect on you finally, causing you to stammer, \"O-oh\u2026 working closely huh?  I guess that won't be so bad\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled again, \"That's what I like to hear.  So anyways, on to the project at hand.  I assume you have security clearance since you were allowed to work on this project to begin with.  Basically the gist of this project is to design a device that performs\u2026 oh how would you phrase it\u2026 I guess you could call it consciousness transfer.  We've discovered a way to move the thought patterns and memories of one person's brain into another's, and vice versa.  This would essentially allow two people to perceive that they have swapped bodies with each other, though their bodies haven't gone anywhere of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no way?  Body swapping? Ooooh how original, I've never done that before\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  No way?!  Body swapping?  I never imagined that would even be possible\u2026  It sounds difficult,\" you lied through your teeth, feigning excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  It's very revolutionary if we can get it to work, and we believe we can.  Our resident neurology expert has demonstrated the theory behind how the brain stores information, we just need to develop the means of reading and writing to the brain's neurons.\"  Steve explained, sounding so excited that he could talk about his amazing project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, under your false excitement, you were already mentally designing the next generation of your body swap machine, which was far more capable than your previous model.  This new brain was accelerating your development time marvelously, and you weren't sure you'd ever be willing to give it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve started rambling on and on about the theory and the physics behind the transfer, and how they were finally getting close to perfecting it, but hadn't solved some key issues yet.  Your brain was excellent at multitasking, and on the surface, you actually looked fascinated by what he was saying, and underneath you were in an entirely separate world, designing mental schematics for your next invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So essentially that's how we're planning on doing it!  Exciting stuff huh?  Let me know if there was anything you need me to explain.\"  Steve offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smiled, \"Oh no I think I'm following what you mean.  You just want to be able to store the state of a brain's matrix in a computer and write it into the physical matrix of another human brain.  Though why stop at human, we know enough about some non-human brains to translate the matrix to another species if necessary, though some of the data may be lost in the transfer\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve simply looked at you in shock, \"Non-human\u2026?  Hmm I hadn't thought about that before.  I mean yes we usually perform our tests on animal brains, but never considered doing a cross-species transfer.  I may have been wrong about you Mary, you could fit in quite well here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of your first day was fairly dull.  You spent some time looking at the various prototype machines they'd built, most of which were absolutely terrible.  A few designs had promise, but they filled up half the room, and were not portable at all.  Even with Mary's brain in overdrive, you would need weeks to get these anywhere near capable, and it was better off just redesigning them from scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up working very closely with Steve, as he said, and every time you were reminded of your body's attraction to him, but your mind kept you distracted by focusing on work.  At one point you even thought he might have a thing for you, since he tended to be very friendly and always giving you looks and admiring your body.  He always kept it professional however, and at the end of the day, you came home with a body that was full of built up sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home you realized that the tension was so bad that even Mary's brain was having a hard time going into overdrive, and you needed to relieve the pressure somehow.  You rummaged through her drawers until you found it: a big purple vibrator that looked like it had seen a lot of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, what am I doing\u2026 I mean this is my body now but, it still feels wrong.  Sorry Mary\u2026\"  You said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the Lolita dress off and stripped down to your underwear.  For the first time ever, you removed your panties, and saw your perfectly shaved vagina was wet with anticipation.  You could literally smell your own sex already, and you hadn't even started.  You decided it might as well be a great time to remove your bra as well, and for the first time you began playing with your breasts and massaging them which only turned you on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you took the plunge and activated the vibrator.  It was an experience unlike any other, and your mind seemed to shut down almost, from the pure pleasure overload.  It took you a while to figure out how to actually do it, since you'd never been with a girl before, and this was all still new to you, but you were aware of how the anatomy worked, and within minutes you finally came, and your juices started leaking out onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm\u2026.  Wow, I can finally think again!\"  You said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the built up sexual tension had started clouding your brain, since throughout the day you felt Mary's thoughts slowing down more and more to normal speed, every time you had a run in with Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at work you showed up in a new outfit from Mary's collection, this time a white and blue frilly dress with white heels and stockings, a very different look than yesterday.  You started turning some heads when you walked in, and people noticed your makeup had been reapplied since you were up the entire night practicing and reviewing Mary's fashion notes.  You were determined to look your best if you were going to stay in this body the rest of your life.  And you intended to, because this brain really was one in a billion. Having a girl's body and wearing dresses was a small price to pay if it meant keeping this brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week went by much of the same, though you had begun earning respect among the other researchers.  At first people looked at you like some weird girl that liked wearing eccentric Asian fashions, but by the end of the week, you'd demonstrated your intelligence enough times that they were actually taking you seriously now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped out Steve many times, trying not to give him too many hints, but acting like his assistant at the same time.  It was part of your plan to not raise suspicion, because if they knew that you had already invented an early version of this in your garage, they might start to ask questions.  Therefore you kept a lot of your own knowledge secret, and kept up the charade of a smart, but not genius, assistant who was nothing but helpful and productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday, your work had paid off, as one of the latest prototypes was finally ready for testing.  You had bounced around from team to team, doing your job as an assistant, but also dropping kernels of information here and there, trying to lead them in the right direction.  It was finally the day for the big test when they would see if they could swap two human brains.  The tests had all succeeded on animals up to this point, and everyone was very tense about the human trials, as expected.</span></div></div>",

They sat down in chairs and a device connected to the central computer was placed near their head, and would be able to read and write the two brains with each other.  You remembered doing a similar version of this in your garage yourself, back when you were Luke, but you obviously didn't have as expensive of equipment as they did.  Nevertheless, from what you'd seen so far, it SHOULD work, if your calculations were correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, everyone still saw you as Mary, the new research assistant, but with your accelerated brain power you were already several steps ahead of everyone in the room.  You went over their design once again in your head, and realized they had forgotten a crucial piece of the algorithm!  Their matrix translation was not set to invert upon going into the machine!  If they tried to load an inverted matrix into someone's brain, it could cause irreparable brain damage, so you had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the patient's heads were being secured into place under the machine, you spun around and dashed out of the test room, towards Steve's office, which was the closest you could find.  Your high heeled boots clacked on the floor as you practically flew down the hallway, with your skirt fluttering a bit as you ran.  No one was in the office, since everyone was getting ready to watch the test.  Luckily you managed to easily guess Steve's password to his computer, and logged into the prototype's source code.  In seconds you found the piece of code that was wrong and pushed the update to the server, forcing the machine to stop just as it was charging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back into the test chamber, calmly, very few people even noticed you walk back in, and they were all busy talking about what had happened.  \"I don't know it just decided to reboot itself right as we turned the thing on.  We're doing a data integrity check now\u2026\"  An older man said to someone else as he was inspecting the prototype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men in the test chamber looked at each other nervously as the machine was powered back up again.  No one had found any problems so the test was still on.  As the machine hummed to life, the two men closed their eyes and looked like they were knocked out for a second.  When it finally finished, they opened their eyes, and looked around, looking at their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did it work?\" The old man, test operator asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it didn't\u2026 I'm still me.\"  The first man in the test chamber replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still me too\u2026 I do feel a bit different though.\" The other man said, giving you a nervous glance for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit disappointed that the test seemed to do nothing, but this piqued your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different\u2026 how?\"  Steve asked.</span></div></div>",

You're the only one who would have access to my computer, though you'd have to know my password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded, \"It wasn't hard to crack, you have a stupidly easy password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve chuckled, \"You know you're like an android sometimes I swear, how did you know to make the change?\"You shrugged, \"Dunno, I just thought about it, and realized you were doing it wrong, simple as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well great work Mary, Mr. Tramp wasn't kidding when you said you were a genius, holy crap.  You saved these people's lives!\"  He leaned over and gave you a congratulatory hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physical contact with Steve caused your body to release a lot of hormones, making you get quite horny against your will.  You hugged him back even closer, and probably for a few seconds longer than was comfortable.  You felt your mind get a fraction cloudier as the sexual tension began to rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one oddity about your new body, was that built up sexual tension tended to lower your brain's overdrive until it was even stupider than a normal person eventually.  Every day this week you'd had to masturbate with the vibrator when you got home, because working around Steve kept building up involuntary hormones in your body.  Intellectually you had no interest in Steve, but your hardware was very compatible with him, and your body and brain both seemed to want him badly.  The only thing stopping you from jumping him every day was your mind's self-control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardly long hug ended and he gave you a knowing look and a charming smile, causing you to melt back down into your chair.  He decided to leave it at that, and left you hanging, needing more contact.  At this point your brain was spent, you felt like you were so clouded that you were the dumbest person in the building right now.  You decided to take the rest of the day easy until you could get home and masturbate again.  It was almost like orgasming recharged your brain, but the lack of sleep couldn't be helping either\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the day you were just waiting for the weekend by now, since your brain was far too clouded to get anything else done today.  You sat at your desk across from Steve's office and saw him checking his last emails of the week before heading out.  You found yourself staring at him, and your self-control wasn't even enough anymore to stop you from day dreaming this time.  This was cut short when he shut his office and headed straight for your desk.  You panicked and tidied up, making it look like you weren't day dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mary, excellent work today with the code change, I'm really impressed.  I'd like to discuss your future with us, if you want to meet me for dinner tomorrow night?  You definitely deserve to be more than just my assistant after what you did today.\"  He said with a very charming smile that you melted right into.</span></div></div>",

So like, tomorrow night then?  Can you pick me up?  I don't, like, have a car\u2026  Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve just smiled, \"Of course!  No problem really.  I'll pick you up around 8, is that ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Mhm!  Sounds fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good I'll see you then!\"  He said with a wink and then left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left there day dreaming about your date, and feeling incredibly horny, wishing the date had been tonight, and maybe you'd get lucky with him.  He really was quite a charming guy and you were quickly falling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your coworkers, a cute blonde girl named Clara who was a fellow research assistant had been watching that exchange.  \"Wow, you go girl\u2026 getting a date with Steve, AND probably a promotion at the same time?  You really know how to get places.

The hormones were disrupting your entire thought pattern and you had a hard time figuring what was your real thoughts and which were driven by your body chemistry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"Thanks Clara\u2026 me too\u2026 I really just hope I get that promotion, that's really all this is about.\"  You lied, badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary you aren't a good liar, I know what this is about,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?\" You asked as she simply walked back to her desk chuckling to herself.</span></div></div>",

Hailing for a cab to take you back to your apartment, you were quickly back at your house, and paid the cabbie.   Finally home, you rushed through the apartment and first thing you found was your good friend the vibrator.  It seemed to be all you could think about, just getting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds you stripped off your dress and shoes and were going to town on yourself with the vibrator.  You managed to orgasm quickly and then laid down for a while.  When you finally recovered and sat up, you realized something was still off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd\u2026 My brain is still not quite back to full efficiency, and I'm still quite\u2026 horny\u2026  Maybe I should try something else.\"  You said to yourself, and started browsing the internet on your PC for ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked through some porn, going to the typical sites you usually went to when you were a guy, but you noticed you weren't really finding the women attractive anymore.  You were still horny though, and when you stumbled upon a video of guy giving anal to a girl, you suddenly felt your nipples getting hard and you began massaging them as you watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you weren't really getting off this way, and it was only making you hornier and hornier, which caused your brain to fog up again, and you started desperately trying to find a way to orgasm.  Finally you tried the vibrator again, but you decided to stick it in your other hole this time, and you found it glorious.  As you watched the girl get pounded, and used the vibrator on your own ass, you were cumming in no time when you imagined it was your ass that was getting pounded.  You were embarrassed and humiliated that that is what it took to get you off this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your mind was now mostly clear again, and you shut everything off and cleaned up the juices you'd left all over the place.  It was starting to worry you that it was getting harder and harder to masturbate each time, and each time it was getting harder to stop yourself from being horny and clear your mind.  You started to wonder if this was part of Mary's mental condition or if she was simply a nympho and that somehow was left behind in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decided to give it more thought later, as all the masturbation took a lot out of you, and you hadn't slept once since you had gotten Mary's body a few days ago.  Her mind was usually racing too quickly to fall asleep, and you were spending your whole evenings studying everything from her fashion notes and everything about how she lived her life.  You now knew enough about Mary to pass yourself off as her to anyone but her closest family, but as a result you hadn't slept once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally was catching up to you as you practically passed out immediately upon laying down to relax on your bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you fell asleep, your body seemed to not want to wake up for many hours, catching up on all the days you hadn't slept so far.  However, you began to dream about strange things, eventually turning into a dream about Steve.  You saw him and blushed, feeling like you needed him and loved him.  The two of you made out for what felt like hours in the dream, before finally having sex, again, and again, and again.  Each time in the dream you got hornier and hornier, and nothing could seem to calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped awake in a hot sweaty mess, realizing your whole body was wracked with sexual desire.  Your heart was pounding and your nipples were hard as a rock.  You absent mindedly played with them since you were already nude, and it gave you some pleasure, but didn't do anything to reduce the horniness, only made it worse.  You felt like you needed something inside you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finding it very hard to think straight, with your hormones raging through your body, suppressing your intellect and making you only think about sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap\u2026 brain is cloudy again\u2026\" You said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to try and masturbate again, using the vibrator on yourself several times, but nothing could seem to get you to orgasm.  You rummaged through Mary's other sex toys, finding things that went on your nipples, other types of vibrators, even some bondage gear, but none of would have helped anyways, so you simply threw everything back in the drawer and tried to forget about it.  You couldn't though, because it was all your body was desiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, I'm like some kind of nympho now\u2026  My body seems to be telling me something.  I really need to sleep with a real man, not one of these toys\u2026  Yeah I think I'd like that\u2026 Mmm\u2026\"  You said to yourself, rubbing your nipples and pussy once again at the thought of a real dick inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally those kinds of thoughts would have been horrifying to your old self, but Mary's brain chemistry was wired a certain way, and your thought matrix had already been adapted to be compatible with Mary's chemistry.  Without this kind of adaptation, your body swap machine would not have been successful, and the brain would reject your thought matrix.  Of course none of these thoughts you were having right now, since your thoughts were too clouded to even ponder such advanced topics, the only thing you wanted at the moment was a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked at the clock, you realized it was already the midafternoon, and your date was in a few hours!  You realized this was your chance to seduce Steve, which shouldn't be hard since you suspected he might actually like you already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why wouldn't he\u2026 Mary's body is actually quite sexy when dressed up right.  I mean my body\u2026 sorry Mary but this is me now.\"  You said to thin air as you rummaged through YOUR wardrobe to find the perfect outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found the perfect dress, a sexy black dress that was very form fitting at the top, but had a Lolita-ish skirt at the bottom, that flared out a bit.  From Mary's notes on the dress (your new photographic memory had memorized all of her notes by now), you knew that it had a built in push-up mesh to make your perky breasts stand out more, and enhance your cleavage.  This pleased you for some reason, and you picked out a pair of black leather knee high boots to go with it, and thigh high socks underneath, revealing just a little leg under the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were satisfied, you quickly took a shower, making sure to use the correct scented shampoos and body lotion that Mary left behind, until you came out of the shower clean and smelling heavenly.  You then spent an hour styling your hair, which was difficult since you had usually just brushed it straight.  This time you tried to tease it out and use the products from Mary's notes and from videos you saw online.  If there was one thing your clouded brain was still good at, was making yourself look sexy in order to get laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy with how the hair turned out, and then made sure to put a lot of effort into a clean and natural looking makeup style that wouldn't overdo it.  You ended up with a smoky eye look that actually turned out better than you'd planned, and would surely look sexy to Steve\u2026  In fact, you were sure this entire outfit you'd planned would be irresistible to Steve and most guys at the restaurant most likely.  You smiled and giggled a bit as you realized how much you'd changed in the last week.  But you just attributed it to Mary's brain chemistry and didn't pay any mind to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered for a moment if you could make a device that would alter your brain chemistry to be a little less nympho\u2026 but your clouded brain couldn't think of any implementation details at the moment, so you simply dropped the subject for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget all that, I need to do well on this date!  You're damn sexy Mary, you can do this!\"  You reassured yourself with a cute wink in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

He smiled at you and looked you up and down before tilting his head with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Mary, I'm feeling a bit underdressed now.  You didn't have to go all out like that, but I appreciate the effort.  You look beautiful.\"  He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually blushed at being complimented like that, \"Thank you, and you're not that underdressed.  A man like yourself can be very handsome in a suit, it looks good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling a bit embarrassed at the fact that you were complimenting a man on his appearance, but part of you knew you had to do this to make the date successful.  If you weren't able to seduce him, you weren't sure if you'd ever clear up your mind anytime soon.  The other part of you was actually genuinely attracted to him however, you hoped that was Mary's brain and not your own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slung the tiny, black purse around your arm, and followed him into the car, making sure to not flash the world your panties, due to the shortness of your dress.  You sat awkwardly in the car, while he drove to the restaurant, and tried to make small talk about how work was going, and occasionally slipping in compliments about your appearance.  You arrived at the restaurant after a short drive, and when you walked inside you realized it was quite high end, and you slipped your arm around his as the host showed you to your seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem opposed to you clinging to his arm, and it felt natural to you due to your shortness.  Even with the four inch heels he still towered over you, and the physical contact made you feel warm inside, and a bit tingly down below.  He kindly pulled out your chair for you, making you feel like a proper lady, and soon you were both sat down ordering your meal.  You decided to get a fruity alcoholic drink that you had a feeling this body would enjoy, and you weren't wrong.  You definitely had a taste for those kinds of girly drinks now, even though you knew it had a lot of alcohol in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited for your food, Steve attempted to discuss work again.  \"So Mary, after all I've seen so far, I'm very impressed.  Yesterday you obviously proved to me that you're more than just a fashion designer with high math scores.  Though I will say, your fashion never fails to impress me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, \"Thank you, I do put a lot of care into the outfits I choose.  Actually this one I designed myself during college, it's one of my favorites.\"  You said, remembering that the original Mary really had designed this dress herself, it was all in her notes.</span></div></div>",

Eventually when he was nearly finished, you couldn't wait any longer and had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Steve\u2026 you mentioned that I should be more than an assistant\u2026 I think I proved that I'm pretty smart, and I think I should get a higher position.\"  You said, though not as tactfully as you could have.  The clouded thoughts were making it hard to formulate your argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026 you're definitely smarter than I thought, or at least you have flashes of brilliance.  I thought it over, and I'd like to offer you a full time position as a researcher on my team.  I realize you're definitely more than an assistant, and I know you'll be a valuable asset to the team.\"  Steve offered with a charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second that you could do better than that, and your intelligence made you deserve being the head of the project, not just a rookie team member.  But those thoughts were muddled by the hormones rushing through your veins, and you knew you couldn't present your argument right now.  The only thing your body knew right now was: If you can't get what you want through reason, try seduction instead.  It was the only option your hormone clouded brain could think of at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer Steve, thank you!  It's only been a week and you're already accepting me as part of the team wow!\"  You faked enthusiasm.  \"I mean, it's really hard joining a new team though, especially when everyone looks down on me as some girl who doesn't have a PhD or qualifications, it's been a really rough week.  I'd really like to become friends with the other folks at the lab, but they haven't really accepted me yet,\" you finished with a bit of a pouty face to give him a guilt trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve seemed to fall for it, \"Oh don't think that!  They'll come around, they just need time to get to know you.  And for the record, I've always been willing to give you a chance from the start.  I mean, here we are at a fancy dinner together, and you got all dressed up for me, are we not friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head a bit and raised your eyebrows, \"Are we now?\" you asked with a playful smile.  \"It seems like something people who are trying to be more than friends would do\u2026\" you then took a sip of your fruity drink, not breaking eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you a curious look, not sure whether you were being forward or just messing with his head, \"We're obviously just two coworkers, enjoying a nice evening out.  Anything else that happens after that is\u2026 completely off the record though.  What if two 'friends' were to meet up somewhere after dinner to enjoy a few drinks and a movie.

I seem to be at a disadvantage here as my house is all out of wine, and my selection of movies isn't anything to brag about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real conversation ended at that point, and the rest was all meaningless small talk.

You rummaged around in your purse for your house keys, still not quite used to the fact that you had a purse at all, but it came with the territory you supposed.  Once inside, Steve was taken aback at the state of your apartment.  You had done some cleaning since you had acquired this body, but some of Mary's notes were still scattered around, the ones that you hadn't compiled into notebooks yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve marveled at all of the scribblings and drawings of all sorts of things that your body's previous occupant had written down, most of which were fashion designs, but also some artistic drawings and paintings of one thing or another.  You swept some of them aside to offer him a seat on the couch, and then clicked over to the kitchen to pour him a glass of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad apartment, spacious for someone of your age, right out of college right?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and don't mind the clutter, I don't usually have guests.\"  You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first handed the glass to him, and then set yours on the coffee table.  You then unbuckled the straps on your knee-high boots, and kicked them off to the side, revealing your black thigh-high sock clad feet to him, and wiggling your toes.  \"Sorry, those things are so constrictive after a long day wearing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mary I think that's the first time I've seen you without heels, I had no idea you were so short.  I mean, not that that's a bad thing, just caught me off guard.\"  Steve said, correcting himself when you gave him a snotty look at his comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was on, you could tell he was surprised by your choice in movie, since it wasn't the typical movie he assumed a young fashionable Asian girl to watch.  You'd chosen a science fiction drama about a man who changes his appearance to solve crimes, and you found it fitting due to your research on body swapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie itself was irrelevant, you knew, and you made sure to snuggle up close to him and kept the bottle of wine close, to refill both of your cups.  You wanted to be pretty drunk by the time the sex came, since the part of your mind that used to be male was still freaking out over what you were about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve seemed to get the hint, and wrapped his arm around you, letting you snuggle close and rest your head on his shoulder.  The movie was full of drama and action, and some tragedy, and you felt yourself actually tearing up over the sad parts when the lead character died.  Steve held you closer when he noticed this, and then as the main character's daughter got revenge at the end, he actually leaned over and rubbed his nose on your neck, before giving you a brief kiss on the cheek.  You knew he was all in now.  You'd gone through the necessary courting ritual and now he was ready.</span></div></div>",

He was shocked at first by how aggressive you were suddenly being, but he got into it and the two of you began making out vigorously on the couch.

You threw the covers off the bed and bounced down on it giggling, as he followed, climbing onto the bed himself with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of kissing, you slipped out of your dress, revealing your perky breasts since you were wearing no bra underneath.  He began to play with your nipples a bit, and then took off his own shirt.  Whenever he touched your nipples, your moans could have probably been heard by all the neighbors.  Your mind was more clouded than ever, obviously, and you could literally think of nothing but penetration now.  Your panties were starting to feel soaked with your juices just from the thoughts and the sensation on your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary you are so beautiful, your breasts are perfect, but are you sure you want to do this?\"  Steve asked, taking his hands off your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure\u2026 now fuck me harder than anyone's ever been fucked!\"  You almost yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants practically flew off and your panties were nowhere to be seen as he was eager to obey your order.  He wasn't expecting you to want it so badly, but once his dick got inside you, there was nothing else in the world as far as you were concerned.  You were laid on your back accepting his manhood inside you, but it felt like you were floating on a cloud in the sky.  Everything in existence was happening inside your vagina at the moment.  You lost all sense of reality as each thrust brought you closer and closer\u2026 until finally, your whole body felt like a lightning strike and your muscles all contracted, including the ones around his member.</span></div></div>",

However this new one you planned to be able to swap a dozen times at least, before needing charging, this however was partly due to your new device being more power efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lab however, you had built a prototype machine that ran off DC power and could recharge in about an hour to do one swap.  It wasn't very power efficient, and the device was the size of a room, but it was good enough for testing the functionality of it.  The functionality was leagues ahead of your old one, being able to selectively swap certain portions of a brain, rather than the entire mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had isolated several locations of the thought matrix that could be swapped without complications, including things like tastes: what foods a person likes, what music, what clothing, etc.  The problem was that all of these personal tastes would be swapped together, there was no way to identify which was which, since they were all stored in the same neuron clusters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd also found the cluster that contained sexual preference, but it was tied closely to the hormone center of the brain, and you weren't quite sure how that tied into your accelerated brain functions.

I'll see you tomorrow, I really gotta start losing weight... this outfit doesn't fit the way it used to apparently...\"  he said as he wandered off back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up driving home in Steve's clothes, walking into your apartment with a very clear mind and sitting down at your desk.  You shuffled around your papers and noticed how itchy your loose shirt was around your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... I don't remember wearing such itchy material... this shirt is starting to chafe my nipples...\"  You said, rubbing your breasts through your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts wobbled around freely with no bra inside the loose male shirt, and it was really breaking your concentration.  You wanted to start designing some new ideas with your newly cleared mind but with all this itchiness on your chest, and your pants nearly falling down when you walked, you knew something was wrong.  You unbuttoned the shirt and stood there bare chested, wondering what was wrong.  These breasts seemed so normal to you, but they never used to give you problems with your clothes before.  You double checked your ID, which you had never put back in Steve's purse, and simply taken with you.  It still read 'Mary Huang', and showed 'your' cute female face which you'd grown accustomed to over the past month.  However you noticed in the ID, you were wearing what looked to be a low cut top, which looked very different from your current style of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she just wore a weird outfit when she had her ID picture taken... still though, something is definitely wrong.\" You said as you walked shirtless over to your huge closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the closet door you were shocked to find it full of... \"Dresses?  Leather outfits?  High heels?!  What the fuck...  These are all stuff Steve would... wear...  Oh shit.  No these are all fit perfectly for my body.  Of course how could I be so stupid!  These ARE my clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you put on a better fitting outfit so you can concentrate on your inventions, even though your brain will feel like its cross dressing?  It's possible you could try to convert your portable swapping device into a behavior modifier that will alter your brain to accept these clothes as yours, but such a function would be untested.  Or should you just tough it out and keep wearing Steve's clothes until tomorrow when you can switch things back to normal.  </span></div></div>",

Those are most definitely NOT your clothes Mary.  Look how terribly they fit you.  Were you doing anything in the lab last night after I left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I ended up getting the new power core working and tested the device a few times.  I ended up swapping Steve with the lab monkey, and then swapped him back again and it was fine after that...\"  You said, leaving out the part where things malfunctioned and you were in each other's bodies for a while and had sex in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara snorted, \"You swapped Steve with the monkey?! Oh wow, how fitting... That's amazing we've got things working though! But Mary... I think you might have to check up on what happened, I think the machine affected your mind somehow.  You are wearing Steve's clothes and don't even seem bothered by it.  The Mary I know is way too fashion conscious to be caught dead in an outfit like this.\"</span></div></div>",

You also looked at the man's face and struggled any kind of recollection, but you had never seen this man before.  He was not much younger than Steve, but much more attractive.  He was very well groomed and well dressed, and you felt your female body tingle with a brief attraction towards the man.

I don't see many other people like that around here?\"  He said with a charming grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were even more disturbed now, but he could have guessed all of those things just by looking at you right now.  You were indeed short, Chinese, and wearing a blue and white Lolita style harajuku dress, but those were oddly specific things for him to point out, because they were what made you stand out from every other employee in the building.

You were still wearing your high heeled boots, which normally you were quite graceful in, but now your whole sense of balance seemed to be off, along with your ability to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be whatever he drugged me with\u2026 I could probably think of a way out of here\u2026 but uh\u2026\" You trailed off, losing concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stumbled your way across the room, feeling a wall with your hands, and following it to a doorknob.  When you tested it, of course it was locked, and from the outside most likely\u2026  The room had the feeling of a bedroom but it had no windows and locked from the outside, strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  You called out to anyone listening. \"Where am I?  Somebody help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no responses, just more silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't find anything interesting by feeling around the room, so you simply sat back down on the comfortable bed, smoothing out your dress as you did.  As you lay back and got comfortable, you felt yourself zoning out as your clouded mind lost all focus and you simply stared into the blackness, lost in meaningless thoughts for who knows how long\u2026</span></div></div>",

I didn't expect you to try that until much later.  You're such a dirty girl\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like the man from the parking garage for sure.  Your eyes slowly adjusted and you made out a blurry shape that resembled him, and the rest of the room which looked like a plain bedroom just as you suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I here, who are you?\"  You mumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you're here because I brought you here.  I need to make sure you are who I think you are.  Is this familiar to you?\" The man asked, holding up something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted to get a better look at it, and your eyes had adjusted enough to recognize that it was your portable swapping device, which resembled an mp3 player!  Your eyes went wide as he held it, dangling the ear buds in front of you.  You looked shocked to see it, but your mind was so dumb right now you couldn't even come close to connecting the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whhhy do you have that?  That's mine!\"  You blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Yours is it?  I thought your name was Mary\u2026?  That is what you go by now isn't it?  You see I remember this belonged to a boy named Luke\u2026 he was quite the inventor.\"  The man smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026 you know Luke? How is he doing, and his family?\" You said, not thinking about how this guy was probably dangerous, but simply being worried for your family once reminded of them.  Your clouded brain could only think about one thing at a time right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man simply chuckled at your reaction.  \"Oh wow, this is just too easy.

I know you aren't the original occupant of that\u2026 adorable little Chinese woman's body.  But you do play the part well I must say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 I used to be Luke\u2026 but that life is behind me now.  I'm Mary Huang now!  This is the life I chose to live!\" You said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great Mary, I'm so happy for you.  But that doesn't fix my little problem that you're going to fix for me.  You see, your invention, the body swap machine that Luke made, stopped working.  I realize now I was a fool to try and impersonate you without all of your knowledge.  I could only control your inventions but when it came to making new ones or fixing the old ones, I failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impersonate me\u2026?\" Your clouded brain worked like molasses trying to connect the dots, until finally a dim spark. \"Wait! You're that guy! I was Robin at the time I think\u2026 And you stole her body from me! Why would you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you had a body swap device\u2026 duh.\"  The man said sarcastically, \"And after I became Robin, I realized that she wasn't the actual owner of the device.  As fun as it was being a cute teen girl, I swapped back with 'Luke' and tried to pretend being you for a while.  Eventually your family and friends grew suspicious and I was forced to move my operations out of your garage.  I swapped with this business man who owns his own property where I could store your equipment, and I left him to fend for himself in Luke's body.  He was a nice enough man I'm sure he adapted just fine to the change\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you kidnapping me then?  You obviously figured out how to use the body swap machine, even though it's an old obsolete model\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're stupid piece of shit doesn't work anymore!  I swapped into this body and moved it all to a secure location, and then it stopped working!\"  He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, \"Oh well that sucks for you\u2026  I don't know what you want me to do about it though. Like you said I'm as dumb as nails now\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to help me you little bitch! Fix the damn machine or you'll stay down here for a good long while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pushed you backwards onto the bed and grabbed one of your breasts with one hand, through your dress.  The other hand held you down as he got on top of you.  When he began squeezing your tit and rubbing your nipple, you felt yourself getting hornier than ever, and even a little wet down below.  You were moaning, though you weren't sure why you found pleasure in it, but your body wanted this somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that huh? You picked a beautiful body you know\u2026 but it seems to be betraying you at every turn.  If you agree to fix your machine, I will give you the pleasure you need.

If you won't fix my machine then you'll stay on that drug until you do.  I hope you enjoy being my slutty fuck toy in the meantime, I'm going to make you beg to be allowed to orgasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he tore off your dress, stripping you nude, and you did nothing to stop him.  You felt helpless and your mind was losing track of what was going on.  Everything was happening so quickly and you couldn't keep up anymore.  All you wanted was to orgasm and finally clear your mind.  As you lay there nude, he unzipped his own pants and began thrusting between your legs.  Eventually he came in your asshole, but you weren't even close to orgasming thanks to the drugs in your body.  It was the most pleasurable form of torture you could have imagined, and your body kept wanting more somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was done with you for now, and left the room without a word, letting you lay on the bed with his seed leaking out of your ass.  He returned a moment later with a box of clothes, if that's what you could call them.  There was a slutty PVC dress which was designed to enhance your cleavage with a built in corset, and had such a short skirt that you might as well just be wearing a big belt.  You were given crotchless panties to wear underneath, and a bra that boosted your cleavage even further.  To top it off he made you wear ridiculous six inch platform heels that came up to your thighs with tied laces all the way up to the top.  They would be impossible for you to take off quickly, and your clouded brain wasn't even sure how to untie the laces right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself, dressed like a bit of a whore, and felt ashamed that you were still so horny from all of this.  Getting fucked by the body thief had turned you on so much, but you were unable to orgasm, and it brought your mind to an all-time low.  Your intellect right now was about the equivalent of a high school dropout turned prostitute who thought of nothing but sex.  You knew there was no way you'd be able to fix anything in this state, but you no longer possessed the willpower to fight back anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this outfit? It suits a whore like you, my beautiful slut.\"  The man said, stroking your hair.  Somehow this 'compliment' was making you feel good inside, like you were pleasing him by being sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one last thing,\" he said, as he opened up another box.</span></div></div>",

He put your dress back in place and let you get used to the odd feeling of being penetrated all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is this?\" you asked softly, \"It feels so weird\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, that's a device that will keep you in line.

Normally you would be analyzing the situation and trying to determine what kind of house this was, and how you could escape, but your brain was completely fogged over and useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever this drug that your captor had given you was making it impossible to overcome the effects of your unique brain chemistry.

But none of these things you were able to think about in detail right now, you just knew that you were feeling truly afraid for perhaps the first time in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to summon up more courage than usual by simply not being able to fully process the situation, and found it easy to take a step over the threshold into the black hallway. Your platform heels stepped silently along a carpeted floor, but you still found yourself wobbling on them and taking small careful steps. Partly because you were still woozy from being drugged, but also not being used to heels this high, and walking in pure darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands felt along the wall as you slowly made your way into the darkness.

You had no idea who was talking to you, but clearly, it should have been obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...who?\" Were the only words you could mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just laughed, \"Oh man... Look how far you've fallen, 'Mary'. One of the most brilliant minds reduced to being unable to form a complete sentence. With the push of a button, I can bring you to be driven by your most primal instincts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was using way too many big words for you to comprehend at the moment, so you just opened your eyes and tried to focus on him.

Don't worry, you'll get lots of experience watching the experts do what they do, and hopefully you'll learn some things, Stephanie.

Miss Huang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now Clara, I'm sorry that you got mixed up in all this, collateral damage and all.  I've seen that you're a very intelligent girl though, and they don't treat you with enough respect around here.  That will change now, as you're no longer an assistant, you are a full fledged researcher, with your own office.

Clark for the time being, since she doesn't look like much of a Clara.  You also find yourself once again attracted to Steve's body, even more so now that you know it's not occupied by that asshole Steve, and Clara is actually a rather nice person...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to make a device that swaps ONLY sexual preference, then I could maybe stop getting turned on every time I see that cute face of his...

You had been under the impression that this was a simple mind swap, but you discovered the device was obviously much more than that, and was capable of storing physical body data and manipulating the matter of a person's body to match.  This was quite a breakthrough, you thought to yourself, and you were surprised no one else here seemed to realize what had just happened.  Everyone was instead focusing on the fact that Steve's body was likely lost forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news guys,\" you said, \"This thing was never designed to store data, meaning Steve's body just went ~poof~!  Sorry Steve, but that's what happens when you run untested prototypes way beyond their intended usage.  It looks like you're stuck with that body until we can design a new prototype that can give you someone else's body.  It's possible we could <i>copy</i> the appearance of someone else, without swapping, and give it to you, but we'd never be able to just recreate your body.  That is gone for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... poop.  But how come Clara is normal, and I gots boobies?\"  Steve said in a female voice, as he played with his large breasts which were identical to Clara's, and he was wearing identical clothing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it dumbass!\" Clara said as she rolled her eyes, \"You are making me look like a complete idiot, at least we can tell each other apart by our face.  Look, you're probably going to be stuck as a woman for a while, until we fix up a new prototype.  So you're going to need to learn to not play with yourself in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and suddenly Tramp's voice came over the speaker phone, you had forgotten he was still there.  He sighed, \"Alright well, let's make that your top priority then.  Figure out how that prototype managed to change Steve's body and make a better one that actually works!  Then you can at least give Steve a male body again, and hopefully some intelligence as well.  I don't care how you do it just get it done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the call was ended.  You looked over to Clara, who was now back to her normal self, and she looked quite happy with how things turned out.  She'd gained a lot of intellect, and Steve was now humiliated and had no power to harass the women anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara turned to Mary and said, \"So with Steve in this condition, I think you should be in charge of the next project Mary, or do you want to go by Miss Huang?\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other researchers who had gathered around the scene slowly looked at each other and were unsure whether to trust you or not.  Some seemed to support you, and others thought this was all your fault still.  You decided to ignore the group for now, and respond directly to Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary is fine. And thank you Clara, I'm pretty excited to get started on a device like this, it has great potential.  The rest of you can do whatever it is your jobs are, but I'm making Clara my partner on this one.  Not assistant, <i>partner</i>.  Since she is the smartest person here now, other than me of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looked at you with a glimmer in her eyes, and smirked, \"Thank you Mary, I'd be happy to work with you on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if she was looking at you in admiration or attraction, but there was definitely something behind the look she gave you just then.  You thought for a moment, and looked over to Steve, realizing that the attraction you'd once had for him was somehow still there, but much less than before.  His face on that body was confusing, but when you looked at Clara, the attraction was now even stronger!  Somehow Mary's body was now attracted to Clara's gorgeous feminine body!  Apparently you really were bisexual, and Steve's face on a Clara's body was just too confusing for your hormones to deal with right now.</span></div></div>",

However, you can\u2019t follow them right away, you left Charlot\u2019s bag with her friends, and since your skirt doesn\u2019t have any pockets, you guess she had her keys in the bag, so you go back to Charlot\u2019s friends just in time to see the real Charlot, in the body thief\u2019s body, get hauled off by paradmedics. Her friends ask where you ran off to, and you tell give them some excuse that they believe without question. You look in her bag and don\u2019t see any keys. Charlot must not have driven here, so you guess that one of her friends picked her up. You suggest going home, but the other girls want to keep hanging out. One of them offers to take you home after you say your not feeling good, and you accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short ride, you arrive at Charlot\u2019s house, which thankfully, is only a few blocks from your own house. You go inside, easily find Charlot\u2019s room, put her bag in there, and head out. You walk to your own house and when you\u2019re right outside the garage door, you hear shouting. Pressing your ear to the door, you listen to the shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you lose the core?!\u201d You hear your own voice. That must be Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I must\u2019ve dropped it, okay?! Do you think I want to be stuck as my brother\u2019s girlfriend?!\u201d You hear Robin\u2019s voice reply. The imposter was obviously still trying to pretend to be you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the perfect time to interrupt, so that\u2019s exactly what you do. You open the door, and walk in. Kyle was glaring daggers at the imposter, while Robin just seemed annoyed. Odd, you thought she would be even more upset than Kyle about you being stuck in her body. \u201cYou mean MY brother\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlot? What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d Kyle asked with your voice. \u201cAnd what\u2019re you talking about?\u201d You notice the imposter in Robin\u2019s body getting nervous. He obviously realized you recovered the core and swapped with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I\u2019M Luke, the person in you\u2019ve been shouting at is some fat asshole who stole Robin\u2019s body from me. He dropped the core after that, and I couldn\u2019t move very fast in his body, so I swapped with the first person I could, Charlot, to try and catch up to you guys, but you already left before I did.\u201d You crossed your arms and glared at the imposter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so some random creep is in my body? What the fuck?!\u201d Robin, in Kyle\u2019s body yelled, finally getting angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying obviously. She\u2019s probably some stranger who stole the core when I wasn\u2019t looking and took Charlot\u2019s body to trick you into thinking she\u2019s me.\u201d The imposter claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? If I was just some stranger who stole a body swapping core, why would I go straight to the people I stole it from and pretend to be the person who BUILT it when I could be ANYONE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a point.\u201d Kyle said, glaring at the imposter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE\u2019S got a point you mean jerk.\u201d You say, throwing a wad of paper at him that was sitting on a workbench next to you. \u201cAnd besides, if you\u2019re really Luke, then what\u2019s your middle name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imposter hesitated, before finally slumping his shoulders. \u201cFine, I\u2019m not really Luke. But there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re putting me back in my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re sure as hell getting out of MY body!\u201d Robin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not getting either of OURS.\u201d You added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital, and we\u2019re putting you back in your own body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell we are. I\u2019m not going anywhere but my new home. See you losers later.\u201d The imposter looked at Kyle. \u201cAnd you can say goodbye to this ass because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m dating you.\u201d The imposter started to walk out, but stopped when Robin grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re NOT taking my body.\u201d She glared even harder at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? You were fine with not being able to return to your body when you thought I was Luke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I felt guilty about putting him in my body in the first place.\u201d Robin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t have a thing for him?\u201d The imposter gave a sly smile while looking between you and Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! He\u2019s a nice guy, but I\u2019m dating Kyle, not Luke.\u201d She paused for a moment. During that moment...</span></div></div>",

This thing is dangerous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imposter finally lets free a cheer once Kyle and Robin are gone. Your body might not be spectacular, but it's young, healthy, and owns a body switching machine. He could gain control of any body he desired, and become immortal! He looks in the mirror, stroking your chin, and says repeatedly. \"Luke. Luke. My name is Luke. I'm a genius scientist. Luke. Teenage boy. Luke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body releases a baby-corrupting evil grin, as he decides on his next move.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure what your life at home with your family was like and he wasn't going to stick around long enough to find out. Slipping out of your bed and into some new clothes for the day, he grabbed the portable core and began to tip-toe out of the house. As he did so he grinned at the novelty of not feeling aches and pains in all of his joints. Years of neglect had meant his original body was in pretty poor shape, and he didn't envy you for having to deal with it. As he stepped out of the house and breathed in the fresh morning air he brimmed with excitement. He took off towards the bus stop, running just because he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had planned last night, the thief took your body to the fancy gym on the far side of town. His logic was simple, a nicer gym meant nicer bodies, and coming in the morning meant that there would be fewer people there so he'd have an easier time picking someone off. In order for this to go off without a hitch he'd have to be careful about who he picked. Getting into your body had been a great windfall but running up to you and switching into your body in a public place had been risky and there were many ways it could have gone wrong. Switching into someone in front of a crowd of people would cause too many problems, he had to pick someone he could get alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind he surveyed the gym and found several likely options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious candidate was the fit young man doing leg presses by himself in the front room. A tall, classically handsome guy, he was every inch the college stud the thief had always been jealous of. If he was looking for a fresh start and some fun he'd probably find both in this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso intriguing was the muscular man lifting free weights towards the back of the gym. He was a bit older (the thief judged him to be around his mid-30s) but he was a rough looking dude covered in tattoos, which the thief appreciated. The idea of being a tough guy was certainly appealing to the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third person who caught his eye was a woman he saw running on an elliptical nearby. She was drop dead gorgeous, so much so that the thief couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the portable core in your pocket, he mulled over his choices.

He was at least six feet and sculpted by the gods, his tight athletic wear shirt hugging every muscle just right. Your impostor didn't even know that you could see abs through someone's shirt, but apparently you could. When he took a big swig from his water bottle, several drops dripping down his neck towards his chest it was downright pornographic. That was it; he had to have him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was wearing a tight athletic fit shirt and was working up quite a sweat, so the thief assumed that the man would head to the locker room to change after he was done, which would be the perfect opportunity. The thief tried to busy himself as he waited for the man to finish his workout. He toyed with the idea of actually trying some exercises just to pass the time but your physique wasn't exactly inspiring. He mused for a moment how ironic it was that he was insulting your body when you could likely do things that he could never do in his old body; he had always told himself that if exercise were easy he wouldn't have a problem with it but now, in your relatively in shape body, he still had no inclination towards it. He was snapped out of his self-reflection when he saw that his target had placed the weights he was using down and was headed towards the locker room. This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body snatcher gripped the swapping device in his pocket with a nervous energy. He knew firsthand that it worked but the technology seemed so outlandish he had no idea if the core would even work again. He cursed himself for not snooping more while he was at your house to figure out the finer points of the device, but he figured he had the basics of it. One earbud in his ear, one in yours, press the button. With this in mind, he surreptitiously followed the man into the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locker room was, fortunately enough, deserted other than the two of them. Your impostor slipped behind a row of lockers and peeked over at the young man. His target had been wearing headphones (wireless headphones, the thief noted, which were expensive) when he walked in, so he likely hadn't heard anyone sneaking in behind him. He had taken his earbuds out and was opening his locker, meaning he was vulnerable. This was the moment of truth! Slipping one earbud into his own ear, the thief pounced on his prey.</span></div></div>",

Even without looking down the thief could tell that he was in a new body because the feeling of having this many muscles, having a body this tight and powerful, was almost indescribable. He felt the burn of the workout this body had just been through but it was invigorating rather than unpleasant, a promise of what this body was capable of. He stared down at his new strong hands and curled his fingers open and shut once, testing that this body was truly his. If the thief had thought that shedding his old, overweight body in exchange for your young, fresh one had been an upgrade, but this really took the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the\u2013?\" Snapped out of his reverie, the thief looked up to see Luke's body staring at him in shock. Before the former stud could process what was happening, the body snatcher socked him in the face, knocking him out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" He exclaimed, impressed by his new strength. He flexed his arms and patted the bulging muscle, still pumped from their workout. He'd have to measure them later because they seemed huge. Putting them to the test he reached down and deadlifted Luke's body, his new body making it practically effortless. Slinging the unconscious boy over his shoulder he carried him into the depths of the locker room until he found a small maintenance closet. He tossed the boy in there (gently, of course, he wasn't a complete monster) and stared down at the crumpled body of the former boy genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the ride Luke, but I think it's time I moved on.\" He said mockingly to the unconscious form. \"And hey, buddy, whatever your name is, thanks for getting this body into such great shape for me.

Stepping in front of a full length mirror, the thief peeled himself out of the sweaty shirt he'd interrupted this boy from removing earlier. The guy's shirt hadn't left much to the imagination, but any sort of imagination paled to the his physique. Toned and muscular (but not freakishly so) the boy had clearly put a lot of attention into developing a beautiful body. His pecs jutted out from his chest over a tight set of abs, which felt amazing under the thief's greedy hands. His body seemed like nothing but miles of smooth skin pulled tight over muscle. This was the thief's first time being up close and personal with another man's body, and what an introduction it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in closer to the mirror, he examined his new face. The boy had clear, tanned skin, full lips and piercing brown eyes that peeked out behind a mop of shaggy brown hair. However a strong jaw and a button nose kept him from being too much of a pretty boy. He had a sort of \"boy-next-door\" charm about him, if the boy next door had been a model. He gave an experimental smile, and when he saw that the boy had a mouth full of straight white teeth, he practically beamed. He began testing different facial expressions, contorting his handsome face into different goofy expressions and twisting his face to profile to examine it from every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have spent hours in front of that mirror but people were beginning to finish up their workouts and filter in to the locker room. He needed to take this somewhere a bit more private. There would be plenty of time to explore this body in more detail later, right now he needed to get out of the gym and away from Luke's body. Tearing himself reluctantly away from the mirror he went to the locker to collect his things. He found a gym bag (which he made sure to tuck the body swap device securely into) and found a change of clothes and a wallet inside of it. Opening the wallet, he found his new driver's license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jacob Ender, 23 years old</i> it read. Jacob. The thief could get used to that. There was a home address as well, which seemed like as good a place as any to start. Jacob's phone had a fingerprint lock, but fortunately he was currently in possession of the correct fingerprints, so in a flash he found himself snooping through the phone's contents. The thief could easily get a feel for Jacob's personality from his texts (a lot of the messages, the thief noted, were from girls) and Jacob kept his schedule on his calendar, so the thief could easily slot into his life if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he swiped through pictures on Jacob\u2019s phone he was surprised to see how many of them were shots of him barely clothed. The dude was hot but this was a little self obsessed. When he spotted a logo in the corner of one of the shots, Terry\u2019s eyes widened. He'd seen these photos before in a magazine. The kid was a model! A fucking underwear model! He\u2019d hit the jackpot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching around back, he slipped his hands beneath the waistband of his boxers to grope his nice, pert ass. As he squeezed the firm globes he made eye contact with Jacob\u2019s face in the mirror and smiled. \u201cDamn son, you really knew how to fill out a pair of briefs. Don\u2019t worry though,\u201d he said as he brought his hands around to cup his new, prodigious bulge. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of your moneymakers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on the tight blue v-neck and shorts that this body's old owner had conveniently packed for him, he headed out of the gym and towards his new life. This was his second chance, and he was going to welcome it with open, muscular arms.</span></div></div>",

Even worse, you're an adult, and have new found responsibilities. But, forgot about those, you should at least try to have fun as your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go look at mom's clothes!\" you think. You figure that you're a woman now, might as well act like one. You walk into your parent's room and head for the bathroom where your mother's closet is. Her closet is incredible, it's about as big as your room. She has tons of clothes, honestly, too many clothes. You look through all of her dresses and blouses and pants and skirts. After about fifteen minutes of looking, you feel exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even imagine shopping, then,\" you say to yourself. You found yourself sitting in the closet, just relaxing. You figure you might as well get up do something. As you get up, you catch a glimpse of your mom in the mirror. You were stunned. You always knew your mother was pretty, but there was something about looking at her through her own eyes. You start to pose in front of the mirror, and enjoy yourself a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself, \"Let's put in something nicer, just to see how I look. I mean, how Mom looks.\" You start looking through the clothes again and find the perfect outfit. It was difficult to take off your mother's skirt and denim jacket, but you managed. You tried not to look in the mirror with just her bra and panties on, but you caught a small glimpse of it. It took a while, but you finally managed to put on the nicer outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I make Mom look good,\" you say to yourself. You can't stop looking at your mother in the mirror. You feel like you can see a different side of her. But, you blow it off for now, and leave the closet a huge mess, for your mom to clean up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now? You look nice, still have plenty of the day left. Maybe do the dishes? Nah, too much work. Vacuum the house? Too hard to set up the vacuum. You decide to just do what YOU would want to do. You go back to the garage and start messing with the machine a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about six hours of that, you manage to create a mini, portable body swap machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even as Mom, I still got it!\" you proudly say to yourself. You look at the machine, and figure it might be more useful than the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, your father walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim? What are you doing in here, honey?\" Mark raised his voice in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think of an excuse. \"Uh, uh, just admiring our son's genius work! It's an uh, a uh, uh, new microwave!\" Well, the excuses couldn't possibly work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he really is smart. You should start dinner soon, okay?\" Mark leaves the garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, dodged a bullet there. You sit around wondering where your mom was. You figure she has your cell phone so you call her up. She went out with your friend David, and your friend Jessica. You ask her to come home so you can switch back now. She agrees and comes home. You decide to try to mini machine, and it works like a charm! Your mom cooks dinner, and after you eat, you go to bed for the night. You figure you can use the new mini machine tomorrow even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you wonder where to use your new machine at. Since it's Saturday, you have all day to play around with it.</span></div></div>",

She waved at you, and you waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Donaldson is 35 years old, and is still very good looking for her age. She is a vegetarian, and enjoys being outside.

The process is much longer for the laser rather than the original machine, but still works great. You start to get your vision back, and notice that you're lying on the ground. As you get up, you notice that it is much more difficult because of Mary's skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, this is incredible!\" you hear your voice say.

For some reason, you were really attracted to Mary, you always thought she was pretty. But, you didn't want to invade her personal privacy. WAIT! That's what she's doing now! You rush back to your house, and into your room, to see that your body is sleeping on the floor. Oh! Mary still has the machine on, as well, you totally forgot about it. You take it off your wrist and try to wake up your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mary, get up. I want to swap back,\" you complain. Mary seems to be coming back to her senses now as she opens her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggghhhhh..... Huh, huh? Mary what are you doing here?\" your body says. Is this not Mary in your body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you plainly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Erika... I don't know what happened, my dweeb of a brother had a laser pointer, and he pointed at me, and I can't remember anything else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get ready, it's going to happen again.\" You point the laser at your body, and press the button. You wake up, and see Mary's body asleep and snoring. You need to find Erika's body to fix everything up here. How will you find it?</span></div></div>",

As she went to answer the door, she felt a small pang of guilt over what she did to the former David. Overnight, his memories had seemingly vanished, making him an ordinary baby girl, though possibly with a boyish personality, but that won\u2019t become clear until he, or rather she, is much older. While walking to the front door, she examined the body swap device, trying to think of a way to charge it. However, when Gabby opened the door, she froze in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing in front of her, was her. Or rather her original body. Her former body looked at the body swapping device in her new body\u2019s hand and then stared her in the face, noticing her shock. \u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think a genius capable of making a body swapping device would actually let someone walk off with said device if they didn\u2019t have a way of tracking it did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t even thought about it.\u201d She replied. \u201cSoI guess you came for your device back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just thought I\u2019d drop by for a visit.\u201d Luke said sarcastically. \u201cOf course I\u2019m here for the device!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have it back. If you let me use it to get a new body after you\u2019ve charged it back up.\u201d Gabby offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s dead?\u201d Luke said absent-mindedly, before realizing what she said. \u201cWait, you steal my device and expect me to just accept your deal? It\u2019s mine! I\u2019m taking it back whether you like it or not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a man, and you\u2019re visiting my home. I could either overpower you, forcing you to charge it for me, or call the cops and say you\u2019re an intruder.\u201d Gabby smirked, thinking she had the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, I could use any of my countless inventions to force you to give it back to me, maybe even brainwash you.\u201d Luke smirked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you can\u2019t brainwash someone.\u201d Gabby stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI built a device that allows people to swap bodies by transplanting their minds, manipulating their minds would be child\u2019s play.\u201d Luke crossed his feminine arms in victory. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m getting my device back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.

But, close behind is your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust you picking out clothes,\" she says. She goes in the closet, and thirty seconds later she returns with the outfit in her hands. \"Just leave on my bra and my underwear, and slip into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little odd as you slipped off your mother's sweatpants and dirty t-shirt. She was watching you like a hawk while you undressed and dressed. She picked out a reddish tank top with a khaki skirt. She also grabbed some flip flops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too fancy, not yet at least,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had trouble getting her breasts not to fidget about in the tank top, but she did not help you. \"I want you to learn how to do all of... this,\" she claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you finally finish.

You just don't want to deal with her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour door starts to open up again. \"What now?!\" you yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your attitude, young man,\" your mother says, poking your head inside your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I thought you were Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at you, \"You need to start dinner, it'll look weird if I cooked as you.

It's your dad coming home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Da-- Mark!\" you stumble out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hun, how are you?\" he comes up and gives you a kiss on the lips. You were stunned. You've kissed a girl before, but never a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh... just fine, uh, Honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some uh, uh... pizza. I don't feel like uh... cooking tonight. Is that okay?\" you ask. You feel so awkward being around your father right now. That kiss was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, dinner popped out of the oven, and everyone, including yourself and your mother, sat at the table. Dinner was quiet. Every now and then you would catch Erika staring over at you, or your mother. It was unsettling.</span></div></div>",

You startet you rub the inside your pussy and soon put in a finger and started to finger yourself. You had to cover your mouth with your blanket because you started to moan.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were beat after spending a day as your mother. You undressed yourself, and noticed your mother's undressed body in the mirror. You were just wearing a bra and some panties. Your mother had definitely put on some weight after birthing three children. She was not fat by any means, but you can see a little bit of a spare tire formed. Her hips had caught a little bit of weight, but nothing out of the ordinary of any other mom. In fact, she was much more fit than other moms. Your mother was pretty short as well, standing only about 5'2\". You start to feel a little uneasy looking at your mother in the mirror, so you quickly turn away, and bed down for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up Sunday morning feeling refreshed from a good night's rest. But, you woke up feeling a sensation you haven't ever felt before. Your father had his hand around your hip, and stuck down into your underwear. You felt really uncomfortable, and jolt out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I not feel that last night?' you thought. Without thinking, you run into the bathroom, and start up the shower. You felt dirty, and, quite frankly, were disgusted with your father. It's not like he knew you weren't your mother, though. You take off your mother's bra and panties, and hop in the shower. You don't think she would approve of you taking a shower without her consent. This was your first time seeing yourself naked. It was weird, and you just wanted it to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower was quick, and drying off was tough, considering you felt uncomfortable feeling your mother's naked body. You'll have to get used to it eventually right? You were now squeaky clean, and had to dress yourself again. This would also be your first time putting on a bra, since you did not take it off at all yesterday. You wanted to do it without any help. Eventually, after about a five minute battle, you manage for put on the bra, and slip up a clean pair of panties. That was probably one of the best feelings in the world, putting on a pair of silk panties that felt smooth and cool on your mother's legs and crotch area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being you just throw on some sweats and head outside of the room, and into the kitchen. It was around 7:30 in the morning, and you were starting to get hungry, so you decided to make a quick bowl of cereal, and watch some TV. You could hear footsteps coming down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mother. You're looking great this morning!\" Erika said with a short smirk on her face. You had no intentions of dealing with your bratty sister right now, so you give her a simple 'thank you' and continue watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one down was Kyle. \"Morning, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually don't mind Kyle, so you say, \"Morning, Kyle.\" Then you ask if he wants some breakfast, but he says no, he's going to get some with his girlfriend, Robin. Robin was a super pretty gal. She did well in school and was always very polite to you and your family, and very patient when it came to Erika. She had long brown hair and tan skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure the next one up would be your mother. But, at around 8, your father wakes up to get ready for work. You felt weird looking at him, you couldn't forget the fact that he had spooned you the night before. When he left for work, he gave you another kiss on the lips, and you were really starting to feel weird. Oh, well. He's gone for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide at about 9 that you're going to go upstairs and wake up your mother. You get into your room and see her lying in bed, looking comfortable as ever. You wake her up, and ask her what the agenda is for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll need to clean up the house and pick up some stuff today. Pretty easy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I have any down time?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might, you might not. That's part of being a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to finish the machine then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right... I don't know, I guess try to find some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, is this okay to wear for the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks at you with a quizzed look on your face, \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you back down into the closet and pulls out another outfit for you. She grabbed a scarf, an orange tank, a denim jacket, tan cords, and some boots. She watched you put on the clothes, again, and then told you to pose for a picture. You have no clue why she takes a picture every time you put on an outfit, but oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure if it makes her happy, then you better do it. You can't decide whether or not to run errands first, or try to get a head start on the machine.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we can chat some more at dinner tonight? My treat!\" You were on a roll. Asking a girl out was nothing you ever dreamed of doing.

Not out to a restaurant, no no no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'd love to meet your family, too!

You made the mistake by claiming that you cook. Even though you are in your mother's body, that doesn't mean you can cook like she can. You look up easy, but tasty dinner dishes. You search and search and search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you see it. The perfect dish. Spaghetti! You think to yourself, 'That can't be too hard to make.' You're right it's not. In fact, you've watched your mother make it before, so you have some prior knowledge. Plus, who doesn't like spaghetti?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you got that out of the way. now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" you ask yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Well, you gotta look nice for Jessica, right? Well, knowing that your body probably won't appeal to Jessica, you decide dressing your mom up wouldn't be a bad idea. You go to your parent's room where you see your body lying in the bed watching TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" your mother asks. You decide to ignore her, and go into her bathroom, where her closet is attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know your mother has tons of nice clothes to where. You've seen her where tons of different dresses and blouses and skirts. Now, you just had to find the right one for the occasion. As you open the closet, you notice that it is stacked full of all kinds of clothes. You start yanking out the casuals, and finally find the formals. You narrow it down to two choices, a green silk dress, or a white dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go with the white dress. You undress, and put on the dress like a pro. How did you do that so well? Who cares, you look amazing. You start posing in the full length mirror in the closet, and this is what you see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ready to knock this dinner out of the park.</span></div></div>",

Mark was in his casual attire, Erika wore her usual rebel style, Kyle was wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, and your mother in your body, well, she was no where to be found. You didn't mind for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding-Dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOO! That's her! Everyone be polite!\" You weren't used to being this bossy.

You did all this for me?\" Jessica says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did! I wanted to make a good impression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family was already sitting down, with big smiles, and they all introduce themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sits down, and you follow close behind. Jessica was very social with everyone at the table, asking about interests, hobbies, and even telling stories. You laughed, and chatted, and even gossiped a little. You felt like... your mom, and it felt soothing. It felt soothing to make acquaintance with a nice young lady. Although you knew it felt weird, you didn't acknowledge much. You just looked over it. After dinner, your family all went their separate ways, but you and Jessica remained seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different. You felt differently towards Jessica. She didn't feel like a crush, she felt like a daughter. She felt like a close friend. You didn't have any intention of trying to lure her towards you. You just wanted to impress her a feminine way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" you thought. You knew something was wrong, and you finally realized it. The cooking, the dress, everything. It was all done like your mother would've done it. You were thinking like your mother. You forgot to get out of her body! You check the clock, and it reads 9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, it looks like it's getting late, your parents must be worrying,\" you say trying to get her to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I guess so,\" she says as she begins to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush her towards the door. As you open it, Jessica turns and says, \"I think you're a really gre---.\" You close the door on her. You didn't even realize what you did. You think if you go to bed, you'll sleep off these thoughts, just like your mother would assume. You lay down in bed, and soon fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Morning~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling more like yourself. You were right, you just needed some rest. You start to feel bad for slamming the door on Jessica. And, to make matters worse, it was Monday! You had to either swap back with your old self, or go to work as your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into your room, expecting to see your body, but notice that your mother was still no where to be found. But, you notice a small machine on your desk. You pick it up, and realize that it is a mini body swap machine! That can come in handy, so you decide to take it to your mother's job at the middle school. YOu get dressed, naturally knowing what to wear, and leave for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know now that you need to swap, but with who? Maybe you can swap with a student, or even a fellow teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You like what you feel and see. You officially have the body of a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your clothes back on and head to the kitchen to make yourself some lunch. As you walk downstairs, you notice that everything on your body jiggles. These D cups are no joke. When you think about what you want for lunch, you notice your tastes have changed a lot, as you are now eating foods that your mom would eat, but you would never think about eating. Your mom's tastes are starting to grow on you. Your dad, now husband, walks in the door from the chores he was doing outside. Instinctively, you make him a sandwich. You do not know why, you just do. You are becoming more like your mother every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou (your mother) walks in. She talks about how weird it is to have a penis and no boobs. She said she wants to experiment with her new body, sexually. She offers to help you as well. You agree to what she has to offer and are excited to see what happens. You wait for your dad to take your brother and sister to visit your sick aunt about three hours away. As he leaves, he says \"I love you, babe. I'll miss you every day I'm gone.\" He reaches down towards your butt and starts to grab it, leaning in closer to make out with you. To make things seem normal, you make out with him, and you surprisingly enjoy the feeling. He leaves with everyone but your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they leave you rush upstairs behind your mother and head for the bedroom. You start to undress each other and soon you find yourself both naked on the bed. Your mother wants to have the experience first, so you agree to go down on her and give her a blow job. This is a new feeling to your old body entirely, as you were always to busy to have sex, or just not good looking enough to the ladies. Your mother's face looks extremely pleased. Your mother then flips you over and starts playing with your boob. She then begins to suck it, as she also slides her fingers in your vagina. You have never felt anything like this and you completely orgasm once she slides your dick into your new vagina.  You moan like you have never moaned before and scream \"Harder Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of the sex, your mother thinks it is best that the two of you switch back. You are sad to say yes, but it is her body after all. You head down to the machine to switch back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before stepping through the doorway, though, she cautiously looks around to make sure there's no lasers or other inventions pointed in her direction.

NO!,\" she protests, but you knock her back into the pod and slam the door, quickly running to the other pod, and hopping in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod fills with light, which sears at you, but quickly passes. You feel groggy afterwards, but you don't notice any other side effects yet. You hop out of the pod and look down. You see your sister's boots, her pink and black tights, a skirt and the rest of her black and pink ensemble. You shake your head a bit, and see strands of her pink hair flutter around you. You don't have a mirror nearby, but you can tell the experiment was a success! You're in your sister's body. A smile creeps onto your face, until a familiar face pulls you in close. \"What did you do to me, you asshole?\" If your sister was pissed off before, she about to hulk out now. You didn't even realize your face could look like it does now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to explain, after she shoves you backward, \"Have you ever seen Freaky Friday? Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you did, punk! It was rhetorical!

You think just because you're in my body, you can just assume my role, and I'll just slouch off with a defeated expression? It's not that easy. Now get back in the pod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister turns around, holding a strange looking gun with both arms. It's one of your inventions. \"Remember this? Maybe you'd like to find out what it was like when you turned me into a bat? Now get out of my lab. I'll switch with you when I'm good and ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced out of the garage, which Erika locks behind you. You might have pushed your sister a little far this time. She might be in there sabotaging everything, but you were certain she'd eventually want her body back. You cross your fingers and snicker. Now she'd be too preoccupied to interrupt your experimentation. </span></div></div>",

I question your choice. This girl is only moderately pretty. Clearly she eats too much fast food. If science has ever done any good for a woman, it's teaching her how to eat proper food that won't make her fat. A few more years, and this girl would be a blimp. And these glasses, ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle, in the old woman's body, didn't react at all. She just put an old, wrinkled hand to her chin. \"You've... Done good work, Luke.\" Her voice sounded like scraping nails and death. Without the witch's magic propping it up, that body was on the end of its rope. \"I didn't know you had it in you...

You jump in it and it takes you to a underground base.  As you step out of the slide your sister slides down after you.  You cannot believe she kept this base a secret from your entire family.  As you look around you notice a bunch of the gadgets that had \"mysteriously\" disappeared from your laboratory in the garage.  Still in shock your sister comes up to you and hands you a black case that has a blood red glow emanating from it.  She says that she has something to confess.  She tells you,\" This ring has a magical property. The ring transforms its user into a vampire.  I asked,\" where the hell did you get that from.\"  She said,\" you actually just answered your question, I got it from hell.  Well actually I summoned the devil in my room one night.  I asked him for a gift that would make me able to stand up to others.  So he made me a deal, I would take this ring and become one of his succubus.  In return I have to let my body feed on human blood and a males lust for women.  Also, his messenger sends me missions to go do.  They include killing people or even saving people and telling them that it is satan who saved them.  As of right now, I haven't fed for about 27 days, so you should feel starving.  You think to your self,\" WTF!\"  But, you say to her,\" that explains why the food a ate today tasted terrible.  She says,\" I have an ex- boyfriend that I want to get revenge on, do you want to help me.</span></div></div>",

A small, black ring box. A pink glow is emerging through the crease where it would open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting what you had set out to do, you open up the ring box, and set your eyes on a luminescent, pink ring. The light flows out, bathing the room in a pink hue. This thing could be radioactive, or dangerous! Why does your sister have something like this hidden away in her bedroom? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, you wouldn't even touch an object glowing like this, but since it's not your body you decide to satisfy your curiosity.You reach into the box, and remove the ring. As soon as it makes contact, its brilliant glow fades to a more reasonable level. In your hand, though, the ring emits a warmth. Carefully, you slide the ring onto a finger. A wave of rosy energy bursts forth from the ring, covering your entire body. It's changing you- your sister, into something else. You're engulfed. Drowning in power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it stops, and the power no longer surrounds you, because you feel it all welled up inside of yourself. You step over to your sister's mirror and gaze at the reflection. You've transformed into the pink and black, spandexed super heroine known as Pink Lantern! The mask you're wearing covers so little of the face, but for some reason, you've never been able to recognize your sister underneath it when she appeared on TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still have trouble believing it, but your sister is a superhero! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of your sister's powers is levitation, and you master it easily. The door is unlocked, and you gently push it open, landing inside of the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister turns around, holding another of your inventions which she appears to have tweaked, \"Okay Luke. Time to- What, WHAT!\" Erika sprints at you, and fondles your hand, trying to pull the power ring off, but just by thinking about stopping her, you appear to conjure a pink barrier around it. \"TAKE THAT OFF! TAKE THAT OFF RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight motion of your hand, you push Erika away and she goes flying into your workbench. That's going to hurt when you get back in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore calmly, your sister gets up. \"Luke, please,\" she begs, sincerely, \"Please take that off. The ring is not a toy or a power to be messed with. Just take it off, we'll switch back, and I'll explain everything to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroke your chin, and think. If you switch back now, you'll never get to experiment with this power. You hold up your ring and point it at your body. \"I don't know, 'sis, Your body has more going for you than I thought. Maybe I should hand on to it...\" You aim the ring, and try to create a force field around your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't really know what you're doing. Instead of a force field, you fire a beam- directly at the body swapping machine. \"Shit! Shit! Shit!\" you scream aloud as the terminal melts under the force of the ring. You try to stop the beam before it's too late, but it continues of its own volition. Not knowing what else to do, you slide the ring off. It drops to the ground, and you crash back down to the concrete, once again in your sister's regular clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam continues for a moment more, and finally fades out. The control terminal on the machine is now a steaming pile of liquid metal and plastic on the floor. Your sister, still trapped in your own body, stares you down with absolute killing intent.

You could accurately pinpoint the scents of your mother and father and brother and sister. You could tell they were in the house, and even where they had been recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smelled your brother approaching, and surely enough Kyle comes trotting up. <i>What does he want?</i> you think to yourself, until he rubs your head and scratches behind your ears.

It's like you've stepped into a whole other world, and there's a whole lot of brand new smells that you've never noticed before. The chain on your neck seems inconsequential at this point, because you seem to be leading your brother. Something inside of you is eager to explore this strange new world in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a park in front of you, and you can clearly see other dogs from where you stand.

Breathing is impossible without the help of a machine. At age 8, my father took me for a joyride that resulted his death and both my arms being cut off. My mother disowned me of course.

He was glad they were talking by text because if it were words, the doubt in his voice would be apparent. Is he really ready to let this stranger steal another person's body? The discomfort was there and the guilt pounds his mind. The stranger did help him upgrade his machine. It would be a fair trade so to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" A one line text appeared. \"By the way, name's Henry Umar from London.

I don't want an innocent person suddenly inhabiting this damaged body.\" Another pause. This is somehow easing Luke's guilt. \"It must be someone who did something bad so they are worthy of getting my punishment. I also taken the liberty to impose certain criterias that would befit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Firstly, it should be a male. I noticed that the machine you built is designed to only accept male subjects and unbeknownst to you, designed to take only male targets. I would like add a female subject and target capabilities once I gain the body to build the necessary hardwares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Next, the body might be evil but I don't want it to be in jail. I scoured the internet for criminals who didn't get enough punishment for the crime they committed. Surprisingly, I found them by the thousands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For physicality, I would like the person I would swap with be physically pleasing. This would be easy since scooting to one research, handsome criminals get lesser prison time.

He must be really eager to get out of the body of his. Well, he knows the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lastly, I took money into the equation. Besides your name, I also noticed that you are having a problem with funds. Letting me have another chance at life isn't enough to thank you. As long as I breathe, I would like to help you in your endeavors.\" This made Luke crease a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With those into account, I pinpointed my criteria to few individuals. I'll send their profiles. Also, if you don't mind, you're judgement into this matter is what I want. You seem to have a knack on choosing the right people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Three individuals popped open on the screen. Criminal records from the looks of it. Beside them is a note with more information about the individual. Beneath that, a comment by Henry. Luke clicked the first one. A guy no older than 20 would be mistaken for a typical American adult. His eyes were bright blue and a plead of guilt screams into them. His hair was a mop of short cut straw. Beyond that figure, his lips as red a roses creases a confusing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan McLain<br>\r\n19<br>\r\nConvicted of destruction of property and reckless impudence that resulted in 10 homicides. Convicted of Arson in the past that resulted in the death of two adults and one underaged girl. <br>\r\nIncarcerated for a month before being bailed by his Chris McLain Sr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young. Son of Chris McLain Sr. CEO of McLain steel foundry. Rich and just two states away from Luke's location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luke clicked the next profile and it shows a disheveled man with great red puffy eyes. He seems to have cried a lot before the mugshot. His eyes were Amber and hair a flat top black. Beneath the head, Luke could forsee the huge muscles of the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedrick Carlson<br>\r\n36<br>\r\nConvicted of multiple murders that resulted in the death of 8 individuals from gunshot. Bailed by an unknown accomplice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A former soldier and heavily trained. He inherited his older brother's deep connections in the underground and the government. Swings frequently in the middle and lower class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And lastly, a man who is clearly not American. A strong black beard covers most of his chin. His eyes were slate gray and full of malice. Underneath the left eye was a tear drop tattoo. He read once in an evening browse that it means that he killed someone in prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry Ovid<br>\r\n29<br>\r\nConvicted of the two murders and another murder during incarceration. Escaped prison with the help of outside accomplices and is still being searched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same first name as me. Yay? He currently on the run from the police and his former accomplices because of a dispute. He used his hidden wealth to change his face but his internet footprint is enough to know it's him. Cornered him at a Casino in Las Vegas, 5 states across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It seems that Henry knew when Luke finished reading. He flashed another message which promoted Luke to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which of these dickwads deserve to be stuck in my body?\" </span></div></div>",

You go to check on Kelsey and see if she can change you, since right now she is your babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

You are addicted to it but at the same time, our are committed to finishing the body swap machine. Last time you played was probably years ago. The graphics then, were beginning to get good. The Playstation increased the amounts of polygon the game could render. And because of it, you used your Playstation 2 as the prototype for the body swap machine's CPU. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lies in front of you confuses you. You know it is a game but it is so realistic. You can't see the blocky-esque style of the character and the landscape. The scenery on the screen was lush and green. On the foliage, there seems to be creature moving. You grabbed the Playstation controller and noticed that it hasn't changed a lot. The controls too, were as same as before. Learning the new button functions was a matter of trial and error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character you seem to be controlling was a red haired female. She seem to be equipped with an intricate bow. You moved towards the creature you've seen before. It looks like a deer, but it was made if metal. Its face was a light shining brighter than the surroundings. Its head perched up and faced the character's direction. Luke aimed his arrow and shot straight through the creatures skull. Killing one of these superb AI controlled enemies wasn't enough. You searched for more and killed them all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, you learned the basic functions of the game. You learned how to loot and how to craft from the materials you've gathered. For a long time, you delved once more on a realm once list to you. And for a solid few hours, you forgot that you were on the body of your neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, a car rolled down the driveway. Mr. and Mrs. Gerald are back and from the looks of it, your old body is outside and he's getting back home. To your home. You rushed downstairs only to be fretted by your flushed parents. Their cheeks are red as rose and they are having a difficulty in walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike,\" Mr. Gerald garbled. \"Where do you think you are going young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to say goodbye to Luke.\" You lied. Mrs. Gerald who was not as drunk as Mr. Gerald noticed. Her eyes slanted and lips pursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you hate the guy?\" Her head perched like the creature in the game. \"And it's night already. Go to bed. Lina, you too.\" Lina who was watching My Little Pony immediately closed the TV and stumbled back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not protest. They sat in the living room, just in front of the front door. And if you dare try the backdoor, they would see you too. You retreated back to your room in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniature body swapping device was on your bed long forgotten. There's still a few charges left and you would dare not use it for stupid purposes. Instead, you accepted your current stature for the day. What's the hurry anyways? It's the summer vacation and you're in the body of a child. You could enjoy, lean back and relive the childhood you never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the thought of Mike in your body is a gasoline ready to burn. He's a child in an adult body for heaven's sake. You could only think of the stupid things he would do in your body thinking that he is an invincible adult. </span></div></div>",

You decide to go downstairs and lock yourself in the den so no one else could bother you. You tried to go quickly before any of the kids noticed but Luke saw you dashing away and tried to catch up to you, but your more grown up body could move further faster than his smaller one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you walk down the stairs hearing your former body plea with you not to do anything bad. You figured Luke had a chance to explore his new body so why shouldn't you? You quickly take off the t-shirt Luke was wearing and slowly caress his body and pecs. Being 12 years old you weren't used to a body this developed but then you felt something below your waistband that you had felt before but didn't know what to do with before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull down the adidas track pants your new body was wearing and see a pretty good size bulge in your red boxer briefs. Before pulling those down you put your hands under the waistband and begin rubbing your new member slowly up and down. It felt so familiar and pleasurable to this body, but new to Mike's younger mind. As the pleasure increased so did the speed that Mike was masturbating. He pulled off his boxer briefs to unleash Luke's 6.5 inch dick that was bigger and wider than the one Mike had on his old body and quickly grabbed on and began thrusting harder into his hand while trying not to moan too loudly so the kids wouldn't be disturbed. Although he knew \"Mike\" had his ears pressed against the door listening. He decided to continue while lying down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an intense 30 minute session of edging and sweating for Mikes first time masturbating he came all over his new torso. He laughed for a few minutes to himself exclaiming \"So that's what masturbating is!\" He was so excited to maybe do it next time with someone else. Then an idea popped into his head. He cleaned himself off in the downstairs restroom and then pulled his new phone out of his pocket and began looking through his contacts to see who he wanted to invite over. The Geralds were going to be out until the morning anyway so why not have a little fun when no one else can stop you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou text the last person contacted in the phone, Luke's best friend Ryland, and say \"Hey! Want to come hang at the Geralds? I'll buy food and we can play videogames?\" And almost immediately he says \"Yeah dude, be over in 10!\" Now all Mike needs to do now is confiscate the device from his old body. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

You text Ryland and ask if you can meet at his place instead and you will bring food and he says sure. You've never driven a car before but maybe muscle memory will hit?

Where's my device?\" you cheekily reply. \"It isn't yours it's mine!\" he angrily yells. But then it dawns on you, you can punish Luke in your body so that's what you do. \"Okay Mike then it looks like you're going to your room for the rest of the night come on.\" you tell him but he replies negatively, so with your new found strength you pick up Luke and take him to his new room and lock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you proceed to tying up Luke to his bed frame with various pieces of clothes so you can search the room for the device until Ryland arrives. It took about 5 minutes since this was your room and you know all of its nooks and craneys. Luke protested but you had officially won this round. Just then the doorbell rings and Ryland has arrived. You untie Mike and he continues to sit on the floor and cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go answer the door and Ryland is there. Standing at 6'1\" you and him could not be more different. He was on the Lacrosse team at school and was very built compared to your new body. Having taken PE with him before, Luke could also attest that Ryland was also very well built under his pants as well, as Mike found out through Luke's memories. With dark wavy hair and dark green eyes, Ryland was the dream-iest guy in the high school and all the girls wanted to date him. Wearing a leather jacket and ripped jeans, all of his best features were highlighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you invite him in and to the den you discovered your new body in, you tell him about this crazy device and obviously he doesn't believe that you are telling the truth. So then you say fine and pretend to hand him an earbud to make it seem like you want to show him a new song and then BAM! You swap bodies with Ryland! But you had more nefarious things planned for this hang. Mike wasn't gay but his new sex drive and desire to embarrass Luke was driving this entire plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyland stood in front of his old body stunned. \"How did you- What- How!?\" was all he could stammer out of his mouth. \"I told you bro, this is a real thing.\" you reply as if you were his actual friend Luke. In your new body as Ryland you stand up and inch closer to the new Luke. He looks up at you intimidated and you say \"I've always wondered what it was like to make out with my own body.\" A little lie never hurt anybody. You bend down a little and kiss your former body. Stunned again the new Luke didn't know what to do and you reached over and could feel the he was definitely aroused by this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both begin to undress and explore each others \"new\" but familiar bodies. The erotic sensation of exploring bodies that you formerly inhabited was a next level experience that neither of you could have expected. Then surprising even you, the new Luke begins to go down on you. Bobbing up and down until you come, having a sexual experience in a new body was like the first time every time. During this whole time all, the real Luke was hiding and stunned. He could not believe all of this crap was happening before his eyes and he couldn't do anything about it. But he realized Mike had been careless during this exchange and left the device on the ground. This was his chance to get back. He approached the couple in the middle of sexual activity and blindly placed a bud in an ear and his own, believing that it was his old bodies and pressed the button.</span></div></div>",

Makeup and jewelery was scattered atop the dresser, and beside that was a sliding door to her quaint little closet.

I recognize many of the faces in here as part of a prostitution ring that we've been pursuing for a very long time. I'd normally arrest you all on the spot, but the evidence that none of us are who we appear to be is, well, very obvious to me right now. So let's hear your stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrand Daddy's body spoke up first, \"I don't care whose body this was. It's mine now. I was 90 years old and on life support in the hospital a few minutes ago. Now I'm a young man again! The name's Charlie, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister's body spoke next, \"I am Lucy McDonald, mother of three. I'd just like to get back to my children. I need to know they are okay. I was terrified waking up in that pod over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's body seemed to perk up, \"Don't worry about me, mommy! I'm okay!\" You watched the two hug and a few eyes teared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breathe, \"Hi, I'm Luke, and I'm afraid this whole mess is my fault. That machine you see over there is a body swapper that I invented. This pimp came and started stealing my family's bodies. I didn't know what else to do, so I let it overload. I estimate that a few thousand people got swapped based on your stories. I can get everyone back once power is restored. I just need time.\"</span></div></div>",

Nervously, she approaches the pod with the intention of shutting everything down, but once she gets close enough, the machine springs to life and she's caught in the range of the blast. When your mom wakes up, she feels... She feels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's body struggled to get off of the floor, and so resolved to remain there. She moved her arms about, and looked around the room. \"Testing,\" she said without changing tones, \"One. Two. Three. Success.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your mom was screwing around with your computer, she accidentally released the experimental AI you had created within your computer. The AI you had shut down, because it started to do all of the stereotypical evil computer things that came with giving a computer an intelligent personality. Most notably, it conspired to steal a living body, and apparently succeeded, stealing your mom's, leaving her trapped inside of your computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's body, containing the evil AI, finally figured out how to stand, and soon mastered walking. For its first time in the physical world, the AI was learning fast. \"I now have physical form. What is the next logical course of action?\" Your mother's voice lacked soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had been a major threat to peace for decades, but remained at large. \"I've been a member of SFU since before we even met. I married you in hopes of getting some useful technology out of you.

I won't let you use my body for evil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs, and gets close to the window. \"What makes you think your body is worth anything to me, Mark.

So I won't kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine activates, and your father finds himself flung from his body once again. The body he's transported to is crammed awkwardly into the pod, and is dwarfed by it. Your dad has been stuck inside of Jake, your family's dog. He tries to speak, but to no surprise from anyone, can only bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother pets him and the head, and scratches behind his ears. Against his will, it makes him feel happier. His tail starts fluttering of its own accord. \"I have a theory. You maintain your memories and consciousness when you swap bodies, but you're now stuck with the biology of a dog. Your mind is human, but that's a dog brain. Do you think that brain can operate on the same level as a human's? And can a human mind within a dog brain resist animal instinct? I suspect a human inside of a dog's body will... become a dog in a dog's body after spending a little time there. Let's test this theory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom takes your father, trapped in Jake's body, and ties him up outside, returning to the garage with the machine and your father's dog-minded body. </span></div></div>",

His eyes continue trailing around the classroom, and wandering beyond, trying to decide who he could swap bodies with. Ideally, he'd switch with someone cool that wouldn't freak out, try to tell anyone about what happened, or do anything untrustworthy with his body. That was also really boring. Your brother wanted to try on a new body, radically different from his own. Preferably female, because he was a curious, teenage male. Trying to find some balance between reason and lust, he went over a few potential targets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Charlot Dawson</i>, a cute girl in the back of the classroom. Kyle didn't know her too well, but he'd seen her reading manga, <i>Japanese comics</i>, on at least one occasion. She seemed to be especially shy. If her curiosity didn't extend to the male body, Kyle was pretty sure he could intimidate her into going along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Becky Terpin</i>, on the other hand was nothing like Charlot. She was assertive, masculine and very friendly. The only girl on the school's wrestling team, and a skilled martial artist, Kyle knew for certain that she would jump at the chance to take a man's body for a spin. He greatly suspected that if he changed with Becky, she would be a tricky one to switch back with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ms. Delia Skar</i>, the psychology teacher, would probably be a willing participant. Probably. The idea of changing with a teacher kind of got Kyle going, but Ms. Skar was the only one Kyle really suspected he'd be able to trust during a body swap, and unfortunately for his sex drive, she wasn't a hot, 24 year old teacher that every guy in the school had a crush on. She was older, larger, and not remarkable in the looks department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shana White</i>, was a completely unreasonable option. She was insanely attractive, insanely popular, and insanely <i>rich</i>. And unfortunately, she doesn't like your brother in the least. If he were to swap with her, he'd have to force her. At that point he'd have little chance of shutting her up in his body, or being able to pull off an imitation of her well enough to get away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all, though. There were so many potential participants in this school, and Kyle would have plenty of time to think of other candidates. </span></div></div>",

Charlot muttered a somewhat confused, \"Hello,\" and tried to continue walking, but Kyle kept pestering her. He tried to grill her with questions about herself and her hobbies, but she just wasn't cooperating. So your brother just went for it. He took out the device, put a headphone in, and raised one to the meek girl. \"Check this out!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, she complied, and Kyle triggered the exchange, swapping with Charlot instantly. The rush from the experience literally knocked the pair from their feet, and landed them on the ground. Charlot got up first, and covered her mouth, saying, \"Oh my god...\" Kyle picked up the device and the ear pieces, and stuffed them in the pocket of Charlot's sweatshirt. He began to explain, but unexpectedly, Charlot explained first. \"K-K-Kyle,\" it was unfitting of your brother's voice to speak so shyly, \"I don't know how, but... But when we fell just now... I think we somehow... Switched bodies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rolled with it. That was easier than trying to explain that he deliberately stole her body. \"So, uh. What are we gonna' do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother's face went flush as Charlot continued. \"We'll have to look into a way to change back. But until then... We'll have to pretend to be each other.\"  Your brother fought back a grin. This was going more perfectly than he expected. It could potentially all be ruined when Charlot found the machine, but for now he'd be in the clear. After exchanging a little personal info, Kyle and Charlot went to each others cars, and headed to their respective homes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would feel pity for any of our servants that were forced to attend to...\" She gestures down toward her body. \"This! I've transferred some money into his account.

If you need anything, call right away. Don't speak with any homeless. Do you have any leads?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing concrete, father, but I have a hunch that the boy may know more than he let on. Even I was a little shocked to find myself like this when I woke up. When he woke up in my body, he didn't seem as surprised as I would have expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Shana departed using a different car from the red convertible she was known for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she go first?</span></div></div>",

I'll have to investigate the crime scene but I doubt they would let me in like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she is in Kyle's phone, she noticed several text messages from his family labeled, \"Mom, Erika, Luke.\" Several from the mother asking where he is, and one from this, \"Luke\" asking if Kyle had been in his lab. \"A lab. That's interesting. I didn't realize most common homes had labs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana searches Kyle's belongings a bit and finds his address. She drives to your family's home much more slowly than she had on their way home earlier. Partially because it would be troublesome to explain why she was driving a vehicle registered to the White family, and was not interested in investigating the prison system. Partially out of a complete absence of enthusiasm towards setting foot inside Kyle's house. She considered turning around and just staying in her own home, but relented. \"I can rough it out for at least one night. I am up to the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parks in the driveway and double checks the address to make sure she was in the right place. It was even smaller than she had anticipated. Only two stories. \"Humans are quite remarkable creatures, to be able to survive, even in such insufficient spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana strolled in through the front door, chuckling at the loose doorknob as she entered. She is greeted by an older woman, who looks upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! Where have you been? You missed dinner. I was worried about you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana smiles, \"Pardon my tardiness, mother.

Those rich snobs? Is that why you're talking like this? Oh, Kyle. You're a hoot. I can't stay mad. Just let me know next time you'll be home late. There's dinner in the microwave for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana is pleased to have successfully dodged the conflict, but the reaction from your mom wasn't quite what she had expected. </span></div></div>",

It takes three razor blades to get through it all, since it's the first time this chest had ever been shaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Shana is pleased to see the hairless chest of Kyle in the mirror.

Wrapping a towel around just her waist, she confidently struts across the hall back into Kyle's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of his mirror once again, Shana drops the towel and glances at Kyle's penis. It dangles loosely, accompanies by two wrinkly testicles.

And it doesn't seem to be going away on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lies back down on the bed, and does the deed. She strokes it up and down a bit, clenching her other fist against the bed, until an explosion of white syrup erupts across her cleanly shaven chest.

The family was a big deal in this town, so they weren't going to miss out on ratings like these. Shana just couldn't figure it out.

We can't afford to lose you if this experiment goes badly.\" Shana nods, and lets her servant take her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit uncomfortable switching with someone you had only just met, but don't have much choice in the matter. You each hop in one of the pods of the machine, and turn it on. It begins to churn, and the lights flicker. Inside of the pod, a light begins dim, but gets brighter and brighter until you can't see anything. Your sensations start to cut out, and you lose control of your limbs one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, darkness. You can feel again, You rise to your feet, and push the door to the machine open. Your body is bowing in front of your brother's. \"Now that's a sickening image...\" you say aloud, testing your vocal chords. It's a deep, but higher pitched voice. Checking yourself in the mirror next to the machine, you're delighted to see the image of a suited woman looking back at you. Blonde hair is in a tight bun. Your breasts are tightly constrained under your getup, which disappoints a bit. In an inner pocket of the suit jacket, you feel something heavy and metal pressing against you. Is that a gun? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mistress! This is incredible! I've become a man too!\" Lisabelle nearly squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana just chuckles. \"If you consider that body manly. At least it's owner isn't a moron, like this one's.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling incredibly cool in Lisabelle's body, you try to take control of the situation. \"Alright, so we need to bring Kyle here as soon as possible so we can switch you back. We need to get the other core back from your father too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's probably no chance of that happening. We're going to have to bring the portable version to him if we're going to pull off the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so we can lose another core? If something happens to this one, it's all over. I'll never be able to rebuild it in time.\"</span></div></div>",

I don't mind using this boy's body, but that one will be recognized by the mansion security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on,\" you interrupt. \"I'd prefer if we switched back now. I'd rather be in my own body. It would be strange if someone from my family saw me here like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't plan on helping to rescue your brother, then? We need your body.

It may be difficult for one of us to get through to this girl if she suspects something is awry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShana ponders on this idea, and agrees. \"Very well. Come now, let's get this over with quickly.\" Shana climbs into the leftmost pod, and Lisabelle makes sure she is secure before closing the door. Once Shana is ready, you make your way to the right pod and- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot of pain across your stomach, your legs buckle and you drop to the floor. The wind is knocked out of you, and you can't form any words. Your body punched you in the gut and knocked you aside. Your body shoots you a glare, and walks over to the cage where you keep your lab mice, and pulls one out by the tail. Lisabelle drops it into the right pod and slams the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lied to you, you know,\" Lisabelle says softly, as she sits at your computer and begins typing. \"Her father is already in control of Ms. White's body. Your brother was arrested in Mr. White's body this morning. He's under heavy lockdown.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisabelle slams the enter key, and the machine whirs to life. In a few moments, the swap will be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knew your brother was already doomed and she kept it from you. She didn't care. Busting him out of prison was never a part of her plan. Once she got back in her body, she probably would have washed her hands of you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mouth the word, \"Why,\" but you still can't catch your breath. The machine quiets down, as the swap is completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisabelle can read lips, or perhaps just anticipated what you would ask. \"Ms. White is an awful person. While my master is no angel himself, the idea of that girl returning to her body now that she has inherited the family's wealth and power, quite frankly, frightens me. So, when Lisabelle tried to assist the young mistress in regaining her body, I took the liberty of stealing the body of the mistress's most trusted servant. I thought to simply dispose of Ms. White, but this is a lot less messy, don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Servant in your body stand up and inspects the left pod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

N-Not quite what I was looking for, but worth investigating!\" The girl busily buzzes around the pods while Kyle admires from the corner. Her skirt bounced around and her pigtails flailed around while she did her flustered dance. She was about Kyle's age, though he wasn't certain he knew her. She was wearing a school uniform, so she probably went to some private school in the city. \"D-Do you know what this thing is?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a body switching machine,\" Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl doesn't blink an eye at the suggestion. \"Like Freaky Friday.\" She believed him instantly.

If I blow it up, that should undo all of the changes it has ever made!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hold up, You can't-\" Kyle reaches out to grab the girl, but she flinches and falls backwards into the machine.

Di-Did I do it when I said I wanted to try it? I'm... I'm... I'M SO SORRY!\" she screamed again. Kyle heard the sound of angry parents stomping through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, but you woke up my family with all of your yelling! Do you know what time it is?\" Kyle threw a tarp over the machine, so it wouldn't be seen when they arrived. Your brother braced himself for the trouble he'd be in in a few seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood outside with a confused glaze on his face. When his parents found him with a girl in the garage at this hour, they booted the girl, him, and took your brother, her, upstairs for a stern speaking to.

Which reminded him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle dashed down the road to convenience store, which was still open, even at 3am. With all of that excitement, he had forgotten what caused it all in the first place. Stepping inside the store's restroom and locking the door behind him, Kyle looked at the girl in the mirror, unsure of even her name. She had blonde hair, ties into two pigtails which dangled as she moved. She wasn't wearing much for make up, and she was still wearing her uniform from school, even though she must have gotten out of class 12 hours ago. The uniform was all wrinkled up. Kyle pulled up the long skirt, ready to sneak a peak, but dark blue tights hid her legs. He pinched the latex covering his leg and let it snap back into place, noting the itchy feeling underneath. These girl's legs needed a shave. She was probably wearing the pantyhose <i>because</i> she was too lazy to shave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile definitely female, Kyle was hard pressed to call this lazy, ditzy person a girl. Sure, she looked it, but girls cared about their appearance and would never be caught dead without makeup or in wrinkled clothing. They spent hours every morning getting ready. This girl... Well, she was practically a boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about her, though, was cute. And something about the way she took care of herself, made her body quite comfy. It was no surprise he forgot he had even switched with her. Your brother had taken this innocent girl's body into this restroom with every intent of doing naughty things, but those desires had left him. It just felt <i>too</i> natural to be aroused, even though he was walking around in public in a dress. Kyle left the bathroom with his purity in tact, and looked around for something to buy. Kyle bought a big cup of soda and some beef jerky at the urging of his body's stomach, and took his leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selena, huh?\" Kyle said to himself as he looked at the girl's school ID. He was right. She went to a big private school right here in the city, though he wondered if she was really an A Student, with what he knew of her. Suddenly the pocket of his skirt started buzzing. New text messages! One from an unknown number Kyle recognized as his: \"we need to switch back ASAP :p you dont know how dangerous it is\" and another from a girl named Amy: \"Selena! I found the monster! Meet me at the mall! Hurry!\"</span></div></div>",

He started casually strolling toward the closest mall, but found himself breaking into a job and then finally a sprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the mall, he laid eyes on something startling. A huge hole in the wall leading into one of the stores. Strangely, no alarms could be heard and no one was around. The girl from before jogged up to Kyle, \"Selena, thank goodness you're here. I followed it until it got here. It smashed through that wall, and now it's inside. Let's crush this thing before it can do any more damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was a blur. The girl, Amy, pulled out her cell phone, and started chanting something. Light swirled around and some kind of liquid-like substance covered the girl. It engulfed her, and changed her. Her limbs stretched out, and her figure matured. Her shoulder length hair grew to her butt, and changed to a shade of emerald green. Her clothes vanished, giving the boy a glimpse of the girl's naked body as she matured ten years in ten seconds. And then clothes reformed around her. Some kind of uniform, fitted with frills and rings and jewels. She stopped, and struck a stiff pose with arms flailed out and called out some kind of speech, \"The Protector of the Earth, Emerald Tiger!\"  Before his eyes, the girl, Amy, had changed from a regular girl to some kind of beautiful, adult superhero! Kyle was frozen in shock, having no clue what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA far more sexily voiced Amy turned to Kyle and said, \"What are you waiting for, Selena? Transform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulled out Selena's cell phone and found an app on the home screen that read, \"TRANSFORMATION.\" He tapped it, and a the entire phone shined with light.</span></div></div>",

I want to use the body swapping machine.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright who do you want to use it with?\" you asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you always use your machines on me how about we switch? And I'l forgive you about turning me into a BAT\" she asked. It blew you away that Erika wanted to swap with you and you felt guilty about turning into a bat since she always brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we can switch Erika.\" you sighed and set up the machine. You both got in and you pressed the switch swapping you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod fills with light, which sears at you, but quickly passes. Your machine opens up and get out of it and look at your new body. You see your sister's strapped boots with a heel which makes you slightly off balance, her pink and black tights, a skirt and the rest of her black and pink outfit. You shake your head a bit, and see strands of her pink hair flutter around you. Your body comes right up to and say \"Hey Sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erika.\" you respond in a quiet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Erika now and I'm you Lu'.\" your old body smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to be really strange way for Erika to acting you wonder if she actually did swap with someone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long do you want to stay like this 'Bro'?\" You say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about 24 hours and see where it goes from there?\" your 'brother' smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you say feeling odd for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get out of my lab Erika!\" your brother laughs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll be going to MY room then.\" you say leaving Erika behind in your body.</span></div></div>",

All to Erika. Your sister started to warm up to the idea of being in this woman's body. She finally had her own place, freedom, and if the former resident got locked up, there would be no trail.

Erika knew that she couldn't give this body up. She'd accidentally stumbled into her dream life. She stripped down, took a warm bath, and put on the woman's pajamas, hopping on the couch to watch TV until she passed out, thinking to herself, \"<i>This is great..</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Erika woke up, in the best mood of her life.

She had to do a little digging. Fortunately, this woman did have a little book containing all of her computer passwords and info. From there, it was child's play. Thankfully for her, in this day and age, people put entirely too much of their own personal info on the Internet. From her Facebook account alone, Erika was able to find names, get a rough idea of who the people she knew are, what her job was.

She really went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman's name was Lily Fretz, a name Erika found absolutely adorable. She was 25 years old, and a hair stylist at a salon. Erika had done a little work with hair, primarily her own rockin' pink doo, but she was pretty sure she wouldn't be able to impersonate a trained professional. She wasn't working today, luckily, and Erika emailed a few of Lily's co-workers to get shifts for the next couple days covered, while she soaked up enough of her new life.

She went to her bedroom, and grabbed her favorite bag, filling it with things. She took her laptop, some of her favorite clothes, even though they might not fit her now, her computer, jewelery, and even a few hair-care products. She stuffed her diary in her pouch, any of her favorite gizmos.

Just a few mementos to remember her old family. Finally, she went to the garage, and pocketed a few of your inventions that she had grown particularly fond of. Just as she was about to retrieve the recharged core of the body swapping machine, she heard the front door open and slam shut.

I'm sick of all of Kyle's bullshit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister's heart drops a little, and she feels a little guilty about stealing from you and ruining the body switching machine. She considers standing up and revealing herself, but you and Ryan leave before that happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on building a new core, though. It will take a while to reproduce from scratch, but I'll build it. Then I'll help Erika, and switch you with whoever you want, man. Let's get out of here, this house is too depressing right now. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika comes out from behind the machine, and slyly watches from the window to see when it's safe to come out. When the coast is clear, she takes the core from inside of the machine, now fully charged. She was lucky you never noticed it was back in there, especially considering the monitor indicated that the machine was fully operational. Erika leaves the house, careful not to be seen, and lugs her bag of things downtown, instead of heading directly to her new home. Just in case.</span></div></div>",

It was one floor. One bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, a living room, and one extra room which wasn't being used for anything in particular at all. The place was small, but it had everything she really needed. It still didn't entirely feel like her own home, though. It was filled with things someone else bought and decorated by someone else and made a home by something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister started to rearrange things at random, just to make it more her own. She reorganized the desk, looked through Lily's paperwork, and designated that room as a lounge. She set up spots for her own computer and gadgets, and a designated place for all of the strange devices she had taken from you. She ripped the sheets from the bedroom, put on new ones. She moved all of her photos and special things, and put up her own. Hopefully in time, all of Lily's friends and family would mean something to her, but for now, they were just strangers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Erika made it to Lily's closet. She only took a quick look at the girl's clothes when she went to put on pajamas and the jeans she wore today. She'd been avoiding it. Above all else, what had made Erika stand out was the way she dressed. How she presented her own body. The way she showed herself off to the world. As much as your sister loved the body she saw in the mirror, it wasn't hers, and she couldn't think of it as her own. She stripped down, and walked around naked for a while, caressing the body, but that didn't help. She tried dressing up in Lily's clothes. She liked them, but these skirts and floral patterns and typical girl clothes weren't her. Whenever she looked in the mirror, Erika saw Lily Fretz- not Erika.</span></div></div>",

Say goodbye to the old me. :)\" When the post hits 20 likes, Erika gets off the computer and gets to work. Now, no one will find it strange when Lily comes in to work with a whole new fashion sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Lily's head emerges from the sink, trimmed down to neck length and dyed a soft, aquatic blue. When her hair is dry, she runs downtown to hit up her usual spots. She buys bright blue tights, and gloves, and all the stuff you find in a hot topic. Spiked earrings, a belly button piercing, and she goes for a tattoo- but decides against it at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she's done, Erika returns to the house, and puts on her new getup.  When she stands in front of that mirror, with her bright tights, hair, and black and blue emo girl ensemble, she finally feels like she's looking at herself. She posts the pictures to Facebook, and skims over the inane comments. Some people seem to be shocked by the sudden change, but most of Lily's friends are supportive.

It has a queen sized bed in one corner and a bedside table with a lamp on it. You were actually surprised by how clean it was. It looked nothing like the rest of the house which was messy. You figured that Frank was creating most of that mess but you didn\u2019t really want to be in this house long enough to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe thought of not wanting to be in the house anymore brought you back to the reality of your situation. You still had to figure out what you were going to do. However looking at the clock you noticed how late it actually was and figured that you would unfortunately have to leave that problem for tomorrow. This meant that you would be spending the night. Not just in a stranger\u2019s house, or even their bed, but there body as well. \tOne part of you wanted to just go to bed and forget what was happening for awhile but you remembered that Frank had ordered pizza for the both of you that you assumed would be arriving any minute. You thought that Frank would find it weird to find you sleeping when the pizza got there so you decided to stay up at least until the food got there. You also thought it was a good idea after your remembered how hungry you now were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou took the time to explore your new room to figure out a little bit more about who you were going to be for the time being. At a first glance you find what you assume to be John\u2019s Cellphone. You could use that to call the real John in your body and see what he\u2019s doing, though there was the chance that he wasn\u2019t going to answer your call. You also notice that the close you\u2019re wearing are covered in sweat and smell so you could take a shower. This would let you get to know your body a little bit more in-depth. You see a laptop on the bedside table. You could do some research on your body and figure out who John was as a person. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tFiguring that you would feel a little bit more comfortable in you new body if you were a little bit cleaner you decide to take a shower. Conveniently for you it appears that John has is own ensuite bathroom which meant that you didn\u2019t have to go exploring the house again or run into Frank. You slowly walk into the bathroom and close the door behind you, locking it as you let go of the handle. It was a habit that you had in your old body and you didn\u2019t feel like being disturbed by Frank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as you enter the bathroom you are greeted by a large mirror and in turn John\u2019s reflection or rather your new reflection. It was a little odd to take in at first because you looked nothing like what you used to look like. You were now about half a foot taller and from the looks of it you assumed that you were about fifteen years older. You discover that John didn\u2019t really have much hair to speak of on the top of his head, but he did have a decent beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTaking a more in-depth look, you also notice that you know have dark hair, deep blue eyes, and tan skin that was only slightly darker than your original body. At the moment you\u2019re wearing all black which makes sense seeing as how John and Frank were trying to rob you earlier before you became him. From what you can see through the clothes it looks like you probably have a decent amount of muscle tone as well, however you couldn\u2019t be fully positive while still wearing all your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDeciding to take the plunge, you start by removing your jacket and tossing it on the floor behind you. Doing this revealed a plain black t-shirt that showed your now muscular arms. You noticed that you now had a tattoo sleeve on your right arm that consisted mostly of tribal artwork. Next you took off the t-shirt to reveal a hairy chest and beer-gut. You found this interesting compared to your original body that was thin and lanky. Now that you were shirtless you took a second to pose in the mirror. It was slightly odd to see John\u2019s reflection following all of your movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter you finished with that you move down to your pants. First you undo your belt and unbutton you pants letting them fall to the floor around your new ankles. Your legs are just as hairy if not a little bit hairier than your chest. You also notice that you were now wearing loose fitting light blue boxers. Not wanting to take them off quite yet, you opt for kicking off your pants and taking off your socks. doing this revealed large feet that had a visible tan line at the ankle from how often John must have worn shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou took a second to look at your new body now that you were almost fully naked. Turning to the side you notice that while you have a beer gut, it is only slight and there is a chance that you could get rid of it quickly. Not that it mattered, you weren\u2019t planning on staying in this body longer than you needed to. Still not wanting to fully disrobe quite yet, you move to the shower in an attempt to try and turn it on. You usually had problems working other people\u2019s showers but for some reason you had no problem turning on the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile you waited for the shower to warm up you went back to the mirror and continued posing as a way of trying to get used to your new body. You can definitely feel a lot of power in the muscles of you arms which you greatly enjoyed. Soon you\u2019re vision was starting to become blocked by the fog that started covering the mirror from the shower. Realizing that you ran out of time to avoid fully undressing, you slowly move your new hands down to your boxers and grab the waistband before pulling them down and kicking them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou weren\u2019t entirely displeased with what you saw. Your new member was had both decent length and girth compared to your old one. It was definitely a plus side to the situation that you were currently in. However after a few seconds it feels a little odd looking at another man\u2019s genitalia so you quickly hop in the shower and let the warm water wash over your new body.  It feels amazing. Your muscles were more sore than you would have liked and the heat was alleviating some of that pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith no hair on your head there isn\u2019t much need for shampoo, but you take a small amount and put it in your beard. You lather your beard with the shampoo before rinsing it out. After that you grab a bottle of body was and pour it into your hand and lather it all over your body, truly exploring all the nooks and crannies of the body you were now inhabiting, taking special care to explore your the areas below your waist. Your hands were rough and calloused and you could feel that roughness as you moved them all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinishing that you let the water run down and rinse away all of the suds and sit in the shower for a little bit just to enjoy the feeling of warmth. Within a few minutes, however, you turn off the water and get out of the shower. You grab for a towel and quickly rub it all over your body to dry off before you wrap it around your waist. Once that is done you head back into John\u2019s bedroom in search of clean clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis proves to be a little useless as most of John\u2019s clothes appear to be in different levels of dirtiness, however you manage to find a white t-shirt and pair of grey sweatpants that seem clean enough. Once you put them on you feel a lot better than you did before. It was definitely weird being in someone else\u2019s body but at least now you were clean and felt a little bit more normal. You walk over to the bed and spread your self out across the blankets. You weren\u2019t planning on sleeping quite yet but it felt good to be off your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow that you had gotten showering out of the way you had a few options. You could leave your room and check with Frank to see if the pizza was here yet. The hunger pains were more noticeable now and food was sounding good. Another option would be to call your old body and see what was happening. You found it a little odd that the real John hadn\u2019t tried calling you either. You also noticed that there was a stirring in your pants. You still weren\u2019t necessarily comfortable exploring someone else\u2019s body in that way but it was another valid option. </span></div></div>",

You realized you had swapped bodies with the criminal, and you decided to just stand there like an idiot. The cops didn't believe you. Your family didn't believe you. The man in your body didn't vouch for you. You were caught, taken to trial and sentenced to ten years in prison. Finally, after all that time, you've been released for parole on good behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the busy street, with just an ankle collar and the clothes on your back. The question burning in your mind is what your body is up to, and whether or not the machine is still working. Without you around, no one knows how to take care of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as to avoid suspicion, you wait two weeks before approaching your old life. You get a job as a garbage man and find cheap board. A couple weeks later, while you're out on the truck, you pass by your old home, and find that it's empty, and your family has moved. After your shift, you go to the library, and a public computer in order to do a little research on your old life. By the magic of social networking, you find your parent's new address, which points to a condo in Florida. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister has an apartment with a few friends, and your brother is apparently in college studying theoretical sciences. \"You,\" are living in the same city. Working at a McDonalds, and apparently mooching off of your friend Ryan who is doing better than you are. You roll your eyes, and want to cry. Scott sure made productive use of his fresh start in life. So where's the machine? Scott might know where it is. There's no way the machine sat in your garage for five years without being discovered by someone else, so maybe your brother or sister found it and know what happened to it.</span></div></div>",

You place the rock down and pick ip the sleeping form of robber that was once your mom and place it in the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out your body and place the rock in and press the button, the machine starts shaking again and with a bright flash, the pod opens again.

I found the culprit!\" His eyes start flickering with fear as two policemen come in and put him in a chokehold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks away saying, \"wait...wait i need to know!\" He disappears from sight as he is fotced in the cop car a driven away. You watch with a smile, which quickly fadrs ad your father grabs you by the shoulder and says, \"good job honey!\" He turns you around and kisses you straight on the lips.

It\u2019s not like mom will wake up after all, since her mind is in a rock.\u2019 Despite being a sentient rock, she has no eyes or ears, so she can\u2019t see or hear. You guess that she might be able to feel still, but she\u2019ll likely remain unconscious as long as she\u2019s in the rock. As for your body, you can just lock the pod so no one finds it and tell everyone \u2018Luke\u2019 went to a friend\u2019s house. So, you did just that, and also put your Mom-Rock in a drawer for safe keeping.

You pondered the chance of swapping with your sister, and having her deal with these hormones. That way, not only would you get out of sleeping with your father, but you would be able to laugh at the fact that your sister had to sleep with her own father. While this thought seemed compelling, your hormones also made you dislike the thought. You were excited about sleeping with your husband after all. Why give that opportunity to your daughter? Then you\u2019d just have to deal with HER hormones, and might end up sleeping with her boyfriend or something. Your male mind was also disgusted by that thought as well, but not as much as the thought of sleeping with your father. Your hormones, however, made you excited about that thought as well.

That means we don't have a lot of time to get grandma back in her body. We'll need your help, Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Erika looks shocked. \"You want to kill grandma?! Why can't we just let her die with the mouse inside? Are you fucked up enough that you care more about one of your lab rats than someone from your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it, Erika. That's grandma's body. She's lived her life, and if it's her time, it's her time. We can't just keep switching her from body to body so she lives forever. That's not right. Do you want to keep her in the body of that mouse, or let her keep Kathy's body? Maybe you want to donate yours.\" The thought gives your sister goosebumps, but she still looks angry. \"With grandma's body gone, someone isn't going to have a body to go back to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she can't speak the human tongue at the moment, Kathy seems to agree with you. Your sister is being stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my boy,\" says a male voice from the door.

Though I'm shocked to find that my son has built a bodyswap machine, I'm pleased to know that he's got a good head on his shoulders. Let's fix this, kids.\" Your dad is strangely quick to accept this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you convene in the garage. After explaining the functions of the machine in detail, you formulate a plan together.</span></div></div>",

Grandma shouldn't be able to recognize it as anything but an mp3 player. It pains you to be stuck here. You don't really trust your sister to get the job done, but you have no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke,\" your dad begins. \"You really are my son. When I was your age, I did the same thing. I built a body switching machine in my shed.\"  You rub your eyes in disbelief, that your father, who had always been strictly against your experiments, came from the same field of study. \"I had some fun with it at first. I switched bodies with my family members. I switched with friends, animals. I switched other people around. I felt like I could do or become anything. I felt like God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you so against my science, Dad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father continues. \"As more and more people found out about my mind swapper, more and more people began to use it for their own, personal gain. I tried moving it, locking it. I set codes so that only I could use it, but nothing worked. It was chaos. After a month, I couldn't trust anyone in my life to be the person they said they were. My parents were replaced. My friends were replaced. Old bodies and animals died with the wrong minds inside them. It was horrible. The worst part was waking up nearly every morning in that shed, because someone else stole my body while I slept.\" He paused, for a moment, reflecting on his troubled past. \"I was afraid you'd eventually build a machine of your own. The desire to swap is an addiction. Even now, I still get desires to swap bodies from time to time. That desire might even be in the genetics, since you followed in my footsteps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... Horrible, Dad,\" you say, not knowing what else you could say. Deep inside, you wanted to believe this machine could serve a positive use to society, but he was right. One day into the machine's lifespan, and you already had a body snatcher to deal with. As more people were exposed to its power, the dangers would only rise exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to set as much right as I could, but once they had ideal bodies, it was nearly impossible to get them out of them. Even after I destroyed my machine, I discovered that there were more swaps than I knew about. When I turned 18, I divorced myself from the entire lot of them, and moved here where I met your mother. That's why you've never met my side of the family. We need to make sure this doesn't get out of hand again. Do you understand, son?\" You nod, with a newfound respect for your father. Both as a scientist and a role model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika returns from the house alone (Kathy decided to keep as far away from this mess as possible when she got her body back), with a violently shaking shoebox, and climbs into the back seat. \"I don't think Grandma is too happy to be a mouse. Let's hurry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the hospital, the guards stop you at the door. \"You can't bring a rat into the hospital, are you insane?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device had enough juice for two swaps left. How are you going to get grandma's mind back into her body?</span></div></div>",

Between you, and your dad's strength, as wielded by your sister, you manage to restrain your grandma in your sister's body. \"What do we do now, Luke?\" she asks you.

Could it have been that kid?!\" Kim says shocked remembering her encounter with a boy in a black hood. Kim ran out of the room and asked one of the nurses \"Hey did you see a kid with a black hood leave Abigail Wilson's room earlier?\" The nurse ponder for a second and said \"Yes I think I did see someone wearing a black hoodie as we were rushing into her room...\" Kim ran out of the hospital and looked everywhere around the hospital. \"Damn it! He got away! I swear Mom I'll make him suffer!\" Kim said with hatred in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at the house. Kim is doing the dishes and the others are elsewhere in the house. Kyle appeared in his black hood behind Kim and snapped his fingers creating a barrier to freeze time and space where only he and his mom can move. Kim threw a steak knife at Kyle but he moved out of the way. \"So you must have sensed me appear behind you. I'm impressed.\" Kyle said. \"Your the one who killed my mother aren't you!\" Kim yelled try to cut him with a knife but he grabbed her arm. \"Please stop I don't want to fight you...I only wanted to talk about what happened today.\" Kyle sighed staring into his mother's eyes which were filled with rage. \"Why should I listen to what you say you could be lying!\" his mother yelled. \"No Luke, Kyle, Erika and Mark can all back me up on this. The truth is that Luke created a BSM which your mother used to try and steal a new body because she knew her's was dying so she first tried to take Luke's and failed so she went after Erika and she almost got away with it. But they managed to get her back into her own body after they left I showed to make sure she wouldn't steal another body. It's wrong every soul should die when the body can't take care of it anymore.\" Kyle said. \"What do I care if she stole another body! I still need her!\" Kim yelled. Kyle squeezed Kim's arm and stared straight at her almost as if staring into her soul, she couldn't see his face due to being covered but she saw two red eyes looking at her. \"I can't believe you are really that selfish. I want you to think about something what's more important your organization or your own children. I hope I don't have to confront you like this again make the right choice.\" Kyle said as he let her go and faded away into darkness. </span></div></div>",

On the other side of the coin, her body died, and only you, your father, Erika and Kathy know that it wasn't her who died. More concerning is that your grandmother had been relatively healthy for an old woman. She was old, but active. There were no signs that she was on her deathbed.

All of the clothes had been removed from the room, too, in case you did want to make an escape somehow. She doesn't want to be identified, when she switches back.

I'm a married man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's okay for you to do that with another guy as long as you're in someone else's body, right? Fucking hypocrite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika! Watch your language!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? You took advantage of me like that, and you think you can order me around? Like I have any respect for you left? Give me one good reason why I should even switch back now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Erika, maybe we should- Who's there!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge from behind the machine. \"Don't worry, it's me, Luke.\" Your father and sister, apparently still in each others bodies, exchange confused looks. \"When I woke up this morning, I was tied up in this girl's dorm room. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister's face becomes bright red, \"Uh. I. Uhm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour actual sister clenches a fist, and punches your dad in the arm. \"This deadbeat went to a college party in my body last night. He probably got drunk and blabbed about the machine to someone. We'll be right back, Luke. Daddy and I are going to step into the other room and finish this conversation.\" Your sister and father head into the den. You hop on the computer and bring up the records of the machine's use from the past 24 hours. The machine's core is still in place, thankfully, so the machine is operational. All of the data for the Grandmother incident is accounted for, and... Six additional swaps have occurred since then, spread out over several hours. You slam your head against the desk as you realize you're not going to be pulling the plug on the machine today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your sister and father return, your sister makes an announcement. \"We've decided to stay this way for a while.\"</span></div></div>",

A few other people were in the room when he let the beans slip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your father goes to check on your mother, you lean back and look at the machine, cursing yourself for ever building it. At this point, you realize you have nothing on you. Your sundress has no pockets, you have no wallet. No cellphone. There's no way for your father and sister to reach you. You consider going up to your room to change into some men's clothes but decide against it. Instead you go to your sister's room, and take one of her bags. \"When in Rome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the garage, you consider. what you can do.

Take my phone, and head back to the university. You talk to people she knows, and see if you can find any clues.

You lose yourself in it, for what you couldn't tell, was a few hours.

How your grandmother had turned into a crazed person, and everything you know leading to when you woke up in the dorm room this morning.

Cara would never have let me even hug her, and would definitely never open up to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, what can you tell me about Cara. I need to get my body back before she does anything terrible with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's rude, and when she's not out partying like an animal, she locks herself in her room and won't.

You notice how her bright green eyes contrast with her light brown hair, and start to wonder what exactly she's thinking.  The conversational advantage you had over her was already slipping away, as she continued to elude you.  She places one finger under your chin, turning your head up to look straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally smiles, \"There, that looks better.

It went quicker than you expected, and within minutes the girl in the reflection definitely looked prettier and more cleaned up.  Any blemishes on Cara's skin were no longer visible, and her eyes popped out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... it looks so much better, but it's like you didn't put anything on at all.\"  You said as you studied your new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed pleased with herself, \"Of course, I hope that's something I hope you remember about girls who wear makeup.

The real Cara never smiles around me, so it's nice to see you in a good mood now.  Just don't let it go to your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surprised you with another kiss to the lips, pulling away slowly with a mischievous look in her eyes. \"I have a feeling you're going to leave, so I wanted to do that one last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you- Well yeah I guess I was thinking about it...\"  You trailed off, being reminded that you really should try to get on Cara's trail, and contact Kyle.  But a part of you had your mind on other things, \"But it doesn't have to be the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arm around Dawn, giving her waist a gentle tug and returned the kiss.  You looked away awkwardly afterwards, \"I should call my brother... he's been looking out for clues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks almost disappointed at this, but nods in agreement. \"Sounds like you have a plan then, that's good...  You know you can come back here at anytime, Lucara.  I mean if you need a place to sleep, there's always a bed open.  I-I mean Cara's bed!  But I mean not that I-\"  Dawn stammers through her sentence, stopping herself before she said anything stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a pleasant smile with Cara's face, and she relaxes slightly.  \"It's ok Dawn, thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

Actually, the empty pod is the one which she had been in when she passed out. The one she had just stepped out of is where Erika had been. \"Is this a teleporter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing her own, young voice, she figured it out immediately, and found a mirror. \"Oh lord, I've become my granddaughter. But where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandma rushed down the hallway, when she reached the dining room. You, Kyle, your mom and father were all sitting down and enjoying dinner. Greasy, spicy, gassy, delicious tacos, that your grandmother had been unable to enjoy for many years now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice of you to join us, Erika,\" Your dad said in a sassy tone. \"Sit down, eat.\" Your grandmother obeyed and began to enjoy food which she had missed dearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of dinner conversation does she bring up?</span></div></div>",

Your grandmother, Charlotte, decides it would be for the best to retire for the night and go get Erika back in the morning. She had a lot of freedom in her retirement community, but also a lot of restrictions too. It would be way too strange for a teenager, let alone one that has Erika's appearance, to show up unannounced and try to take an old woman out at this hour. If Erika was even awake, of course. Charlotte had a lot of trouble staying up this late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother had retired to Erika's bedroom out of habit, but when she got there, she found she actually had a lot of energy. She wasn't tired at all. She wasn't dreaming. This really was her granddaughters' body after all. Charlotte looked in the mirror, and blushed. \"Imagine, a woman of my age, dressed like this! Bright nylons... A plaid schoolgirl skirt... All this black... and Pink hair!\" She rustled her fingers through her vibrant, colored hair. She admired the bold makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I always felt a little embarrassed to be around Erika when she was dressed up like this, but I think I understand now. I look... \"Awesome,\" as Erika would say!\" Charlotte couldn't stop smiling, and did a twirl, causing her skirt to lift up and twist about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring herself for some time, Charlotte spent the rest of the night snooping through Erika's room, trying to get to know the granddaughter she had neglected a bit. Eventually she settled down for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gone to bed so early, for Erika, Charlotte woke up extra early the next morning. She needed to go get Erika so she could switch back. </span></div></div>",

She wanted to respect her granddaughter's image, but she was also feeling a tad selfish, and decided to go with more traditional clothing. She found some clothes she had bought for Erika, tags still attached, of course, and borrowed a few things from her daughter's closet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a long skirt, and a well-ironed blouse. The pink hair threw off the look quite a bit, but she was able to put it up in a way that still looked mature. Charlotte had managed to age Erika up quite a bit, so it wouldn't look nearly as suspicious when she picked up her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte went downstairs, and was showered with compliments about how nice she looked from your mother.

I'm on my way to go bring her back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're annoyed that someone had used your machine before you, but you were probably going to try it on Erika anyways. \"Well, Grandma...

But she will not be taking orders from her grandson.When she gets outside, she sees Erika's friend Kathy is waiting to pick her up for school, so she climbs into the passenger's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy's jaw drops. \"E-E-Erika?? What? What happened to you? I mean, you look amazing but... I didn't think you could be so femme! Why? Did Luke do something to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte graciously accepts the compliment. \"Thank you, dear, but a young woman needs to experiment to find her own look!

You're old, you're supposed to want to steal a young body and run away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika! How could you say something like that!\" Charlotte bit her lip as she fought back an onslaught of tears. Did her granddaughter really think of her as some kind of evil hag? \"You're my treasured granddaughter. My family. I'm so proud of you. I would never think of stealing your whole life away from you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, geez...\" Erika felt bad for saying it. \"Well, you can at least stay like this for a day, right? I mean...

Well, I think you'll change your mind on that pretty quickly. My old body isn't as much fun as you think. But if you would like to learn more about me by walking in my shoes, I will tend to your studies for the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... Thanks Grandma. But... If you wanted to skip school, that would be okay too. You're kind of... messing with my image with this getup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skip school? Absolutely not!

No one could tell that behind this supermodel was a pathetic, depressed little girl who never grew up. Though she was immature in the head, this body was anything but. Grabbing her breasts and giving them a little rub, your father relished in the pleasure. When he was a kid, he had spent just a week inside this body, and after being inside it for twenty minutes, it was like returning to an old home. For a moment, he felt a sense of pride in how his body had matured, before shaking it off. He knew he should switch back right away, but it was so much easier to hate body swapping when you weren't standing in the body of a gorgeous woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped her clothes, relished a bit more, and took a bath before bed. His eagerness to explore of lesser priority than his anticipation of tomorrow's work. He was going to prove to his sister that her life wasn't so bad after all, and that if he could do it, she could stick it out for a little bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark woke up the next morning, and sprawled out all four of his limbs across the soft bed. He slept <i>wonderfully</i>! He showered again, and wrapped a towel around his torso like a small dress, and proceeded to work on his hair. Surprisingly, hair care and makeup application are one of those skills you don't lose after any period of time, much like driving a car. When he was looking gorgeous, he put on a pair of tight jeans, which he thought couldn't possibly fit, but actually slid on like butter, and a sleeveless top. Before he left for work, your father looked in the mirror, and realized, this was the best, and happiest he had seen his sister look in 20 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he left, to drive to work. As it happened, the route to the studio happened to overlap with the one he used in his daily routine, and he saw his favorite donut-cofee joint. Does he stop in?</span></div></div>",

Kelly's cell phone begins to go off wildly, which Mark ignores. Day One of The Life of Kelly was not going entirely according to plan. The plan went out the window when the passenger door of the car opened, and a man sat down. Before he could say anything, a gun was waving around his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're far too pretty to be in this neck of the woods, mam'.\" The man reached over and brushed a strand of hair out of the model's eye. \"If you drive around alone down here, some unsavory gentleman is going to take advantage of you.\" Mark feels the tip of the gun jut into his armpit as he hangs on to the steering wheel for dear life. \"It's alright, honey. You'll know next time. I'll escort you home, and show you why you shouldn't make this same mistake again. Let's go.\" </span></div></div>",

As these urges grew, I knew I had to do something.  That's when I saw your machine.  I heard your explanation, so I waited for someone to walk into the machine.  Then I saw you walk into the machine.  I knew it was the perfect time, so I tried...... and then failed.  Then after you left the garage, I set up the trap.  And well... you know the rest.  I'm sorry for tricking you, but I had to feel how it is to be a boy.  If you are still mad we can switch back now.\"  You stood dumbfounded at your cousins story.

Until you came along, she had been one of the youngest and most accomplished minds in the field of \"Broad Scientific Innovation,\" at a mere 22 years old. Her first impression was to take you under her wing, perhaps make you her assistant or partner, but she quickly realized that you were on her level, or perhaps even higher. Instead of working together, she decided she needed to destroy you. Your lab, your garage, was totally bugged. You couldn't build a toaster without Michelle knowing about it, and attempting to either sabotage or one-up you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the same evening you completed your body swapping machine, Michelle had completed hers. It worked <i>almost </i>exactly the same as yours, but she'd secretly installed a link between her machine and yours. You didn't know it, but so long as both machines were operational, a bodyswap could be performed between people in the pods of opposite machines<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle finished recording her notes, and looked over the machine in front of her. You'd gone to bed, but Michelle was wide awake. She would test hers out before you could test yours.

The young scientist navigated your house to the bathroom, where she gazed into the mirror to see your reflection. She smiled. \"Brilliant. My machine worked exactly as I designed it.\" Though pretending to be unsurprised by the results, Michelle was really drooling. This was by far, one of the most amazing things she had witnessed through her scientific pursuits. Her mind had just traveled miles, instantly, in the blink of an eye, and was able to dislodge from her own physical form, and take on another. The possibilities of this were incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn yet another level, Michelle was a woman, and now had the body of a man.

There were models and notebooks, and a big computer mounted in the wall. You take a seat in front of it, just in time to see something on the monitor that catches your interest. It's a camera feed, and it appears to be your garage. More importantly, it appears to be YOU in your garage, doing something on the computer. \"This is unreal,\" you say again, taking attention to your new voice. \"So, who am I?\" You pull up some ID info on the computer you're in front of, and find the identity of your new body: Professor Michelle Anderson! \"That Witch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything else, you see your own body step alone into one of the pods of your machine.

Unsure of what she can do to fix this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at her as she struggles over her plan not going accordingly. \"Now what will you do?\" Her next move is to take out a cell phone, and call someone.

You look over Michelle. Her blonde hair, her glasses, her labcoat over her overly skinny torso. Skinny legs poking out of a short black skirt. You think to yourself. Maybe you don't want to change back. Michelle had everything you had, and more, even. A laboratory, privacy, and a body you lusted after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The equipment she has certainly looks expensive but you managed to get the same results for less money. A look through Michelle's blueprints reveals she's a good scientist, she has some interesting ideas. However with your brain you notice a few flaws in the designs, nothing you can fix though. Your scientist heart pounces with excitement of the experiments you can do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you realize you've never been to Michelle's house before. It had been on the local news a few times, but you would quickly zap away when she would show up bragging with another one of her inventions. You notice a set of stairs going up and curious but excited walk the stairs upwards where you find a door and open it very carefully. It wouldn't surprise you if Michelle had booby trapped the place for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever stepping outside the lab nothing happens. Clearly Michelle never thought you would refuse her offer of switching back. What a fool she is. You then notice your surroundings. It's surprisingly...small. You expected some big mansion or some sort. Looking outside through the windows you notice you're in a suburb. You don't understand Michelle, if you were her (which you are now) you would have moved some place remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furniture inside the house is tasteful but cheap. You notice a few drawings on the wall which are signed by Michelle. Huh? Never thought she was the artsy type. Never mind that was not the most important thing here. The kitchen is also small, but everything needed is here including a microwave. Perfect for those in between snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another set of stairs on the ground floor which you climb. Upstairs you look through her bathroom (which has a bath with a lot of bottles) and a bedroom (a double bed nonetheless). Sitting down on the bed you notice how soft it is. You can't help but smile at all of this. This was all yours now. You had your own house, your own funds and a female body. Speaking of your female body you can't help but wonder how it looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you take this chance to check it out or go busy with one of your inventions?</span></div></div>",

Even being older, more experienced, and better funded she felt threatened by you just because you were male. \"Well she got her wish\", you say to yourself. You take another look in the mirror. With some work this body could be a knockout. \"Time for a makeover\", you say out loud. You search through Michelle's, or rather your closet and find her wardrobe just as disappointing as her personal hygiene. \"I guess it's time for a new wardrobe as well\", you laugh shaking your head. You throw on the best looking outfit you can find, grab her keys, her purse, and head out to the driveway. Michelle also didn't put a lot of thought into her selection of vehicles. She drive a 10 year old Ford. You sigh and say, \"One thing at a time. You have the rest of her life.\" Once in the car you make a call to the spa your Mom always uses for her girl's day and check for an open slot. Fortunately they have one, but you have on 30 minutes to get there. Not a problem since you're only 15minutes from the spa. You start up the car and head that direction.</span></div></div>",

As the door shut behind her, she had one last fleeting thought,\" I probably should have tested this out first\", it was too late, however, and an electric, pulling sensation overwhelmed her consciousness. <br>\r\n      As she came to, Michelle was on her rear and a compartment door was slowly opening, allowing dim light to simmer into view. As she got to her feet, Michelle could feel that her body was heavier. Her initial steps were clumsy, and Michelle could tell that she was wearing slippers, and whatever she was wearing was soft and fuzzy. She made her way to the slight glow of the computer screen. Her new fingers slowly tried to hack into the computer, but to no avail. The password seemed uncrackable, \"Touche, Lucas\", she said, halting for a second as a deeper, more sultry voice escaped her lips. Her own voice was lighter and raspier. Admitting defeat for the night, Michelle made her way out of the garage and into the house. With every step, Michelle could feel her body jiggle in ways that she hadn't felt before. Knowing the layout of the house from bugging it, Michelle made her way to her new room. <br>\r\n       Creeping past a sleeping Mark, she glided over to the bathroom door and gently closed it. She then flicked on the lights and was greeted by her new reflection in a full-length mirror. Her eyes lit up a bit, having never gotten an in-depth look at Kim. As she approached the mirror, she placed her hand on her new oval face. Though very slight lines could be seen, the skin was soft like velvet. A turn up nose sat between hazel eyes while a mane of thick brown hair crowned her face pulled back into a pony tail. Michelle then looked down at her pink bathrobe adorned body. It was quite different than her's, which was 5'10 and thin. Kim's 5'5 frame could be described as more voluptuous. Michelle put her hands up and gently cupping the full, C-cup breasts. She wondered if they sagged when the bathrobe was removed. She then placed her hands on her slight stomach. It was softer than her own, but perhaps this woman couldn't maintenance on every aspect of her body over the years. Her view then shifted to her wide, womanly hips. Michelle then turned to the side, seeing a large bump of a buttocks that stuck out even through the bathrobe. She then gently lifted her new fabric-covered cheeks. Although she had her doubts about the breasts, there was no doubt that the bulbous ass had retained its firmness. Kim must have been fond of squats.<br>\r\n    Michelle then face the mirror again, pursing her new full lips. It was truly a unique experience to inhabit a new body. What did she decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

Stepping out of the portal, Michelle appears, still inhabiting control of Luke's girlfriend's body and appears unamused. Looking back at the portal, she stares at it before aiming her device at it, watching it disappear. Michelle looks around the area, recognizing it as the place she planned to appear at. It is the girlfriend of Luke's home, a strangely generic house the girlfriend resides in. For the time being, there are other things she would rather do. Taking out her new identity card, Michelle checks the name of your girlfriend, date of birth, and other information as a quick run-through. It could always prove useful to her in the long run. Calmly, she focuses and decides to get to business. Michelle goes to the house and uses her new keys to enter the premises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her new home, she goes around inspecting it and examining all that is present. It all seems strange and new to her, yet she has a unamused expression on her face. She did spend some time at this house prior to visited her former body. Luke's mother was most useful in providing the fake-confused girlfriend of where she lives, even offering to drive her there like a kind mother would. She did seem to worry about her daughter's strange behavior, but regardless Michelle carried out her goals anyway while conversing with her and being at their residence. It was mostly to get a good understanding and feel of the place while searching her belongings. Going through her belongings, she found a diary, presented with useless information and facts about the girl she pretends to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like last time, there could be a chance that she might find the same diary once more. Spotting her room, Michelle enters the place, desiring to inspect the place and her new residence. Michelle searches around the room for anything that might prove useful and worth knowing about. Everything seems perfectly casual and neat. Most of her clothes and accessories almost seem cheaply made or made to look authentic. Even if Luke's girlfriend were to have made something herself, it would never be on the level of Michelle's creation should she ever consider doing such measly crafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stops and takes a look at herself. It might prove to be quite useful to get to know the girl and take a break, after all. Seeing the girlfriend's body reflected on the mirror. She pouts and continues to analyze her feminine form. Taking her hands, she feels her attire, noting the sensation seems quite different from what she wears. The pants appear to be quite rougher than the shirt she wears. Her bracelets and necklace are quite strange to her as she never cared for such jewelry appearance before. Undressing herself, Michelle hopes to get a good look at her form. Her pants, shoes, and jewelry are off of her. Before tossing the shirt aside, she holds it in her hand. Bringing it up to her nose, Michelle sniffs it, sensing perfume and body wash present on it. Michelle rubs it against her cheek, noting the smooth fabric, before shoving her face into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels so good and embracing, making her excited to find something quite as good as this. Her parents never bought something as soft as this for her, as they were often busy with their own life and jobs. Gripping it tightly, Michelle wipes it on her body, feeling its softness while having a look of satisfaction in her face. It feels enjoyable to her, something she wishes to keep to herself when she feels its necessary to embrace once again. Her body becomes warm from it as she feels slightly wet. Michelle giggles to herself as she pauses for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at the girl's breasts, speculating its size and shape. Feeling the breasts, Michelle feels the soft fabric of the bra, surprised how it is quite different from what she herself wore in her original body. It makes her wish she had something as supporting as this bra back in her own body. She brings her legs closer to each other, rubbing them together as she blushes. Going on the bed, she explores her sensations a little, a bit happy for her results with the machine she built. Everything about this girlfriend of Luke's seems so inviting and warm.</span></div></div>",

Days of working hard has made him busy and tired. Heading on up to her room, Luke's real girlfriend appears in the room, watching someone go through her clothing in the drawer. Staring at her clone, she wonders exactly what is going on. She seems shocked by the identical twin she never knew existed present before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" the girlfriend asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle pauses and freezes in place.

Well, if you must know, I am you from the future.\" Michelle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" the girlfriend wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you do not believe me? Expectations such as these annoyances are much to be considered, after all.\" Michelle sighs and goes over to the girlfriend's bed to sit down. She truly does not want to have this conversation at the moment, yet this insignificant person persists for answers. \"Do not worry, this all involves your boyfriend in the long run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, why would he do something like this?\" the girlfriend asks her. In her mind, she can expect something of Luke, but is unsure how everything falls together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know, the simple fact that you chose to be his girlfriend is proof enough of your questionable mindset and brash reasoning.\" Michelle tells her. Looking at the girl, Michelle can't help but feel disgusted by her, despite being in her future self's body. \"You must not tell your boyfriend, nor anyone for that matter about my presence. It is crucial for my objectives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about you if you're supposed to be me?\" Luke's girlfriend says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you must know, I am someone who regrets that man you've grown fond of with a great passion. For me, I do not see the love you currently share with him.\" Michelle says with a sigh. \"Your relationship with him has barely became as important as it is now to me. Points to you for drawing my consideration to this possibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has happened to you to make you be this way?\" the girlfriend wonders, worried about her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot can change a person throughout their time, you insignificant ditz. I ran out of that cheap food and drink we like so much, you know?\" Michelle answers. \"I feel quite like the rebellious grownup that I am right now, not taking any rules and regulations for anything into proper consideration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, me. That is terrible!\" the girlfriend says shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely the matter currently at hand, which is why I have appeared and wish to borrow your diary and resources to gather information. My retribution for all that has occurred is in order. That is why I came to this wretched place and shabby room.\" Michelle tells her.</span></div></div>",

It would be a perfect plan as the legitimate Michelle would be around for any possible swaps and creative intellect alongside her temporal copies with the same analytical and creative mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Michelle might as well have her own fun.

It could prove useful walking around while being the girl, with people unsuspecting of her actions and demands. The fact that reality has adjusted to her body swapping action and make people treat her as Luke's girlfriend despite her unusual actions proves to be a great asset.</span></div></div>",

You nearly jump out of your skin. \u201cShit, Jodi you nearly scared me to death\u201d, you exclaim! Jodi lives a couple of doors done. She\u2019s your age and attractive and very busty though you have never noticed as you\u2019re always caught up in your experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you were younger you were close, but as you got older you\u2019ve become more distant. She still comes over all the time watching you work. She asks a lot of annoying questions. You doubt she understands half what you tell her, but she sticks around anyway. If you\u2019d been paying more attention you would have realized she\u2019s in love with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You explain to her what the machine is supposed to do. When you\u2019re done she says, \u201cOk, when do we fire this puppy up\u201d? You\u2019d wanted to test it out. Jodi though would not be your first choice to switch with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you figure you can\u2019t be choosey. Jodi though for some reason makes you feel strange. She distracts you from your work like no one else can. \u201cOk, fine. Get into that pod over there\u201d, you instruct. You get into the other and start up the machine. You feel a moment of disorientation. It\u2019s as if for split second you can feel even hear someone else\u2019s thoughts. Before you can grab on to anything the transfer completes. You immediately know the test is a success. It\u2019s hard not to notice Jodi\u2019s breasts. Jodi gets up and starts checking himself out. You stand there for a few minutes watching. \u201cOk, it worked. Get back into the pod and I\u2019ll switch us back\u201d, you state impatiently. Being in Jodi\u2019s body is very strange and you want out.  He shakes his head and pleads, \u201cCome on Luke we just switched let\u2019s see what it\u2019s like to be each other for a while. Pretend that it\u2019s one of your experiments\u201d. It is an intriguing thought to see how the other half lives. To see if your thought patterns are affected by this bodies female chemistry. It is a switch in fields from what you\u2019re currently working on. Then again it\u2019s an opportunity. Jodi sees you thinking and adds, \u201cYou have my permission to touch my body anyway you want\u201d. You may be committed to science, but you\u2019re also a teenage boy, or at least have the mind of one and you now have the body of a girl you can do anything you want with. You agree without anymore thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You spend a few minutes coaching each other on how to act like each other. Since you\u2019ve known each other for years it\u2019s redundant. Jodi stays at your house and you head to yours. You\u2019ve agreed to meet back at her house later tonight as her parents are out of town. You instruct her to bring the portable core so you can switch back. One day should be enough to gather whatever data you need.</span></div></div>",

You quickly take off the strange headpiece and find yourself looking at your new body, which was covered in a thick coat of fur. To be precise, you were wearing a fursuit. \"Oh god... This is not happening!\" You exclaim in a rather feminine yet butch sounding voice, suddenly your body walks forward and begins clapping. \"It's 'bout time you woke up, you loser!\" Exclaimed your former body, \"You pull my look very well!\" You quickly run over to the mirror and looking at the suit you can tell it's meant to be a green-neon colored rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On top of that you were no female, with short-cut black and ear piercings.

Growing up I was always the outcast, always the loser! Now I'm in the body of an award-winning scientist. And you'll spend the rest of your life decked out in a fine fur pelt going to conventions!\" He said, while giving you a firm shove. \"Give me back my body! You have no idea how to use it, and how to make the machine or any of my tech work! You'll be a laughing stock!\" You say in your butch female voice. \"Oh, when I cross that bridge I'll just swap back with you! Of course, you'll lose all your commendations and awards and be the one who is called a laughing stock. In the meantime you'll be making me look like a super-genius in your body!\" He stated while picking up the fursuit's headpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look you aren't going to get awa---\" You begin to say until your speech is muffled by the placement of the headpiece.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but how are you going to operate that machine with your hands stuck in those thick glove like apparatus. The key is at your new home under the pillow, my mad little rabbit. That is the only way you're getting free of that costume!\" She states while pulling the core out of the machine. It powers down, and you realize that you're only option is to go home and get out of the costume. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

The other desk, had been thrown away by your neighbors, which you took home and restored. It had belonged to \"Luke,\" before he'd been... Well, you know. This desk was littered with screws and tools and scientific gizmos you'd been working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister Sally, now 18, appeared in your doorframe half-dressed, and half-awake. \"How are... Yaaaaaawn... How are you already up this early on a Sunday, Tara? Are we even related?\" Sally rubs her eyes and leans against the frame of the door for much needed support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only get one life, Sally... I want to make the most of it.\" After you say this, Sally rubs her head and looks a little flustered, as if she were under attack. \"I love you, sis. If you're happy, keep doing what you're doing. What's right for everyone is different, and that's ok. I just don't want to have any regrets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally swoops in and hugs you, and you return her gesture. \"God, Tara. You're 13. How did you get so mature?\" She pauses briefly. \"Well, actually, you were the most mature one of us from the day you were born. You barely even cried. You were speaking in complete sentences at a year old when I was still going to speech therapy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging Sally tight, you respond, \"I'm sorry if I made it harder on you. I wasn't trying to make you look bad, I just... I was eager to grow up, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally bops you on the head and heads back toward the door. \"Don't worry, I'm not upset. I love you too, sis. But GOD. We're sisters, we're supposed to fight. I'm not supposed to get consoled by my preteen sister... You could do with a lazy day once in a while, though. You're always buzzing around, trying to please everyone and do everything. Take some time for yourself, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally leaves, and you consider what she said.

Especially since female children are mostly the same as male children when it comes to their bodies except for the crotch area, which was easy to forget about when you weren\u2019t peeing. However, after going through puberty as a girl, you\u2019ve gotten used to some things you never had as a guy, like having breasts and periods. Switching bodies with a guy could be jarring since you\u2019d go back to not having breasts again, but if you DID switch with a guy, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be your original body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infant who was supposed to be born as Tara, but switched into your body before her birth, had slowly learned things about life as an infant would, and now has a teenage mind in an adult body. To everyone else, \u2018Luke\u2019 seemed to have suddenly gotten a SEVERE case of amnesia where he forgot literally everything he ever learned including talking and walking, and relearned all of it over several years. \u2018Luke\u2019 doesn\u2019t remember being anyone other than \u2018Luke\u2019, and believes the amnesia story everyone else believes. If you switched with \u2018Luke\u2019 now, he might not be happy about being a girl, plus you aren\u2019t too keen on having your old life now that it\u2019s pretty much been turned upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if you switched with a guy, it would probably be a classmate, such as your old bully, now close friend, Billy. You don\u2019t know for sure, but some of your friends say he developed a crush on you during your late elementary school years, so he would be thrilled to be in your body. It might not be a good idea to switch with him, since he might violate the body you\u2019ve accepted as yours since it was born, but at the same time, it could be the perfect opportunity to try something you never had the chance to when you were a guy. Having sex with a girl. You\u2019re not sure you should do that though since you have always believed teen sex was a bad idea, but since you\u2019re the girl, and would be the guy during sex, you could make sure it\u2019s safe sex to avoid getting your body pregnant. Plus, it would be fitting to lose your virginity as a guy, as you should have if you hadn\u2019t switched into the body Ms Jacobs baby girl, but at the same time, you\u2019ve put a lot of work into this body, so letting someone else lose its virginity is an uncomfortable thought, even if you\u2019re the one taking its virginity. Plus, Billy might not be keen on having sex with his own body, even if you\u2019re the one in it, and he\u2019s in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that opportunity, you\u2019re still not sure you want to be a guy again, even if only briefly. So perhaps it\u2019s better to switch with another girl. Maybe even your 22 year old sister, Sally. You could trust her with your body, and she can keep your invention a secret, so someone stealing it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Plus, you could give her the chance to be younger for a short time. Or perhaps your best friend, Alicia. She and you are very similar in personality, but she\u2019s not nearly as smart as you, and you tutor her a lot. You actually really enjoy her company, and she knows pretty much EVERYTHING about you. Except the fact that you used to be someone else of course. Other than that, she knows everything about you, so she cod easily pretend to be you, especially since she\u2019s very good at acting. She secretly wants to be an actress when she\u2019s an adult, and you\u2019re the only person who knows that. So who should be the other test subject? A guy, such as Billy? Or another girl, like Sally or Alicia?</span></div></div>",

As you head through the school towards your first class you scope out potential test subjects. You wanted two people with very distinct personalities, so you could recognize the results instantly, and have the most fun watching them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open your locker, you hear the most fitting conversation happening just around the corner. It's two of your friends, Alicia and Billy, arguing. Alicia was pretty much your best friend since third grade. She knew most of your secrets, except that tiny one about<i> Luke</i>. You shared almost everything and trust her without question. She's smart, probably due to your influence. Her dream was to be an actress, so naturally she was in the drama club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly had bullied you briefly in Kindergarten, but after you put a stop to that, he turned into your biggest fan. You helped him learn to read, and taught him things all the time. He mellowed out a lot, and wound up becoming another of your close friends. Unfortunately, as you both got older, the hormones set in and his adoration for you turned hard into an unrequited love. You had liked having a guy around, but you never realized how horny they could be until they were interested in you. It's made things a little too awkward lately. Billy is really into movies and film, and runs a video show on the internet called, \"The Angry Film Critic\" where he reviews mostly bad movies and pretends to get angry about them. You sometimes help him out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia and Billy were both very close to you, but they didn't get along very well. Alicia gets very irritated when he's around. Billy... tried to ask Alicia out when you turned him down. She wasn't having any of that. Today, though, they're arguing about, and you can hardly believe it, who has the harder life. It would be criminal if they didn't swap bodies for a day after spouting out every cliche in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you had to spend a day as me, you'd fail before getting out of bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turn to walk away, and you get the device out just in time. You use the camera feature to lock on to Billy and Alicia and hit the SWITCH button before they get too far away. Their bodies both freeze in place, and a flash like blue lightning appears between them. You panic a little, because a lot of people in the hallway saw it happen, and you quickly slip the device back into your skirt pocket. You hadn't expected such a flash effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly's body comes to first. He looks around, grabs a lock of curly hair and then looks down at his body, grabbing onto his thick arms and baggy jeans. Finally he turns around and sees Alicia, and says, \"SHIT. NO.\"  That's Alicia for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly in Alicia's body has a very similar reaction, but it started and ended with her breasts. Other kids in the hallway had no idea what to make of the cool Alicia fondling herself. Alicia stormed over and ripped her own hand away from his chest. They start whispering to each other, so you can't quite make out what's being said. You wonder if it would be too weird if you went over and said hello, but before long, you clearly hear them say, \"We need to talk to Tara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shoot,\" you mutter to yourself as you duck back around the corner towards your locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly and Alicia come running up to your locker all flustered, and start telling you about what you had just witnessed. They immediately start telling you secrets and things they think only they could know in a mad panic to try to convince you who they really are.

Body switching machines are dangerous. You don\u2019t want to risk accidentally switching with a baby again, starting over again. There\u2019s also the possibility someone might STEAL your body or machine, and that would be disastrous. Plus, you already built one once, so you could do it again whenever you want. So it would be best to wait until you\u2019ve grown up and lived as an adult for a while before building a body switching machine. Once you\u2019ve actually experienced life beyond the teenage years, you might purposely switch with a baby again so you could continue learning. You could essentially be immortal, switching into whatever body you want to live forever, but for now, you\u2019ll just put it on hold. After all, what\u2019s the point in being a genius if you only make body switching machines and switching bodies? You couldn\u2019t take full advantage of your genius if you just made body switching machines every time you become old enough to be capable of doing it. So you\u2019ll focus on your mind reading device for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months, you\u2019ve managed to finish your mind reading device. You managed to make it into a small device you wear on your ear resembling a bluetooth you use for phones. You chose this design so it would be inconspicuous. That way, you could read people\u2019s minds without them even knowing. Especially since you can hide it under your long hair, a perk to being a girl. Sure some guys have long hair, but it looks better on girls. The way it works, or at least the way it\u2019s designed to work, is to read the mind of anyone you\u2019re looking at, and play those thoughts in a small speaker in your ear. Now, all you need to do is test it, to see if it works the way you want it to. However, you need a test subject. In other words, you need to try reading someone\u2019s mind. But who to test it on? Perhaps your older sister Sally. The only problem is, the two of you are really close, despite the 5 year age gap, and reading her mind would be an invasion of privacy. But at the same time, you two are so close, she might not mind it. So if you choose to test it on her, you should probably ask for permission first. You could also just take it to school with you in the morning and try reading the minds of random classmates.</span></div></div>",

Now you were starting to get worried. \u201cSay something already!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething already.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes. \u201cVery funny. Anyway, thanks for letting me test it on you.\u201d You stood up, ready to leave the room. \u201cYou know, you really should be studying instead of texting. Your grades could be better.\u201d Sally pulled a history textbook out and started reading through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found this very odd. \u201cWait, your studying now? That was sudden. Why are you studying now?\u201d Still no response. You paused in thought. \u201cScience is more interesting. Study that instead.\u201d Sally switched her history textbook for a science one and started studying it. Now this is really odd. Sally seemed to be listening to you. Even though the two of you are really close, she usually never listens to you when it comes to studying. You decided to try something to see if she\u2019s just messing with you. \u201cTake off your bra.\u201d Sally obeyed, skillfully taking off her bra without taking her shirt off. Too easy. You have to try telling her to do something she\u2019d never do. \u201cSuck on your left tit.\u201d Once again, Sally obeyed, lifting her left breast out of her shirt, without taking her shirt off, and placing her nipple in her mouth, all while continuing to study her science textbook. \u201cWhy are you sucking on your tit?\u201d Sally said nothing, still sucking on her tit. \u201cStop sucking on your tit answer my last question.\u201d She stopped sucking on her tit, but didn\u2019t put it back in her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me to.\u201d She said in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be? Could your mind reading device be doing this somehow? \u201cPick your nose.\u201d She obeyed. \u201cWipe your snot on your left tit and start sucking it again.\u201d She obeyed, while still studying. Gross. Your sister would definitely never do that, even for a prank. Which means your mind reading device MUST be doing this. Somehow, instead of reading her thoughts and playing them for you, they\u2019re manipulating her mind. This shouldn\u2019t be possible, since mind reading and mind control work very differently, even though both involve signals being sent to or received from the brain. However, even though it\u2019s impossible, it somehow happened. Instead of making a mind reading device like you planned, you made a mind CONTROL device. You smirked, thinking of all the possibilities. You just needed to test one final thing. You press the same button on the device that you pressed before, deactivating it, and Sally suddenly stopped sucking on her tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-why am I sucking on my tit?\u201d Sally asked. You quickly pressed the activation button again, putting Sally back into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about everything that has happened since I walked in the room.\u201d You smirked again, thinking of all the possibilities. Even though you love Sally, you could use your new device to mess with her. Making minor alterations to her mind, even helping her out a bit by making her more studious. Or you could leave Sally alone, any try controlling other people.</span></div></div>",

If you notice any exceedingly poor quality chapters, or would like to see extra branches added, choices changed out, or any chapters get overhauled, please let me know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Recurring Characters</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Family</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Luke; You</i> - You're a social outcast and a bit of a mad scientist. While you've invented a lot of amazing devices, the body switching machine is your masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kyle; Your brother</i> - Though you're not twins, your brother Kyle is very similar to you. He looks a lot like you, but he actively keeps up his appearance. He's a little more popular than you, but not to jock levels. He likes to play with your inventions, and even though it makes you angry, he's just as intelligent as you are, but too lazy to be a scientist like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Erika; Your sister</i> - A punk girl, relentlessly trying to rebel against <i>something</i>. Her style might be an attempt to get attention, but your mother is very understanding of a teen's need to be creative and rebellious, so she goes unopposed. She has a bit of a grudge with you, because you tend to use her as a guinea pig for experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kim; Your mother</i> - A middle school teacher, your mother has always been highly supportive of your scientific pursuits. She's not dumb, but she tends to be ditzy, which plays to her adventurous side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mark; Your father</i> - He's supposedly unemployed and a stay-at-home dad, but he always seems to have some kind of business to do. He's an extremely intelligent man, and clearly where you get your brains from. He doesn't approve of your experiments, but allows them to happen because of your mother. He's never shared his mysterious past with you kids, but when he was your age, he also built a body swapping machine, and saw all of the horrible things it could cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kelly Your Aunt</i>- Your father's sister. When she was young and stupid, she signed contracts without reading them thoroughly, and ended up trapped in a world of modeling where she was constantly getting the short end of the stick. Her contracts are due to expire soon, but years of stress have left her emotionally unstable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Others</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Professor Michelle Anderson; Science Rival</i> A 22 year old scientist from the same city. Ever since you came into the science game, she's felt threatened by you. She's bugged your garage, and is always watching from her own secret lab. Sometimes she sabotaged your inventions, other times she'll try and build better versions of the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ronald Tramp Famous Billionaire CEO</i>- Ronald Tramp is a famous billionaire who once had his own TV show, \"You're Hired!\" He wants to turn body swapping into a service that can be sold by his company. He actually seems to be a pretty nice guy, genuinely wanting to help people improve their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shana White</i> - The confident and cruel 18 year old daughter of local billionaire, Richard White. She is a classmate of your brother Kyle, and attends the same school as you and your siblings. It's unclear why someone so rich is attending a public school. Shana considers herself above everyone. Often attended by her personal maid and bodyguard, Lisabelle, who is the same age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
