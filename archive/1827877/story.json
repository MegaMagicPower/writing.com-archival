Her Mom, dad, and 15-year old twin sister Bertha all weight over twice as much as they should. Her family eats five meals a day; breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and desert. Hilda's mother even dropped her daughters out of school because Bertha got too hungry to concentrate in school; school lunches never came close to filling her. So now the girls get home schooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this Thanksgiving,</span></div></div>",

When they walked in there wasn\u2019t many other families there. The only ones that were there were other poor families because they had a special where if you came with your family it would be cheaper. So it was just Hilda\u2019s family and a few other poor families in the buffet. When they got there the buffet had signs of a contest that was being held. It came along with their thanksgiving special where whatever family ate the most plates got discounted visits for the next year. And They servers made you fill up your plate with enough food so you couldn\u2019t skimp out. Hilda\u2019s family saw it and made it their goal to eat the most. As they were eating the people in the restaurant were counting how many plates each family was eating. Throughout the contest families would drop out left and right but Hilda\u2019s family was one of the final families. At the end there were 2 families left. Hilda\u2019s who had eaten 15 plates and the other family who had eaten 15 plates as well. But the other family had eaten their plates faster then Hilda\u2019s so they would win if it ended in a tie. The other family had 6 people so they had an advantage but they didn\u2019t have gluttonous family members like Hilda\u2019s family. Hilda\u2019s parents ate 4 plates each while Bertha ate 5 and hilda ate 2. Hilda was way smaller then her family members so she was full with only 2 but the rest of her family was also full and overweight so it was harder to get more food. Hilda has a third plate in front of her and she was trying to eat it for the family. Her mother said, \u201c Do it for the family sweetheart. \u201c. And that\u2019s all she needed. She finished her plate and the buffet cheered. She then fell asleep from eating so much. </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t think that she longed for her parents attention but now that she had a taste she liked it. When she woke up for breakfast she sat down at her spot on the side of the table and her father said, \u201c you know what, since you helped out the family so much why don\u2019t you sit at the head of the table today.\u201d Hilda accepted even though her parents only rewarded Bertha by having her sit at the head of the table. They used it as a reward because it was the most comfortable chair in the house. She sat down and a huge stack of pancakes were already set down for her father. He said, \u201c You can have them, after all you deserve them.\u201d Hilda ate the pancakes her stomach still extended from last night. Then her sister came down and they all ate breakfast. She ate the whole stack of pancakes which she usually never did. </span></div></div>",

They usually went for only dinner but on weekends they went for at least 2 meals. They waddled in and used their discount card one last time. Their new habits had earned them some extra weight over the year. Their parents were about 250 pounds each, with their father being a little heavier. Then Bertha had gained about 30 pounds and she stood at about 320 pounds. Hilda\u2019s parents and sister were all belly heavy so it was a little harder for hilda to tell how much she had gained when it all went to her backside. She was the odd one out being way smaller and bottom heavy unlike her family. She had gained 50 pounds bringing her weight up to 180. Since last Thanksgiving eating at the buffet with nothing but junk has only encouraged her gain. And with a family of hogs she was always eating the least. </span></div></div>",

So their family sat down at a table. Bertha had to sit in two chairs to support her wide build. They started the contest and filled up their plates. They were in the lead for most of the time but there were 2 groups not too far behind. One was a family of 5 and the whole family were grown ups. They weren\u2019t obese or anything but it was a lot of people. The other group was just a husband and a wife. The husband was obese but the woman next to him was the biggest woman Hilda had ever seen. She had to have been like 500 pounds. But her family still had a decent lead on them. Their family was at 21 plates, their parents with 5 each, Bertha with 7 and Hilda with 4. They had taken a break because they were all so full even though Bertha was yelling at Hilda to eat another plate. \u201cHilda hurry up, your gonna lose us this contest if you don\u2019t eat some more plates.\u201d \u201c I Might be able to get one more, but only if we need it.\u201d Said Hilda. The family of 5 had dropped out at 17 with a bunch of unbuttoned pants. There was only the giant woman left and she wasn\u2019t slowing down. When she was at 20 Hilda got another plate. She was trying to eat more but was so full. \u201cHurry up she\u2019s gonna best is and it\u2019s gonna be your fault.\u201d Said Bertha. By that time the woman was on her 22nd plate along with Hilda. They were both eating slowly as they were stuffed to the brim with food. Eventually they finished the plate but they finished at almost the exact same time. So that meant they had to get another plate. The man went up and got the last plate for her and Hilda waddled up there to get another plate. She sat down and slowly picked at the food. The taste wasn\u2019t even there. She was so stuffed she couldn\u2019t even taste the food. She saw that the other woman had finished the plate and she saw the food still left on her plate and opted out. The buffet cheered for the lady. Hilda looked over at her sister and saw the scowl she had on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault\u201d she said. Then she looked at her parents as they tried to hide their disappointment. Even though she had eaten as much as them she still seemed their approval. She had looked over at the woman as she was being helped out by her husband and the buffet staff and as they cheered her on. Hilda longed for that kind of praise.</span></div></div>",

Instead of the discount it said that the meals were free. She knew they would be looking for it the next day. So she got there earlier than usual. They used to have to give it to a person but now she just had to swipe it like a credit card. The couple would usually come in at 6 every day so she got there at 5:30. Hilda has nothing else to do but wait she she got a plate and started to eat. Then she saw the couple arrive. Hilda was a little paranoid so she sat in the back this time. She watched the couple waddle through the big double doors. She found it amusing how the big woman had to walk through sideways even though the doors were enormous. They went to the front counter where you pay and Hilda watched her fumble around in her bag and have a confused look on her face. She saw the man say, \u201cyou probably left it at the house.\u201d The woman was about to say something but just then she saw the food and told him to \u201cjust pay\u201d so she could fill her gut.

Instead of getting one plate she went up and got 2 so she wouldn't have any more distractions for a while. The couple waddled in per usual and the woman spoke to the server. She had waddled up to the cash register with a purpose and a pissed off look on her face while her husband looked calm. A small woman walked out from a side room. Hilda assumed it was the manager. She walked up to the big woman and tried to calm her down. Hilda had to know what they were saying. So she got up and started to fill up yet another plate. She could hear the conversation a little bit. The Manager said, \"sorry ma'am but we now sell those cards on our website. There\u2019s no way of finding it if someone took the card but like I said earlier you may have just lost it.\u201d Woman, \u201cI didn\u2019t lose it I know someone took it. It\u2019s worth thousands of dollars someone must\u2019ve taken it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI recognize you so I can give you another card.\u201d Said the manager. Just then, Hilda was listening so much that she wasn\u2019t paying attention and her butt bumped into a table and knocked over a cup which landed on the floor and broke. The manager and the woman turned around and looked at her.</span></div></div>",

Without the buffet every day their habits changed a bit. Then Bertha waddled in about 10 pounds heavier at 330. She was eating nonstop no matter if they were at the buffet or not. Then soon after Hilda had waddled in. She was a regular at the buffet but her family didn\u2019t know this. After that day at the buffet when they fat woman had stumbled out in defeat, Hilda had went there every day to see if the fat woman would show up. And when she didn\u2019t show up, Hilda would stuff her face with the \u2018fat woman\u2019s Food\u2019 as she told herself. Every day she came and waited for the woman to come in for months, but she never did. And Hilda has never felt more proud of her revenge. Her family sat down at a table as the competition began. Hilda hadn\u2019t seen the woman come in so she had assumed an easy victory. But then someone bursted through the doors. \u201cWait I\u2019m here don\u2019t start without me\u201d yelled a woman. It was her, the huge fat woman. Hilda hadn\u2019t seen her in  months and it seemed that she had gained some weight. It was hard to tell because she was so big but Hilda assumed 50 pounds. The woman was stuck until some workers had to help her through. The woman and her husband, who was hidden behind her, sat down when the servers started to bring the food. It was different this year and Hilda was relieved because it had gotten harder and harder to get food herself. She saw the hunger of the obese woman had not slowed down since last time she saw her. Plate after plate Hilda would look over at the woman and she was a force to be reckoned with. About an hour later the competition was coming to an end. Hildas parents had eaten 9 plates combined and her sister had eaten 8 plates herself. Hilda has just started on her 7th plate. The family was at 23 plates. But they had to beat the obese woman\u2019s 25 plates. Hilda saw the woman stop eating and she crowd that gathered around her and pushed herself. She ate and ate until she finished the plate. Then a server brought another one and set it in front of her. She saw the look of nervousness in the woman\u2019s eyes and devoured the plate. The buffet cheered her on as the server set the next plate in front of her. It was fried chicken tenders, her favorite, she ate slowly as she was painfully full. She regretted eating the last plate so fast. She slowly ate and ate and ate until she was on her last piece of chicken. She picked it up with her fork and shoved the whole thing into her mouth. The crowd cheered and someone took a picture of her as she held her hands up in victory. She had eaten 9 plates, that\u2019s more than Bertha. She saw the crowd cheer and her parents were ecstatic that their daughter won the contest for them. Right after she put her arms up in victory a button flew off on her pants and right when she was about to see what it was her chair made a cracking sound then...SNAP... Her chair broke and she had fallen on the ground. A few servers helped her up and the manager had given her family the special card and apologized about the chair.</span></div></div>",

Hilda asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Her mother replied with, \u201cwe\u2019ve decided that since we get free meals at the buffet, why not go for every meal.\u201d Hilda was not surprised by her family\u2019s gluttonous behavior. Bertha was a heavy sleeper and she usually slept late so Hilda\u2019s parents told Hilda to wake her up. \u201cWe will start the car, you try to wake your  sister up and see if she wants to go.\u201d Her father said. They walked out the door and Hilda walked to the stairs and looked up. She didn\u2019t feel like walking all the way up to the top of the staircase and she had no energy yet so she decided to raise her voice and ask knowing it wouldn\u2019t cause her sister to wake up. She then proceeded to walk out her front door. But she got stuck. \u201cCome on Hilda it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Shouted her parents. She quickly panicked and pushed her way out of the doorframe. She looked back and hadn\u2019t realized how small their doorframe was until now. She mentioned something to her parents and they said they would try to do something about it but they didn\u2019t have a big budget. When the three arrived at the buffet they waddled through the wide double doors and swiped their card feeling like royalty. They got plates, sat down and dug in. They  ate to their hearts content. Hilda was completely as she sat back in her booth and absentmindedly rubbed her belly. Her mother said, \u201c your done already? No no no. You can\u2019t be done. You are the champion Hilda, you made this family proud. I\u2019m going to get you some more.\u201d She waddled to the food and came back with 2 more plates, \u201c go on eat, you deserve it.\u201d \u201c Thanks mom, you know what, I do deserve it.\u201d Hilda said as she leaned forward and Ate the rest of her food. They got back home just as Bertha had woken up and she was hungry. So an hour later they went back to the buffet for lunch.  Hilda and Bertha has a contest to see who could eat the most. And since Hilda had been stuffed from the morning she had lost. But when they returned for dinner the girls had a rematch and Hilda just barely beaten her sister by a few bites. When they got up to leave Hilda needed help from her parents to lift up her stuffed 340 pound bulk up from the booth that she sat in as she sat there triumphantly.  </span></div></div>",

Then the belly heavy Bertha followed weighing at about 350 pounds. She was followed by Hilda who lumbered into the buffet with her bottom heavy build. Over the year Hilda\u2019s family had been going to the buffet every day. Her and her sister had a competition to see who could eat the most for what turned out to be almost every meal. In the beginning it had been close but as time went on Hilda\u2019s competitiveness had won out. During the past few months Bertha didn\u2019t even come close to Hilda, she was an eating machine.  She walked through the double doors as he hips brushed the sides of the doorframe. They all waddled and took their seats. Hilda sat on the booth per usual. They always had to push the table out for Hilda. So the competition began. Hilda had gone to town. She wasn\u2019t even paying attention the the competition. She had gone into a trance with all of the food being brought to her. When she snapped out of it she realized her family had won by a landslide. As a family they had eaten 34 plates. Hilda has eaten 14 plates. The second best was the obese woman and her husband who had eaten 25. The fat woman glared at Hilda as she had been lifted up by her parents and she waddled out with the card. </span></div></div>",

Gifted to Sasha by to her by her friends for having such a large rump for her size. Jenny and Sasha were coincidentally the same in height, stature, and interested, but Sasha AKA Big Butt happened to have a large rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this late hour, the NSE (or the student center) is usually closed for the night, but one tug of the glass door enabled her entrance into the building. Sasha giggled at the above lighting that panned toward the stair way leading down toward the cafeteria, \u201cJenny probably won\u2019t tell me what kind of strings she had to pull to do this.\u201d Patiently, Sasha stepped her way down. With each step a delightful odor tickled her nose and teased her taste buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was but a few days ago since Jenny had slipped that Valentine\u2019s day card into her book bag after she left for class from the dorms. She had found it in the middle of lunch and quit eating then and there.  Sasha knew that Jenny is one to keep a promise no matter how unnecessarily extravagant she made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day, Sasha!\u201d Jenny shot her hands in the air cheering as the rest of the cafeteria lit up behind her. Sasha\u2019s red hair mixed with Jenny\u2019s black hair as the two friends embraced each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold,\u201d All along the cafeteria tables were platters holding a bountiful feast. Normally Sasha would be of put by the massive amounts of food. Heart shaped donuts with pink frosting and sprinkles, cookies with the same decorations and shape, succulent cuts of meat, plump and juicy hot dogs, chicken sandwiches with cheese, strawberry milkshakes, and plenty more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny pulled out a chair in the middle of all of the food, \u201cTake a seat, Big Butt! Let\u2019s get this started!\u201d To be honest, Sasha was frightened about the amount of food Jenny had prepared for her. However, the hopeful look Jenny shot her set her at ease. The additional cheering helped coax Sasha into taking the seat provided. Once her big rear was parked into the seat, Sasha grabbed a fork and had her eyes scale along the feast that Jenny scooted closer to her with a wanting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
