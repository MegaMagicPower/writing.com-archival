Well, except that I still have to go to school and change diapers. Diapers are so gross! But that's what I do all day. I go to school to learn about things like reading and writing and numbers; but most of our time is spent learning about how to take care of boys. For some reason, they just can't seem to take care of themselves. My mommy works during the day and my daddy stays home and helps take care of the house, but he's not very good at it. He's a lot of fun to be with: he plays with me and tucks me in for naps and we eat ice cream cones together, but that's all he can do. Mommy even comes home for lunch during the day to make him food and change his diapers; then she tucks him in on the couch, puts on our TV, and gives him a cup of milk and some books to read. He's not very good at reading though. He tries to read with me, but sometimes I have to help him with the words. I like it better when my teachers at school read to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the same thing with my little brother too. He's three. Of course, he doesn't know a whole lot of words yet, so he gets a lot more attention. I usually take care of him while mommy takes care of daddy. Both of them wander around the house in their diapers and a shirt. Sometimes when it's cold out they'll wear socks too. But usually it's just their diapers and a shirt. Of course, they do dress up when we go out somewhere, but that only happens on the weekend. But since today is my birthday, we all get to go out for dinner and we get to eat cake too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mommy came home from work, we all got our baths, dressed up in our going out clothes, and piled into our car to go to a restaurant that I got to choose all by myself! My favorite food to eat is spaghetti \u2013 it\u2019s so much fun to slurp the noodles \u2013 so we went to a restaurant that serves Italian. Both my daddy and my brother ordered macaroni and cheese, and mommy ordered something fancy that I don\u2019t know how to say. As our waiter left, I could hear the crinkle and mush of his diaper under his trousers. And from a couple of tables away, I could see another man that had wet himself and needed to be changed. That\u2019s when I got to thinking about everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy?\u201d I spoke up to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Nani?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come boys don\u2019t use the potty and feed themselves like we do?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause things just don\u2019t work very well that way dear\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiapers are so messy, and sometimes they don\u2019t get changed when they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d I continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetheart, one day you will understand why everything is so much better this way,\u201d she smiled at me, but she also gave me that look with her eyes that said I should stop talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a group of people arrived with my cake lit with lots of different colored candles and began to sing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After you get out your sleeping bag and set it up downstairs, you lay awake for a long time, thinking.  Finally, you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up early and climb out of your sleeping bag.  You instinctively head to the bathroom, but then realize that you are wearing a diaper.  You take off the diaper and use the toilet for the last time.  Then, you strap it back on and head out of the room.  You head to the kitchen and find Sarah and Rebecca chatting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah says to you, \u201cHey Daniel.\u201d  \u201cDo you need you diaper changed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn bright red with embarrassment, but manage to say, \u201cNo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Rebecca says surprised \u201cPeter is usually soaked in the morning...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used the bathroom instead.\u201d  You say, and Rebecca nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls resume their conversation about the colony.  You get out cereal and milk and begin to eat.  Peter comes in a little later, and begins to cook bacon.  After Peter is finished with cooking the bacon, he leaves.  You finish eating and go to your room to get changed.  You find Peter getting into a large pink baby onesie.  You are still a little surprised, even after what happened yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d says Peter, and you look over at him \u201cCan you help me zip this up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Peter and zip up the tiny zipper on the outside of the onesie.  Then, you get dressed in your normal clothes.  You both leave the room and head into the kitchen.  Aunt Tanya is in the kitchen waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to leave now.\u201d Aunt Tanya says, and gets the car keys off the hook. You head out the front door, and get in the minivan waiting outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Tanya starts the car, and you, having nothing really to do, begin talking to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like for you to have to wear diaper all over again?\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been wearing them for so long, I just got used to it.\u201d Peter replies \u201cThere are even some good things about being diapered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You say, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d,He whispers to you  \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else this, but Rebecca and I have diaper messing contests when our mom isn\u2019t around.\u201d  \u201cThey are fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows, but you keep silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you pull into the \u201cairport\u201d and you get out of the car and walk inside.  Within half an hour, you are on the space plane ready to take you to the colony.  You sit in one row with Sarah and Peter, while Rebecca sits across the isle with aunt Tanya.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the plane takes off.  You are fascinated by the views of space through the window.  You then open a book you brought and begin to read.  Then, you starts to wonder how long the flight is.  You lean over the aisle and ask Rebecca, \u201cHow long is this flight?\u201d  What does she say?</span></div></div>",

You eventually decide to go to the bathroom because you can, and not cause trouble with anybody about diapers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the bathroom, you see that the bathroom is locked and three people are already waiting to get in before you.

Suddenly, a giant wet fart erupts from his diaper, and he looks around sheepishly.  Luckily, only Rebecca and Sarah notice, and they both really do not care.  Rebecca whispers to Peter across the isle, \u201cI can\u2019t change you until we land.

Most of your possessions are already in a container waiting at the spaceport but you take a bag each for the flight. Your mother's is mostly stocked with diapers and changing supplies for you, and now Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you near the space port you see space planes lifting off and heading for orbit. You begin to get a little excited. You've never been to space before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother pays the driver and you all head into the large building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mother looks around for the right queue to join Stephanie says. \"I've gotta use the toilet. I'll meet you back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta go too.\" Rebecca says. \"Wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere.\" your mother says. \"You're in diapers until we get to Obaasan. That means that the toilet is off limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to wet myself?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's what diapers are for.\" your mother says simply. \"Don't worry, your sister or I will change you before we get on the space plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if you should pee before lift-off too. If there's nowhere to change on the shuttle you might be stuck in a wet diaper for hours.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel weird, trying to wet yourself in a room full of people but persevere. As you follow your mother up to the counter to check in you focus on trying to pee. Eventually you convince your bladder that you need to go and pee begins to trickle into the crotch of your diaper. The flow increases until you are peeing properly. You feel the padding between your legs expand and the dampness spread up the front and back of your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" your mother asks and you realise that you've stopped on the stop as you wet yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah.\" you say blushing and looking around to make sure nobody else might have guessed what you were doing. You wonder how you're going to tell her that you need your diaper changed without people nearby hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Stephanie returns, Rebecca has started fidgeting uncomfortably on the spot. She is obviously still refusing to use her diaper. You wonder how long she'll last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally make it to the front of the queue and check in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" your mother says a little too loud for your comfort. \"Do either of you need your diaper changed before we get on the space plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so.\" your mother says. \"And what about you Rebecca? Have you used your diaper yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's response is only a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll change Daniel.\" Stephanie offers her mother. \"You probably want to keep an eye on Rebecca to make sure she doesn't sneak off to the toilets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Stephanie.\" your mother hands her bag to your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie leads you across the crowded terminal to the toilets. You instinctively head to the male side but she stops you. \"I can't go in there.\" she reminds you. \"We'll have to use the baby change room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you into the door between the male and female toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one look at the changing tables she says \"Well there's no way you'll fit on those.\" She looks around for a better option before she decides. \"I guess we'll need to do this standing up.\" She unfastens your belt and your jeans and pulls them down, leaving your diaper completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look nervously at the door as you step out of your pants. There's no way to lock it and someone could walk in at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie neatly folds your jeans and places them on the nearest changing table then she untapes your soggy diaper and throws it in a nearby bin. You move your hand to cover your privates as she unzips the bag and retrieves some baby wipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you don't get to be shy any more.\" she says, gently moving your hands out of the way before wiping you clean. \"If it makes you feel any better this is weird for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you're clean, she takes out a clean diaper and unfolds it. She positions the front against your groin and says. \"Hold that for a moment.\" She passes the back of the diaper down between you legs and pulls it up firm against your bottom. \"I hope they have proper changing tables for you on Obaasan. This is tricky\" Finally she tapes the diaper in place. \"There. all done.\"</span></div></div>",

It's not so bad changing your diaper.\" she says, hugging you. \"Although I'm not looking forward to the poopy ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the reminder that sooner or later you'll have to mess yourself, but return the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Stephanie says, taking your hand. \"Let's get back to mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you through the chaotic mass of people to where your mother is waiting with Rebecca. It's obviously that she is still fighting the inevitability of a wet diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opportunity of a change before takeoff has passed anyway. It's time to board the space plane. There aren't many people in the queue. There are a handful of women and one man who all appear to be travelling alone and two other families. One is a boy, about your age, with his mother and father. The other Is a girl, also approximately your age, her mother and little brother, who appears to be about 5 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the group down a long thin corridor and enter the space plane through its air-lock doors. Everyone finds a seat and straps themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit next to me.\" Stephanie tells you, taking your hand to indicate that she insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her and take the window seat. She straps you in, double checking your belt before taking her own seat. Since changing your diaper she seems to really feel that it is her responsibility to take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the aisle, Rebecca is still fidgeting uncomfortably. You are glad that you've already wet and now have a comfortable dry diaper for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the plane does not take of vertically, like the old rockets, it does accelerate quite quickly and you are pushed hard back into your cushioned chair. Stephanie holds your hand, just in case you're scared. You do find it comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe space plane eventually stops accelerating as it reaches orbit. Rebecca is no longer fidgeting but has turned a deep red. You guess that the pressure from the takeoff finally made her lose control and wet her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you can see the shuttle through your window. Its body is broad and round and has no windows. Eight large ionic propulsion drives are equally spaced around its circumference. This is the craft which will take you out of earth-orbit and to the space station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour space plane docks with the shuttle and everyone releases their belts and floats up out of their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be careful.\" Stephanie tells you, unclipping herself then helping you out of your own belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying close to your big sister, you pull yourself along the rail which runs along the ceiling of the cabin to the air-lock which now connects this craft to the shuttle. In front of you, Rebecca is having trouble with her skirt. Without gravity holding it down, it keeps floating up, revealing the bulge of her diaper under her leggings. Fortunately for her, you and Stephanie are the only people who get the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn board the other craft you find the seats arranged in groups of 4, facing each other around a central table. Except for a round wall in the centre the entire space is open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother takes a seat, and insists that Rebecca sit next to her. Stephanie leads you to the other seat next to your mother and clips you in before taking the last seat in the group fer herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone is seated, the pilot's voice comes through hidden speakers. \"Please make sure your seatbelts are fastened. We will begin acceleration in a few moments. Please remain in your seats until we have stabilised at one G, simulating normal earth gravity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, you feel the craft begin to accelerate. You feel gravity return and you are once more pushed back hard into your chair. After a few minutes the force deceases and it begins to feel like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have stabilised acceleration at one G\" the pilot's voice returns. \"You are now free to move about the cabin.\"</span></div></div>",

The school is nice, and every day a bus drives you too and from it amidst all the other students in your grade, which, by the way, you are one of the only males. It seems all other teenage boys were able to get out of it, or have moved off, regardless, the school is predominately female. A school so disproportionately female might be heaven for most teenage guys, but not this school. Men are effectively classroom babies, the only interaction you get with most girls is them, seriously or otherwise, asking if you need your diaper changed. The bathrooms in the school, and everywhere else, say 'Female' and 'changing room.' Rebecca was able to ditch diapers once your made planet fall, but you're stuck for the foreseeable future. All you know these days, is your new dream is to get as far away from the god-forsaken rock known as Obaasan as possible. So yeah, Obaasan sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of your own life, things are different for everyone else too. Your mother is busy, in one of Obaasan's orbital stations most of the time, and your sister has really become your primary changer, at least Stephanie's still being mature. Rebecca seems to have forgotten all lessons she might have learned on the trip over, as she is back to a constant teasing of you. Tanya has become your neighbor, and one of your few friends on Obaasan, she's been nice to you, but the two of you never talk about diapers to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe government itself too, The Matriarchy, as it's called, you have quickly learned is run by five directors, all of whom have their identities masked, to prevent power grabs using public support. They watch everything, all your books and communication devices, are owned by the Matriarchy, they seem to know everything that happens on Obaasan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, is pretty normal for you, after a day of being socially ostracized by your mostly female peers, you've gone home for a change for Stephanie, and are now off to doing one of the few things you can enjoy, exploring the nearby woods in silence, but today...</span></div></div>",

You take the shortcut, struggling to get through amidst your dress and thick diaper, and jump out right onto the path in front of the stranger.

She composes herself and finds the baby wipes in the bag. She takes a couple and thoroughly cleans your skin. \"Okay. All clean. Time for a nice new diaper.\" she returns to the bag and pulls out another diaper which she unfolds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of awkwardly holding it against you like Stephanie, she places it on the closed lit of the toilet. \"Sit down.\" as you sit on the padding she looks through the bag again. \"You don't have any baby powder.\" she thinks for a moment. \"You should tell your mommy to get some. It'll make you more comfortable.\" She fastens you into the diaper then checks her work before helping you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou.\" you say as she helps you back into your jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" she kisses you on the cheek. \"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for her to wash her hands then she leads you back to your mother to return the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Tanya rejoins your group. Tanya and her compare notes on what it is like to change a 15-year-old boy's diaper. You sit there, quietly embarrassed until the conversation moves on to other topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the pilot's voice returns to announce. \"We are approaching Obaasan and have almost completed deceleration. Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts for docking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get back to Mom.\" Stephanie says. \"We'll see you on Obaasan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Tanya says. \"Don't forget our date Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" you promise then follow Stephanie to be buckled in next to your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou become weightless again and soon hear the mechanical noises of the shuttle docking with the space station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now docked.\" the pilot reports. \"I hope you had a pleasant flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie unclips herself and then you and you follow Rebecca and your mother through the airlock. Again, Rebecca struggles with her skirt in the zero gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airlock leads into the centre of the station. From here you are directed into a lift. As the lift moves out from the centre, the rotation of the space station provides the feeling of gravity once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the lift in a customs area where your bags are checked for items not allowed on the station and you are checked to ensure that you are diapered. You notice that the other boy from the shuttle is stopped and his mother has to take him to a small, curtained-off area to be diapered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of customs you find a woman holding a sign with your mother's name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" your mother greets the other woman. \"You must be Louise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" the other woman says. \"I hope your flight was pleasant. Come with me. I'll show you to where you'll be staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short tram ride you arrive at your new home. \"I'll leave you to get settled in.\" the woman says. \"If you need anything you have my number. Otherwise I'll see you in the lab on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother says goodbye to the woman and leads you inside. Just inside is the living area with a netscreen, sofa and dining table. You can see the kitchen off to one side and a corridor, probably leading to the bedrooms. It looks a lot like an apartment on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my room?\" Rebecca demands. \"I'm taking this diaper off.\" not waiting for an answer she heads off down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Stephanie races after her. \"I'm older. I get first choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need your diaper changed again?\" your mother inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you say. \"I'm dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she says. \"Why don't you go find your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head down the corridor, trying each door you pass. The first one is the toilet. You guess you won't be needing that. Next to it is the bathroom. Across the hall you find a room containing large table with a padded plastic top. It takes a moment to realise that it is a large changing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Stephanie should be happy about that.\" you say to nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the changing room you find an unclaimed bedroom.

The other leads to a small, fenced-off yard. It even has grass. Looking up you can even see the sky.

Let me finish changing him. I was talking to Louise and she said that they usually keep boys in cloth diapers when they are at home and save the disposables for when they are out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens a nearby cupboard, revealing what looks like a stack of white towels. She picks one up and unfolds it into a large square. \"Now pay attention. You'll need to know how to do this too.\" She lays the diaper on the table and begins folding it. \"You need to make sure that you make it thick enough in the right places or it won't work.\" Stephanie watches the demonstration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Daniel.\" Your mother finally addresses you but only to tel you to. \"Lift your bottom.\" so she can slide the diaper under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lower yourself onto the diaper you can already feel that it is thicker than the disposables you have been wearing. It feels even thicker as your mother pulls the padding up between you legs and fastens it with two large safety pins. \"Now remember to be careful with the pins.\" she tells Stephanie. \"You don't want to poke him, there's some very sensitive parts under there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done.\" your mother says, helping you sit up and climb down from the table. \"We just need some plastic pants of the diaper will leak.\" She returns to the wardrobe and finds a large pair of baby-blue plastic pants with little teddy bears printed all over them. \"These are cute.\" She holds them out for you to step into then pulls them up your legs and over your thick diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think his jeans are going to fit over that diaper.\" Stephanie observes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright.\" your mother says. \"The boys here often don't wear anything over their diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Stephanie agrees. \"We saw lots of them at the park in just a t-shirt and diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or he could wear a dress.\" Your mother suggests. \"Louise said it's normal here to dress boys to match their mother and sisters. She even made sure we all had a few matching outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be so cute.\" Stephanie says. \"Do you want to wear matching dresses?\"</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't be able to change him until we got home anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a short walk from your apartment to Tanya's. She answers the door in a pink dress, similar in style to your own. \"Cute dress.\" she says, only teasing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you says. \"Yours is nice too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he wants a pink one.\" Rebecca says, provoking a pinch from Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her mother and brother appear, both in pink dresses, like Tanya. Kevin doesn't seem to be too happy about his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a tram into another part of the station where there are a number of restaurants and stores. along with a movie theater and even a small amusement park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should have?\" Tanya's mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chinese.\" Rebecca says enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Italian.\" suggests Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vote for Italian.\" agrees Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel like Italian Daniel?\" your mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.

She explains, squirting some foam from the bottle onto her hand. \"If you're going to be wearing dresses you shouldn't have hairy legs.\" She begins rubbing the foam all over your body, even your privates and bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin feels tingly as the foam does its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she says, holding your hand. \"Into the tub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the large bathtub and sit down. The foam washes off, leaving your skin hairless and pink.

She folds another cloth diaper and slides it under you but before pinning you into it she takes a bottle of baby powder. \"Tanya's mom said you'll be more comfortable if I use powder.\" She gives your diaper area a generous covering of powder then pins you into the diaper and puts out into a pair of white plastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just your diaper and plastic pants, she leads you into your bedroom and opens a drawer and pulls out a short white nightie. You let her pull it on over your head. You've gone out for dinner in a dress, wearing a nightie to bed isn't a big deal.</span></div></div>",

She pulls your dress off over your head and then pulls your plastic pants down. Finally, she unpins your diaper and lets it fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you are naked, she picks up a bottle of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will take off your body hair\". She explains, squirting some foam from the bottle onto her hand. \"If you're going to be wearing dresses you shouldn't have hairy legs.\" She begins rubbing the foam all over your body, even your privates and bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin feels tingly as the foam does its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she says, holding your hand. \"Into the tub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the large bathtub and sit down. The foam washes off, leaving your skin hairless and pink. Even your pubic hair has disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother scrubs you gently all over then help you out of the tub and wraps a large thick towel around you before rubbing you dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to the changing room where you climb up onto the table. She folds another cloth diaper and slides it under you but before pinning you into it she takes a bottle of baby powder. \"Tanya's mom said you'll be more comfortable if I use powder.\" She gives your diaper area a generous covering of powder then pins you into the diaper and puts out into a pair of white plastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just your diaper and plastic pants, she leads you into your bedroom and opens a drawer and pulls out a set of lavender footed pajamas. You want to argue that you don't need such juvenile pajamas, but as you're already in diapers and plastic pants is seems pointless. Instead you meekly step into the legs and let her zip you into the suit.</span></div></div>",

You notice that the boy who was on the shuttle was also in the park, you figure talking to him would be best since he knows what it's like to be forced back into diapers.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You shout to him, waving your arm. He looks over to you and walks up to you. When he does you get a good look at him, he has dark hair with bright green eyes. He's wearing a yellow shirt with a leather jacket and you notice that his diaper bulge is even worse than yours due to his tight jeans.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" He replies. \"You're the one from the shuttle right?\" He asked, recognising your face. As he talks you notice that he holds himself in a very composed mannor, which find surprising given the circumstances.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am. My name's Daniel.\" You introduce yourself.<br>\r\n\"I'm Zach.\" He replied. \"This place certainly does have weird rules doesn't it?\" He asks, looking down at your pants. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does.\" You replied chuckling. \"Have you already wet yourself?\" You ask, hoping he says yes so you know you aren't the only one. <br>\r\n\"No.\" He replied turning his face away from you. He starts to blush deep red. \"It was messy.\" You sigh inside, glad knowing that he's already used his diaper too.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we have to get used to it.

You looked quite deeply into this law.\" You point out.<br>\r\n\"Of course I did.\" Zach says. \"It's the reason I came here in the first place.\"<br>\r\n\"To be diapered?\" You ask confused.<br>\r\n\"To become a lawyer.\" He corrects. \"There is a high demand for male lawyers here so I hope to be able to get in.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised males can get good jobs like that here.\" You admit.<br>\r\n\"Males are allowed any job that doesn't have high authority.\" Zach informs. \"And as you can guess, very few males travel here so the population is mostly female. And because of the jobs desperately want males.\"<br>\r\n\"So the benefit to being a male here is that jobs come easily.\" You conclude. \"Although can you imagine being in a course case and using your diaper?\"<br>\r\n\"What is that smell? I'm sorry my honour, I think I just had an accident.\" Zach replied in a deep voice. You start laughing so much that you feel poo start to enter your diaper. Before you can stop yourself the seat of your diaper is full of brown mush. You turn a new shade of red as you realises what you had just done. Zach looks at your expression and starts laughing too, you see him laughing but feel oddly happy with yourself, Zach had remained straight faced the entire conversation, this is the first time you saw him show emotion.<br>\r\n\"Well I can't let you have all the fun.\" He wipes a tear away from his face before concentrating. You hear a large fart as the bulge in his pants begins to grow, you stare quite shocked that he actually forced himself to have an accident. <br>\r\n\"We've both soiled ourselves at the same time so the diaper ceremony is complete.\" Zach announced.<br>\r\n\"Diaper ceremony?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"That's right, from now on we are padded pals.\" Zach informed. \"Our bond of friendship as strong as the smell coming from our diapers.\" You laugh at his comment. \"But seriously though, we need a change, you absolutely stink!\"</span></div></div>",

He walked through the back door and you soon follow him. The inside of Zach's house had already been decorated with decor that looked either Spanish or French. As the two of you walked into the lounge room a lady walked up to Zach before scanning his diaper. <br>\r\n\"Did you have an accident?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Mum, this is my new friend Daniel.\" Zach introduced you, completely ignoring his mother's question.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Daniel, my name is Jasmine.\" The lady replied. \"I'm so glad that my boy has already found a friend here. Have you lived here long?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually we arrived on the same shuttle.\" You explain. \"I saw Zach in the park and thought I should get to know him. I'm also your next door neighbour.\"<br>\r\n\"Well isn't that lovely that Zach and you became friends.\" She smiled. \"But it seems like two certain diaper boys need changing. I'll get you both cleaned up and then the two of you can go upstairs to Zach's room and play games.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun.\" You agree. Jasmine leads you both to a changing table where Zach jumps up and gets changed before switching with you. Once both of you had clean diapers on you followed Zach up to his room. <br>\r\n\"I'll go next door to make sure your parents know you're here Daniel.\" Jasmine informed as she walked out back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach powered up his gaming console and threw you a controller. You sat down on the cushions  on the floor while Zach laid on his bed and watched the screen upside down. The game started up to show the intro sequence to 'Injustice: Gods Among Us'.<br>\r\n\"So, do you like these types of games?\" Zach asked. You watched him grab a soda bottle from the ground and start drinking it. He offered you a separate can and you happily accepted.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. And yeah, I do enjoy Justice League.\" You reply, opening the can of soda and drinking some. Zach makes his way to the free battle mode where you choose your characters. Naturally you chose Nightwing since he's the best DC character ever while Zach decides to take a villainous path and chooses The Joker. The entrance animations start and you find yourself fighting the good old Killing Joke Joker. You smash as many buttons in the order you think are combos as you can, trying to take the hawaiian themed Joker down. <br>\r\n\"So how old are you?\" Zach asked as he casually beat your ass. \"I know we're the same age but what month were you born in?\"<br>\r\n\"June.\" You reply, trying, and failing, to avoid the endless barrage of attacks being dished out by the Joker. <br>\r\n\"I guess that makes me older.\" Zach informs. \"My birthday is in February.\" As the two of you continue to fight and you only had half of your last health bar left, you notice that Zach's character begins to slow down. You look up at him and see that his face is slightly contorted and looks to be in pain.<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Zach answers you. \"I just really have to pee.\" Hearing Zach confess about needing to pee made you also aware of the pressure in your own bladder. Zach sees this on your face and chuckles slightly.<br>\r\n\"I will if you do.\" He says. You nod, understanding exactly what he meant. Two seconds later two crinkly sound could be heard as the two diapers around the boys began to turn a slight yellow and sag.<br>\r\n\"Yes! I won!\" Zach cheered as he watched the Joker pour oil over Nightwing before pulling out a match.<br>\r\n\"You're Fired!\" The Joker announced before throwing the match onto his opponent.<br>\r\n\"So, should we just change ourselves now or wait till my mum comes home and have her change us?\" Zach asked.<br>\r\n\"I thought only females could change males.\" You informed.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't particularly matter in your own home.\" Zach informs. \"So what will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

Zach soon replied with two fresh diapers in his hands. As he took off your diaper you blushed a deep shade of red, it was the first time you had been changed by another boy and it felt kind of weird, somehow even weirder than being change by a girl. Zach was also blushing slightly during the process, either because he was looking at another naked boy or he knew he would have to strip down naked soon after. You got up off the bed after being change and Zach laid down in your place. You went through the same process with him and soon the two of you were in nothing but diapers.<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Zach asked. \"Want to get whooped again?\"<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we get to know each other a bit more?\" You suggested. <br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great idea.\" Zach agreed. He grabbed a bunch of paddle pop sticks and marked the edge of half of them before throwing them all into a cup. \"Let's play a game, it's called Fun Fact. We each grab a paddle pop stick and look at the bottom of it, if it has no marks you say any fun fact about yourself. If it's marked you need to tell an embarrassing fact about yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds easy enough.\" You inform. \"Let's play.\" You both grabbed a paddle pop sticks and to your relief yours is unmarked, unlike Zach's.<br>\r\n\"Ok, since yours isn't marked you can go first.\" Zach informed.<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" You take a second to think about an interesting fact about yourself. \"In seventh grade I was known as the Match Maker.\" You inform.<br>\r\n\"I used to suck on my thumb when I slept.\" Zach informed. You placed the paddle pop sticks back before picking again. This time the situations were reversed. \"Since mine is unmarked I'll go first. I can play the drums.\" Zach announced.<br>\r\n\"That's cool.\" You reply. \"I often pretend I'm a superhero trying to protect the town.\" Once again you both pick a new stick with both being unmarked.<br>\r\n\"My natural hair colour is blond.\" Zach explains.<br>\r\n\"If I could have any superpower it would be density shifting.\" You inform. After several more rounds and learning interesting things about Zach, such as that he wore diapers until ten years old on Earth and that he loves the show Scooby-Doo, his mother comes in to the room.<br>\r\n\"Hey boys, it's probably time to say goodbye, the two of you can hang out tomorrow.\" Jasmine informed.<br>\r\n\"Please can Daniel stay longer?\" Zach pleaded. \"Why doesn't he sleep over?\" You nod excitingly at Zach's suggestion.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jasmine thought about it.</span></div></div>",

You decide that it's time to get really serious and choose Sinestro, Zach however picks Aquaman and after a very intense match manages to beat you again.<br>\r\n\"How are you so good at this game?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Practice.\" Zach replied. \"I used to play this game with my friends all the time. I'm glad that I have you now.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"My friends on earth, well they wouldn't very much approve of my new state.

What are you doing here?\" You ask, surprised. <br>\r\n\"I'm here to have dinner with Jasmine and Ben.\" She answers, as if it was a silly question. You look over to the man you assume is Ben and Zach's father. He was wearing a checkered shirt with denim jeans, which you could see the bulge only slightly.<br>\r\n\"Hi Daniel.\" Ben greets. \"It's nice to meet you, I'm Zach's father.\"<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" You wave before sitting between Zach and your Mum. You knew dinner was going to be hell from the start, it's never a good thing when two mothers have dinner together with their children, you knew for certain the subject was going to be diapers. Thinking of it reminded you that you aren't wearing anything but a diaper.<br>\r\n\"So how is Zach adjusting to his new life?\" Your mum asks.<br>\r\n\"He's doing fine. He likes to change himself whenever he can so it's great on us and him.\" Jasmine responds.<br>\r\n\"Not my Daniel. He's completely dependent on his sister at the moment.\" Your mother replies. You turn red at her comment.  \"And I must say I don't know what he eats but his diaper sure does stink after he messes in it.\" <br>\r\n\"Mum!\" You whine, completely tomato red. Zach snickers.<br>\r\n\"It's true you know.\" He whispers through his chuckling.<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" You snap. You take a bite of your lasagna and hope the conversation moves on to another topic. <br>\r\n\"Well I suppose it's easier for Zach.\" Jasmine explains. \"He was diapered until he was ten so he we taught him how to change himself.\" It was now Zach's turn to suffer from embarrassment and you were incredibly pleased. \"We tried to potty train him but he never caught on. When he was in Grade three we thought he was potty trained but he peed his pants.\" Zach's face was turning new shades of red as his mother told the story. \"The nurse at his school gave him overalls to wear but he soiled himself not long after. He had to be sent home in a diaper.\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously mum?\" Zach replied, still bright red. Luckily the conversation moved towards why the two families moved to Obaasan. After dinner you and Zach move back to his room.<br>\r\n\"So what should we do now?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Let's see, I know the perfect thing.\" Zach replies. He boots up Youtube on his console and types 'Try not to scream'. You look over to his devious face a little worried. He finds the challenge and plays the video. <br>\r\n'It's just a few jump scares.' you tell yourself. 'It shouldn't be too scary.' The first clip proves you wrong as you almost hit the ceiling. Zach pauses the video while to clam down your heavy breathing. When the sound of your breathing slows down you hear the sound of pee escaping into your diaper. Zach plays the rest of the video, which each scare being scarier than the last, you look over to Zach and he seems very calm, not of them seem to scare him, that is until you look at his diaper and notice it as was very wet. As one of the monsters jumps to the screen you see his eyes widen and the seat of his diaper expand. To be frankly honest you're surprised he lasted that long, you're diaper was full after the second scare. When the video was over Zach triumphantly announced his victory before heading downstairs to get some diapers. When both of you were all diapered up you decide that it's probably time for bed.<br>\r\n\"Well I can pull a mattress out and you can sleep on that or you just sleep in my bed. It's big enough for the both of us.\" Zach suggested. </span></div></div>",

Where are you?\" He asked, receiving no response. He got up and walked into the lounge room to see if you were there. To his surprise the room was empty. He looked into the kitchen but once again there was no one.<br>\r\n\"That's odd. Mum is usually always in here in the mornings.\" He told himself. Zach checked the other rooms, the dinning room, bathroom, study, each were completely empty. Zach began to worry as his breathing became heavier. He opened the door to the last room in the house, his parent's bedroom, only to find it completely empty. Zach rushed outside into the park area, completely forgetting the fact that he was only wearing a diaper, and found that it too was completely empty, there were no kids running around and playing on the swings or monkey bars, completely desolate. Zach walked through the gates of your house and walked inside to see if you had gone back home, similarly to his own home this one was utterly bereft of people. Zach was almost in a full panic as all of a sudden the world around him disappeared into black. Zach looked around at the vast emptiness that surrounded him and began wailing loudly. He dropped to the ground as the darkness seeped in on him, the sounds coming from his gradually wetter diaper only being drowned out by the sounds of his crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" He cried as he sprung from bed, startling you awake to the point you pissed yourself. You watched him as Zach began to brawl his eyes out. Instantly you hug him as his cries turn more into sobs.<br>\r\n\"Daniel, you're here.\" Zach manages to say through his tears. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here.\" You reply, not quite sure what that meant. You stay hugging the boy for a few more minutes before he stops crying and reverts to sniffles. <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Zach apologises. \"I woke you up over a silly nightmare.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" You comfort him. \"I'm happy I could be here for you. Speaking of which you could use a change.\" You both look down and Zach's diaper which is giving off a fairly foul smell. Zach chuckles.<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk.\" He says as he points to your yellow stained diaper. \"I think both of us need changing.\" Zach pulls out another two diapers and you proceed to change each other. After you and Zach are back in fresh diapers you both tuck yourselves back into bed for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up to see Zach still asleep, sucking on his thumb.<br>\r\n\"Used to my diapered ass.\" You say to yourself as you watch the boy. After a moment you get up and walk downstairs where Jasmine is cooking breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Morning Daniel.\" She greets as you walk in. \"Did you sleep well? Do you need a diaper change?\"<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" You reply. \"Zach had a nightmare last night and woke me up but apart from that I slept well, and I don't think I...\" You stop when you look down and see that your diaper is almost as dirty as it was when Zach woke you up. \"Actually I might need a change.\" You say blushing.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Zach tends to get nightmares every now and again\" Jasmine informs you as she finishes the cooking and comes to clean your diaper. Once you have a new one on Jasmine sets the table and Ben comes down to greet his wife.<br>\r\n\"Morning honey.\" He says. \"Mind coming upstairs to change my diaper?\"<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Jasmine replies, she looks around and notices Zach's not around. \"Is Zach still asleep?\"</span></div></div>",

You walk up to him and look down, now noticing the foul smell that surrounded him. You shake him lightly but no response, he remains out like a light. You shake him again, this time with a bit more force, without warning Zach spins in his bed and kicks you in the gut.<br>\r\n\"Go away. I'm sleeping.\" He informs without opening his eyes. It takes you a few seconds to recover form the pain but you try to shake him awake again. <br>\r\n\"Come on Zach, breakfast is ready.\" You inform him.<br>\r\n\"That's great.\" He replies, still not getting up. You look around his room for something to use to wake him up and find a door leading to a bathroom. You sneak in and fill a cup with cold water before heading back to Zach. Usually you wouldn't do something like this, especially to your new best friend, but he had left you no choice and you wanted to get back at him for kicking you in the gut. You carefully took the blankets off Zach and pulled the front of his diaper out, with a clear view of the inside of his diaper you pour the cold water down. Zach instantly shoots up awake after having the cold water poured on his crotch and gets up, his diaper sagging as he did so.<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" You cheerfully greet him. Zach only huffs back. \"I think someone will feel better after a diapee change.\" You say in a mocking tone. Zach doesn't reply and just lays down on the bed and waits for you to change him. Once he was in a fresh new diaper you both head downstairs to have breakfast. Jasmine and you did most of the talking since Zach remained silent and grumpy. After breakfast you follow Zach upstairs and are about to talk into his room when he grabs your arm. You turn around to see what he wanted.<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you.\" He says, blushing profoundly. \"For everything.\" You smile and nod your head before walking into the room. After a few more hours of video games Zach decides to teach you a few tricks on how to be a better fighter, he shows you some of the advanced combos for certain characters as well as telling you which characters to avoid using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're probably all gamed out now so what should we do?\" Zach asked. As he does so you become aware of the ever-growing pressure in your diapered area.<br>\r\n\"Are you still clean?\" You ask. Zach takes a few whiffs of the air before shrugging his shoulders. \"Ok then diaper checks.\" You both get up and Zach walks up to you before pulling out your diaper and checking inside.<br>\r\n\"All clean here.\" Zach informs. You turn around and pull the diaper of Zach out to look inside.<br>\r\n\"You too\" You add. \"Ok, so let's have a competition to see who can soil themselves the most.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Zach nodded. \"Let's make it the loser has to stay in their soiled diaper for an hour.\" You agree to the terms and you both stand, facing each other, in the centre of the room.<br>\r\n\"Ready, set, GO!\" You announce. Almost instantly you hear a loud muffled fart as the seat of Zach's diaper expands. You hear the sound of your own diaper as it turns yellow and soon after the sensation of evacuating your bowls. Zach still isn't done as he squats slightly and tenses and his diaper grows larger, you do the same in order to beat him. By the end of it both of you have fully loaded diapers.<br>\r\n\"Let's see who has the messiest diaper.\" Zach says.<br>\r\n\"The winner will be decided based on how smelly, large and wet their diaper is.\" You inform.<br>\r\n\"So let's see who won.\" Zach responds.</span></div></div>",

They are kept in diapers and dependent on women to change them.\" You reread that part at least 3 times, certain that you must be reading it wrong. \"The women generally keep their men in infantile clothes, or sometimes little more than their diapers. However It is not uncommon for males to be dressed in girls' clothes, often to match their mother and sisters or, later, their wife and daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell yourself that surely this can't apply to you but that hope is squashed as you read the next paragraph. \"As a guest on Obasaan, you must abide by our traditions. Males must be diapered and are forbidden from using the toilet or changing themselves. When you arrive you will be assigned to a female student who will care for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ends with the statement. \"To help you get through customs quickly, we recommend that you wear a diaper for your arrival on Obasaan. You will not be allowed to leave the docking bay until it is confirmed that you are diapered. Also there will be no male toilets available once you board the colony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiapers?

The beer is cool, it tastes great and you find yourself feeling a little better, but there is still time to kill so another beer it is. After that third beer you are starting to feel pretty darn good, not even thinking about the fact that you will be spending your college years in diapers. you are feeling so good you order another beer, and another and another. After downing that sixth beer you hear the the last call for your flight, while you were busy getting a bit drunk you must have missed the first few calls.<br>\r\n    you rush to your ship and just barely make it on in time. You then make your way to your seat and realize that you have to pee, badly, beer tends to have that effect you try to go to the bathroom but you are immediately told by a flight attendant to take your seat as the ship is about to depart.

The line goes on for about another thirty or so people, mostly women. Almost entirely women! You find yourself a little surprised by this by this, but you hear a soft plastic crinkle come from your crotch area. Well, maybe it really isnt surprising after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking ahead you see that the line ends at a small kiosk, a woman in a blue uniform sits at a desk with three other uniformed women standing about 10 feet behind her. The woman in the kiosk is dividing her attention between the woman in front of her and a small net screen to her left. The woman in front hands over her passport which is quickly looked over and cross checked on the net screen before being handed back. The woman moves forward and the line lurches a few steps before stopping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you wouldn't happen to be new here would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice is becoming from behind you. You turn around to face the woman. You recognize her as the one you saw on the spaceplane. She had long jet black hair, complementing her fair skin and emerald green eyes. Shes about your height and has an average build and seems to be in her early 30s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm uh, yes. I am here for school.\" You reply, holding out your right hand for a shake. \"My names Daniel, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks down at your hand then into your eyes. She let's out a small chuckle before grabbing your hand with hers. Her grip is light and she shakes playfully, similar to what you might give a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, welcome to Obasaan Daniel!\" She says with an inviting smile. She disengages her hand shake. \"I could tell you were new.\" She points her finger downward in the direction of your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most men here don't wear belts, or jeans for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is it illegal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Oh no it's not like that.\" She sighs. \"Oh, why are new boys always like this? Always too cute. Say, Daniel, you wouldn't happen to be a Daniel Robinson? Attending the university as a freshman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Howd you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. I'm Marianne Gasky, I head the Beureu of Male Immigration and Integration for both the Directory and the University. I was told to expect you when I returned. I'm supposed to help boys like you settle into life on Obasaan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not immigrating I'm just here for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises one eyebrow. \"You sure? I can tell you're already diapered, I assumed that meant you were happy to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by her saying that, you are taken aback. You quickly regain your posture and lean in to whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that obvious?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles and leans towards you whispering, \"Oh yes. Very much so! It bulges so much in the back that you might as well be wearing a basketball for underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only worsens your embarrassment, which is now obvious from your flushed cheeks. Marianne takes notice, and goes in for the kill. Leaning even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont think you could have chosen a bigger brand. Buts that okay, you'll need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you are embarrassed beyond belief. Having to wear diapers is one thing but now you are being degraded by this woman you only now just met! You have regrets coming here and you decide to leave as soon as you can get another flight. But your emotions give way to logic, and you remember all those hundreds of applications that got rejected. Obasaan is seemingly the only place thatll accept you, and if you want to get a degree for anything, it appears as though you'll have to stick it out in this odd colony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it a week I guess, then I'll leave if it's bad.\" You say to yourself turning around. You cant see it, but you can feel the proud smile emanating from Marianne behind you. You dont think you're going to like her, but if she is the head of that Beureu or department or whatever, you'll have to deal with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it one week. Maybe I'll get accepted elsewhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front of you walks up to the kiosk. You're next and take your passport out of your pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cover of the passport has the official seal of Obasaan on it in a golden ink. The seal itself is very ornate. A circle surrounded on both sides by two roses connected together by a vine that encompasses the circle. The circle itself is divided into a center and an outer ring. Within the outer ring is some golden lettering. One word on top and three on the bottom. OBASAAN is printed on the top in bold letters with the phrase 'Cooperante. Gratia vobis. Misericordia.' printed on the bottom section. You dont know latin but it sounds fancy enough. Inside the circle are the symbols for male and female. The female symbol dominates and is much larger than the male symbol. With the female symbol about as large as your thumb, and the male symbol about three quarters the length of your thumbnail. They seem to enjoy making their themes very obvious here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front moves from the kiosk and the female attendee inside beckons you forward. You walk up and place your passport and Interplanetary ID. The woman takes them and looks both over before directed her focus to the netscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name and business please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel Robinson and I am here to study at Obasaan University.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please turn around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" An odd request you think, but you comply anyway. Suddenly you feel a hand pat your bottom. You should have known that's what she wanted, but it still shocked you. You take a glance back at the waiting line. Marianne is standing arms akimbo and mouths  an obvious 'Good job!' Before giving a thumbs up. The rest of the women in line are unperturbed. You turn back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at you. First day on Obasaan and hes already padded up. Your mommy must be so proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the university already assigned you a female caretaker for your stay? If not one of our attendants can.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. I'm his caretaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second, female hand puts another passport onto the kiosk. Its Marianne. She looks at you and winks before hardly slapping your bottom. An audible smack can be heard from her hand hitting the seat of your pants and smacking against the diaper. Why must she do this to you? You havent done anything wrong other than pick a strange college to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Marianne Gasky, I am the head director at the BMII. Returning from a vacation on Earth. Have his luggage shipped to my apartment and I'll sort it from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh welcome back Director Gasky! I hope you enjoyed your vacation and were glad to have you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hands Marianne back passport and ID. Then picks up your passport and ID, and then hands it to Marianne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thats... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shushes you and holds her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry I'll take good care of it. Now follow me I'll take you to my car and drop you off at your dorm.\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone finds a seat and straps themselves in. You hear the engine begin to warm up and then the spaceplace begins to move. Although the plane does not take of vertically, like the old rockets, it does accelerate quite quickly and you are pushed hard back into your cushioned chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you stop accelerating as the spaceplane reaches orbit. After a few minutes you can see the shuttle through your window. Its body is broad and round and has no windows. Eight large ionic propulsion drives are equally spaced around its circumference. This is the craft which will take you out of earth-orbit and to the space station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour space plane docks with the shuttle and everyone releases their belts and floats up out of their seats. On board the other craft you find the seats arranged in groups of 4, facing each other around a central table. Except for a round wall in the centre the entire space is open.</span></div></div>",

As you watch the passengers in front of you have their luggage checked you notice something odd. A woman pats the bottom of each boy who passes through the checkpoint.

It's a strange kind of rebelliousness. At least it would be on Earth, here apparently every guy is doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diaper is a lot less comfortable wet and you find that you want to get out of it as soon as possible, even if it is to get back into another diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is, fortunately, not long before you arrive. As you disembark the tram and enter the campus you feel your soggy diaper hanging heavily from your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looks up and points. \"Hey.\" she says \"Look at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see a completely ordinary sky.

Helen and Rachel.\" She points at a door, numbered 313. \"You'll be sharing that room.\" Then she points to the next door. \"Felicity and Daniel will be in 314.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You ask. \"Guys and girls can share a room here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys have to share a room with a woman.\" Kate informs you. \"You need someone to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm the one who changes his diapers and stuff?\" Felicity asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, well aware that you are in dire need of a change already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate explains. \"Yes.

Err, every man on this planet wears diapers. You lean against the changing table and ponder about the culture shock you've so far endured. In your deep thoughts you don't notice that you have begun to suck on your pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend over to pick up your jeans, and are made aware of how awkward something as simple as bending over is in your thick diaper. You pick up the jeans and fold them. You then begin walking towards the door. Well waddle really, this diaper is pushing your legs outward even more than the last one. You blush red at the embarrassment even though no one sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit and begin making your way down the hall back towards your dorm. The plastic panties and diaper make a very audible crinkling noise that softly echoes along the corridor. A door opens behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, looks like someone was a little naughty today.\" Said an unknown female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see a blonde girl in jeans and a black shirt standing outside her dorms doorway, backpack slung over shoulder. She chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys are always so adorable when they're being taught how to behave.\" She closes her door and turns away from you walking the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are overcome with embarrassment, you shake a little and walk hurriedly back to your dorm. Hopefully no one else sees you. This planet is insane! How could people act like this and think this was normal? Maybe you should go back home and leave this all behind you. This university might not be worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what else is there? You had been rejected by every other university across the entirety of the universe. This was the only place that would accept you, and you need a degree. In this universe without a degree you can't find any job outside of maybe janitorial work. Ship pilots, plumbers, and even most military jobs require a degree in something. If you wanted to get your degree, you would need to stay here and tolerate this humiliation. At least until you graduate, then you can leave this place for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the corner to your dorm and enter. You feel relieved to finally be back somewhere private. Unless they also put surveillance equipment in the dorms. This planet was just a nightmare, what else did you expect? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Felicity was staring at you from inside the dorm, she had her arms crossed and didnt look very happy. \"Are we going to have a problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't she supposed to be back around six? You glance at the clock, its five PM. Maybe she's early. You look back at her and shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity sighs, \"Good, I don't want to have to take care of someone who's a troublemaker. You do realize that changing yourself is against the law right? You can get into <i>a lot</i> of trouble for that. When Wendy told me you tried to do that I got really worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer angry face turned into that of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're okay. But,\" she points to your comically thick padding with the locking panties ad then your pacifier. \"you are being punished.\" She produces a key out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy told you yes? You're going to wear those locking panties and wear only the thickest diapers until either I or hear believe you have learned how to behave. Same with the pacifier. Also you're going to be on a diet of extreme laxatives and liquid for the foreseeable future. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. Felicity repeating your punishment to you just makes it worse. You didn't need a reminder to know that you had just made your life her a little more miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity smiles and pats your head. \"Good Dannyboo. I expect the best behavior from now on!\" Dannyboo? She somehow made it even worse. She leans in and kisses your cheek, you blush in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh also, I went and picked up our class schedules. We have the same exact courses it seems. Except for one, which is actually today at seven tonight. Here, look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right it was the same as hers save one class, a course named 'Introduction to Obasaan society and law for male immigrants'. Immigrant? You're not immigrating here you're just staying temporarily for college. Once you graduate you're gonna leave and never look back. However, after today's events, a course on the laws of this planet would be beneficial. You smile at Felicity to thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, Helen, and Rachel are going to a restaurant instead of the university cafeteria. You can come if you'd like. Its French.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to nod your head but you remember what she said about your new diet, maybe you can get out of it by staying behind and going to the cafeteria? You......</span></div></div>",

In the seat next to her is a man. They both look like they are in their early 40s. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she says. \"I just thought you might need some help with your diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diaper?\" you ask, you can't think of a more nonsensical thing this woman might have said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not diapered?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Of course not.\" you say. \"Why would I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" she says. \"You don't know much about Obasaan do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. No.\" you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should sit down.\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the seat opposite her, next to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Susan.\" she introduces herself. \"And this is my husband Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say. \"I'm Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" the man finally speaks. \"So you're not wearing a diaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you say. \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All males on Obasaan are diapered.\" Susan explains. \"They are never potty trained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Obasaan is a communist matriarchy. We recognise that for communism to work it must be run by those who are naturally sharing and nurturing.\" she says. \"Men are too competitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with competitive?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is wrong with being competitive, so long as the instinct is properly directed.\" She responds. \"Men's competitive nature would drive them to try to take Power. We keep them in diapers to remind them of their dependence on women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a joke.\" you say. \"Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Susan says. \"Here, take a look.\" She gets up and takes Kevin's hand. \"Stand up for a moment dear.\" he obediently gets out of his seat and she unfastens his belt and pulls down his trousers, revealing a thick disposable diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger than Kevin's underwear is his reaction. He appears completely unashamed to have his diaper shown off in front of a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" She says looking at the diaper. \"Looks like someone might need a change soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see that the crotch of the diaper is slightly discoloured and beginning to sag a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I get you diapered too.\" she says. \"Kevin has enough spares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you say. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be allowed through customs if you aren't diapered.\" she explains.</span></div></div>",

Even worse, rumors of some major cut backs have been going around the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave, have you heard anything more about the possible cut-backs?\" asks Tyler, one of your good friends.<br>\r\n\"Nah, though I expect the axe to fall any day. I really can't believe how bad things have gotten here.  Too many people competing for jobs, and not enough to go around,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean my friend, I ....\".  Tyler is interrupted as the manager walks into the break room looking clearly upset.  In his hands he holds several envelopes.  He hands one to each of you.  \"I'm sorry guys.  Here is your last paycheck, please gather up your things and exit the building.  I really am sorry.\"  Judging by the stack of envelopes in his hand, nearly everyone here is out of a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Tyler, his head is hanging low and his chest gives a small heave like a toddler trying to stifle a sob.  \"Now what are we going to do?\" you say aloud to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler seems to collect himself and says, \"Well I guess my wife and I will be heading to Obasaan.  She got a job offer there and we had agreed that we would stay as long as I had a job, but now... what about you?  Any back up plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you admit.  There is nothing left for you here.  Your parents recently passed away, leaving you nothing, you just barely managed to pay for their expenses without winding up in debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not come to Obasaan too, I bet you could find a job, as far away as it is not that many people move there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you haven't heard much about Obasaan, other than the typical male fantasies about a colony of beautiful women, like angels, that dote on men all day long.  \"Might as well, I got nothing going on here, when are you guys leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next week, I will be booking the flight once I get home.  I suppose I better go break the news to my wife.  Give me a call later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friend part ways and head  home.  Once you get home you try to decide whether to begin looking for a job, or just book the flight.</span></div></div>",

Looking through the options you see there is only one flight headed out to Obaasan next week.  You book your flight and start looking for housing.  Amazingly, the cost of living seems to be incredibly low.  It seems that the Obaasan is communistic with the members of the community helping each other out.  You also briefly scan over some of the job listings.  There are quite a few manual labor jobs available, and while the jobs wouldn't be your first choice, you feel confident that you can quickly find a job.  You print off your travel information and start packing up your possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the Spaceport you run through your mental list of things to take care of before you depart.  You put your house up for sale with a decent realtor, who seemed to think the house would sell rather quickly for the price you were asking.  All the possessions that you wanted to keep had been moved into storage so you could have them sent to you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the counter to get checked into the flight.  You hand your luggage over to the handler.  The woman behind the counter smiles at you.  \"Heading to Obaasan?\"<br>\r\n\"That's right;\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Vacation?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I am hoping to find a job out there.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you are moving there, I will need your signature on some of these papers.\"  She hands you a rather large stack of paper and directs you to some chairs.  \"Just bring them back up here when you are done, but please do not take too long, it will take me a while to make sure they are all in order.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\"  You sit down and begin reading the documents.  You begin reading through the documents and signing them.  You are only about halfway through when the attendant at the counter calls out to you.  You quickly sign the remaining papers and hand them to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be just one minute sir.\"  Once she looks over all the paper, she places a red bracelet, like the ones used at bars around your wrist and allows you to board the plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you board, you see Tyler and his wife further back in the plain.  Do you go and sit with Tyler and his wife, or do you go to your assigned seat?</span></div></div>",

I have a few more of Ty Ty's diapers in my bag, If you like ill put one on you and then you wont get in trouble when we land, all I ask is that you admit I was right and you really do need a woman to take care of you, by the way im sure you will find one on Obaasan  it over 80% women, most of them looking for a cute little guy to care for\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are somewhat perplexed on the one hand it seems you have no choice but to accept that you will be diapered eventually but at the same time you have no desire to give up just yet..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Technological progress has made it possible for average people to travel to space and live there. Overpopulation has made it necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of colonies have been set up, on space stations and other planets and moons. Some are owned by governments, others by private corporations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very small minority are owned by those who live there, groups of idealists who put their funds together to leave earth and create their idea of the perfect society. Obaasan is one of those colonies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe founders of Obaasan described it as a Communist Matriarchy. They believed that communist societies of the past have failed because they were run by men. Men are instinctively competitive and are easily corrupted by power. Women on the other hand are nurturing and sharing, therefore a communist society can only succeed as a matriarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, given the nature of men they would eventually try to take over and ruin everything. Therefore, to keep men in their place, they are never potty trained. They are kept in diapers and dependent on women to care for them their entire lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women generally keep their men in infantile clothes, or sometimes little more than their diapers. However It is not uncommon for males to be dressed in girls' clothes, often to match their mother and sisters or, later, their wife and daughters.</td>",
