She has also ever since grade school had had a slight weight problem, but since then she has accepted her larger body and has even begun to like it a bit but she is not quiet sure.

She is constantly \"sampling\" the food at the bakery to make sure that they were good enough for her costumers and they always were thanks to Maxine's raw skills in the culinary arts. Maxine has tried desperately tried to lose the weight, but she was never good at exercising or dieting and could not drop a single pound, but soon something happens to Maxine that makes her want to stop trying to lose the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:Trisha Smith or Trish.<br>\r\nAge:Twenty three.<br>\r\nHight:Five foot eleven.<br>\r\nWeight:350<br>\r\nFrom:Amarica.<br>\r\nHair color:Black(Dyed to have red strikes)<br>\r\nEye color:Brown<br>\r\nPersonal info:Trisha has always been shy and awkward, until she met Sasha in sixth grade and she helped her open up and they had become best friends. When they entered collage they became room mates, and by the end of their first year they had both gained the freshman fifteen (plus ten) and they began to feel funny around each other and realized that they were in love, and that they also liked each other fat but that didn't come until the end of their first year as a cupel when they had both gained another twenty five pounds. Sasha is now a very successful house saleswoman in New York and she has all the money she needs to keep her stay at home wife/feede, Trisha and her ever growing hunger satisfied.</span></div></div>",

Cat walked over to a bench that a very large woman who was eating lunch at. She looked like she was more then a hundred pounds heavier than Cat! Her clothes did a pretty good job at keeping her covered but a bit of her stomach still poked out from under her shirt, a sight that got Cat very excited, but she held it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat sat down next to the girl on the bench (although the girl took up most of it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jennifer, how ar-...what the heck are you eating!\" Cat said, disgust by the...thing, that she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Cat, just a tuna fish sandwich on toasted breed, it's not the best thing in the world but I heard its good diet food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet food? Why would you want to eat diet food?\" Cat asked, fully aware of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know, might have something to do with the fact that I weigh almost weigh FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS!\" Jennifer said, yelling the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't make you look bad, it makes you look cute and cuddly!\" Cat said with a cutesy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I wish the guys thought the same way you do, then I'd be crawling in boyfriends and I wouldn't have to be on this stupid diet.\" What Jennifer said gave Cat a sliver of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you just stop trying to impress guys then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jennifer asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys can be such pigs about a girls weight no matter what, right? Girls on the other hand can be bitchy about it to girls that they don't like, but very kind to the ones they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that Maybe you've been trying to date the wrong gender, I mean as long as you love someone and they love you, why should it matter what gender they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I Guess you're right, but I don't know if I find girls attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, you're a very pretty girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really the same thing though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's not, guys are handsome and girls are pretty, that's why it gets confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but, I'm just not sure I want to change my sexuality over not being able to get a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me I felt the same unsure feelings that yo-\" 'Oh shit, pull up, pull up!' \"Er, I mean I can imagine how it must fee-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat? A-are you a lesbian?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No I just, um...okay you caught me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I had my suspicions since you never dated any guys but...wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that would give me away, so you're not freaked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit but, you're my friend and I'll accept you for who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'm happy to hear that...so, how about we do something sometime, show you what it's like inside a brain like mine...maybe even change yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not, it can't hurt.\" Jennifer agrees to go on a few dates to see what it would be like to date a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're friends, I don't think dating would be a good idea for us.\" Jennifer lets down her easy and Cat tries to find someone else to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I was a lesbian, and I'm not sure I am, I don't think a fat girl would be my type.\" Jennifer is a bit to harsh and Cat turns to her best friends Dana, Julie and Chris for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if I was a lesbian, and I'm not sure I am, I think I'd like a girl who was the same size as me.\" Cat decides to get even fatter for Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess dating a girl wouldn't be the weirdest thing I've ever done, that girl being a friend might be but, sure lets give it a shot.\" Cat and Jennifer hit it of and enter a committed relationship, but how will her secret admirer react?  </span></div></div>",

It was a saturday, no work for her today. \"Haven't been shopping in a while so there's probably not much to eat, I should go-*growl!* Okay okay! I'll go shopping After I feed you.\" Maxine joked to herself. After getting dressed in a white blouse, in a black-striped skirt, she went out. As she walked the short distance from her apartment to the applebees that sat just around the corner. As she was seated by her waitress, a tall, rather slim girl with large breasts and a large ass, both of which strained her shirt and skirt. \"Yes, I'll take a regular coke. Appetizers? An order of Mozzerela sticks, and an appetizer size portion of chicken tenders. Fried, not grilled.\" The waitress nodded. \"Okay, I'll be right back with your order.\" As the waitress walked away, in a few booths over, Maxine saw a boy sitting down. She expected him to be staring at the generous backside of the waitress. But he wasn't. The thinner, lanky man was staring at her. That is, until she looked at him. He lingered on looking for a second, and looked away. Her order arrived at her table, and she began dining on her appetizers. Since she was \"dieting\", this was a normal sized meal, and to burn off the calories she would then try to run (for what felt like) hours on her treadmill. As she finished her \"Appetizer\", the waitress came back, and she seemed to...smile... at her finished plate. \"So, are you ready to order?\" She asked, in her rather high voice. \"Er, sure. I'll take two full racks of ribs, with three sides of fries. And for dessert, I'd like two molten lava cakes.\" She was terrible at dieting (even though what she ordered was about half of what she normally ordered so at least she was getting better) but she didn't know that. The waitress couldn't help but smile. Not out of having to, otherwise she'd be fired, but Maxine could tell..She seemed to be..delighted with the food choices of this woman. \"Alright, I'll be back with your order.\" Maxine looked back at the lanky man, who she once again caught staring at her. The man looked away, looking at another fat brunette, sitting to  the far left, who was wearing secretarial clothes. Maxine caught the hint in a flash: This man was a conniseur of fat women. As the man looked back at maxine, maxine gave a wink, and a smirk, and a chuckle. The man went red like a tomato, and hid his face behind his menu. Maxine heard footsteps approaching her booth, she turned and saw the waitress approaching her booth with a tray laden with food. The woman had a wide grin across her face. \"Here you go ma'am, enjoy.\" She laid the three plates before maxine: One held her ribs, the second held the mass of fries she had ordered. The third held the chocolate cake. Maxine nodded. \"Thank you, miss..\" She looked at her nametag. \"Miss Geraldine.\"  The red-headed waitress chuckled,and walked away. After devouring the meal, Geraldine approached with the bill, and saw the hoarde of food that had been consumed in one sitting. She smiled, and looked down: Maxine had to actually undo a button on her skirt to hold the food. She was barely containing herself from jumping up and down with glee. She handed maxine the bill, took the plates, and said something...odd. \"Good work, ma'am.\" After paying the bill, Maxine...</span></div></div>",

The girl is the feedee, and I would be the feeder.\" Maxine smirked at this prospect. \"I like the concept.\" Sheldon saw an opportunity, and then, with a side of slickness that Maxine had not seen before, and after eating a quarter of his meal, Sheldon leaned back in his chair, seeing as maxine was already done. \"Hey, since you like the concept of feeding...How about I demonstrate?\" Maxine giggled, and spoke. \"Now that'd be amazing.

Maxine's second chin had quite expanded, her belly soaked up quite a bit of the poundage. Her arms grew even more bloated with fat, so did her calves and breasts. Her bakery had gained more and more money, sheldon had his own lucrative buisiness, a computer-repair business. The two brought in enough money, Sheldon and her combined had compiled enough money to move out of this shabby apartment that was quickly running out of room for Maxine, and into a house as big as a mansion. As they moved into the house, Sheldon spoke. \"Well, honey bun, welcome to our new life!\" Maxine smiled, and kissed sheldon. \"I can't wait, sugar pie. Speaking of honey buns and sugar pies, I think it's time to fill up the blimp again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes, sheldon had a meal fit for a king's court prepared for Maxine. \"Since we have more space, I think it's time to really kick off. Consider this an appetizer. Maxine was stunned. She felt a brief moment of thought: Appetizer? This was enough to satisfy her for a week back at the apartment. But this was quickly brushed aside by her newfound animal impulse. She had thrown caution to the wind, she now felt not only compelled, not only required, not only desired, but VITAL to fatten herself. A goal nessecary to life itself, she began to tear into two succulent turkeys and a serving plate of Carborona. A full pizza, pre-ordered before the move, was being eaten, and she was eyeing two plates of burgers and fries that sat at the halfway mark of the table. Sheldon, in the kitchen was working as fast as humanly possible to cook up the 'main course.' By the time maxine had finished the full table, Sheldon was standing by her side and began immediately plating the unbelieveable mass of food onto the table: Five turkeys, Three plates of burgers, ten servings of spaghetti and meatballs, a 52-slice-pizza, a whopping ten serving platters full of lasagna. Maxine didn't have time to talk: Eating ensued. She didn't know hunger: She was tearing into the food, and her stomach was expanding with each bite. By the time she had finished the banquet suitable for every athlete in the united states, and her old white blouse and skirt had been stretched to its limits, Sheldon wobbled in with a massive chocolate-vanilla cake. Maxine smiled, and immediately tore into the giant, cramming slice after slice into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished, she leant back, looking at the massive accomplishment. Suddenly, her buttons began tearing off like bullets, plummetting into either dshes, or onto the floor. Her clothes fell open, her body looked like it had gained almost a hundred pounds in one sitting. The chair she sat on cracked and fell to the floor, crumbled. In an instant, Sheldon was on top of her, maxine was too tired to resist, and nodded while gasping from the massive intake of food. Sheldon wastaking off her underwear, unhooking her bra, and then began. By the end of the session, Maxine was lay ing on the floor, naked and panting, sighing, passed out from the exaustion of sex, in a pool of her own sweat. Then...</span></div></div>",

Now who are you, and what are you doing in our house?\" Geraldine spoke in her soft, almost devilish voice, saying \"Well, it's simple. I heard of your little plan, fattening her up. I see her kind at Applebees all the time: Fat women, coming to the booths and tables to dine themselves and gorge themselves. Many also are trying to diet. A shame really... That's not the point. I'm here to give you an extra hand. I personally love to see women like your feedee girlfriend, women who WANT to put on weight. They have more self esteem, and I personally find them more beautiful.\" <br>\r\nSheldon sat in awe at this woman.

Just say 'yes', and your wife will fatten up like you wouldn't believe.\" <br>\r\nSheldon gave it some thought...Would he really accept the thought of a stranger coming into his house and giving his wife food?

Geraldine spoke. \"I'll be out running an errand.\"  She walked out, and Maxine looked at her as she walked out the door. Maxine laid down on the couch, causing it to creak, and fell asleep. Her eyes opened to see a gargantuan breakfast laid out across the coffee table. \"Wake up, dearie!\" Geraldine's voice spoke, in it's strange mixture of soft and sharpness. She saw it all: Biscuits, Bacon, eggs, pancakes, country ham, grits, muffins, and coffee. She went in and began eating, giving a smile of gratitude. Geraldine spoke. \"I also had a new bed installed. With both of us, you should be gaining double what you were, and that means that you're soon going to be too big to move.\" Maxine's mind wandered: Was this still safe? Immobility? So much was on her mind, and her heart still worried her. It had served dutifully, but it seemed it was coming ever closer to its end. And then another portion of her mind opened up: The pleasure of it all. Who cares about how long i'll live? More and more food, this beats dieting by so many miles! I hated moving around so much anyway, Immobility will be a welcome invitation! She liked this prospect. The previous worry had been utterly wiped away. She finished her breakfast, and shockingly, Geraldine brought out another bag of food. Her new clothes, which she had not noticed, were almost filled, the large shirt that seemed to be usable as tent material was starting to show her belly touching its edge.  But she simply ate what Geraldine poured out with succession, Sheldon wasn't in view. She simply continued eating. By the time the multitude of extra biscuits, bacon, and ham were down, her shirt was straining. Its buttons wriggling about by being pushed to their maximum. Sheldon came by with another tray of baked goods, and she simply ate them without question. Three buttons could take no more: They came flying off, exposing the top of her stomach. Geraldine smirked, and spoke. \"We make a great team, don't we, sheldon!\" Sheldon could only smirk at his girlfriend. Maxine got up. \"I think I'll go rest until lunch is ready. Can't wait!\" she spoke. Geraldine, and Sheldon hurriedly went to work in the kitchen. Soon, Maxine awoke to a massive lunch of more food items than she could count, and she didn't even look at the food to try and tell what it was, she just tore into it. Her shirt's buttons came flying off mid-way into the meal, but she powered on. Her shirt fell off to the side as her body bloated with each bite. Both geraldine and sheldon looked on, both attracted immensly to her ever- fatter form. As she finished the meal, the new chair was groaning. Sheldon walked over to the kitchen, and brought in several jars, and a funnel attached to a tube. He put the funnel in her mouth, and began feeding her through the funnel, putting the gain-shakes from the jars into the funnel. She grew fatter and fatter with each jar. The chair was almost literally on it's last legs. Sheldon walked over and heaved her up, walking her over towards her sturdy, industrial-sized bed, which looked like two double-beds turned into one. She heaved herself on, and began sleeping. In her sleep, Geraldine and Sheldon discreetly fed her in her sleep with the funnel. She woke up, and sheldon had a scale before her. She swung out of bed, and stepped onto it, eager to learn the number. Sheldon stooped down, and called out a number. \"Six hundred and fifty five!\" Maxine listened on, and followed geraldine and sheldon to supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few months, </span></div></div>",

Sheldon was off on repair business, fixing an old woman's computer down in the trailer park. She fixed her white blouse back on, and her formal black blouse, both almost skintight. She passed the cabinet in the hall, grabbing a bag of chips and beginning to shovel chips into her mouth. She walked over to the cart that sat in the hall, and she began pushing it. It had a large glass container, attached to a pump, leading into a hose. She stopped by the refridgerator, grabbing several jars of thick, cookie-dough colored substance: Pure calories, sugar, and Carbohydrates, mixed in with  highly saturated fats. She poured several of the jars into the large container, until it was full. She set aside the glass jars, and wheeled the cart into Maxine's room. She laid on an industrial size bed, big enough for a family of three, leaving ample room. She looked 920 pounds if she weighed an ounce. She looked excitedly at the container. Geraldine gave her seductive smirk at Max, her second chin stretching in this maneuver. \"Hello, Maxy Max! Time for that time again!\"  Maxine smiled. \"I always love 'That Time'. She opened her mouth as geraldine held the hose. Geraldine's ideas came close to fruition, she slowly inserted the hose, and as maxine closed her mouth, geraldine slipped out the hose and kissed maxine. Her eyes widened as geraldine kissed her, but she felt strangely...attracted to it. She went on, and geraldine pulled away. \"Now, time for the next course!\" Geraldine re-inserted the hose and Maxine slurped from it. She could feel the slushie of calories, saturated fats, sugars, salt, and carbs flowing into her large stomach. She relaxed on the bed as geraldine sat back in pleasure, watching her feed. Maxine's stomach began expanding and growing, slower of course, as it had more to grow. But grow it did. Geraldine had grown accustomed to seeing her naked. Maxine's nostrils began breathing in and out, faster and faster. Geraldine gave it a bit, and walked over, removing the hose to allow maxine a respite. Geraldine grabbed the rag and showerhead from off the wall: Since maxine was immobile, she couldn't go back and forth between the bathroom and her bedroom. Geraldine began washing Maxine with water, giving her a nice spread of hot water across her body, and scrubbing the soapy rag along her folds, her belly, on her breasts, cleaning her. The bath was a nice relaxation, and Maxine leaned her head back. As she did so, Geraldine scrubbed both of her chins. Maxine felt her scrubbing what seemed like a third chin, a thin fold developing beneath her double-chin. Geraldine gave a chuckle as she scrubbed it. Maxine smiled with her eyes closed. Geraldine then turned off the water. She took the hose, and put it back in maxine's mouth. Maxine laid back and allowed the slurping to continue.

Geraldine was out of the room: She had left shortly after putting the hose in her mouth, work had called. She wriggled uncomfortably in her bed, clutching her chest as the heartburn grew to horrid proportions. Her fears became verified, and she felt like screaming, but she couldn't, the hose was feeding a constant stream of pure fat and cholesterol down her throat. Her heart was ebbing and flowing, it had finally begun the process of giving out. Her chest began rising and falling rapidly, as though being riddled with machine gun bullets. Her heart's arteries were pumping hard, fast, as much as possible, but heart tissue began tearing. Her massive heart couldn't take the pressure any longer: It flat out stopped right then and there. The only thought in Maxine's brain was 'Oh god, no, I was enjoying myself.' As her life faded away and her eyes began closing, only one thought came through. 'Damn you, sheldon.' She laid there, looking so peaceful. Her belly continued to grow. Peace settled on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke in a sterilized white room, in a case surrounded by scientists.

Then you'll gradually allow yourself to weaken and fatten. Are you up for it?\" Maxine paused for a moment, and spoke.</span></div></div>",

She unzipped a portion of her jumpsuit's top, letting sweat run down from her toned stomach and begin soaking the tip of her jeans. She had been working out on a strict regimen for a month now, and her weight had gone up, her muscular growth showing. It took heavy mental training to not revert back to her old habits that had killed her. The concept that sheldon and geraldine, and all of the people she had known were dead took a bit of working around. She almost reverted back into a cycle of emotion-based eating, but she was able to hold that demon back before it spawned. She looked down. It still struck her that these scientists were able to do what she was unable to do in her many, many, many years of working out: Remove the weight that had plagued her all her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine walked into her bedroom, sitting down on her bed. She still remembered that decision to visit applebees. She could have ignored Sheldon and continued on her decided suicide-by-food. Would things still have changed, though? Would the outcome have been different had she sought out Geraldine first? She felt like her life was nothing but clay in the hands of others, and it didn't seem to be any escape. Her weight was a chain that bound her to others. She stripped off the long, white jumpsuit with its blue stripe running off her collar in a long, oblong shape, leaving her down to the cloth that covered her breasts and her pelvis, exchanging it for a hexagonal patterned top that covered down to her flat, muscular belly, and a light blue pair of shorts that went down to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came at the door, She opened it for the white-coated scientist. \"Maxine, good to see you.\" said the rather large, dirty blonde scientist whose belt bulged with his belly. Maxine spoke. \"Good to see you too, Doctor Graham.\" Graham smiled a bit, and spoke. \"I'd like you to follow me, We're going to just give you a physical, and see how you're standing in relation to our experiment.\" Maxine nodded, and followed Graham. The long, white corridors seemed so sterilized. Doctors dotted the sides, discussing various experiments. This or that test on human genes, This or that test on mechanical compatibility with the human organs. Maxine puzzled at a few of these, but the future shock had come far earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the wide, square room. Graham walked over to a square scale linked to a reader on the wall. It had plenty of room, and the floor tiles had moved recently.

Amazing work, just stand still. Extend your arm a bit.\" She extended her long, slightly beefier arm. A needle came from the wall in front of her and inserted itself in painlessly. It then left, and within a few moments, Graham began speaking. \"Alright, that's a BMI of 15, Muscle density is about Fifty out of Eighty. Amazing shape overall.\" Maxine nodded. Graham spoke. \"Now, I'd like you to begin a diet including the following: Coffee, Doughnuts, Cookies, Potato Chips, and Candies.\" Maxine nodded, and went off.

I'm going to call Nine One One.\" Sheldon ran over to the phone and began dialing. Maxine could feel her heart struggling to get oxygen into her blood, her panting quickened. She felt as though her heart was going to detonate, this made it race even faster. She felt it was going to detonate at any second. Sheldon was pacing back and forth, talking on the phone, answering the woman's questions.  As the paramedics opened the door, her vision went black. She felt unbelieveable peace and tranquility, like nothing could touch her. She was finally free. <br>\r\nThen she woke up. <br>\r\nShe was laying in a hospital bed, the doctors stood above her, along with sheldon.

Alright, give me the news.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so it seems that you have a condition that prevents your body from being able to burn of calories or fat!\" Maxine froze in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE GOOD NEWS TO GO WITH THAT?\" Maxine yelled, attracting the attention of passerby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the condition also removes any health risks that come with being overweight, and even removes the possibility of losing your mobility no matter how big you get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what else eliminates the health risks of being over weight and immobile,\" Maxine paused. \"BEING SKINY, THAT'S WHAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know, but you don't have a choice about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be fat! Wait, what about liposuction?\" Maxine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your body won't be able to handle not having the fat in your body, your body will reject the lighter form and you will die!\" The doctor warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is horrible!\" Maxine cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all bad, you can eat anything without worrying about becoming unhealthy, you can become as big as a house and still be able to move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but what's the point in eating what ever I want if nobody finds me attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised, their are tons of guys and even girls who are fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little of mor talking with the doctor, Maxine hung up clued cell phone and heard some on coming up behind her.</span></div></div>",

Her constant snacking was making her stomach start to round out, nothing drastic but enough to make her want to wear baggy clothes so that no one could notice (thus the loose blouse), and now her crush was coming back after being away for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes after she got dressed she heard some one fiddling with her doors lock and opening it, and Rex went crazy, he quickly ran over to the door and jumped onto the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrr!* \"Whoa boy,\" The intruder reached into his pocket and pulled out some doggy treats. \"You want a chew stick boy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex took the treats in his mouth and walked into a corner to chew it, but still kept his eye on the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you treat him so nicely!\" Sam said as she came up to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more of a self preservation thing then anything else,\" The man got up and brushed the dog hair off of his clothes.

He got a extra large tub of popcorn to share, he got Sam a cherry slushy and a root beer for himself. He let her pick out what ever kind of candy she wanted, which was just a bag of gummy bears, and he got his favorite \"candy\", raisins coated in chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after they sat down the previews started.

While you were away I got bored with no one to keep me company, and I started eating to pass the time...a lot, and well,\" Sam lifted up her blouse and exposed her rounded middle. \"I got kind of fat and I wasn't eating because I thought you wouldn't like me if I got bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that it?

She opened her fridge and pulled out some eggs and began to cook them. While she stood over the stove to make sure that the eggs were made just the way she liked them, she failed to hear the sound of someone flushing the toilet, washing their hands, open the bathroom door and come up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for me?\" Chase asked as he firmly grasped Sam's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHASE YOU PERVERT GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY ASS,\" Chase took his hands off of her butt and Sam turned around, using her left hand to cover her crotch and her right arm to cover her breast. \"I thought you left you jerk!

She decided to do somewhat of a mix of the two, she put in a new black bra and a new black pair of panties, and a loose blue blouse that reached a quarter of the way to her knees. She walked out off her room to see that Chase put the eggs onto a plate and was working on the French toast and sausage as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you went to bed hungry so I thought I should make you a little something extra.\" Sam sat down at the kitchen table and Chase placed the plate of eggs down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really do spoil me!\" Sam said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my favorite girl,\" Chase said as he walked toward the door. \"Listen, I really hate to do this to you but I should really go home and change, but I'll come right back as soon as I do!\" Sam nodded and after Chase left she continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chase came back Sam was just finishing of the last of the food. \"Okay I'm back, did you save me anything?\" Chase asked as he came into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to?\" Sam asked with her fork in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just kidding, I had a apple and some orange juice at my place.\" Chase said after sitting next to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sunk her head down. \"Great, now I feel like a huge pig!

Chase sat laid down on the couch and Sam sat down between his legs and rested her back on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase rubbed her stomach with his left hand and her thigh with the other, while he kissed her on the face, shoulder and neck. \"You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment, one hand on my thigh, you kissing me all over, it would be exactly the same if your other hand wasn't on my big tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I know what you mean!\" Chase moved his left hand from Sam's stomach to back on her ass, but for the third time she slapped it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT.

I meant on my flat abbs, but they've been replaced by my tummy fat.\" Sam said sorrowfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase put both of his hands on Sam's stomach and grabbed a hand full of her flab in each. \"Don't be sad, they're still in there some where, they've just got some soft padding now,\" He said trying to cheer her up. \"And didn't I tell you I'd like you no matter what you looked like, besides, I think you soft, round stom-er-tummy, is a lot nicer to touch then some hard, square abbs anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like the feel of your hard mussels more then the feel of my own tubby tummy?\" Said Sam as she grabbed onto Chase's muscular forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess it's some kind of double standard or something or maybe it's because opposites attract, but my body makes you happy and me feel good and your soft st-er-tummy, makes me happy,\" Chase took his hands off of Sam's stomach and put them her shoulders. \"but if it doesn't make you feel good I can help you lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put her own hands on her stomach and grabbed it. \"I never said that I didn't want you to be happy with my-wait, are you trying to tell me that you like me fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase's eyes darted back and forth. \"I, um, I didn't-ah, hey look at the time, it's already noon! How about we get some lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we can go out to eat or we can have something here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. Stay in and eat.\" After the meal Sam has out grown her cloths and she asks Chase to go buy her some bigger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB. Go out to eat.\" After lunch Sam's clothes are getting tight and Chase takes her to get some new ones. </span></div></div>",

Because its starting to get-OW!\" Sam was going to say something else but the pain from the tightness of her over stuffed stomach cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you alright,\" Chase stopped joking around and rushed to Sam's side to make sure she was okay. He poked at Sam's rock hard stomach and watched as she recoiled in pain. \"I'm so sorry I shouldn't have made you eat that much, how about I give you a bel-er-tummy, rub.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff, yeah that sounds good.\" Chase helped Sam out of her chair, but the buttons of her now skin tight blouse could no longer handle the stress and the bottom three of it popped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is-or I guess was, my loosest fitting top! Now what am I going to wear to work...OH NO, WORK! What is every one at work going to say when I walk into the station looking like a Cow!\" Sam said as Chase sat her back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry no one is going to make fun of you, and if they do they'll have to deal with me!\" Chase said as he too sat back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Sam said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give them a couple punches to the face, a couple kick to the side, maybe a few shots to the knee based off of how bad they hurt your feelings, you know, typical boy friend stuff,\"Chase put his hand on Sam's stomach and began to rub it to relieve some of her pain. \"And as for clothes, as soon as you are feeling better I'll go get you some new, better fitting clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you just say that you were my boy friend?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, was I not supposed to?\" Chase replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's not it I just...wasn't expecting you to say it so soon.\" Chase smiled and gave Sam a kiss on the lips.<br>\r\nChase rubbed his hands around in circles on Sam's stomach to relieve some of the tightness, when It became loose enough he grabbed some of it in his hands and began to kneed it. Once it got back its soft, doughy feel and regained its flabby shape, Chase continued to fondle Sam's stomach fat, he tickled it and held it in his hands, he'd lift handfuls of it up and let it fall, squeeze it tight then slap it lightly to watch it jiggle, all of wich was providing a Very sensual experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it pleahehese! It tickels too mu-ahaha-no stopstopstop! Please no more I can-oh ho, you need to stop or I'll-AHHH-STOP,\" When Chase finally took his hands off of Sam she was gasping for air. \"I *huff* hate *huff* you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I just...sorry,\" Chase apologized. \"And um, I know this isn't, um the best time, to ah, say this but, if I'm going to get you some new clothes...I'm going to need to know, how much you...weigh.\" Chase threw his arms over his face and prepared to get hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh!* You're probably right, I guess it's time for another meeting with the bane of my life.\" Sam got up and walked into the bathroom and Chase followed, she stepped on the scale and the number that was displayed was,</span></div></div>",

Sam had gotten into her fanciest getup, a long blue dress that was slightly strained after the morning of eating. The air was thick with the smell of tomato, baking breads in the ovens. Chicken dishes, pastas, pizza, many many dishes that tantilized the senses lay strewn about the occupied tables. <br>\r\nThe waitresses appeared to be well-fed and weighty, one would even call many of them fat, filling out their white workshirts and black aprons rather well. Sam smirked, and somehow foresaw herself in such a 'filled' body. Something told her that she would feel...comfortable in such a body, the women didn't look skinny and angry and mad like the many women she saw at resturaunts elsewhere, the hostesses that angrily demanded her order<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Their waitress of seemingly around 300 pounds approached and asked for her order, she could tell that she genuinely cared. \"Uh, yeah, I'll take an antipasti of...What's this third item?\" she asked, holding the menu up to the fatter black-haired woman, who said \"Oh yeah, the Shrimp Carboroli. It's really good, trust me.\" Sam nodded. \"Alright ma'am, I'll take some Shrimp Carboroli, and a coke.\" As the woman nodded, and spoke. \"Alright miss, I'll be right back with your order.\" Chase spoke lightly as the woman walked out of earshot. \"Looks like she knows from experience how it tastes...heh.\" Sam lightly smacked him on the elbow, and spoke. \"Oh please, you wouldn't mind if I was her size, would you.\" Chase spoke. \"Now would it be so bad?\"<br>\r\nSam innocently rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, sam held her dress which was stretching even more, spoke. \"Ooooohhh god, I shouldn't have let that waitress and you tag team me into getting two entrees and two desserts. I'm gonna blow.\" Chase snickered, and spoke. \"Eeeeyup, you sure are.\" Sam smacked him on the chest while chase couldn't help but break down laughing. Sam spoke. \"You gutter-brained bastard you, I didn't mean it like THAT!\" Chase spoke in gasps. \"Hey, don't blame me, it was low hanging fruit.\" Sam spoke. \"Okay, for that, you're gonna go shoe shopping too while you're out getting me a new dress. Thanks to you and that waitress, this one's about to burst out from its seams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase was in the store, looking at the many arrangements of shoes, dresses, blouses, skirts, shoes.

When Ema was young she was treated very differently because she did not look normal, she was picked on and made fun of a lot. Even after she became a adult she still wasn't treated normaly. Even her boyfriend Jake treated her differently, but not in a bad way. In his eyes she was the most beautiful girl in the world, her flawless and pale skin, beautiful eyes and lovely features drove him crazy, when ever they were in the same room Jake could barely take his eyes off of her, even when he was away from Ema she was the main thing on his mind. When Ema was being bullied she did a lot of comfort eating to ease the pain, which caused her weight to skyrocket and by the time she went of to collage she weighed three hundred pounds! When she met Jake a year later she had lost almost all of it, only weighing 125 pounds. She only let him see pictures of her when she was two hundred pounds or less, not wanting him to see how big she once was, but as of late she with the stress and over all unpleasant job, she has taken up comfort eating again and has gained back thirty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:Jessica and Alicia Wilson (or Jess and Alia).<br>\r\nAge:22 and 19.<br>\r\nHight:5 foot 7 and 4 foot 7.<br>\r\nWeight:125 and 110<br>\r\nHair color:Short blond hair and long blond hair.<br>\r\nEye color:Hazel and blue.<br>\r\nPersonal info:Luke was nineteen when found the seventeen year old Jessica, taking care of her sick fourteen year old sister Alicia in a alleyway. He took them into his home, he put Alicia up in his room and Jessica in the guest room while he slept on the couch. He put th Alicia in school, helped Jessica to get her GED and made sure that they became well educated so that they could one day be successful. Four years later Alicia's condition worsened and she had to be hospitalized and Luke paid for all the medical bills. It didn't take Jessica very long to fall in love with him. Alicia thought of Luke as a father or brother and so did Jessica, but it soon evolved into love, the way that he cared for her and Alicia, how he was so selfless made Jessica fall for him (the fact that he was very handsome didn't help her not fall for him ether). Jessica declared her love for Luke and he returned it. A year after that Alicia's condition had finally improve and she was going to be able to come home soon. Neither Luke of Jessica told Alicia that they were together, since they thought that they should be the last thing for Alicia to worry about, but it had to come out eventualy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No more crumpets for you, young lady!\" Taylor joked to herself, imagining what her mother would have said in a cartoonishly exaggerated British accent. Her parents found this particular portion of her humor annoying, but Taylor couldn't help what she found funny. Besides, no one else was around to hear it. However, the reason for her quip remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the last four years, Taylor had been living with her boyfriend, Jason, while she attended college. She'd been trying to avoid gaining weight, but it had slowly started creeping up on her. It wasn't much at first\u2014if it got too high, she'd work (most of) it off soon enough\u2014but lately, her efforts had slackened. She wasn't exercising as much anymore, wasn't watching what she ate as closely anymore, and it was going straight to her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, here she stood, trying to overcome the obstacle that all who have found themselves a bit rounder than before must overcome\u2014the buttoning of her jeans. Gradually, they had become harder and harder to put on, but she always managed to do so. With a final effort, Taylor passed the button through the loop and zipped up her jeans. Exhaling slowly, Taylor checked the button. It still held, but it was quite strained. Adjusting her black Deadpool T-shirt over the waistband, Taylor looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new muffin top had formed around her waist, sticking out fairly prominently from beneath her shirt. Her jeans were a lot tighter around her lower body, slowly transforming into skinny jeans. Her belly pooched out, threatening to spill over her waistband. Her arms were losing their toning, and the Deadpool logo on her shirt seemed a bit stretched (although not by much, Taylor sadly noted). With dread, Taylor went to the bathroom, pulled out the scale, and hopped on. The numbers flashed, adjusted, then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n140 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor had gained 10 pounds of pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Taylor could hear sizzling. Jason was making pancakes. Her stomach growled hungrily, wanting breakfast. Taylor made her way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', Tay,\" greeted Jason, smiling. \"You're just in time.\" He put down a plate stacked with three large flapjacks drenched in butter and syrup in front of Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's no wonder I've been gaining weight. Jason, sweet as he is, always seems to make too much food for me.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason,\" Taylor said, \"don't you think this is a bit\u2026 much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Is it?\" Jason's expression took a turn for the worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not at all! It's just\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 Nothing,\" Taylor answered, shaking her head. She wasn't ready to confront her weight gain just yet. Grabbing a knife and fork, she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, for his part, only had a bowl of cereal. This was something Taylor found strange\u2014for someone who always gave her such a large breakfast, he ate fairly little himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was finished, Taylor was quite stuffed. She felt like she wouldn't need to eat anything for the rest of her life. She also felt the button of her jeans no longer attached to them. It lay on her seat, face-down. Palming it, Taylor got up gently. Giving Jason a smile and a quick kiss, she returned to her room, changed into some stretch pants, grabbed her bags, and left for her first class of the day.</span></div></div>",

Kevin's black hair was a mess, just like it always was and was wearing a white button up shirt, a red tie, black pants and his black rim glasses, the same thing he always wore, while Emily was wearing aqua blue t-shirt with a green skirt, with her blond hair in a pony tail. Clara however, had yet to change out of her grey suit in from work and into some of her normal, more colorful clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looked down at her tray, it had a hamburger, fries and a milk-shake on it. Then she looked to her friends, Emily was having a salad and Kevin was just sipping on a soda. \"Hey Emily, hows that salad?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You've already got something to eat.\" Emily asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I think I should have a salad instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not that hungry? Because if not you should get something else, this salad is terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm hungry, I just think I should be eating this kind of food right now...I've sort of been putting on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew that was coming.\" Kevin said before taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Clara you look as thin as ever! You've been so stressed out lately you're seeing things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I've got the best friend answer. Now for the blunt roommate one.\" Clara said, turning to Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stared at Clara blankly. \"...So I invited my girlfriend to come over tonight...\" He said hoping to to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, I didn't know you had a girlfriend, I can't believe you found the next girl you want to dump you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, you're so funny,\" Kevin said with another role of his eyes. \"Anyways, she's going to bring two friends of hers to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, not only is She coming over, but she's bringing friends, too?\" Clara complained, forgetting about the previous subject of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound too excited, don't you like her?\" Asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I do, but she Hates me and now she's bringing friends who probably will, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does not hate you! Sara's just jealous that you live with me but she doesn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughed. \"Yeah, like that's a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And I've met her friends, you four will get along great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-wait-wait, four? You want me to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we thought that we should get our friends together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara let out a sigh. \"This is going to be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night while they were all waiting for Sara, Clara had changed out of her suit and a pair of tight green shorts and a tight pink blouse. \"Aww, I was hoping to pick up the guy!\" Emily whined when Clara came out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looked down. \"Huh, I wasn't planing on that, I just picked something at random.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" Kevin yelled as he ran out of his room and to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin opened the door expecting someone to come in, but instead he a hand reached in, grabbed his tie and pulled him out. \"Hey there hansom, I see you didn't bother to change for me, but I guess it's a coming of later anyways.\" Said the red head girl who had Kevin by the tie as she pulled him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sara, w-why don't you and your friends eh-come in.\" Kevin offered as his cheeks went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiled as she and her friends walked inside. When Clara saw Sara she looked her over. She thought Emily\u2019s body looked like an apple, while her body looked like a light bulb, thin at the top with a round, fat bottom, but she compared Sara's body to a bowling pin. She had wide hips, a thin waist, a big chest and was wearing a black miniskirt with a blue baby-doll-T that had a large v-neck to show these features off. \"Hiya, I'm Emily, it's nice to meat you!\" Emily said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, too,\" Sara said smiling. \"And of course it's always nice to see you Clara...anyways, this is Chad and Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi...I'm Amy...it's-uh, nice to meet both of you.\" If Sara a bowling pin, Amy was the bowling ball. She was at least a foot shorter than Clara and about twice her weight. She had brown eyes and black hair that she wore up in pig tales. She obviously was rather subconscious about her weight. She was wearing a loose black and white horizontally striped long sleeved shirt with a small neck hole, with very baggy blue jeans. It was also very clear that she was trying to suck in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man standing next to her smiled. \"And that would make me Chad,\" Chad was about the same height as Kevin but was more lanky than him. \"And don't mind Amy, she's a little awkward at first, but she's as sweet as they come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell, everything about her screams it.\" Emily said with her hand stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you...I think.\" Amy said before shaking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I'll leave you four to get acquainted, while me and Kevin go out and have a bite to eat!\" Sara said, looking at a confused Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I thought we were going to stay here?\" Kevin asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were, but now that I see how well they all get along I don't think we're needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that sounds okay, are you guys okay with it?\" Kevin asked, looking the group of (hopefully) soon to be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, you two have fun!\" Chad said before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised a hand. \"Um, actually-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck on your date with your soon-to-be-ex!\" Emily said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean, Kevin!\" Sara asked with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, nothing. She's just convinced that you plan on dumping me.\" Kevin replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I would never do that, I would be giving up Way too much!\" Sara said, leaning in close to Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put her hand over her mouth and puffed out her cheeks. \"I think I'm going to be sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara laughed, grabbed Kevin by the hand and led him out the front door. While they were gone, the four 'friend in-laws', talked about all sorts of things and all in all, their night,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas actually a lot of fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas pretty uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas awful!

It was raining again so she forgot her umbrella today she swung her wet hair side to side and walked over to the dish bench to squeeze out all the rainwater into the sink.<br>\r\nShe straightens her up and walked to her room, goddess no she doesn't share her room with her little sister and her parents are still at work so she grabbed some leftovers from yesterday to her room where she was gonna re-read some chapters in her math books. The leftovers were just some mashed potatoes and meatloaf with some brown sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna made her homework for hours until it\u00b4s soon noon. She had eaten the leftovers and ate now on some chips while she wrote down some notes for the essay tomorrow at school. \"Bloody hell gal! I can't take this.\" So she snapped the book when her mother called her out.<br>\r\n\"Jenna! Dinners ready.\" Said her mom from the kitchen.<br>\r\nJenn opened her door and walked past the hallway into the kitchen and sat down on the wooden chairs on the opposite side off her little sister who has gotten a little chubby over the last months, it must be a grows spurts during her early puberty and she\u00b4s 13 by the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Taco Thursday today and it was all that could cheer her up now, a rainy day and a lot of homework and the stress is unbearable, so she would really enjoy this dinner because she was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arranges her taco tortilla with some meat and salad and onions with crunched taco chips with ketchup. She ate it up and went for a second one. Usually, she only eats one, but tall girls need to eat and it doesn't matter that she doesn't grow taller anymore. she went for a third and a fourth to a sixth until her ebony skin was stretched taut around her middle. She grabbed her swollen middle with both hands and burped. \" Sorry, ma.\" She ate some more until she walked to her room and was stuffed so extremely severely so her stomach started to create black stretch marks. She has never eaten that much before, or at the same time. Imagine that if the stomach as always remained flat or firm and the suddenly something pressing it out. It\u00b4s realistic that it happens in that manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not feel great, she went to the bathroom to barf but the dinner stayed in her, digesting and growling in agony. \"My!, oh no. I have school tomorrow! I don't feel good.\" Said Jenna. So she rubbed her middle to ease the pain but suddenly the upper bottom of her jeans started to snap until all buttons snapped to. Her belly is hard but it stayed the way it was. Right now her belly is too big for her size 2 jeans, but tomorrow morning it might have decreased in size. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just leaned up from the bed in her yellow tank top and white-pink panties and swung her legs over the bed to the cold wooden floor. She snoozed the alarm clock that said 5 o\u00b4clock that sung lovely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna walked to her bedroom mirror to brush her hair but saw her reflection in the mirror. Well, she is the dark tall gal as she always is, but she noticed that she might have gained...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>when Jenna woke up from the bed she turned off the alarm off her alarm clock on her phone. She got up in her white top and panties and walked off her bedroom to the bathroom to make herself formal for the day. She curled up her hair with a hair blower and cleaned it off from hair knots.<br>\r\nShe stood in front of the mirror and sighed. She remembered she had eaten a lot of food last night, and it is shown on her tall figure. She breathed out and saw her once flat stomach push out a bit and it stuck out more prominently than yesterday. Her navel has deepened, a bit of dark flesh now lied below the top line that has appeared to have ridden up an inch. She placed her hands on her belly and felt her hands touch a layer of fat. She now turned around to see her ass have gotten more cellulite to it and her sides, her love handles shown a more bulge to it. She grabbed her phone to scroll around off her selfies to her most recent picture. It was taken before dinner, and now she took a new photo of her current figure and felt a bang of shock and arousal, her heart beats faster by the realization she has gotten a bit chubby during a night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dressed off her clothes and put on a new fresh pair of panties and a shirt and a pair of Blue jeans. she Manages to put on her jeans, just some resistance around her ass. She had to suck in her gut to bottom the jeans successfully. Her shirt was no problem, it just didn't go all the way down, it barely covered her navel. So Jenna was fine with that. She has never been chubby before and were a little excited about how her few friends or classmates to react to her new appearance or her little crush, Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ready, 25 minutes to spare before the bus is at the bus stop before heading deeper into London city. She looked down and breathed out to see a potbelly. She finished off with her hair and grabbed her homework in her brown leather shoulder bag and at last, she put on her awesome black leather jacket she had to school. she greeted her sister in the kitchen and her mom who red the newspaper with a cup of Earl Grey and smiled at Jenna with a look of surprise when her eyes went to Jenna's abdomen. Jenna grabbed a toast of bread with marmalade or several of them and drank down a bottle of milk before heading to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Have a nice day Jenna!\" Said Her mother.<br>\r\n\" I will ma! I must get to the bloody bus now.!\" Jenna said before shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenna went out from the elevator and opened the door out of the apartment building along the riverside of the great London River, and 900 meters ahead lied the London bridge with Big Ben not far away was the usual protester with boards stood every Monday in the early rush hour. She felt the cold autumn breeze chilled her spine as she decided to put on her hat from her bag. She began to walk to the bus stop 50 meters ahead there a 20 or so waited on the Cowden line bus. In England the public transportation is very reliable, school children take the same bus like everyone else, some take the underground train or a bloody cab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna walked she felt a comfortable feeling as she walked in the cold breeze. Yesterday and before she began to shake when she walked out in the cold. Maybe the extra fat gave a little insulation against the cold? Before it was just skin between her and her bones and she had to dress in a winter jacket every early winter. Nevermind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the red bus rolled into it stops people went out and people went in with their cards on the magnetic ticket pad. She placed her card at the front of the bus and hid it down again in her wallet in her bag. Jenna took her usual seat at the back and when she did she felt her gut bulged forward and straining the upper button!<br>\r\nIt was rather uncomfortable but felt she could do nothing when the bus was almost full. <br>\r\nA while later the bus stopped and some passengers went on and some off, but this was not her stop no, it was here crush at school usually went on to her school. Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw him at the front looking for a seat, and Jenna had one open next to her. Omg, what... will happen now she thought. this could be her move!<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",
