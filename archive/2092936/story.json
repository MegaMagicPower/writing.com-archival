The waitress cards you so no alcohol but you're allowed to gamble. You order a Sprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dealer deals cards. You nearly spit your sprite when you see your cards. There are naked people on some cards and they look like they are moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly gentleman next to you leans over and says, \"First time.\" Your only answer is the blush that comes over you as you realize you blew your poker face. You lose the first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think this must be some advanced technology putting videos on playing cards. However, the people on the cards are not acting sexy. Some act humiliated and some act bored. You figure out that the higher the card, the more likely it is to have a naked person on it. The queens are all female. The kings and jacks are all male. Otherwise, high hearts and diamonds have females while high spades and clubs have males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone bumps you and you spill Sprite on the ace of spades you just laid down. You grab a napkin to wipe the card off and notice that wiping the card pushes the little man around too. He bumps his head on the edge of the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat woman sitting next to you says, \"Careful. You wouldn't want anyone to treat you that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say, \"It's just a card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dealer takes the ace of spades from you and says, \"Thanks for trying but it's too late. The card is marked. It has to be replaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo security guards come and take the ace of spades. The fat woman says, \"Go and watch. You need an education.\" You leave the table to follow the guards to a back room. The guards let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room, a glowing blue orb puts out energy. People operate computers nearby. The guards put the card on the blue orb. The naked man pops out of the card fully restored to normal size. The guards grab the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man yells, \"No, I don't want to be a card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter securing the man to the blue orb, one of the guards rips the old card to shreds and throws it away. He says, \"You still have to be a card until two in the morning when we close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guard pulls out a new ace of spades which seems to suck the naked man into it. He hands you the new ace of spades and says, \"You can take that back to the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the ace of spades. He's screaming but not making any sound.</span></div></div>",

He tries to turn around but you role him over to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat woman says, \"Go easy on him. He just got married and came here for his honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat woman says, \"I'm his mother.

It feels like being hit by a foam mat, no injury but not fun either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Toby wins. He plays stupid but he keeps winning. He folds when he sees too many men in his hand and bets high when his hand is full of women but he keeps winning anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time he has you in his hand, he says, \"I normally don't play this well. You must be my good luck charm. I should have you in the deck every time I play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Toby gets into a major bid war against the elderly man. Without betting limits, the bets get up into the hundreds quickly. The elderly man runs out of chips. He says, \"I'd like to put an I.O.U. on each of my cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dealer says, \"Deal.  Standard rate is one additional day as a card for each card in your hand if they lose. If you win, the winnings go first toward paying off each cards additional day and you keep the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry, \"I didn't know we could do that. That's unfair.\" But no one can hear you. If the elderly man loses, he's at zero with no debt but you get an extra day as a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly man loses. He had four aces. Both you and the ace of spades get an extra day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby decides he needs to learn more about this game before he plays any further. He cashes out walking away with a few thousand more than he came in with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dealer says, \"As a token of our appreciation and hope that you will come back, you may pick a card to take with you. When the card's time runs out, you can trade it for another.\"</span></div></div>",

Has he eaten? He doesn't look like he's been a card for a week. He's freshly groomed like he just came from the barber ready to get married. You wonder about this and you muss his hair. You watch fascinated as his hair slowly un-musses itself. He isn't doing anything but within seconds, he's back to looking like a man ready to get married (except for his lack of clothes). This is kinda fun just pushing the little man around the card. You spread out his arms and legs and hold them there and you realize that for the next seven years, he's going to be pushed around like a little toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, are on a winning streak.
