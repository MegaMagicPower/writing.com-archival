You enjoyed the series well enough, but one of the characters caught your eye every time he came onscreen: Natsu Dragneel himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a thing for sleeveless, sandal-wearing anime guys, so he was right up your alley. You had gone to sleep the night before, thinking about the pink haired stud as you drifted off. You woke up the next day with a giant headache... but there was something even more concerning... you were only an inch tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and saw nothing but giant blades of grass, the sun beamed down on you as you began to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I...?\" You muttered to yourself as you continued to walk aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel small quakes beneath your feet, confused, you turned around to see a giant figure looming over you with something flying beside it. You immediately recognized him as Natsu, your eyes went wide as you stood in front of his sandal-clad feet. You could smell the stench coming off of them, it was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was a hard job, eh Happy?\" Natsu asked his blue cat friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only hard for you because you can't handle train rides!\" Happy chastised his dragon slayer partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'm just ready to get home and get some food in my belly!\" Natsu patted his abs before looking down directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natsu, what's that weird bug?\" Happy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know...\"</span></div></div>",

Natsu was putting his weight on the foot that was meant to crush you, the pressure was noticeable as the sandal stomped down HARD onto you. Strangely you didn't feel like your bones were being crushed, all you felt was Natsu's giant form leaning on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu chuckled as he completely covered the bug with his foot. \"That's right, any bugs I cross you better expect a good round of crushing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon slayer, wanting to crush the weird bug even more. Lifted up his heel and started grinding his sandal. Natsu suddenly looked confused as he only heard the graveling of dirt, no crunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ne Happy you hear anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exceed floated down and listened, crinkling his nose at the strong scent. Sure enough from the swiveling sandal there was a lack of sound to confirm you were crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I hear is dirt, oh maybe it's a super bug!\", Happy put on a thinking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu frowned and lifted up his foot, turning it to look at his sandal's sole.

Many people knew you as the Pint of the guild, fitting name as your magic was being a inch in height. The Small Magic as you called it, not only gave you your size but also a high durability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came in handy as while the guild was friendly and you considered them family, the bottom of feet and other body parts was a occurring sight in your sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong your friends was a special someone, the ice mage Gray Fullbuster. He was a true bro and always helped you when needed. You wouldn't say it out loud but you do have a crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis crush was metaphorical and literal. There were numerous times when Gray find you stuck to his large sole or under his firm ass. Not to mention whenever he and Natsu got in their scuffles, falling on you and pressing you under their large muscles. Still you had grown a liking of being squashed, but that was another thing you were hesitant to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the end of the day and many guild members had started heading home. This of course had you looking up at your buff manly guild mates as they stepped over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you were hesitant to go home. Usually you headed home when there was still light out. The sun had completely set and Magnolia Town had darkness coating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt the ground shaking again, looking behind you was the large black shoes that occasionally flatten you. Looking up at the towering figure, you saw Gray shirtless and looking past his muscled torso at you with his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice mage gave a smile to the speck before him. \"Hey Pod, you heading home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at your crush's voice before nodding. You suddenly sighed remembering your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray suddenly crouched down, leaning on his knees and making his muscles flex. The black haired giant frowned at your look. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of your head you tried not looking at the muscular assets or the bulge clothed in black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah...its just pretty dark and I'm a bit nervous to head back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow covering you darkened and you soon found yourself clenched in Gray's warm fist. The giant soon rised and slowly brought you up his buff torso before grinning at you with his dark eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if your scared, you can spent the night with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray nodded as he stood up and unconsciously flexed his muscles as he stretched. \"Yeah it's no problem squirt. We can hang and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grew excited as you thought of what fun awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ice mage exited the guild hall, he looked down at your head poking out of his fist. \"Its kinda cold out, how about I put you somewhere warm?\", Gray grew a small smirk as he bounced his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Gray put you?</span></div></div>",

He would often squish you under his bare feet or sit on you \"accidentally,\" but it was obvious that he liked to have fun with your tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pit will be warm enough, right Pod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you stared at the buff wizard's giant armpit. \"U-uh, yeah, that sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray brought you up to his damp armpit and let you get a good look at the wall of smelly skin and hair. Usually when you ended up in his armpit, it was because he'd fallen on you, but now you got to get a nice look of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the smell little man, today's mission was rough.\" Gray said before casually pressing you against his pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were squashed into the shoft, squishy skin as Gray rubbed you around. His smell was strong, it smelled like the scent of a hard working wizard. You couldn't help but take deep breaths as Gray grinded you into his warm pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that'll be enough to make sure you don't accidentally fall out,\" Gray began to lower his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were smushed between Gray's muscles and armpit, trapped in the dark forest of Gray's armpit hair as the ice wizard began to walk home.

It was even more difficult for you being only a inch tall. The giant doors belonged to the guild Fairy Tail, a infamous guild you hoped to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began when you were watching T.V back home, surprisingly you were watching a anime with the same guild name.

Looking up, your eyes widened as a large figure was walking towards the door and you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had spiky blond hair and a distinctive lightning scar on his handsome face. He was shirtless, giving a view of his muscular bod and guild mark. His large brown shoes pounded the floor as they carried the muscular weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Laxus Dreyar! You were a bit embarrassed to admit that you had a small crush on him. His personality and looks were a contributor. Speaking of crush....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaxus stopped right before the door, his big booted feet were on both sides of you and made you feel truly puny. Looking up, you could barely see Laxus' face over his large pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome giant soon looked down and his familar smirk grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah a bug, trying to be a guild member are ya? Well sorry to say but the only place you'll be joining is underneath my foot crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a chill as Laxus lifted up one of his large feet and hovered the boot over you, the stomper slowly descended as if to draw out your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WAIT I'm not a bug!\", you desperately shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaxus........</span></div></div>",

It was a sunny hot day as you walked through town, a particular destination in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall building in the distance sped up your walking and a grin grew on your face as you spotted a familar face near the entrance and called out. \"Romeo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo Conbolt was hanging out in front of the Fairy Tail Guild, prepared to set off to train a little. The black haired boy wiped some sweat off his forehead when he heard his name being called. Romeo grinned as he saw you running up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Minu! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon stopped in front of your friend. Now your short form showed as you only went half way up Romeo's chest, a sight often causing flushes due to being leveled with the muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you smiled. \"I've been practicing with my magic, I wanted to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo toothily grinned and put his hands on his hips. \"Awesome! Come on show me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you soon took a breath and concentrated. A grayish magical circle glowed beneath you as your whole body glowed the grayish color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, the whole world had taken a literal HUGE turn. In front of you were a familar pair of brown shoes, the toes were as big as a house. Going up was a pair of tall legs leading to a torso, clothed in a vest opened to reveal firm abs. You blushed as the face of your friend was slightly blocked by his large pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Minu where'd you go?\", Romeo looked around in confusion. A dim glow down below made him glance down and widened his eyes as before his feet in a tiny magic circle was his now speck of a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell onto your butt the gigantic Romeo crouched down, his booming voice hitting you like strong winds. \"Whoa that's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo suddenly reached down, engulfing you in a warm fist. Standing up, Romeo brought you up his muscular torso before grinning at your head sticking out of his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled while trying to suppress your flush. \"T-thanks, I call it Downsize. I can shrink down and increase my durability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo suddenly had a look of thought, before he grinned widely. Tugging his scarf  off fully uncovered Romeo's firm chest, the fist soon lowered to where you found yourself facing the canyon crevice and picking up the smell of b.o.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this wouldn't hurt you?\", Romeo's question soon revealed its context as the black haired boy pressed you into his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked as Romeo pushed you between the two large walls of muscle. The pecs as they were now already were squeezing you as the bodily musk surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo chuckled as he put his hands on his hips and looked down at his chest. \"Hehe wow Minu your really a shortie now!\", the muscular boy suddenly bounced his pecs, feeling your tiny body get crushed between his buff muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the increased pressure and walls of muscles squeezing you up and down. You weren't in any pain, the worst effect of Romeo's pec crunching was the blush forming from the boy's muscles and smelly stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Romeo....</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately strange circumstances rose in the form of a freak alchemy accident facing you. A group of strange cultists had kidnapped you and tried to use human transmutation in a bizarre ritual with you as a sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual was a failure with all the cultist being killed as their souls were torn from their bodies. You were spared but strangely faced a different outcome, your body was reduced in size to an inch tall. It was a shock and you had to struggle to survive when the military investigated the scene and nearly crushed you under their boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken in as a ward/pet of the military you were to be watched by the colonel Roy Mustang. You were nervous about about being watched by a giant, especially the handsome dark haired man you saw in photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were set on the floor of the office, waiting for Mustang to arrive and finally meet you. Intimidation already filled you at all the gigantic furniture surrounding you. Light tremors soon began to thump the ground and you looked towards the towering door as tbe knob began to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed as he walked into his office. He had many thoughts running through his head about the ward he was going to be watching. Ian was a shrunken boy who had no clear future of returning to normal, the alchemy that did so was strange enough as is. Still he felt an urge to protect the tiny, like a natural instinct as a giant. Roy rose an eyebrow as his desk was bare, where did they put you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in awe at the huge form of Roy Mustang, his large booted feet led up to his blue clothed body. From the looks of it he might be hiding some muscle under there. The handsome man was swaying his head seeming to look for something.

As you were brought into the air in the fist your eyes widened as the military top suddenly was gone, your blush returned as your saw just how muscular this giant was. From his bulging biceps to his huge pecs this was the definition of a manly body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am major Armstrong, it's a pleasure to meet you.\", Armstrong bowed his head to you as his muscles flexed with the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to shake off your blush before looking up to the mustached man. Telling Armstrong your name the man suddenly began bringing you to his chest. Pressing you to his huge firm pec, Armstrong crossed his huge arms across his chest as if giving a giant huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was the pressure from the massive muscles squeezing you a lot but a sweaty b.o smell was coming from the bulky body of Armstrong.

But finally the door to the home of the most fearsome beings in the old world awaited you. Should you beg, be confident and bold. A normal human is one thing but you were weak to your larger species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door in front of you suddenly opened, thooms in the ground had you nearly fall a large mass landed before you. Looking up the color drained from your face as looming above was a purple headed boy with one eye showing. People often spoke of the generals and if you weren't wrong then this was the fallen angel Lucifer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple eye of the giant suddenly looked down at you, immediately the fear inceeased. \"U-um demon general I'm sorry to intrude but i wish to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trailed off your words as the shadow covering you darkened, looking up your eyes bulged as the giant rose one of his large feet over you. Before you could even shout the foot came down and you found yourself being thrown to the ground with a heavy and sweaty pressure squishing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrushihara grunted he leaned into the foot he just stomped down. \"Stupid bugs.\", lifting up his heel the fallen angel began to swivel his foot to ensure he throughly crushed the 'bug'. A audible squish noise came as the soft sole pressed the giant's weight onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squishing down on his foot again, Urushihara brought his attention up as he scanned the area around the door. The purplenette sighed as he walked back in, unaware of the twitching speck smooshed into the ball of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down in front of his computer, Urushihara looked at the webpage groaning. \"They said it was gonna arrive today.\", the fallen angel was hoping he'd get his delivery before Maou or Ashiya got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as your front was squished into the soft sole quite a bit. Miraculously you weren't reduced to a jumble of crunches, almost like your endurance was high. But you weren't thinking about that as you inhaled the smelly foot odor from the giant's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...</span></div></div>",

After breakfast you pulled up Netflix to watch the anime Seven Deadly Sins, a show you've grown fond of. You soon decided to take a nap, as you drifted of to sleep you blushed as you thought of the sin of greed Ban. It was silly, but you kinda wished you could be in the world of Britannia and get to meet your immortal Husbando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up had been a shock as surrounding you, tall as buildings was grass. Everything was also different visually, you couldn't explain it but the world just looked......animated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choices on what to do, you started trekking through the grass to find one of this world's giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good minute of walking, you stepped out of the tall grass as you stepped onto ground with the green plant just sprouted. Shade was covering the area as a tree's branches blocked the harsh light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at the sight in front of you. Two giant red shoe soles towering over you, crossed at the ankle. Some hope surfaced as you maybe found some help, but upon going around the shoes your jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBan the Fox's Sin of Greed was resting against the tree, not to mention he was a giant! He had his toned arms folded behind his pale blue hair, his wide armpits with bushy hairs were exposed and sweaty. Ban let out snores as his firm pecs rose and fell, his abs also shifted with each breath. His full glorious torso was nude and had trails of sweat going between the well defined muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the sight of the hot immortal boy not only in front of you partially nude, but also a giant. There was a strong temptation to go closer, as you walked up the tightly clothed leg you felt the red leathery outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, you gribbed onto the leather as hard as possible and started to climb up Ban's thigh. Reaching the top, your nose crinkled as it caught the scent of potent b.o coming off of Ban's numerous abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing closer to the abs, you couldn't help but look up in awe at the trail of muscles to Ban's handsome face. The abs themselves were like hills and touching the warm skin allowed you to feel the mighty muscle and even the gurgling of the immortal's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly......</span></div></div>",

So you would try and learn from a idol if yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large door stretched into the sky, deciding to go for it you rushed forward and rammed into the door. A somewhat audiable thud came as you rubbed your sore shoulder. Just as you were about to ram the door again, the ground began shaking with tremors coming from beyond the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly opened and a shadow was casted over you as the tremors stopped with a large mighty stomp from the towering figure's large foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in awe, all the way up the long black clothed legs. The torso of the giant was nude, half of his numerous abs had sports tape wrapped around them. The large tan pecs partially blocked the face of the handsome Suiryu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping at the true scale of just how gigantic Suiryu was to your tiny form, you tried gathering courage and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-suiryu-dono please take me as a stu-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SQUASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out your tiny voice didn't reach Suiryu.

Looking anywhere but down Suiryu sighed before chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm must've been too nervous to talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suiryu turned and walked back into his home, you could be spotted plastered to the tan sole of the muscular giant.

Your name was Jerry, you were born in an area where radioactive waste had been spilled, which caused a... small issue during your birth. Despite your height, you thought that you may be good for some challenges and you also thought that the guys of TD were attractive, especially Alejandro. You arrived at the new location, an island called \"Shuren Isle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris McClain had you hidden away in his pocket as he and the contestants for this season stepped out onto the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Shuren Isle!
