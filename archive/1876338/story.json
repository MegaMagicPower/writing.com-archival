One of them can definitely help me out of this.\" He said to himself. With this in mind he began the long trek to the curtain that acted as a door.

Fortunately, it was still relatively early so there was nobody walking around the hall so he could walk in relative safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's a good thing her room isn't too far from mine'. He thought to himself as he made the long trek. 'Otherwise, I could've been walking for quite a while.' In spite of this the journey was still very lengthy do to his current size, and by the time he made it to Korra's room Mako was exhausted. However, exhaustion didn't stop him from being awestruck by the sight that greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra was HUGE! In his mind Mako had known that being smaller meant everyone else would be bigger. That knowledge didn't prepare him for the sheer massiveness of the female in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this how bugs see us?' Mako wondered as he continued his appraisal of the giant Avatar. Korra was already dressed in her signature blue water tribe outfit and was just finishing putting on her fur-lined boots when Mako walked in. As she stood up Mako was once again overhwelmed by the tremendous disparity in size between them. Mako crande his neck in order to see Korra's face. She had a look of morning grogginess about her and her eyes were distant and unfocused as she began to walk towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How in the world will I get her to look down here?' He thought concernedly. He had to decide quickly because Korra's gigantic boots were almost upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra!\" He shouts desperately. </span></div></div>",

This was his chance! \"KORRA!\" he screamed, \"LOOK DOWN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra heard the voice again. It seemed to be coming from below, so she looked down towards her feet.

At least she didn't seem to have any intention of hurting him. The ground shook as Korra dropped down onto her knees and bent over so she was eye level with Mako.

I mean, keeping you safe shouldn't be a big problem, but I'm not really sure how to go about unshrinking you. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra was cut off as Tenzin barged into the room. She quickly moved Mako around behind her back so he wouldn't be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra, you're late for airbending practice!\" Tenzin said, scolding her. \"And what's that behind your back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind my back?

I can even believe you're accusing me of hiding something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin cuts her off \"Save the speech Korra. Just show me your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra, not wanting the tiny Mako to be seen, quickly did the first thing that came to mind. Unfortunately for Mako, the first thing that came to mind was hiding him in the place available, the back of her pants. She dropped him in and showed Tenzin her empty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako couldn't believe what just happened. Korra put him down here pants, and now he was pressed up against the Avatar's butt! Lucky for him, he ended up between her butt cheeks rather than under a cheek. In his position, her two firm buttocks were pressing in him from both sides, squeezing him between them. He tried to struggle and demand to be late out, but Korra silenced him with a simple clench of her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you didn't have anything behind your back. I'm sorry for accusing you otherwise. However, we still have airbending practice to get to. Come on.\" Temzin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Tenzin,\" Korra replied, following him out of the room, thinking about poor Mako between her butt cheeks. His struggles tickled her, so she had to stop them with a clench of her butt cheeks. \"I'm sorry Mako,\" she muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Korra get to remove him before training? Or will Mako have a front row seat to her practice</span></div></div>",

She had to admit, his squirming did feel good, but she had to get him out of there. She needed a distraction. Luckily, she got one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP PULLING MY HAIR IKKI\" Jinora screeched from down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin sighed. \"Not again..... Korra, I have to handle this. I'll meet you outside in 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra didn't miss her chance. She rushed to her bedroom and reached into her pants to retrieve Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako felt the movement of Korra's butt cheeks speed up considerably. Her massive glutes nearly crushed him as they ground him between them. Just as suddenly as the movement started, it stopped. A massive hand suddenly descended from above and plucked him out of his prison. He was once again brought up to Korra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry Mako!\" Korra told the tiny man in her hand. \"I don't have much time before I have to meet Tenzin, so I'm going to have to help you later. Until then, you'll have to stay in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako looked to see where he'd be staying, and saw that Korra was moving him towards an open dresser drawer. The real shock was when he saw what was in the drawer. It contained Korra's undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only drawer I'm sure Ikki and Jinora won't go fishing around in. They're always borrowing and trying on my clothes. I'm sure you won't mind spending some time in there though.\" Korra said with a wink and a flirtatious smile. \"I'll be back in a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako just blushed without saying a word as Korra pushed the drawer shut, leaving a tiny crack of light to illuminate his surroundings. He decided to take a nap while he waited for Korra to return. He had no problem falling asleep; he was exhausted from his shrunken adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako awoke to the drawer opening.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mako was in bliss as Korra continued to playfully smother him in her round, juicy butt by walking around the room and occasionally flexing her spongy glutes. With each step she took, Korra's wide hips shook from side to side, causing her thick cheeks to continually bounce and rub all over Mako's body. Enveloped in soft, warm flesh, Mako could do nothing to hide his arousal, especially since his erection kept poking and prodding her behind while she smothered him with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt it, Korra stopped walking and looked back at her behind with a smirk, \"Hmm, what's that I feel? Is someone having a grand ol' time between my buttcheeks. Do you love getting battered by my big beautiful booty, Mako?\" Mako tried to respond, but he was quickly silenced by a mouthful of Korra's chocolaty ass, which he proceeded to kiss and lick with vigor. Satisfied with his response, Korra decided to kick things up a notch. While Mako was busy playing with her butt, she reached behind herself and cupped each of her meaty cheeks in her hands. \"Well I can't really blame you for falling in love with my ass the way you have. It's just so plump and bouncy that even I can't help but want to squeeze it and play with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning she used her hands jiggle and bounce her ass all over Mako, rocking his world as he continued to moan in pleasure. What both of them failed to notice was the extra strain this was putting on Korra's extra-tight panties, which was slowly starting to rip apart at the seams. As suddenly as she began, Korra stopped. Next she slowly slid her hands from the bottom of her bubble butt to the sides. She proceeded to slowly squeeze her cheeks around Mako, release them, and then squeeze again. Mako couldn't move from the pressure, but he was too entranced by Korra's soft ass and intoxicating pheromones to care. After squeezing him a few more times, Korra used her hands to knead, squeeze, and grind her ass all over Mako with extra vigor. All Mako could do was wiggle around and grab as much of Korra's flesh as he could as he was swept away by her ass, his squirming and tickling giving Korra even more pleasure. Both were too focused on their arousal to notice that Korra's blue panties were on their last legs; they couldn't take much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Korra let go of her butt and started to grope her chest while she sensually wiggled her hips, continually teasing her lover. \"I've seen you stare at my bouncy booty whenever we trained or went out somewhere. You loved seeing it stretch out my water tribe pants and my training gi. I bet you fantasized about me bouncing it in your face or grinding it in your crotch. You must be living the dream right now, aren't you, Mako? And now that you've finally got it, you cant seem to get enough. Even if I did this.\" First she started to bounce in place, causing her ass to bounce up and down as it shook Mako about., prompting him to fall back against her weakening panties as her cheeks pummeled him. After the warm up, Korra looked back with a smirk as she put her hands on her knees and squat down a little, jutting her ass out. She winked and then started to wildly shake and clap her huge butt cheeks all over Mako. To him, the shaking was nearly cataclysmic as he laid back spread-eagle against Korra's panties, vulnerable to the endless pounding of Korra's round cheeks, but he was still loving it, especially since his member was still caught between her cheeks as they pummeled it and rubbed it in just the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take anymore, Korra's panties broke off her voluptuous ass with a loud *SNAP*. With nothing left to hold him in place while Korra shook her ass, Mako bounced off Korra's butt and fell. Fortunately, Korra was standing in front of the foot of her bed during their playing, so Mako landed safely on the soft  surface. He merely laid back and looked up at the ceiling, dumbfounded by the pleasure he had just experienced. Korra looked back in surprise at what just happened but was happy that Mako was unharmed. She giggled when she saw that his member was still fully erect. \"Haha, wow! Even now you still want more of my booty. Well let's see if you can handle what's next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako looked back at Korra, wondering what she was talking about. He saw her look back and strike a sexy pose, one hand on her hips as they're cocked to the side, then she stuck her ass out towards him and gave it a powerful slap, further entrancing Mako as her mountain of an ass rippled and jiggled. Suddenly, Korra jumped in the air and landed her bouncy ass directly on Mako, once again enveloping him in her warm flesh. Korra gave a relaxed sigh started to slowly grind her ass on Mako, while also switching to light bounces on occasion. Again, Mako couldn't move, but he didn't care. He was being smothered by the world's biggest, softest ass, and he loved it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Korra stood up and looked back. She was expecting to see Mako plastered to her bed, but laughed when she saw he was stuck spread eagle against her butt crack instead, grabbing handfuls of each of her cheeks while his member was stuck between them. \"Aw, you look so cute, Mako! You cant bear to be away from my butt. Let's get a better look at you on my butt.\" Korra then started to walk towards the full-body mirror on the other side of the room. With each step she took, Mako could feel her butt shaking and jiggling, sending vibrations across his body. Every time Korra rocked or turned her hips, Mako's arms and legs sunk into her soft, squishy flesh while his face and crotch were crushed and ground in between her massive cheeks, which felt wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the mirror, she turned around and bent over to get a good look at Mako and her butt in the reflection. \"Aw, Mako. Look. Don't you just love how big my delicious booty is compared to you? Here, take a closer look.\" Korra then stood up and pressed Mako and her butt up against the mirror. \"Don't you love it? It's almost like you'll vanish inside my...giant. Plump. Butt. Hahaha\" With each word, she pressed Mako against the mirror again, bouncing her ass against him as she relished the experience, not that he minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Mako grabbed korra's left cheek and held on as tightly as he could. he wrapped his feet and arm on it and hugged his entire body against it. Korra's cheeks continued to move up and down rubbing mako body, but Mako was no longer struggling but was attached to her left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra could feel mako hugging her left butt cheek and was wondering what he could be doing down there.

Mako felt he figured how to stay put in korra's butt comfortably and that her boobs would be a whole other ballgame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay in your butt for now\" Mako said looking up at korra's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it couldnt have been that bad mako, especially if your already going back in\" Korra said as she brought mako back behind her and should her glorious glutes sticking out of her tradition water bending clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled down her pants and showed Mako her tight blue panties once again as she pulled this back again. Mako thought that korra was going to put back in-between her cheeks once again, but korra had a different idea. Korra put mako on her left cheek and let her panties go. Mako felt his tiny body being pressed against Korra's butt cheek and felt it jiggle as korra let go of him. he then felt her panties strike his back and tightened around him holding him in place. Mako couldn't move around at all like last time. korra was happy, now she doesn't have to worry about mako distracting her with his wiggling body. Korra readjusted herself to get comfortable. She started to walk around making sure that mako was tight. mako could feel korra walking around, but his body wasn't moving at all. his arms were spread like he was trying to hug her cheek, and he couldn't move at all. Korra was glad she fought of this. Mako was still in place and now she can't actually move around without having to worry about him. Korra started to train. She ran through the gates 10 times and started to sweat. The first place she started to sweat was he butt. Mako could feel the heat building up around him and his body being pulled closer to her cheek and the sweat dripping around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery movement korra made her ass jiggle around with mako with it. Every time korra finished with a run she shook her butt a little to make sure that mako was in place and hadn't fallen out. She started to like the feeling of mako on her butt cheek and starting to get a little frisky with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mako sorry about the sweat, but i was wondering if you could help me out\" Korra said as she smiled to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmako had no idea what she could need help with with him at this size, but he was completely drenched in korra's sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you lick up some of that sweat? It makes it really hard to practice when the sweat starts to get in my butt crack\" She said as waited for a reply. She wasn't expecting mako to say yes, but she was hoping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako couldnt believe what he was hearing. Korra wanted him to lick her butt crack? This was very demeaning but he didn't want to anger Korra when he was small enough to be in her panties. Mako started to lick up the sweat dripping around him, trying to make sure that nothing fell into her butt cheek. Korra couldnt believe mako was actually doing it and it felt amazing. She could feel his little tongue going all over her butt and getting closer to her crack. Korra stopped moving and just stood enjoying the treatment. mako continued to lick like his life depended on it, making sure that everywhere he could reach was spotless, not letting a single drop fall into her crack. The smell was starting to get to him but he didn't want to stay anything to anger korra. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mako woke up in a cold sweat. \"What a strange dream...\", he thought to himself as he wiped the perspiration from his forehead. In his dream, he had shrunken down to roughly the size of a mouse and Korra was simply gigantic, like about the same size as the Aang statue in Republic City. \"Thank goodness it was only a dream.\", he thought to himself, \"I'd hate to be around a giant Korra.\" He shuddered at the mere thought of a colossal Korra. Considering her generally reckless personality, being around her at normal size tended to be somewhat detrimental to his health. On top of that, her giant clash with Unalaq demonstrated that, despite her being the protector of the world, a giant-sized Korra combined with her inherently impulsive nature could spell disaster to anyone near her. What made Mako even more uncomfortable was the mean attitude she exhibited in his dream. \"Perhaps she was still angry over the way they left their relationship after the break-up.\", he wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mako started to stand up, he began to notice that the place where he awoke was...strange to say the least: He could see nothing but pure abyss, not even his own hands. Yet, when he felt the ground, he started to doubt that this area was his bedroom. The ground here felt...soft like sheep wool (unlike the wooden floorboards in his apartment. Also, a peculiar, faint aroma engulfed the entire atmosphere. He took note of the smell and the humidity of the cavern as he began to advance through the mysterious cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The walls, he noticed, seemed to be made of the same fabric as the ground, and as he moved forward through the cave, it seemed as if the ceiling was...expanding. It was not the only oddity; the cave's fur-like ground began to grow larger as well; whereas it was like grass when Mako awoke, it was now roughly up to his neck...and still growing. Even the foul vinegary stench was growing stronger as he progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\", he pondered as he continued forward. Just as he asked that, Mako tripped and tumbled down a long woolen hill. He landed in a small pond that reeked up of stale corn chips. He rose to his knees, lit an ember in his palm and inspected his new surroundings, coughing as the muggy air filled his lungs. From what he surveyed , it appeared that he had fallen into a valley of sorts. He turned around and saw, lurking above him at the peak of the hill, was a creature he had never seen before in his entire life. The beast appeared not to be moving. It was a elephantine mound bearing a hue that could only be described as white with a strong hint of yellow. The snoozing monster emitted the same scent Mako had smelled earlier; however, as he crept closer to it, the odor grew much more potent. He carefully placed his hand on the stationary beast, and felt as moist, salty perspiration leaked from its fur onto his hand.  \"This place looks like an crater landed here long ago, and now this area has become a swamp of some kind. Judging by its size, this monster must be its guardian or something.\", he explained to himself, \"I better grab the map an- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire world began to shake violently as a seemingly systemic series of tremors emitting from the steps of some unknown behemoth seemed to be approaching Mako's location. The booms propelled his entire body off the ground into the fur of the slumbering. Despite the powerful quivers of each footfall, the monster did not move, he noted. \"Perhaps, it's dead.\", he whispered. He attempted to crawl of the beast and get into his signature fighting stance...but he could neither keep his balance nor estimate from which the direction the behemoth was approaching. All he knew was that, judging by the sheer force of its footsteps, this monstrosity was immense, much more immense than anything he's ever faced before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the quakes ceased...and a sudden feeling of weightlessness lifted Mako's entire world. He quickly grasped the tangles in the monster's fur and held on as a mysterious force lifted the beast up into a blinding beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the morning sunlight crept through the bamboo blinds into her apartment and hit her drowsy eyelids, Korra jumped out of her bed; she was late for training. Without a moment's thought, she threw on her matted blue sweatpants and undershirt. Her turquoise eyes scanned the room for her sheepskin boots. She spotted one lying next to Naga's bed on its side. She grabbed it and threw it onto her mattress, searching now for its sister. After hastily searching the room for it, she finally noticed the other sitting upright on her dresser. \"God, I'm an idiot.\", she sighed as she jogged over to the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta do whatever I can to be late.\", she sarcastically remarked to herself as she reached into the confides of the boots, hoping that she left her white socks inside. Surely enough, she felt the worn fabric of the tube socks and pulled them out of the boot. Right as she lifted the socks out of the boot, a subtle fragrance wafted into her nostrils. \"Whew!\", she remarked, turning her head away from the soiled footwear, \"You guys seriously need a wash.\" Without a second thought, Korra pulled the dingy socks over her muscular calves and rushed over to her boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being one for proper hygiene, Korra had worn these socks for...well...she lost count about five days ago. \"Being the Avatar takes its toll on one's time.\", she reasoned. This particular morning was just one of many where she found herself bolting out the door with little disregard (if any) for her appearance and hygiene. Today in particular was going to be an especially busy day: she had probending training in 30 minutes, a meeting in Ba Sing Se at 9:30, more training at noon, and finally, a picnic date in Summer Lotus Woods with Asumi. Korra had no time to lose, especially to worry about something as mundane as the condition of her socks; it was not like anyone was going to smell her feet anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nThe sheer enormity of his friend/former lover sent a shiver down Mako's spine. He had faced countless foes before that had towered over him: the Dark Avatar, Kuvira's Mecha, etc....but this.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep gulp as a turquoise iris the size of the moon gazed indifferently upon his insignificance. Previously, in his dream (which at this point, he started thinking that it might not have been a dream), he was roughly the size of a mouse (about four inches tall). However, judging by the scale of Korra and her sock relative to him, he estimated his height to be on par with ants. \"No\", he thought fearfully, \"she would notice an ant on her sock...I must be no bigger than a flea for her not to notice me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe harnessed all of the power he could into his left hand, and with it, launched an meteor-sized conflagration towards Korra. \"Hopefully, this will get her atten-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a fleeting second, as she was putting on her right sock, she saw a minuscule flash fizzle into the air. Giving him no time to think, Mako held onto the sock as it hurled through the air at an immeasurable speed. As Korra began to pull the sock over her plump toes, Mako lost his grip and tumbled down the expanse of the matted cotton. Her monolithic fingers tugged the fabric over her tan ankle and up to her calf. She wiggled her socked toes as she reached for its sheepskin sheath. Mako, meanwhile, could only hold on as tight as he could to the sweat soaked fibers surrounding the massive toes. Not being able to see the colossal Korra's face and the strong, pungent fragrance of cheesy corn chips indicated to him that he was currently located beneath Korra's toes. Mako's entire world darkened as Korra sheathed her right foot inside its warm, fuzzy home. As the sock made contact with the unkempt sheepskin sole, the fibers began to devour Mako. He felt himself sinking deeper and deeper into Korra's worn, sweaty sock until finally, all but his face and upper torso were consumed by the cotton entity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, he had pondered whether or not this sock was a monster; now, he realized that his hypothesis was much more on-the-nose than he thought. His plight only grew worse as he was suddenly met with unfathomable amounts of cotton; Korra scrunched her socked toes within the boot. The putrid scent began to soak into his clothes as Korra's sock, like a sponge filled with water, began to unload its perspiration onto its captive prey. <br>\r\nFinally, Korra stood to her full height, smother Mako beneath her astronomically immense weight, in between the sweat-drenched fibers of her worn sock and the scruffy fur of her old Water Tribe slipper boot. \"All set.\", he heard his new goddess boom and felt the seismic tremor caused by her left foot stepping down. He then felt weightless as Korra lifted her right boot. As she took her step, her foot slammed down upon him with unimaginable fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna a long day.\", they both thought to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mako was hers now, and she loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra let her tiny fall to the bed. She moved her foot until it loomed above him so he could get an up close and personal view while she took her socks off. She could only imagine his terror as her beautiful bronze soles came into view.

The motion made the mattress unstable and Mako fell to his knees. Korra smirked again and was sorely tempted to lower her foot onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo a good job, and you will be rewarded. Do a bad job and I may just have to squish you.\u201d She widened her grin and moved Mako directly into the shadow of her foot. \u201cI own you now, little man.

She was garbed in the traditional airbender clothes: Poofy, loose fitting yellow shirt and pants with brown shoes and a small red shawl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jinora!  Down on the floor!\"  Mako cried up to the towering teen, but it was ineffective.  Jinora's attention was completely focused on the novel held in her hand.  Mako's cries fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinora continued down the hallway, Mako realized he was missing out what might be his best chance at salvation.  Thinking quickly, he ran out into the path of the brown boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this, but you've left me with no choice.\"  Mako took a deep breath, and as the foot descended over his tiny form, he released a blast of fire at her sole.  It was a powerful shot, guaranteed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, it didn't.  All the fire Mako produced dissipated harmlessly against the shoe, and Jinora's step continued unobstructed.  Too late, Mako realized how insignificant he truly was.  The foot drove into him, smashing him against the floor and knocking him out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering over her book, Jinora took a glance at the floor.  Her step had ended up on something tiny on the floor, and she wanted to know what it was.  Marking her place in the novel and setting it aside, Jinora crouched and took a look.  It seemed like a little doll.  The doll was extremely tiny, thinner than her tattoo arrows were wide.  Picking it up, she noticed a striking resemblance to that firebending boy Korra used to work with...  Mako.  It was probably a figurine based off of the Fire Ferrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora's fist closed over the toy.  Her outfit was lacking in pockets, so she'd have to carry it until she found its owner.  Was it Korra's?  She didn't seem to be one to miss the past, but she did love her pro-bending days.  Maybe it was Ikki's.  She loved collecting dolls and things, and if it was related to Korra's romance, it was all the more interesting to her.  Of course, Jinora <i>really</i> wanted to get back to her book.  She could just toss the ridiculous toy to a corner of her room until someone asked her about it.  </span></div></div>",

His skin felt like it'd been coated in a layer of cold sweat, and he had a feeling that it wasn't his.  Taking in his surroundings, Mako realized he wasn't in the hallway anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was sparsely decorated, and the few items adorning the wall were all related to airbending history.  There was a small model of Avatar Aang's blue glider, a painted picture of Avatar Yangchen, and a scroll with a quote from some long-dead guru who Mako probably never heard of.  And, sitting on her bed with her legs tucked up to her chin was Jinora, still as giant as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Mako ran up to the side of the bed.  It towered over him.  It would take hours to climb, assuming Mako wouldn't get tired or Jinora wouldn't get up.  At the foot of the bed was Jinora's discarded brown boots, standing straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako jogged over to them, and a plan started forming in his head.  The boots were tall, yes, but not as tall as the bed.  He could use firebending to get onto them, and could then easily finish the climb to the top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako keeled down.  His fighting style was up close and personal, and he didn't need to be a rocket very often.  He'd only get one shot at this, and he didn't want to muck it up.  Firebending comes from the breath; Mako breathed out and blasted the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little rocketman shot up into the air.  The boots rushed past him as he reached incredible heights, before his inevitable fall.  Looking down, he saw the unending void that was the boot of a little girl.  Screaming in terror, he reached out wildly, trying to grab anything that would halt his fall into shoe-zilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why Team Avatar never lets Mako come up with plans.</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, Mako spits out the putrid taste and tries to see how screwed he is.  Soaked in sweat that wasn't his, trapped in a shoe that was much bigger than him, and no one knew anything about him?  Poor Mako was doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, tiny Mako decides he should look around for an escape route.  First and foremost: Can he get out the way he came in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako set his hand against the side of the shoe.  Smooth, with no purchase for climbing.  And he couldn't just rocket out, since he'd likely set the shoe on fire as he attempted to escape.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning about, Mako peered down into the furthest depths of the boot.  Lighting a small flame for a light source, Mako peered down the tunnel.  At his current size, Mako would have to crawl to go there.  It'd leave him vulnerable if Jinora decides to wear the boot, but it might be the only way to get out.  Getting on his hands and knees, Mako ventured onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell only got worse as he went forward.  Jinora wasn't a tomboy by any extension of the word, but even her feet would stink after hours of airbending.  And these boots were clearly not new; Mako could see the depression caused by her sole.  In fact, Mako could see how he ranked in size next to the dark imprint of her sole!  If he needed to, he could most likely fit under her arch or between her toes and the ball of her foot, and he would live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside of his new found prison, Mako heard the sound of a temple door sliding open.  Soft foot steps padded past the boot, and Mako's heart jumped into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, do you mind helping me for a second?  Rohan got his kite stuck in a tree, and he can't airbend yet.  Could you get it for him?\"  That voice belonged to Pema, Jinora's kindly mother.  \"Sure.

Although that book really wanted to be read, she had promised to help.  She just didn't think it'd take quite so long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn airbender steps lightly, like the calm wind on a summer day.  This was Mako's salvation, for the weight of Jinora was massive and his body was weak.  Yes, her steps hurt him, pressing his body into the unrelenting flesh every time the foot went down, but he shuddered to think of how he'd fare under Asami's feet.  Her quick steps would flatten him out in seconds.  Or worse, if he was under Korra's foot, he'd be ground to a pulp immediately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't very good down here, either.  Jinora was a fourteen year old girl, well on her way through puberty.  Mako would almost prefer to be under Ikki's sole; sure, she was spring loaded, but at least she wouldn't be sweating as much.  Jinora's foot was practically gushing as she stepped, and each swing of her leg sloshed Mako in it.  The foot went up, and Mako was pushed into the insole, marinating in old juices.  The foot went down, and Mako was pushed into the actual foot, the source of the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway down the hall, Jinora stopped.  She tapped her foot, giving Mako a quick battering.  She thinks to herself, <i>If I glide over there, it'll be a whole lot faster than walking...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding back to her room, Jinora opens the little closet.  In her left hand, she grabbed her Airbending glider; in her right, she had the wingsuit.  The glider would be faster, since she wouldn't have to change clothes, but the wingsuit was way more comfortable.  Peering at the closed book laying on her bed, she made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

He sighs, happy he didn't fuck it up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he struggles to pull himself up, Mako can't help but get a whiff of the shoe.  It wasn't terrible, per se, but it was obvious that a foot spent time in there.  Mako was glad he didn't have to spend time with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was out of the shoe, it was a simple matter to climb the bedsheets and summit the bed.  There, Mako found Jinora.  She hadn't bothered to change out of her airbending robes, choosing only to remove her shoes.  Engrossed in her book, Jinora sat with her back to the wall, knees tucked under her chin and book only inches from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jinora!  It's Mako!  You know, Korra's friend?  I could really use some help here.\"  Not a single iota of recognition crossed her face; her expression still showed her enraptured by her story.  Mako was gonna have to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of him was Jinora's massive feet.  Stepping a little closer, Mako couldn't stop himself from noticing how soft they looked.  Experimentally, Mako reached out and touched a toe.  In response, all five toes and that foot curled in, away from him.  He giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head, Mako could hear Chief Beifong's voice scolding him.  \"Enough lollygagging.  Get to work Mako, or I'll be assigning you to toilet duty for the next three years.\"  Mako lit a flame in his palm.  He could easily give the girl a little burn, nothing much, to get her attention.  But was that the best choice?  Wouldn't she just lash out instead of looking for a tiny firebender?  Maybe he could climb her, try to get to her book where she could she him.  It might not be the safest choice, but it'd be helluva lot nicer than blasting her.</span></div></div>",

Her pants seemed to be a cream-colored silk. You knew it was silk, because Asami was sitting on you, and sweating, and the silk was not that absorbent. From your (admittedly poor) vantage point of the room, it had been heavily redecorated. She was rich, and that was to be expected. Asami twisted on her bed, putting her feet up, and just relaxed on the coolness of the bed. It had been a long day of training. You, on the other hand, were busy trying to decide what to do. If you got her attention, she might help, but, then again, she probably wouldn't like your currently being under her butt. It was dark and damp between the amazingly flexible bed and her sweaty pants. The weight, you realize, ought to have smashed you into chunky salsa by now. Maybe being small had something to do with it. You had no time to think about it, though, as Asami--who seemed pretty OK by now--got up. From the window, you could tell it was evening. You heard a door open. Next thing you knew, you were in a very white space. The bathroom, you realize. You saw Asami's delicately manicured finger grab hold of her pants.

Today Asami was going to show Korra and Lin a new invention that was in its testing stage. The invention is a shrink ray that will be used by the New Republic Police to shrink down criminals for easier arrests. As they almost made to the room Lin mentions how its pretty warm today and she asks Asami if its ok to be walking around barefoot. Asami says yes and Lin's boots retract revealing her sweaty bare feet, Korra thinks to herself on how she doesn't want to be near those feet. Finally all three of them make it to the room in which the shrink ray was being held and Korra noticed how big it was. Asami explained how it worked and that since it was still a prototype it could only shrink and not regrow, but they will fix that problem she assured. So Asami leads Korra and Lin towards another room but Korra asks if its ok for her to stay and look at the ray a little more. Asami tells Korra yes and so she takes a better look at it while Asami and Lin leave the room. As Korra continues to look over the shrink ray she unknowingly bumps the button that turns on the machine and as she walks away from it she is hit by a beam created by it. Korra begins to notice the world around was getting larger and larger, in which she realizes she is getting smaller and smaller. When she finally stops shrinking she sees how unimaginably large everything has become. What she didn't know was the machine was set to its smallest setting, so now Korra only stands at the height of 1/10th millimeters. Before she could take everything in thunderous footsteps could be heard coming into the room. Korra turns around to the doorway and sees a massive pare of feet enter the room. She knew whoever it was didn't know what happened and would be unaware of micro sized Korra. The massive pair of feet were...</span></div></div>",

She would get her girl by the end of the day no matter what, she had denied her crush on the beautiful and solid (not to mention extremely curvy) Avatar for too long, even Jinorra noticed and the girl only got her head out a book to put it between Opal's thighs. Seriously everyone but Korra seemed to notice her not so secret crush on the girl, now was her time to break the cycle and seduce her way to getting Korra to notice her. She grinned widely as she slipped into a thin lacy scrap of fabric that just about counted as underwear and struggled her way into her tight pants, which made her ass look wonderfully squeezable. The things she did for love<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Asami's squirming and bouncing moved Korra around in her bra, the shrunken Avatar now finding herself pressed against her slowly hardening nipple, her body damp from the water still clinging to Asami's skin after her shower. It was this dampness that gave her some ideas of escape though: either she can use her wet, slightly slick body to slide out of Asami's bra and try get her attention another way... or she could use her bending on the water, freezing it and getting the giant's attention and hopefully assistance that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which is it?</span></div></div>",
