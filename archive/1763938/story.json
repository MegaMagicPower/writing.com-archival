Here, you can date anyone you wish: Go to parties, sparr with them, have a night with them - virtually anything you want to do here is permissible. There are, however, just a few things that are not allowed:<br>\r\nManslaughter (unless you're dealing with Hallows), rape, molestation, drug use, robbery, or excessive swearing will not be tolerated lightly. If you feel compelled to perform any of these acts, make sure you first negotiate with one of our BDS managers, or you could be confined to the Repentence Cell within the Soul Society where, upon arrival, officials will spend anywhere from three days to a month on deciding what the according punishment will be. (Just ask Rukia. She'll tell you.)<br>\r\nNow that we have clarified on how we expect you to be have, let's take a look inside.<br>\r\nOur available candidates were hand selected just for this Service in order to provide you the maximum level of entertainment that you yourself expect or wish to be fulfilled, and we can proudly and confidently assure you that you will not be disappointed.<br>\r\nFirst, are you male or female?</span></div></div>",

Sexual scenes are allowed, but try not to go overboard with the details. Sorry, but I want this to <i>stay</i> 18+. Besides, there might be little kids that watch the show!<br>\r\n2. Please keep the mature language to a minimum (or at least try). Again, it's a content matter.<br>\r\n3. ONLY CORRECT SPELLING, GRAMMAR, AND PUNCTUATION ARE ALLOWED!!! (I cannot stand bad writing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the rules you must follow, period. And try to make it as detailed as possible.
