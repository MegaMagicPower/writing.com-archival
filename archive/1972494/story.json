You look over at the gunner Ingram who surprisingly is still asleep despite you and Peter yelling over the radio, \"Hey Ingram wake up\" you say while you shake him awake. \"What , we there already?\" he asks sleepily, \"No we're just outside the town line\" Miller responds. \" Alright, I'm up\" Ingram says while he tries to stretch inside the cramped turret. \"Hey, load up a HEAT round since we're most likely going to be doing urban combat alright?\" Says Miller, \"right one HEAT round coming up.\" you respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomp on the pedal on the floor and open up the door that reveals the rounds for the tanks main gun, you reach in and grab a HEAT round from the rack, turn around, and slam the round home inside the breach. You successfully load the round as the breach block rises up and locks the round in place, you reach beside you and arm the main gun and yell\"UP\" so that the gunner knows that the gun is loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey head topside and see whats wrong with the antenna I think someone forgot to un hook it from the turret\" says Miller, \"Roger\" you reply. You look up and push open the hatch above your head and climb out on to the tank and look and see the main antenna is in fact still tied down, you carefully crawl over to the antenna because the tank is still moving, slowly, but still moving. After unhooking the antenna you begin to walk back over to your hatch and radio down that the antenna has been freed. Just before you open that hatch to get back in there is a sudden pain in your right shoulder and an invisible force knocks you off the turret, \"Miller halt, I got hit by and fell-----\" before you could finish you see your tank explode in a bright, hot flash of fire that sent you flying backwards you lay there looking at the sky numb. Slowly the pain from your shoulder comes into focus, then slowly you feel a new pain in your left calve, you manage to sit up and see a long shard of metal sticking right where you feel the pain. You look over and see what remains of the tank siting there burning, unrecognizable, you begin to look around to see if anyone managed to survive, but you know the chances were less than small. you fall back onto the grown and look back at the sun and close your eyes, feeling its warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you sit up from your bed quickly and look around you room and see no one else, \" damn dream again\" you say to yourself, you look over and see its 4:00 in the morning, \"well thats enough sleep for one day\" you say as you get up and decide...........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get up and get on your jogging gear, PT belt, Pt shorts, running shoes, a t shirt and head out. You stand outside and start to stretch so you don't pull a muscle, taking extra care to stretch out your healed wound on your left calve, and start jogging around the perimeter of the base. The base in which you are stationed is about four miles if you don't run around the airfield, and you usually run 5 miles and you know that from your room to the squad bay is about half a mile, you figure one lap around the base, to the squad bay and back should be good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out on your jog going at a reasonable pace making sure you don't get hit by whatever vehicles might be moving around, your first lap went pretty well as you come up to your living quarters, \"now just to the squad bay and back then I'm done\" you think to yourself. As you run up to the Squad bay and turn around some one comes jogging out from one of the many crossroads and run right in front of you, you brace yourself for the crash, \"Ow\" you both say as you collide and fall to the ground. You continue to roll two more times before coming to a stop on your back, \" you alright?\" you ask to the other runner, \"yeah I'm fine\" you hear the voice, clearly female. You get up and walk over and help her up, as you pull her up the light reveals her face and you recognize her as Sheila, a kitsune that seems to be locked onto you since you got here one week ago. She was also like you wearing running gear, shorts that showed her red/brown fur on her legs, that changed to black near her feet, but unlike you she wore a sweatshirt instead of a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed she was looking at your legs, more specifically your left calve, \"what happened to y-----\", \"Shrapnel\" you reply answering her question before she could finish asking it. \"oh, sorry its just that I've seen an injury like that before\" she says quietly, \"Its alright to ask I'm not going to get upset about you asking.\" you tell her. \"If I may ask, is that the only one?\" she inquires, \" no I've got one on my right shoulder from a bullet\" as you say this you pull back the collar of your shirt to reveal the bullet wound on your shoulder and showed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at the wound and doesn't say anything, after what feels like hours she finally says \"sorry to ask about your injuries\" she say with her head bent over, \" hey I said its ok and that I'm not mad about you asking, you were curious and so you asked, there's nothing wrong with that.\" you tell her, and on hearing that she raises her head to look at you. \"ok\" she says, \"ok well I better go take a shower and get dressed before it gets too bright out\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both say you goodbyes and head your separate ways. What now?</span></div></div>",

You knew this day would happen sometime because these living quarters were designed for three people to live in them, not for one person only. You walk inside and throw the paper on your bed and then head to the shower to clean off from your run, you get out and put on a set of combat fatigues followed by your sidearm on your right leg, you grab your patrol cap and walk down to the mess to get some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a tray of food and take a seat near the back of the mess away from everyone else and begin eating. You see something in the corner of your eye making you look up from your food and see your squad leader sitting across the table from you. First sergeant Paul Grimes was a male anthro wolf about your height, and if you had to guess, had been in the service three years longer than you. \"Morning First sergeant\" you say as he sits down, \"I just got word that we might be heading out on a patrol sometime today, so I need you to head down to the armory and sign out your rifle and hold on to it for the day, but if  05:00 tomorrow rolls around and we don't go, bring it back.\" he says, \"ok, off topic question, do you know anything about me getting a roommate?\" you ask him, he starts to shake his head, but stops, \"actually yes, we got a new platoon in and so we had to give people roommates to make space\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up from the table and leaves, you finish your breakfast in quiet and then leave toward the armory to retrieve your rifle. You grab your rifle and head to the range to practice for a little and then after that the day was the usual routine except you had your empty rifle slung around your chest, it made doing things like your laundry a little difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*later that day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake on your bed from a short nap, you look at your clock and it said 17:45(5:45), \"they should have specified what time my roommate was getting here\" you think to yourself. You reach over and pick up your rifle and walk over to your desk, you roll out a rubber mat and pull out some cleaning tools and begin taking the rifle apart to clean it. You put in some earbuds and listen to your music while you work, you remove the bolt assemble and take it apart then you wipe off all the grease then take a metal brush and start cleaning off all the carbon from the piston head. After brushing away built up carbon for a few hours you fell a tap on your shoulder, you pull out an earbud and turn around to see Sheila standing there, \"do you need something?\" you ask, \"no\" she says, \"so what is it then?\" you ask confused, \"I'm your new roommate,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" you say surprised, \" well take any bed you want except mine\" you say, she nods and throw her gear on the bed across from yours, you turn back to your rifle and finish cleaning it, you put it back together and walk over to your locker and store it in there making sure to lock the door. You walk into the bathroom to clean the grease and carbon flakes off your hands, as you walk out you see that Sheila has already finished unpacking, \"I'm heading to the mess for dinner, want to come?\" you ask, \"I'll be down later she says. You shrug and leave toward the mess hall and grab some food in a to-go box and head back to your room so that you are not that far from your rifle if you get called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your quarters and see that your new roommate wasn't here so you walk over to your desk and throw your feet up on the desk, you open your laptop and put in headphones and start a movie to watch while you eat. Half way through the movie you finish eating, as you finish the rest of the movie you begin to feel tired so you close the laptop and flop down on your bed and drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You sit up and unlock your locker to grab your rifle, vest, and helmet, you look over and see your roommate was still asleep, \"what about her?\" you ask quietly, Grimes looks over and recognizes who it is, \"she's in fourth squad, only first, second and our squads are going\" he says. You follow him out to the squad bay where first, second, and third squads were loading up on equipment and ammo, you walk over to your squad and start gearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimes walks over to the other squad leaders and starts talking to them, \"whats going on?\" you ask one of the corporals named James. James was the only one other human in the squad and the only other one, besides Grimes, that you socialized with, you both graduated from the same school, but two years apart. \"I think there is a change in plans\" he says, after he said this the three squad leaders called every one over, Grimes steps forward from the other two squad leaders, \"change in plans,we're not going on patrol instead we have to escort a small resupply convoy out to two outposts\" he says, \"we will be traveling in MRAPs due to the fact that these roads have been known to have IEDs on them so be ready for anything, third squad will be in the lead vehicle, followed by first squad in the middle of the convoy and second on rear guard\" he adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any questions, ok then load up and lets move out\" says one of the other squad leaders, you James and the rest of your squad walk outside to the convoy waiting outside and climb into the massive MRAP in front of the convoy. You sit down in the first seat near the rear door, James and the rest of the squad sit in the rest of the seats in the rear of the MRAP.  As soon as the last member of your squad climbed in you reached out and closed the rear door, sealing it, as soon as the door clicked shut the MRAP lurched into motion and one of the other soldiers in the MRAP climbed up into the turret and readied the M2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip ahead*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the mission was going smoothly, no one had tried to shoot at the convoy on the way to the first out post, but on the way to the second one people had started throwing some rocks at the trucks. Now you were climbing back into the MRAP for the last time for the return trip to the base, this time the convoy consisted of the three MRAPs the cargo trucks were staying at the outposts. \"Alright lets get out of here\" says the driver as your truck takes the lead again down the road leading into the outpost, you continue down this road for two hours before James leads forward in his seat, \"so I hear you have a new roommate\" he says, you nod \" yeah its going to take time getting used to having one\" you tell him, \"so whats his name?\" he asks. \"First off my roommate is a she and her name is--\" before you could finish there was a loud explosion followed by your MRAP rolling over multiple times before coming to a rest on its right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still strapped to your seat, sitting there dazed for a minute before you realized what happened, you look up and see James unconscious also strapped into his seat. You look to your right and see the other members in your squad beginning to unstrap themselves and check each other for injuries, \"status?\" you hear Grimes yell from the front of the MRAP, \"I got one with a broken arm\" says the squad medic, he runs over and checks James, \"and one K.O'd possible concussion\" he adds. You attempt to unstrap yourself, but the buckle wouldn't come undone so you pulled out your knife and began cutting at the straps to free yourself. You manage to finally cut yourself free and walk over to the rear door and attempt to open it, but it wouldn't budge, \"this door's jammed\" you yell over your shoulder, as you turn around you can hear the sounds of rounds clanking off the roof on the MRAP followed by the sounds of the other two MRAPs' M2 heavy machine guns returning fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your other squad mates pushes on the left side door and manages to get it open, he climbs out and reaches down to start helping the rest of the squad out. You make your way towards the door and toss your rifle to him and climb out, he hands your rifle back to you. Outside the MRAP you see the real how bad the damage was, all the wheels were blown off the truck and it had rolled off the road and into a small ditch on the left side of the road.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly you hear the sound of helicopter rotors getting close, you turn around and barely make out the outlines of two Apache gunships headed toward your direction. The clank of a bullet brings your attention back to the firefight, you let off a couple more shots before you hear multiple rounds hit right above your head making you dive behind the MRAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back in the direction of the gunships in time to see them open up with their 30mm chain guns and Hydra rockets. You look back at the mountain side where the shooting was coming from to see it explode in a shower of rock and dust. As the dust starts to settle you notice there's no more shooting, \"well we either killed them all or scared the rest away\" says one of your squad mates. The gunships continue to fly overheard, but at a slower patrol like speed, searching for any more combatants that might be hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes the gunships leave and two Blackhawk helicopters land followed by a chinook helicopter, those who were injured were loaded in one and everyone else was placed in the second while the two functioning MRAPs drove back to the base. \"What about the wrecked truck?\" you ask Grimes, \"that chinook is going to pick it up and take it back to base so they can try to repair it\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later the Blackhawks were touching down back at the base and you were walking toward the squad bay to store your rifle and ammo, but you took your helmet, body armor and sidearm with you to be stored back at your bunk. You walk into your living quarters and see Sheila sitting on her bunk reading, as soon as you walk in she looks up from her book for a minute then goes back to reading. She does a double take and puts her book down, \"are you ok?\" she asks sounding concerned, \"yeah why?\" you ask confused, you notice she was looking at your helmet, so you take your helmet off and look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw shocked you, there were three bullet holes along the front left side of the helmet, but none of them passed through the kevlar. \"Well that would have ruined my day\" you tell her, \"well I guess your just lucky\" she says, \"you think this is bad?... follow me\" you say. You walk back to the airfield with Sheila following you with a confused look on her face, as you walk up to the airfield the Chinook carrying the wrecked MRAP had just unloaded the wreck and was beginning to land. \"Were you in that?\" she asks pointing to the MRAP, you nod, \"you really are lucky\" she adds.</span></div></div>",

You walk over to the buffet line, grab a tray and get some food and a coffee, you go and find a table to yourself near the back of the mess hall. You begin eating your breakfast and enjoying your coffee in silence, you look around the room and see only about four other soldiers in the mess, not counting the cooks behind the buffet. \"What are you doing up so early?\" you hear a female voice behind you and on reflex you reach for your sidearm, but catch yourself before turning around and see it was Sheila, a kitsune who seemed to have her eyes on you since you were transferred here, the reason why she likes you is beyond you. She was staring at you as if she was looking for something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep\" you tell her, she continues to stare at you. You slowly bring up your hand an snap your fingers in front of her eyes, but that does nothing. She reaches up and pushes your hand down and continues to stare at you, \"you ok?\" you ask, confused. She snaps out of her stare \"Yeah\" she answers, sounding defeated. \" Um ok, I gotta go\" you tell her as you get up to take care of your tray and cup.

You're normally never this jumpy.\" He asks. \"Yeah I'm fine just thinking\" you reply, \"still can't read his mind?\" he asks, \"Yeah it's like there's nothing there, no thoughts, no memories flashing through his mind, nothing.

In two weeks you learned how to range and fire just about any type of sniper rifle, how to create a shooting nest with your surroundings, how to set diversions and traps, navigating while under fire, and how to make you own ghillie suit for both you and the rifle. You look over and see Sheila still asleep on one of the other beds in your room, McKnight suggested that since you two will be working together a lot that you should both sleep, eat, and practice together. The first week was different for you because you usually sleep and ate alone, but after a while it didn't seem to bother you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheila, get up.\" you say as you shake her awake, but as you do this one of her tails slaps your hand away, \"Sheila get up its 3:30 and McKnight said we needed to be at the range by 4, so get up.\" you tell her, but again her tail slaps away your hand. \"alright you've left me no choice\" you say as you grab the bed and tilt it so that she rolls out onto the floor. She quickly stands up and glares at you \"What'd you do that for?\" she says \" we have to get to the range or we'll be late, you don't want to be late to the last training practice before you graduate do you?\" you answer back. After you say this she looks at the clock and swears, \" alright, let get going then.\" she says as she hurries to get dressed and ready for the last practice for becoming a shooting pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run into the bathroom and shave quickly, \"no time to shower,\" you think to yourself. Quickly you put on your combat fatigues, boots, sidearm, and grap your bag, which over these two weeks has all your sniper equipment in it. You turn around and see Sheila grabbing her spotter bag and running over to you, you look at your watch and see 3:40, \"we're cutting it tight\" you tell her \"but i think if we hurry we'll be fine\". You both literally leave the living quarters as a run and make it to the range just as your watch says 4:00. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well did you think that because it was the last day of training that I was going to let you sleep in?\" says McKnight \"No way Master sergeant\" you both answer, \"good, today I will be testing you in sniper-on-sniper warfare, you will hunt and be hunted by the very thing you are training to be. If you pass this test you will graduate as a sniper team, clear?\" says McKnight \"Very clear Master sergeant\" you both answer again, \"And to make things very difficult, I am going to be that sniper that will be hunting you.\" says McKnight, \"roger that Master sergeant\" you both answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you will be loaded on a Humvee and dropped of at a location, further instructions will be given to you on the way, the two ways to win are simple take out the sniper, or get to your objective undetected, simple right?\" says McKnight \"Yes Master sergeant\" you and Sheila yell. \"Good, get you gear and load up.\" says McKnight, he waits until you both are leaving in the Humvee and turns around and gets in his Humvee and leaves.</span></div></div>",

This new rifle surprises you as you have never used this rifle except in training, in your opinion its a good rifle, but your more of a semi-auto rifle than a bolt-action. You check the ammo and see instead of regular rounds your using simunition, basically paint bullets that hurt when you get hit, but are relatively harmless. The other passenger in the Humvee tells you that you after they drop you off, head north for 5 miles then head west for another 5 miles to get to the objective, seems simple right? \"can't be this easy\" you think, you look over at Sheila and she looks at you and from the look on her face she's thinking the same thing. \"one other thing,\" he adds \" you have a time limit of up to two days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both begin the process of camouflaging yourselves and your rifles, by the time you are done you are dropped off and begin to run in the direction they told you, you keep running until you can't see the Humvee anymore. You both come to a top near some bushes and get down low tho the ground to discuss your plan. \"I don't like this, there's no way it can be that easy, there have to be guards or patrols out looking for us plus McKnight to deal with.\" you tell her and she nods her head in agreement, \"I think that there going to have other type of traps set up for us so keep a look out for snares or flare traps.\" she says. \"Their most likely going to be using anthros in the patrols to try to smell you out, sorry no offense you humans do have a distinct smell\" she says, \" No thats fine I brought some charcoal to cover my scent.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check you compass and find north, \"Alright lets get going, I know I'm pushing it, but I want to try to get to the top of that mountain before noon,ok?\" you tell her \"yeah, no thats good then we should be able to see down and try to spot any patrols nearby.\" she say nodding her head in agreement. You both start moving toward the mountain, grabbing some of the surrounding plants and feeding them into your ghillie suits to increase your camouflage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later you have just reached the beginning of the mountain, \"well I think we're making good time, don't you think?\" you ask, \"yeah I hope it stays that way\" says Sheila as you begin to ascend the mountain. \"let me know if you need to stop for any reason, ok?\" you tell Sheila and she nods \"same to you\" she says, two hours later you both stop to check the map again and to catch your breath, it seems that this mountain is a lot bigger that you first expected,\" hey Sheila\" you call her over to look at the map \"yeah what is it?\" she asks \"well I was checking the map and I realized that the top of this mountain is the half way point\", \"yeah so?\" she says \"well if its half way then I think we are going to start encountering patrols soon so just be ready.\" you say, she nodes her head, \"ok I'll keep my eyes out for 'em\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both pack up and resume your climb you looked at your watch and say it said 9:30, pretty good time considering you were about half way up the mountain and you both missed breakfast this morning. You look at the bags that the soldier in the Humvee handed you and find it held about a day and a half's worth of food for both of you, \"well I think well stop for a little meal break, what do you say?\" you ask Sheila, \"yeah thats sound good\" she answers. You both sit down and open a MRE to eat for now, not the whole thing, but just something to tide you over till you reach the top. While you sit and yea you aslo dig out you shooting glove, your old crewmen gloves that have the trigger finger tip cut off, and put them on because you noticed it was getting colder as you went up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of resting, you both resume the long climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you both make it to the top on time?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shrug and continue walking looking for a place to stay the night and still remain hidden from any night time patrols. You find a small, but suitable area underneath some tree roots that provide a hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila manage to squeeze in between the roots and still have room to store your bags, \"well this is going to be tight on sleeping space.\" you tell her, at this she simply shrugged. \"Alright I'm going to set up some traps to help protect us during the night.\" you say slipping out with nothing but your sidearm, knife and some trip line.<br>\r\n*later that night*<br>\r\nYou return from setting up some snares and other traps to create noise and slow down any approaching patrols. As you approach the roots you see Sheila sitting there with her rifle pointed outward, keeping watch until you returned, \"all set\" you tell her as you squeeze back under the tree. Sheila simply nods, <br>\r\nand stares at the direction you just came for a little bit longer, then sets her rifle at an angle that she can get to it easily should a patrol come this way. You lay on the semi- hard ground and use you bag for a makeshift pillow,and tuck your arms in you armpits to stay warm. Despite having on two layers, your fatigues and ghillie suit, you still were cold and you didn't bring and type of blanket because you weren't expecting to be sleeping on a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila notices your shivering and lays next to you, even though its a big sleeping hole you both still will have to lay next to each other, \"you alright?\" she asks \"yeah just a little cold, nothing serious\" you tell here through chattering teeth \"well I can solve that\" she says \"What do you mean?\" you hope she was smarter than you and brought something to cover with, but she didn't, instead she slide her tails through her ghillie suit and wraps them around you and hugs you close to her, \"Wha--\" was all you could say before she shushed you, \"don't fight it, its the only way for you to stay warm through the night.\" she tells you, you have to admit it was keeping you warm, but it was such a weird sensation when her tails first started wrapping around you. You stop resisting and accept that even if you tried you couldn't get out of her tails grip. \"Alright just this once I guess\" you tell her, at this she just giggles, slowly you fall asleep still wrapped up in her warm tails and begin to dream........</span></div></div>",

She slowly open her eyes and then she sees you looking at her, \"well good morning handsome\" she says smiling at you, \"Good morning honey\" you say sarcastically, mocking her, she laughs, but then she goes quiet and looks over your shoulder toward the entrance of the sleeping hole. \"What is--\" you start to whisper, but she puts her finger/claw on your lips silencing you. She slowly removes her tails from around you and back under her ghillie suit,\"probably a good idea, if there was some one out there, don't want to be caught tied up\" you think to yourself, she continues to look out, ears twitching. Slowly you begin to reach for your sidearm, which is next to your bag, you grab it and get ready to use it if needed, Sheila is slowly reaching for her rifle which is on the other side of the hole, she grabs it with one of her tails and begins to bring it over to where she can grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her rifle up to her shoulder and aims outside and waits, sure enough after waiting for about 30 minutes without moving a patrol walks about five feet in front of the hole you and Sheila were. If it weren't for the ghillie suits, charcoal, and and the ghillie covers on your rifles, they would have spotted you both. You both get ready to take aim should they spot you, after about five minutes they leave, you both mentally breath a sigh of relief, but remain frozen should they return, they don't. Now you both finally relax, \"that was close\" you say, \"too close\" Sheila adds, you nod in agreement, \"alright we should get moving\" you whisper in case that patrol is still around. \"Yeah, I'll go clear outside before we head out\"  whispers Sheila, you nod, she carefully and slowly climbs over you and heads outside with her rifle pressed to her shoulder, she sweeps from left to right and slowly moves outward, ears twitching listening for any sound of a patrol, you sit straight up with your sidearm drawn and wait for her to return. After making sure the surrounding area is clear for now she returns and you both grab your gear and head out, this time heading west, but at a more cautious pace now that you have encountered a patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk for about 2 mile in complete silence, stopping only when needed, you signal to stop because you see something, what is it?</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes and stare down the scope tightening your grip on your rifle, you inhale through your nose and let it out through your mouth, you focus on the sound of your heart beat, \"thump-thump..thump-thump..\" in you chest, again you inhale through your nose and out your mouth, you do this process three more times, slowing your heart rate to around 65 beats per minute. \"thump..thump....*inhale*..thump....thump....*exhale*....thump.....thump...* inhale*.... thump.....*exhale*......*hold*...thump......*pull the trigger*....thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou pull the trigger timing it right between your heat beats, the bullet leaves the chamber at 940 meters/ second hitting the sniper in about two second from when you first pulled the trigger, you finish exhaling as you watch the \"bullet\" hit your target. \"we should get moving, patrols are going to be all over us\" you say as you pick up your rifle and help pack up her spotting scope. You head out going west still intent on reaching the objective, except your moving at a half jog pace. About one mile out you signal you her to drop and freeze, just as you do this a patrol comes running by not 2 feet away from you, but luckily for the charcoal and ghillie suits saving you again because the didn't see you and kept running east probably hoping to find you still at the clearing where you took the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left you paused and waited to see if there was another patrol behind them, but there wasn't, you slowly stand and Sheila follows suit and stands up and you continue on until you spot a small tent about 500 meters out in a wide open field. Cautiously you both crawl out to the tent using what plantation is growing for cover, in sync you both approach and open the tent to see Grimes and McKnight sitting there smiling, McKnight in a paint covered ghillie suit and Grimes in his fatigues, \"congratulations you both passed and exceeded my expectations, nailing me and still making it to the objective under the time limit. I'm impressed with that shot, never heard that coming, didn't see you, nothing.\" says McKnight. You see that you managed to hit him in the chest area, but its hard to tell with the spatter of paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets get you two back home for some food and rest\" says Grimes, all you could do is shake your head as you and Sheila loaded onto the Humvee, \"have fun?\" asks McKnight, but as he looks back behind him your asleep, he turns back around and laughs to himself.</span></div></div>",

You towel off and head over to your locker and put on a clean pair of undershorts and pass out on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You feel a warm sensation crawling onto your body as you lay there, you open your eyes to see it was Sheila laying on you, \"Sheila what did I tell you the night on the mountain?\", \"So\" she answers, you sigh \"fine, but I've only got underwear on this time not a ghillie suit\" you tell her, \"that makes two of us\" she says without lifting her head, you look at her and see that she wasn't lying, that she is in fact in her underwear too. \"You know what, I'm too tired to care\" you whisper as you lay back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sleep for what feels like days because of how mentally exhausted you were, you wake up to Sheila still asleep on top of you with her tails cocooned around you again, you look over at your clock and see it was only 21:30(9:30). You attempt to move a little, but that only causes Sheila to tighten her grip on you a bit more, \"might as try to go back to sleep because I'm not going any place anytime soon\" you think to yourself, you close your eyes again and attempt to fall back to sleep, as you drift off again you faintly feel  Sheila place her head under your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling something wet on the right side of your face, you open your eyes to see Sheila licking you, but she is still asleep, \"hmm thats never happened before,\" thinking back to the night on the mountain. You see the sun starting to rise so you figure to try to wake her up, \"Sheila wake up\", \"mm, tastes good\" you hear her say in her sleep. You look at her, \"alright better wake her before she tries to bite me\" you think \"SHEILA\" you yell, at this she wakes up and looks at you and sees you looking back at her. \"What?\" she says and then she notices the saliva on your face, you see the fur on her face visible change, \"I didn't bite you did I?\" she asks, sounding embarrassed, \" no, but it sounded like you were going to\" you tell her. \"sorry, I didn't say anything did I?\", \"Nope just the face licking and saying I'm tasty\" you tell her, \"why got something you don't want me to hear?\" you ask suspiciously \"No\" she shot back. \"alright, just asking\" you say, \"we'd better get up before someone comes looking for us and walks in and gets the wrong impression\" you say, \"fine\" she says and gets off you and walks over to her locker, as she walks by she playfully hits you in the face with one of her tails, you grab on of your pilliow and throw it at her, but she catches it with her tails and throws it back at you hitting you in the face again. \"Not fair\" you say, she just laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and head to the bathroom to clean your face and to shave. You walk back over to your locker and start to get dressed, you only managed to get your pants and boots before there's a knock on the door, you head over and answer it and its Grimes, he looks at you and sees how your dressed and then at Sheila in the background, then back at you, \"come on Grimes were all adults here, its not what it looks like\" you say, he cracks a rare smile at your response. \"I didn't say anything\" he says, \"but you thought about it and that still counts.\" you tell him, this time he laughs,\"Yes I do suppose that still counts\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, you don't normally come down here?\" you ask, \"well I was wondering if you and Sheila wanted to meet up later for drinks as a celebration for your graduation?\" he says. \"Ooh umm..........\"</span></div></div>",

You towel off and start getting dressed, you look at the clock and see you have about an hour till Grimes shows up, so you decide to take a nap, surprisingly Sheila doesn't climb into your bed again.

Oh this nothing\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could pester more about the photo you both here a horn outside, \"that must be Grimes, he's here early\" Sheila says, seeming no longer interested in the picture.

You all climb into the Humvee, Grimes and Sheila in the front and you in the back behind Grimes, you stare out your window thinking back to the photo in your pocket, \"alright were here\" says Grimes breaking you out of your trance. You turn to see you have arrived at the on base bar for enlisted personnel, you all walk inside and the first thing that hits you is the cigaret smoke, as you walk in you see to your left there is a cork-board on the wall with the words \"Fallen, but not forgotten\" written on the top with pictures of fallen soldiers underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all walk over to the bar and order some type of beer and sit down \"I'll drive back tonight\" you tell them, \"I don't drink much anyways\". You all begin talking about what happened the day you graduated, keeping out the part about Sheila grabbing you with her tails to stay warm, after you finish you beer you order a water to drink, keeping true to your word of being the designated driver. You reach into your pocket and pull out the photo and keep it under the table so Grimes and Sheila don't see it, \"I'll be right back\" you tell them, you get up and head over to the wall of pictures and stand there looking at the other photos, you reach over to the cup next to the wall and pull out a tack and pin your photo to a blank spot on the wall. You turn around and head to the bathrooms at the back of the bar<br>\r\n*Sheila's POV*<br>\r\nYou watch Christopher walk over to the wall and place the piece of paper you saw him pull out earlier, he turns around and heads to the restroom so you wait until he goes into the men's room and then you tell Grimes that you'll be right back, he nods and goes back to his drink. You walk over to see what he put on the wall, you find the photo he placed at look at it. In the picture there was Christopher standing next to three other soldier all standing on or around a Abrams main battle tank with the words \"<i>get some</i>\" written on the turret, all were smiling at the camera, you flip the picture around and see writing saying \" outside Fort Timber,Adjikistan 2008, Christopher, Miller, Peter, and Ingram. 13th Armor division \"Gunmetal\", \". You place the photo back on the wall and walk back over to Grimes \"find something?\" he asks \"no\" you lie.<br>\r\n*Christopher's POV*<br>\r\nYou walk out of the men's room flicking the water off you hands and walk back over to the booth that Grimes and Sheila were sitting at, Sheila notices you \"welcome back, I thought you fell in, I about to go see if you needed rescuing\" she says,grinning. \"I thought foxes, hated getting their fur wet? you say, she laughs, \"not this fox\" she answers back, you shrug. </span></div></div>",

After driving around for and hour Grimes manages to point out his living quarters, you help him up the steps and lay him on the bed, he sits up and points at you \"not a word to anyone else about tonight\" he say in a serious, but slurred voice, \"my lips are sealed\" you tell him, pulling and invisible zipper over your lips, he flops back down on his bed. \"hey I'll hold onto the Humvee for tonight, it'll be outside my living quarters\" you tell him, he simply raises his arm and gives you a thumps up.<br>\r\nYou get back to the Humvee and drive back to your living space with Sheila asleep in the passenger seat, she was also intoxicated, but not as bad as Grimes was, you pull up to you living space and park the Humvee beside the house. You walk over to the passenger side and open the door and put Sheila's arm around your neck and carefully pull her out, you slowly climb the small set of steps and walk into the house, you walk Sheila over to her bed and set her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to leave, but feel something warm and furry grab your arm, you turn to she Sheila had snaked one of her tails around your arm \"are you ok?\" she asks, \"yeah I'm fine, why do you ask?\" you tell her, \"well I saw the photo you posted on the wall\" she says, you sit down on her bed, \"I'd be lying if I said I was surprised at you\" you say. \"*sigh* but I'm not angry at you, you were just looking out for me\" you say, she sits up next to you and slowly brings her other tails around you in a type of hug. \"If you want to talk I'm here you know that\" she says, you nod.

Quietly you walk over to Sheila's bed side and unscrew the cap on the canteen and start to tilt it, you pour a little on her head and instantly she wakes up and tackles you, \"What's the matter, I thought you weren't afraid of water\" you say with a smile, she wraps her tails around your arms and pin them to your sides, \"not what I meant\" she says, \"hang on, your smiling\" she says sounding surprised, \"so I am\" you say. She smiles back at you \"well I know a way to wash that smile off your face,\" she says emphasizing on the word wash, she reaches over and grabs your canteen from were it fell, and proceeds to pour the remaining water over your face. \"Oh n---\" was all you managed to say before you got doused with water, \"Still funny?\" says Sheila, \"I regret nothing\" you reply, she leans down and helps you up, she uses one of her other tails and grabs a towel from her locker and tossed to you, \"here you can use this to clean up\" she says, you wipe your face and then wipe the water off the floor, you toss the towel in the laundry bin outside the bathroom. You walk over to your locker and change out of your wet uniform and into a dry, clean one, \"So what do we have planned today?\" you yell over your shoulder to Sheila, \"We have........\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You walk into the little restaurant and ordered some shawarma for a breakfast/ lunch, while you wait for your food you talk about where your from, \"I grew up in a small town in Maine\" you tell Sheila \" Would you believe me if I told you I grew up in Vermont\" she says, \"I've been there once, it was during the summer when there was 109 degree weather with 97% humidity and no chance of rain\" you tell her \"How about your family?\" you ask \"My mother left when I was born so I never knew her and what I was told was my father was killed in action\" she says very quietly, \"sorry\" you say placing you hand on her paw \"its ok, what about you?\" she asks, \"My mother and father separated when I was young, originally I lived in Pennsylvania, but then I moved to Maine with my mother, I am the oldest of three with two step siblings and a step father\" you tell her<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a little bit more talking you food arrives and you begin eating, \"this is really good\" you say with food in your mouth, \"didn't your mother teach you not to talk with your mouth full?\" says Sheila, you both finish and pay for the food and leave. You begin walking back to the Humvee when suddenly two armed, masked bandit types run out of an alley and grab Sheila, both armed with uzi - type weapons pointed at you \"you move she dies\" the one holding Sheila yelled,Sheila looked at you with the stare she gave you when she first joined your squad, <i>\"I'll twist to the left and get the one on the your right if you get the one holding me\"</i> you hear in your head, she must be using her mind to talk to you, you look at her and nod slowly <i>\"on your go\"</i> you say in your head hoping she heard you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sheila twisted to her left and tackled one of the gunmen, you draw you sidearm and take aim at the other gunmen, the bandit that had Sheila, brought up his weapon and fires first, you fire once hitting him in the head, dropping him instantly, you run over to help Sheila and managed to detain the second bandit, \"you good?\" you ask, \"yeah you?\" she says, \"yeah, nice trick\" you say. You pick up one of the weapons and take out the magazine, you look at the bullets and see the letters AP stamped on the back, this makes you freeze because you are now faintly aware of a pain in your mid-section \"Umm Sheila, I don't think I'm good\" you say as you reach under your armor and pull out a bloody hand, Sheila turns to look at you and sees the blood on your hand she looks at you in shock , you begin to pass out and slump against the nearby wall, before you hit the ground your out cold.</span></div></div>",

You shower, taking care washing near your bandages, shave and get dressed, you and Sheila get in a Humvee and drive to Grimes' living quarters and knock on his door, he opens it and sees you standing there, \"hey I was just going to go find you, I was wondering if you wanted to take a crack at interrogating the bandit\" he says, \"I was going to ask the same thing\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'll drive you there\" says Grimes, he gets in and drives out to where the brig is, he parks and walks in, he leads you two to the interrogation room, you look through the one-way glass at the same man, who almost two weeks ago was aiming a machine pistol at you in an alley. \"how far can I interrogate him?\" you ask, \"as far as the base commander is concerned this man doesn't exist, so do what ever you need\" says Grimes, you nod, \"I'll need a car battery and jumper cables, a retractable police baton, cattle prod, and a knife.\" you say, Grimes nods and gets you what you asked for, you place the baton in your sleeve so the bandit doesn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila walk into the Interrogation room, the bandit looks at you then at Sheila, \"oh look its the bit---\" before he could finish insulting Sheila you drop the baton into your hands extending it and hit him in the shin as hard as you could swing, knocking him out of his chair. \"AAAAAHHHH what was that for?\" screamed the bandit, calmly you kneel down to his face, \"you will treat her and me with respect or I will break you leg next time, understood?\" you said in a calm voice, he nods, you set him back in the chair. \"Now this is what is going to happen, I will ask you a question and you will answer, you lie I break something, I think your lying, I break something, you give us anything besides an answer I break something, you give us something good and we do something good for you, clear?\" you say also in a calm voice, he hesitates, but nods.<br>\r\nYou retract the baton, but keep it in your hand, \"Now let's start over, this is Corporal Sheila\" you point to Sheila \"I am Staff Sergeant Christopher\" you tell him \"you can say hello\" you tell the bandit \"h-hello\" he says confused, \"good now was that so hard, you see I'm a nice guy, you give me what I want and you don't get hurt then everyone's happy. Now why were you sent after us?\" you ask calmly, \"Umm--uh\" says the bandit, \"Times up\" you say as you whip out the baton again, \"NOO, no please, we were sent to finish something that was started two years ago\" screams the bandit as you raise the baton, \"finish what?\" you ask \"killing you and those close to you\" he says, you pause \"who sent you?\" you ask. \"I can't tell you he'll kill me if I do\", \"wrong answer \"you say, \"get on your knees\" you order, \"wha-\" before he could finish you grab him and stand him up \" I said get on your knees\" you say as you hit him on the back of the legs, dropping him on his knees. \"Now remember what I said if you didn't give us an answer?\" as you bring up your foot and stomp on his left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me his name or you other leg is next, followed by your arms, and then the fun really begins.\" you tell him still in a calm voice. \"he doesn't go by his name only by his nickname \"The Valkyrie\" \" says the bandit through sobs, \"sounds a little odd for a male insurgent\" you say \"he is male right?\" you ask, the bandit nods. \"where is he?\" you ask, \"I don't know, but he told us if we were captured and asked that question to say \"next time he won't miss\" \" says the bandit with a smile. You continue to stare him in the face, slowly you stand back up and turn around, \"well are you going to break my oth---\" before he could finish you spin around and slug him so hard he's out cold before he hits the floor, \"damn that felt good\" you say holding your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila leave the unconscious bandit on the floor and leave, you look at Grimes standing in the hallway \" you might want to have medics go fix his leg, he nods and pulls out a radio. Sheila walks over to you \"what did he mean by \"he won't miss next time\" ?\" she asked, you start to unzip your uniform top, \"If he's who I think he is, then he's the one that gave me this\" you say as you pull back the right half of your shirt collar, revealing the scar from the sniper's bullet on your shoulder, \"and he's also responsible for the death of three of my friends\" you say with anger in your voice, \"and I know where to find him and he knows it\". After a long silence  you begin putting you jacket back on, \"I need some space to think right now\" you say, Sheila and Grimes nod, you walk out of the brig and walk in the general direction of your living quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait up\" you hear you turn around to see Sheila running to catch up to you, \"before you say anything I just want to say that what happened in the interrogation room was is not who I really am\" you tell her \"I know that, I came because I wanted to know if you were alright after what he told you?\" she says. \"I'll be fine\"you tell her, \"come on lets go get something to eat at the mess\" she says.</span></div></div>",

After talking for a little, you get the feeling of being watched so you look over your shoulder and see another human soldier walking toward you with his eyes locked on you, \"are you Staff sergeant Christopher?\" he asks, \"yeah, what can I do for you?\" you say, \"First sergeant Grimes attached me to your sniper team as a runner\" he says, \"a runner?\" asks Sheila, \"yeah you know the guy that runs out to distract snipers and carries the extra equipment\" he answers. \"Ok sorry, I didn't get your name\" you say, \"Corporal Felix\" he says holding out his hand, you and Sheila shake hands with him, the three of you sit and talk and get to know more about Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for about an hour you hear your squad called over the PA to report in the squad bay, you all get up and head to squad bay with the rest of the squad, as you arrive you see Grimes and someone else standing next to Grimes, \"you may be seated\" says Grimes, everyone in the squad finds a seat and looks at the unknown person, from what you've read in spy books, people who normally wear a uniform, but no patches are usually some type of spook with CIA type of people. \"My name is not important, all you need to know is that I work for a secret part of the government, it's been brought to our attention that some information regarding an individual on our deck of 52 has been possibly located, this individual is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of your fellow service members, we have yet to verify his location, but when we do we will be using your and five other squads in an assault on his location.\" says the spook, \"your squad was chosen because you have the best qualified sniper team in the rest of the company, for now we do not have a date for the mission, but when we do mission word in Geronimo\" says the spook, he looks over at Grimes and nods. \"Alright until the mission is green-lighted it's business as usual\" says Grimes, \"alright dismissed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimes walks over to you three \"I've see you've meet your new runner\" he says, \"yeah, he sort of found me first\" you say, \"I figured that if we are going after this guy you are going to need all the help you can get,\" he says, you nod \"yeah thats if we go after him\" you say, Grimes just shrugs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You all get up, throw out your trays and run to the squad bay a quick as possible, as you arrive you see everyone else getting geared up, you see Grimes walking over to you, \"our spook just confirmed the location of our  Valkyrie, so gear up and get ready for a briefing.\" he says. The three of you all gear up and find a seat in front of a giant cork board with photos and maps pinned to it, Grimes walks over to the front of the board and begins briefing everyone of there tasks in assaulting the city, the five squads the spook was talking about is tasked with taking one section of the city, there is almost a battalion assaulting with you two blocks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brief you grab your rifle, body armor, helmet, and a disassembled sniper rifle in its case, you hand the sniper rifle bag to Felix to carry during the assault, you stuff extra sniper ammo in your bag, you decide not to grab a ghillie suit because you will be fighting in an urban environment, you make your way over to the ammo table and begin stuffing magazines and grenades in your vest, you throw night vision goggles in your bag, \"never know when we'll be back\" you think, you grab as many MRE's and bottles of water that you can carry and begin handing them out to your team. \"All set?\" you ask Sheila and Felix, \"we're good\" says Sheila, \"locked and loaded\" says Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all load into Blackhawk helicopters and take off, you ride in the helo for what feels like hours, someone taps you on the shoulder and yells over the sound of the rotor \"one minute\" you nod and pass the message around, you begin to prepare your self to fast rope down into combat, pulling down your goggle to keep the sand that's kicked up from the rotor out of your eyes, and wrap your desert scarf around your mouth. You feel the helicopter level out, \"go rope\" you hear the crew chief yell out from behind you, someone by the door throws the rope out the door and prepares to fast rope, as he jumps on and slides down, you grab the rope and slide down after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop onto the ground and instantly look for cover to hide from any shooting, you crouch down next to  what was a car at one point, the rest of your team drops and runs over to you, after everyone is off the helicopters they drop the ropes and fly away, then the silence set in, \"where is everyone?\" asked Felix, \" I don't know, but they know we're here\" you tell him, \" keep your eyes open\" you tell them, you get on the radio and Grimes tells you to move on down the road and scout out ahead. As the three of you cautiously walk down the street, moving from cover to cover, when suddenly you hear a snap followed by the brick above your head exploding, you dive into the nearest building to get off the street........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The assault was moving into its third day of fighting, the main assault force managed to push the enemy close to the center of the city, by now imaginary battle lines have been drawn along the city, you and Sheila walk into a room with another table map in it, but this one had a close up of the center of the city, Grimes and Felix were already there leaning over the map. Grimes looks up at you as you walk in, \" We're sending you in deep behind enemy lines, we have solid intel indicating that our Valkyrie will be inspecting some of his troops a few days from now, our spook friend thinks that by eliminating him this will cause a mass confusion amongst their leadership and give up the upper hand, we believe this will be the only time he will be out in the open long enough.\" says Grimes, you all gather around the map as Grimes explains how you will infiltrate, set up and exfiltrate the area, he indicates where your target will be and he hands out pictures of your target so you can identify him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you head to the supply bunker to ready yourselves, you each grab a suppressed carbines, MRE's, water, and some medical supplies, you pick up the disassembled sniper rifle thats was still in its case, surprisingly you never got a chance to use it. You hand over the medical supplies, food and water to Felix to carry, you put on the backpack rifle case that has the sniper rifle in it, and Sheila grabs her spotter gear and radio to carry, since this is a stealth mission you have to move on foot. You look at your watch, Grimes said that to reduce the chances of the enemy knowing about the mission, they will be using an artillery bombardment to cover your infiltration, the bombardment is set to launch at 16:00(4:00) and its almost noon so you have four hours to wait, \"get some rest you two, I'll wake one of you in an hour and we'll switch shifts\" you tell Felix and Sheila, they nod and find a place to lay down and quickly fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*four hours later*<br>\r\nYou wake up to Felix shaking you awake, \"time to go\" he says, you look at your watch and see it says 15:45(3:45) you sit up and grab you gear and prepare yourself to sprint across the street into enemy territory, as your watch reaches 4:00 you hear the sounds of artillery shells incoming, you wait until you hear the first one slam into the ground and then you run across the street to the nearby building, after waiting a couple seconds Sheila comes running across the street to you, followed by Felix. You move from building to building careful to take cover from incoming artillery, \"that would suck, getting killed in enemy territory by your own artillery\" you think to yourself. After about an hour the shelling stopped, the three of you managed to make it about five blocks in before seeing one of the possible buildings to set up in. You check your map to see that its almost three miles from where your target is supposed to appear and the building give a clear lone of sight into the city center, \"what do you guys think?\" you say pointing toward the building, \"its going to be at least a days travel at this rate if we don't run into any trouble\" says Felix, \"I agree, but I think its a good choice\" says Sheila.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You turn and look at Sheila and Felix who are just as tired and dirty as you, \"well hard parts over, but we're taking the stairs, we can't risk using the elevator.\" you tell them, they nod, but you can tell by their body language that they didn't want to. The three of you begin the long climb up the stairs to the 40th floor, as you reach the 40th floor you move to the side facing the city center and begin setting up your sniper nest. You set up traps to cover you from behind, you take off the backpack case and begin setting up the rifle, the sniper rifle was a M107 anti material rifle, Felix slides over the bag with the ammo in it, \"what types of ammo do we have today?\" asks Sheila, \"two mags of SLAP ammo, three mags of API MK 211 Mod 0 HEIAP, and one mag of APEI for emergency use only\" you say, \"wow they're not playing around are they?\" says Felix. You set up the rifle at the back of the room to conceal your position, but you keep it unloaded for now, Sheila sets up a few feet away from you so she doesn't get hit from the blast that comes out of the muzzle break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix keeps sets up on the other side of you and looks out the window for counter-snipers, after an hour you look over at Felix and Sheila and see them forcing themselves awake, \"get some sleep you two I'll wake you if anything changes\" you tell them, \"Felix you go rest first, you'll need me to spot if he shows up\" says Sheila not looking up from her scope. \"alright then two hour sleep shifts, Felix you first, then Sheila, I'll take last\" you say. Felix nods and moves away to find a place to sleep, after two hours you wake Felix and send Sheila away to asleep and after another two hours you crawl away for some rest. This process continues for the next two days waiting for the Valkyrie to arrive, you take notes of troop strength and sketch out the area in front of you to set up land marks to help you when your target arrives, you begin to notice an increase in troops and light armor in the city center, \"I think our Valkyrie is due to arrive soon\" you say, \"yeah I noticed that too\" says Sheila, \"get me a range for now, don't worry about wind right now we'll add that in when he arrives\" you tell Sheila, \"range is 50,410 meters\" she says. You input the distance in your scope, \"hey how's our exit out of this building set up?\" you ask Felix \"ropes all set up to repel out\" he says, you turn and look to see he attached three repel lines to support beams and has the ropes set up near the windows to quickly get off this floor in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue observing for almost another day, when suddenly an unmarked armored car pulled into the city center, \"alright I think this is our guy\" you say as you load a magazine of MK211 into the rifle and pull on the charging handle. You glance over at Sheila who was looking at the photo of your target and looking through her powerful scope, she looks over at you and nods, \"alright wind speed and direction?\" you ask her, \"15 knots, heading south to north\" she says, \"good the wind is in our favor\" you say, you input the wind into your scope and take aim, you go back to the day on the mountain when you graduated from sniper training, you close your eyes and slow your heat beat again by controlling your breathing. All you hear is the sound of your heart beat in your ears, you wrap your left hand around the bottom of the stock to give you a better grip on the rifle, you open your eyes and exhale, you pause and pull the trigger right between your heart beat. The rifle kicks back into your shoulder hard, as the MK211 leaves the barrel at 853m/s the barrel recedes back into the rifle about 25mm, the bullet flies through the window and straight at your target unaltered by the wind, you watch the bullet travel toward your target, you watch him inspect his troops unaware of the round traveling toward him, you had to aim where he was going to be about one minute from now. You watched him walk over to where you fired at, he said something to the soldier in front of him, that was the last thing he did, one moment he's talking and the next he disappeared in a cloud of blood and gore, \"That's for Miller, Peter, and Ingram,\" you whisper, \"positive hit, lets get out of here, they're going to try to find us\" you say as you start packing up your gear, slinging your carbine over your shoulder and placing the M107 back in its case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the case on your back again and run over to the repel lines and click in, Sheila and Felix run over to you and click the rope into their carabiners and break out the window, the three of you jump out the window and begin repelling down the side of the building. You reach the ground with rifles drawn, but no one was around, \"lets go\" you say, you begin running back toward friendly lines no longer worried about stealth, but speed. You managed to make it about three blocks till your home free before a convoy of light armor vehicles drove by, \"did they see us?\" asked felix \"I don't thi---\" before you can finish the last armored car stopped and turned toward the three of you, the turret rotated toward you and opened fire with 20mm and light machine gun fire, the three of you dived into the nearest building, you unhook the case and put the rifle back together, but removed the scope and flipped up the built in iron sights, \"I need those SLAP rounds\" you yell to Felix who had the ammo, he drops his bag, reached in and tossed you the magazine marked SLAP on the side, you load and charge the rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran into the neighboring building and set up waiting for the armored car to drive by, as it slowly moves down the road you shoot and hit it just under the turret, but this does not stop it from rotating and firing its machine gun at you, you quickly shoot again hitting it under the turret and this time the turret stops firing, you shoot it again and it explodes in fireball. \"that was almost too close\" you say relieved as you start to disassemble the rifle again and put it away. \"Umm sarge? \" you hear, you turn to see Felix holding his stomach, he sways a little before collapsing, you and Sheila run over and pull open his vest to see blood seeping from a wound in his lower midsection, \"I need gauze\" you say to Sheila, she hands you Felix's bag with the medical gear in it. For an hour you manage to stop his bleeding, but if he doesn't get to a doctor he's a in real trouble, Sheila grabs his bag and rifle, you place him over your shoulder firemen style, Sheila get on the radio when you are one block out notifying Grimes that you are coming and need medical personnel ready for Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grimes says to wait, they're going to provide some fire to cover our retreat\" says Sheila, \"when the shooting starts, start running\" she adds. As soon as she says that you hear the heavy machine guns open up on what ever enemy forces are behind you, \"GO\" you yell, the two of you run as fast as possible across the street into friendly forces, as you cross over into a bunker you find medics ready to take Felix, you lay him down on a stretcher. \"Did you get him?\" says Grimes from behind you, \"I did\" you say, \"good go get some rest because tomorrow your going back to base to be debriefed\" he says.</span></div></div>",

You both leave and track down Grimes, \"you two are being sent back to base soon so pack up\" he says \"what about Felix?\" you ask, \"he got flown out last night for better care while you slept, but the docs say he'll be fine\" he says, you nod and mentally breath a sigh of relief. \"You'll be driving out today, enemy AA is keeping our birds from getting too close\" says Grimes, \"get ready to leave and head over to the motor pool, other than that you are dismissed\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila head back to the barracks and start packing, after that you head over to the temporary motor pool and commandeer a Humvee for the drive back to base. You load up and drive out following the road formed by the daily convoys in and out of the FOB, as you approach the town line you see something dark on a nearby hill so you pull over, \"want to go investigate?\" you ask Sheila, she looks at you then at the object on the hill, \"sure why not as long as we get back to base\" she says. You drive towards the object on the hill, as you get closer you see it was the wreck of a tank, you stop and get out, you approach the wreck and put your hand on it, you see some type of lettering on the side of the turret, \"what is it?\" she asked confused by your silence, \"get me some water and a rag\" you tell her, she returns to the Humvee and comes back with a rag and a canteen and hands them to you, you climb up on the hull and take the canteen and pour a little on the left side of the turret and begin wiping away the dirt with the rag, as you wipe you reveal the words <i>\"get some\"</i> written on the side, you stand on the hull in shock, you feel your legs get heavy as you fall to your knees and place your hand on the lettering, you begin to see the edges of your vision blur, you realize your starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila climbs up after you and grabs your shoulders, \"are you alright?\" she asks, you only managed to nod, she looks at what you uncovered, remembering what she saw in the photo at the bar, and then at you, \"was this?\" was all she said, you nod. You stand up and walk over to the loader's hatch and climb in, Sheila walks over to the commander's hatch and sticks her head in. The interior of the tank was scorched black in some places, everything was warped or damaged in some way, it was completely empty, you remember the medics telling you that your crews remains were recovered and shipped home for burial, the hatch that held the tank's rounds was completely destroyed, you hear something crunch under your boots, you look down and see a piece of metal about the size of a flash card, you bend over and pick it up, \"what's that?\" you hear Sheila ask from the Commander's seat. \"Just something the four of us made for fun\" you say, it was a piece of steel with all your names and ranks stamped on it, \"come on lets get out of here\" you say, Sheila nods and climbs out, \"I got him you guys\" you whisper before you climb back out of the hatch, you climb down from the tank and walk back to the Humvee putting the sheet of metal in your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to drive?\" Sheila asks, you nod, \"sure\" you say. You look back toward the tank and see Miller, Peter, and Ingram standing on the tank smiling at you, you rub your eyes and look back and no one was there so you climb back into the Humvee. You feel a hand on your shoulder making you jump, \"sorry, why don't you try and get some sleep, I'll wake you if I need you.\" said Sheila, you nod and start to drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slept the rest of the way back to base, Sheila wakes you as you enter through the front gates, she parks at the motor pool and you both walk the rest of the way toward the squad bay to find the spook leaning over a table top map with several other officers that haven't noticed you two yet, you sigh and drop your gear on the floor loudly alerting them to your presence, the spook turn and looks at you and smiles, \"congratulations on hitting your target\" he says \"let's make this quick, I want to get back to the city and finish what we started\" you tell him, \"oh thats not necessary, you see after you toppled their leadership they fell apart and we finished taking the city, while you drove down here\" he adds. \"Walk with me you two\" he says, the two of you walk with him retelling him everything that happened leading up to killing your target and the exfiltration of the building back to friendly lines, he listens carefully, having you describe everything in detail as he writes it down in a notebook, as you finish he simply nods, but continues writing in his book, he stops, \"is that everything?\" he asks, you and Sheila nod, \"alright you did good, go get something to eat and rest up, your dismissed\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila turn, grab your gear and leave, you walk to the mess and grab some food to go because you still smell like a sewer and didn't want to stink up the place. You reach your quarters and sit outside and eat, after you finish you lay back on your backpack and stare at the night sky, suddenly a tail brushes your face, you look over at Sheila \"you alright you seem a little spacey\" she says, \"yeah I'm fine, what about you?\" you ask \"yeah i'm fine\" she says, you reach over and grab her wrist, \"was that your first time in combat?\" you ask cautiously, she pauses,\" yeah\" she says quietly, \"thats ok, you did well for your first time in combat\" you tell her. You notice tear starting to form in her eyes, you lean over and hug her and she grabs onto you tightly, \"I'm sorry, its just that when I saw Felix wounded I kept thinking back to the day when you got shot outside that restaurant\" she says in a tearful voice. \"Thats ok when he was wounded I thought back to the day I lost my three closest friends\" you tell her, \"come on lets go get cleaned up and rested\" you say as you help her up the steps into the house, you direct her toward the bathroom, \"ladies first\" you say making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your bed and toss your gear under and get ready for your shower, 30 minutes later Sheila walks out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, \"all yours\" she says, \"I hope you didn't use up all the hot water\" you say jokingly. You walk over to the bathroom and take your shower, as you rub the soap over your body it comes to your attention some new cuts and wounds you picked up during the fighting, you look at your feet and watch the combat cocktail of dirt and blood that you've become familiar with swirl down the drain. You finish showering, towel off, shave, and put on some clean underwear you walk out to your bed, you sit and pull out the piece of metal from the tank and turn it over in your hands. Sheila walks over to you and sits down next to you on the bed and puts her arm around your shoulder, \"thank you for for looking out for me earlier\" she says, \"its no problem\" you say. She leans over and gives you a small kiss on the cheek, instantly your face turns bright red, she giggles at your reaction, \"I defiantly wasn't expecting that\" you say, \"I wasn't expecting you to expect that\" she says with a smile, \"come on time for bed\" she says as she wraps her tails around you and drags you onto your bed and lays on top of you, \"good night\" she says, in a matter of minutes you both fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You bring your arm up and poke her in the shoulder, \"you awake?\" you whisper, she doesn't respond and continues to snore lightly, \"now how am I going to wake her this time?\" you think to yourself, then an idea pops in your head and you stop poking her shoulder and lightly scratch behind her ear, one of her tails begins to twitch. after a little bit you begin scratching a little harder to try to wake her, but that only causes more of her tails to start twitching, suddenly you stop scratching her ear, you see her tails freeze in place and slow fall back onto the bed, she lifts her head and looks at you, \"aww why did you stop?\" she whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we have to get up\" you tell her, she looks at you with a pouty puppy face, \"just five more minutes\" she begs, you give in to her stare, \"oh alright\" you say, she leans in a kisses you on the cheek again, \"that reminds me are we even allowed to do that?\" you ask, \"well when you were in the shower last night I skimmed through the regulations and it says no relationships between officers and enlisted personnel, but it doesn't say anything about two enlisted personnel\" she says, \"well lets be careful \" you tell her, she lays on your chest and wraps her arms around your head and rubs her nose against your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay in each others arms for what seems like hours, but according to your clock was only ten minutes, \"alright your five minutes are long over\" you tell her, she miles, \"yeah I guess they are\" she says, she leans in and gives you another kiss, but this time on the lips. At first this came to a small surprise to you, but it soon passed and you found yourself enjoying the kiss, \"well I should have expected that one\" you tell heras you break for air, \"I expected you to expect <i>that one</i>\" she says, \"come on gotta get up\" you say, \"fine\" she says, she gets out off you and walks over to her locker and starts getting dressed. You get up and start getting dressed too, you look at the calendar you had posted on your locker door, you marked on the calendar when your tour finished and when you were going home, \"hey two more months and then we head home\" you yell over your shoulder at Sheila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed except for your uniform top before....</span></div></div>",

The first one was from and unknown email and from the looks of it, it was from the spook you talked to yesterday, he was asking for a typed version of your story, but the second one was from your mother back home, she was asking the usual questions, \"how everything is going, what's new.\" You respond to her message, \"everything's fine here, I think I'm finally getting over my nightmares\" you type, she sort of found out about your nightmares when you almost had a breakdown when you returned from your second tour. \"Maybe we can video chat later\" you add to your message, you send the email and close your laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*later that day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in and lay down on your bed, exhausted from today, you finished a ten hour patrol followed by having to help some new guys remove the main gun on an Abrams for maintenance, you were their best option because of your background as a tanker, helping them was another two hours of manual labor with you doing the most work. You look around and see you were alone, you walk over and grab your laptop and open up the video chat and see your mother was online, you give her a video call and she answers\"hey honey, how are you?\" she says, \"good how are you?\" you ask, \"things have been crazy, but normal crazy\" she says, \"so a normal day\" you say to yourself, the two of you talk for an hour, switching every so often to say hello to your other siblings, after half an hour Sheila walks in from where ever she was, she freezes in the door and slowly closes the door so not to make any noise. She walks over and looks at your computer screen taking care to stay out of the camera view, she looks a you and gives you a weak smile and walks over to her bed and sits down, \"Hey two more months and then I'm back home\", you tell her.<br>\r\n\"awesome\" she says, you look over at Sheila sitting quietly on her bed, \" is it ok if I bing someone home with me?\"you quietly type in the message bar, \"who?\" she types back, \"my roommate, I don't think she has anyone back home to go to\" you type back, \"sure, I'm sure we can make arrangements\" she types. You simle at her,\" ok, I've got to go\" you type, \"ok be safe I'll see you in two months\" she replies, you both say your goodbyes and sign off. You put your laptop away and walk over and sit next to Sheila who hasn't moved since she sat down, you look and see what look like tears streaming down her face, \"Hey you alright?\"\" you ask putting your hand on her shoulder, she flinched and looked at you, \"sorry\" she says, \"why are you saying sorry?\" you ask \"for looking over your shoulder while you were video chatting\" she says, \"you don't have to be sorry\" you say as you bring you arm around her shoulder, \"I'm just going to be straight forward and ask, do you have anyone back home waiting for you?\" you ask, she shakes her head, \"no like I told you I never met my mother and I was told my father was killed in action\" she says, \"who took care of you after your father died?\" you ask, \"my aunt raised me when I was four till I enlisted,\" she says, \"well don't you have your aunt to go back to?\" you ask.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, \"no she passed away three weeks before you arrived\" she says tearing up again, you hug her tightly, \"I'm sorry\" you say, after hugging her for a few minutes she pulls away, \"its ok you didn't know\" she says quietly, you look at her and help wipe away her tears, \"how would you like to come home with me when we return home?\" you ask her, she stares at you for what feels like an hour, \"can you do that?\" she asks, \"yeah, I can\" you tell her, suddenly she grabs you with all her tails and her arms and pulls you into a deep hug, she begins crying on your shoulder, \"thank you, I don't know what I was going to do without your help\" she says with her head still in your shoulder. \"I'll let my folks know to make accommodations for the both of us tomorrow evening\" you tell her, \" ok\" she says as she loosens her grip on you.<br>\r\n \"I really don't know what I would have done when I returned home to no one\" she says, \"well its important that we look out for each other, back after my first tour I had thoughts about taking my life, but I had my parents to help me.\" you tell her, she looks at you in shock, \"why?\" she asks, \"well before I lost Miller, Peter and Ingram, I lost a school friend three months into my first deployment, he was a helicopter pilot, my platoon was being deployed into an area we knew was heated, he was piloting the helicopter that transported us to our new base and as soon as we were unloaded the enemy opened up on the helicopter as he tried to lift off, they damaged the helicopter so bad that it immediately crashed into the nearby hill, but did not explode so I carefully approached the crash and managed to pull him out, but he bled out in my arms before medics could arrive.\" you say quietly.<br>\r\nYou both sit quietly not saying anything, \"What if you family doesn't like me?\" she asks breaking the silence, \"its ok I'm sure they'll love you, I'll tell you what if you want I can introduce you tomorrow when I video call her,\" you tell her, \"ok\" she says and smiles. \"Alright time for bed\" you say, but as you try to get up she grabs you with her tails, \"I think this time we sleep in my bed\" she says, \"when did we decide we were taking turns?\" you ask, she giggles, \"we didn't\", she lift you up and sets you down on her bed and crawls up next to you, you are so tired from today that you soon begin to drift off to sleep, Sheila snuggles up to like she did last night.</span></div></div>",

She breaks the kiss and looks at you, \"well thats a start\" you tell her, she smiles at you, \"well I hope its a good start\" she says, \"come on I gotta go shower from yesterday\" you tell her, you didn't get a chance to shower or get out of your uniform from last night. She lets go of you and you get up and head to the bathroom, you hop in the shower and wash away the filth from the previous night, you get out, shave and towel off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out and get dressed, as you sit to tie up your boots you hear your computer chirp, a new email. You open your laptop to see an email from Grimes, he was asking to see if you could help train some new tank crewmen. You turn and look at Sheila, \"looks like I'm going to be training some new tankers\" you tell her, \"sounds fun\" she says, \"where will you be working?\" she asks, \"says I'll be helping them train in hanger 2\" you tell her. \"Hanger 2? Why are you woking in a hanger?\" she asks, \"its not an aircraft hanger, its a vehicle maintenance hanger\" you tell her. You close your laptop, finished getting dressed, and both of you walk out the door toward the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk into the mess, grab some food and find a table, not long after you sat down Grimes sits down at your table, \"did you get my email?\" he asks, \"yeah I did, when do you want me to start training them?\" you ask. \"Today or tomorrow, up to you\" he says, \"I think I'll evaluate them to see where they need work. Wait are these the guys that needed help yesterday?\" you ask, Grimes nods, \"ok well I know what to expect from them now\" you tell him. \"Think you can handle it?\" he asks, \"yeah I got this\" you say, he nods again, gets up, \"oh Sheila one of the medics asked me to pass on a message, your needed down at the infirmary, something about paperwork\" he says and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both finish your breakfast and leave the mess, \"I'll meet up with you after I go get this straightened out\" she says, \"ok you know where to find me\" you tell her. Sheila walks toward the infirmary, you continue walking toward that hanger with the new crewmen in it, the same hanger where you were in helping that same crew remove the main gun from a tank. You walk into the hanger,in the center of the hanger was an Abrams battle tank that was missing the main gun, to the left of the tank was the main gun suspended by chains and around the main gun were the four new crewmen, one of them looks up from the work he was doing and see you standing in the doorway, he sets down his tools and walks over to you, out of all four crewmen is was your favorite because he tried his best and worked harder than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up, come to help us finish?\" he asks, \"nope, I'm here to train the four of you\" you tell him, \"what do you mean?\" he asks. \" My superior thinks that you guys are good, but you could do better\" you tell him, he nods, \"fall in, I'm about to brief you guys on whats going on\" you tell him. You look at the other three who seem to be slacking off and taking more time to do the job than was needed. \"FALL IN\" you bellow, instantly the other three crewmen run over and stand next to the crewman that was talking to you earlier, \"my name is Staff sergeant Christopher and I was told that you four soldiers are good, but you could do better, so until you improve I am going to be your new instructor.\"  you tell them. \"I will teach you methods to troubleshoot any problems you will have in the field, I will teach you to remain calm while performing field repairs when someone is shooting at you, and I teach you how to work as a team, because if you fail as a team you fail at everything\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the crewmen has a smirk on his face, you walk over to him, \"why do you have that smirk on your face, was something I said funny?\" you ask him,  \"its just that we will never have to do a field repair, these tanks are virtually indestructible\" he says with that smirk still on his face. Slowly you move your face close to his, noses almost touching, \"you my friend are very wrong, I have had to perform a field repair on my tank while under fire, I've had a bullet enter my helmet from the left and exit out the rear, all because a small piece of metal deflected the bullet away from my head. As for these tanks being indestructible you are wrong, I lost my three crewmen..... three friends........three brothers....... when an IED blew up the tank, the only reason I survived was because a sniper's bullet knocked me off the tank\" you tell him, slowly as you tell your story his smirk disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk away from him, \"now for today before noon, I want you four to perform a routine maintenance on that main gun, but I want to see you working as a team, do I make myself clear?\" you tell them, \"yes Staff sergeant\" all four crewmen yell, \"good dismissed \" you tell them, they run back to the main gun and jump to work.<br>\r\n*switch to Sheila*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you finish filling out some paperwork that seemed to have gotten lost in the vast network of the military, it was some simple paperwork, but it still was time consuming, \"here last thing, just sign here\" says a medic at the desk, you sign the paper and hand it back to him. \"We need a medic at hanger 2\" you hear over the radio next to the desk, you only thought was that Christopher was injured somehow,  you follow the medic that was responding to the call to his Humvee,\"hey can I ride down to the hanger with you I was headed that way anyway\" you ask him, \"sure hop in\" he says. He drives down to the hanger and pulls up to the giant main doors, you hop out and run inside, you see a tank sitting in the middle of the room with the main gun missing, you see the gun to the left of the tank was the main gun but the bottom was laying on the floor and the barrel was pointed up as if a chain had broke and dropped the rear end. You see the medic run over to Christopher and look him over, he shakes him away and points him to one of the other crewmen sitting there holding his arm, you run over to Christopher, \"what happened?\" you ask. \"Chain snapped and hit him in the arm, he was lucky it didn't take his arm off, and we were damn lucky no one got crushed when that gun fell\" he tells you. You notice some blood on his face from a cut along his right cheek, \"what happened to your cheek?\" you ask, \"when the chain snapped I think I got hit by a flying piece of the chain\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and grab some first aid equipment from the medic and run back to treat his cut, you start treating his wound, \" don't you remember when I said we had to be careful in public\" he says, \"relax, since I rode in with the medic they must think I'm with him\" you tell him. He stand up and walk over to the medic, \"how bad?\" he asks, \"he'll live, he's lucky any closer when that chain broke and he might have lost his arm\" says the medic. Christopher turns and looks at the other three crewmen standing by the tank \"lower the gun from the chains for now, we'll deal with this tomorrow\" he tells them, they walk over to the gun still pointed upward and slowly begin lowering to the floor, after they set the gun on the floor they leave for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on let get you out of here for today\" you tell him, \"I want to see him off first\" he says, \"I'll be by the door when your ready\" you tell him, you walk over to the side door and wait. You watch him walk the injured crewman over to the medic's Humvee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*switch to Christopher*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped the crewman into the Humvee and closed the door behind him, you turn around and found Sheila standing by the side door, you walk over to her, \" alright lets go\" you say, \"hey its not your fault right? It was just a faulty chain, accidents happen\" she says to you, \"yeah your right\" you tell her, \" so where do you want to go right now?\" she asks, \"how about....</span></div></div>",

You walk in and open your laptop and begin typing up your incident report on the accident that happened in the hanger, you finish the report and send it to the medic to file away with his medical report. You put your laptop away and sit quietly at your desk, Sheila walks up behind you and sets her hands on your shoulders, \"how are you holding up?\" she asks. \"I'm fine, its just that this wasn't the first impression that I wanted to set with them\" you tell her, she hugs you from behind, \"don't worry I'm sure you'll be fine training them\" she says, \"come on lets go get some lunch\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and follow her out the door toward the mess, \"hey lets get it to go and head back to the hanger, I have to make a list of parts in-case they need to be replaced on the main gun\" you tell her, \"sure\" she says. The two of you walk over to the mess and grab some food which today was MRE's and walk back down to the hanger. You walk into the hanger, \"Hey can you give me a hand?\" you ask, \"sure what do you want me to do?\" she asks, \"I'm going to lift up the front of the gun with the chains that are still attached, I need you to feed another chain around the rear end of the breach so I can lift it up\" you tell her. After half an hour of walking her through the steps you both manage to fit a new chain on the rear and raise up the main gun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sit on the tank hull and begin eating you lunch, \"so what's the damage\" she asks, \" so far I only think the breach block picked up some damage and I won't know how bad until I take it apart and look at it, but I want a new one in-case there's damage I can't see\" you tell her. \"So what now?\" she asks, \"well not much to do until tomorrow\" you tell her, \"is it ok if I stick around and help you train them?\" she asks, \"let me check with Grimes, but I don't see why not besides I think I could use the help\" you tell her, she smiles. \"Tomorrow after I'm done having them finish the maintenance on the gun and put it back together, I'm going to take them to the range to see if they did it right\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you want I can teach you how to operate the main gun so you can help supervise if there's a problem\" you say, \"or\" she says, \"what do you mean \"or\"?\" you ask confused. \"Well I can read minds and if you let me I can learn how to operate the whole tank from your memories\" she tells you, \"well we could do it that way, wait was that why you were always staring at me?\" you ask, she blushes, \"yeah,\" she says. \"So how do I do this?\" you ask, \"just think back to when you were at tanker school and I'll do the rest\" she says, you clear your mind and think back to your first days at tanker school, Sheila begins staring deeply at you, \"done\" she says after a few seconds. \"Thats it?\" you ask, \"yep\" she says, \"why didn't you read my mind before?\" you ask, \"I don't know, when I tried it was like looking at static on a tv\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I want to test to see if this worked\" you tell her, \"how?\" she asks, for the next hour you test her on everything you know on the tank and she passed every test you gave her. \"Alright it worked, let me go talk to Grimes and we can start tomorrow\" you tell her, you manage to find Grimes in the mess later that day, \"hey I was wondering if Sheila can give me a hand training these soldiers\" you tell him, \"sure, but your going to have to teach her the basics first\" he says, \"that won't be hard\" you think to yourself, \"sure I can do that\" you tell him. You leave and meet up with Sheila back at your living quarters, \"Grimes said he's ok with you helping me\" you tell her, \"awesome\" she says \"are you forgetting something?\" she asks. You shake your head, \"no\" you says as you walk over to your desk and open your laptop to the video chat program and call your mother, while it rings you look at Sheila, \"I remembered\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to your laptop and see your mother answered, \"hey what's up?\" she says, \"I talked to my roommate and she wanted to meet you before we returned home,\" you tell her, \"ok, it that her I see in the background?\" she asks, \"yes this is her\" you turn and look a Sheila and motion her over, \"come over here and introduce yourself\" you tell her, she walks over into the camera and says hi, you get up and give her your seat, soon the two of them are talking like they were old friends. You look at Sheila then you walk out the door and head towards the mess to get som food for the two of you, you grab two servings of food and put it in some to-go containers and head back to your quarters. You walk in and they're still talking, you walk over and place one of the containers of food next to her on the desk, \"alright I'll let you two go\" says your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright maybe we'll talk again tomorrow\" you tell her, you say your goodbyes and close your laptop, \"well?\" you ask looking at Sheila, \"you were right she does love me.....she's kind of like....the mother I never had\" she says, lowering her head, \"hey, you alright?\" you ask. \"Yeah I'm fine\" she says lifting her head and looking at you, \"come on eat before it gets cold\" you tell her, she smiles \"ok\". You pull over another chair and begin eating you dinner and talking about your plan for tomorrows training, you both finish and throw away your food boxes, you walk over to your bed and sit down, Sheila walks over and lays down with her head on you lap looking up at you. \"Having fun?\" you ask looking down at her, she giglges and smiles at you, \"maybe\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean down and kiss her on her lips, \"time for bed\" you tell her, she sits up and walks over to her locker, you kick off your boots, and toss your uniform in your laundry bag. You climb back into your bed, Sheila walks back over, she like you was only in her underwear revealing her cream colored mid section, she climbs into the bed and lays next to you draping her tails around you like a blanket, \"good night\" she whispers in your ear</span></div></div>",

Half way through reinstalling the main gun, the crewman who was injured yesterday showed up asking to resume his duties, \"you fit to work?\" you ask him, \"yes I am Staff sergeant\" he says, \"ok, but if you put the rest of the team or yourself at risk I'm taking you out, roger?\" you tell him, \"roger that Staff sergeant\" he says. You nod and he runs off to help the rest of the team install the main gun, they finish installing the gun correctly. \"We're ready to go Staff sergeant\" yelled one of the crewmen from the commander's hatch, \"alright one of you is going to ride with Corporal Sheila while the rest of us head down to the range\" you say to them. \"I'll go\" says the crewman in the commander's hatch, he climbs out of the tank and walks over to Sheila and gets in the Humvee and rides with her to the supply depot to get the rounds for the main gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up on the tank and drop down into the commander station, to your left is the loader who was a female coyote Anthro, in front of you was the gunner who was the injured crewman. You put on your helmet, \"alright driver start up the engine and lets get moving\" you say into your head set, you hear the engine turn over and the tank slowly move forward, you stick your head outside the hatch to help the driver navigate from the hanger, after leaving the hanger you order the driver onto one of the many tank designated roads to avoid non- tracked vehicles, after moving at a cautious pace you make it to the heavy weapons range. You find Sheila already there with a cargo truck with the tank rounds in the back,  you direct the driver to one of the firing lanes and order him to halt and shut down. You look over at the gunner and order him out to help load up shells, you climb out and let him out, you walk over to the loader hatch to help hand the rounds to her. The gunner, commander, and driver form a line and pass the tank round down to you and you hand them to the loader, who places them in the ammo storage rack. After about ten minutes all the ammo slots are filled, \"alright what's going to happen it that the loader and gunner are going to practice loading and shooting some rounds to get warmed up, then the commander is going to take my place and practice spotting and shooting some targets, and after that I'm going to have you practice firing rounds on the move if you prove you can work together as a team, roger?\" you tell them, \"roger that Staff sergeant\" they all say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, the gunner and the loader all climb back into the tank, you look over at the loader and she looks back at you and nervously smiles, \"nervous?\" you ask, she nods, \"don't worry, just do what they taught you at tanker school and you'll be fine\" you tell her, she nods again. \"Alright lets get this started,load one SABOT\" you tell the loader, she opens the ammo door, grabs a SABOT round and loads it into the main gun, she reaches over and arms the main gun, \"up\" she says into her headset, \"alright lets go hunting, gunner, SABOT, tank 1 o'clock,\" you yell into your headset, \"standby\" he yells back, \"fire\" you yell, \"on the way\" he yells and depresses the trigger. There is a deep, bass like boom followed by the breach block shooting back about two feet, the gunner drops the breach block, turns around and opens up the ammo door again, grabs another SABOT and reloads the gun, \"up\" she yells. \"Gunner SABOT tank, 12 o'clock\", \"standby\", \"fire\", \"on the way, but this time when he pressed the trigger nothing happened, \"Master blaster\" you tell him, he reaches over and turn a red handle, but nothing happens. \"Alright stand by I think we have a misfire, check the circuit breakers\" you say into your head set, you take your eyes off the commanders sight and turn toward the loader, but you stop and see that the breach was still open, \"hey look at the breach\" you yell toward the loader, she turns around from checking the circuit breakers and looks at the reach, \"hit it in there\" you tell her, she starts pounding on the round to push it all the way in the breach. After punching the SABOT about ten times you stop her, \"alright pull it out of there\" you tell her, she pulls out a lever and puts into a slot next to the gun releasing the round, you pull it out a little, \"now shove it in there\" you tell her she shoves the round into the breach and this time the breach block rises up locking the round in place. \"Up\" she says into her headset, \"lets try this again\" you say, the gunner depresses the triggers and fires the main gun for a second time, this continued for three more rounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loader safes the gun and climbs out the hatch, the gunner follows you out your hatch, \"alright you guys did really good, you didn't miss a target.\" you tell them, you look at the loader, \"you still could use a little practice, but you did very well, don't feel so bad I was a loader like you and I've had my fair share of mistakes when I was new,\" She smiles, \"now for this next exercise you need to make sure that breach is up and locked ok?\" you tell her, she nods \" yes Staff sergeant\" she says. You call over the commander and go over the plan of attack, \"I want you to shoot at five targets, three will be using HEAT and the other two will be with SABOT, there is no order in which you shoot them and no order in what type of round you use, you can shoot one SABOT and the next HEAT, that's up to you ok?\" you tell him, \"roger that Staff sergeant\" he says, \"do not go over five shots, if you miss continue on don't go back\" you tell him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb off the hull and walk over to Sheila standing by the range officer's station, \"commander can you hear me?\" you say into your radio, \"roger Staff sergeant\" he says, \"alright you may fire when ready\" you say into your radio. After a few minutes they finish shooting all five targets, \"safe you gun and I'll be over in a minute\" you say into your radio. You walk over and climb up on the hull of the tank and move over toward he commander's hatch. \"That was some excellent shooting, now we are going to practice shooting on the move, you're going to follow us down this road for two miles there you will reach another section of the range which is designed for you to practice shooting on the move, there you have ten targets to hit with whatever rounds you want, when you are finished follow the road and it will bring you back to the beginning and I'll be waiting there to give you further instructions\" you tell him, \"roger that Staff sergeant\" he says. You and Sheila climb in a Humvee and drive down the road with the tank slowly following behind you, \"well this is interesting\" you say, Sheila looks at you, \"whats that?\" she asks, \"seeing a tank in my rear view mirror\" you tell her, she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the other section of the range, this section has a path down it designed for a tank to travel on, around that path were hill with targets hidden around the hills, this range is designed to improve the reaction of the commander at spotting targets and relaying them to his gunner, so that he can quickly bring the main gun around and hit his target. It is also designed to teach the commander that sometimes flying through is not the best method, you pull over to a small tent set up with monitors inside so that you can observe the progress of the tank on the range. The tank pulls up to the start of the range, \"ok commander you may begin when ready\" you say into your radio, \"roger Staff sergeant\" he says, the tank begins driving down the range at a fast pace. Because the driver was moving too fast the gunner missed the first three targets, but after missing those targets the tank began to decrease speed and the managed to hit the other seven targets, the tank continues down the path and eventually returns back at the beginning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming to you\" you say into your radio, \"roger\", you walk to the tank and climb back on the hull, \"obviously you didn't hit all the targets, but for your first time on this range I will say I'm impressed at how quick you realized your mistake and fixed it, you did good, but again you could be better\" you tell him, he nods \"thank you Staff sergeant\" he says. You make your way over to the loader and look in her hatch, \"how did you do?\" you ask her, \"no problems\" she tells you, \"that's what I like to hear\" you say. You look back at the commander, \"head back to the first range and unload the unused rounds\" you tell him. You walk over to the Humvee and follow the tank back to the first range, you radio him to halt next to the cargo truck to make unloading easier. After a half an hour the tank is fully unloaded, \"alright I'm going to trust you four to return this tank back to the hanger and wait for me to return, ok?\" you say, \"yes Staff sergeant\" says the tank commander. You climb off the tank and walk over to Sheila, \"I'll follow you\" you tell her, she nods and climbs in the truck and starts to drive, you get in the Humvee and follow her to the supply buildings, she parks the truck outside and walks inside the building. After a few minutes she comes back out with another soldier beside her, she signs a clipboard and hands it to him, he climbs in the truck and drives it around the back of the building. She walks over and gets in the Humvee, \"we good?\" you ask her, \"we're good\" she says, you drive back to the hanger and find the tank inside with the crew sitting on top talking. They see you drive up and climb off the tank and forma line and stand at attention, you walk over to them, \"at ease, you four worked really well today, but I still see room for improvement, tomorrow we will learn to act on the run, I'm going to throw a lot of challenges at you so this is your only warning to prepare yourselves, dismissed\" you tell them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Sheila get in the Humvee and drive down to the mess for lunch, you both grab some MRE's and get back in the Humvee to talk about tomorrows training. \"I want to teach them how to react to sudden changes, like GPS failing or having to replace a cog under fire\" you tell Sheila, \"like have them get out to navigate with a map and remove the cog?\" she asks, \"yeah something like that, something to throw them off balance.\" you tell her. The two of you continue talking about plans for tomorrow, after you finish your lunch and take care of your trash, you drive to the base gym, \"I'm going to go work out a little to help me think, I meet up with you later\" you tell Sheila, \"ok\" she says and drives off. For about two hours you work out at various stations lifting weights, you walk over to the changing room, shower off and change back into your uniform and put your workout clothing in a laundry bag in your locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk outside and find Sheila walking toward you, \"so what no---\" before you could finish a Humvee pulls up next to you and Grimes sticks his head out the door, \"get in\" he says, you and Sheila climb in the Humvee and he takes off toward the squad bay. \"We just received word that a city that was split in half, one half supported the insurgents and the other half opposed them, just became a war zone and the brass wants us to intervene\" he says. He stops and the three of you get out and run into the building and begin putting on your body armor and getting your rifles, for this fight you will me operating as a marksmen not a long range sniper. Your rifle is an HK 416 with a ACOG and fore-grip/ flashlight combo, and your sidearm is a G17 with a flashlight attachment, you grab your vest which has a backpack attached to the back. You begin loading food and medical supplies in your bag and in various pouches on your vest, you attach a hydration pack to the outside of your bag and put two spare canteens in your pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the rest of the squad and Grimes briefs the rest of the squad on the situation, \"insertion will be by Humvee and light armor here\" he points on a map, he continues the brief and points out the objectives as well as discussing troop strength, \"this is going to be like the last assault, this city is going to be huge, but there are civilians still in the city so watch your fire and check your corners. Alright load up\" he says, You climb into the third Humvee with two other soldiers, Sheila climbs into one of the armored Strykers. You ride down a road for an hour before coming into view of the city, there was civilians streaming out of the city as armed forces poured into the city, there was black smoke rising into the sky from multiple locations, a sudden clank of a bullet brought your attention back to in front of you. You hear the lead Humvee and Stryker open up with M2 machine guns and suddenly the convoy started picking up speed, suddenly there was a loud boom followed by your Humvee flying into the air and landing on its roof knocking you unconscious. You wake up sitting inside a nearby building propped up next to a wall, you look around a find that its nearly dark out, you reach over and grab your rifle laying next to you and sling it over your shoulder, you check yourself for an injuries and find none. You find your radio on the floor next to where you were sitting, you pick it up, \"this is\" you pause trying to remember the callsign Grimes gave you, \"Romeo 1-5, is anyone there?\" you say into the radio, \"roger this is Lima 2 charlie we read you, sorry we had to leave you back there Romeo, but enemy forces pushed us back before we could get to you, the rest of your company is 3 blocks north and 5 blocks east from your current position, you can try getting to them or wait until tomorrow and we can get to you\" says the voice over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger I'll try my luck and try to regroup with my company Lima 2\" you say into the radio, \"roger that, keep your eyes and ears open for snipers, Lima 2 Charlie out\" says your radio, you clip your radio to your vest and cautiously make your way up the street toward your squad. You make it the first 3 block and start to head east when a gunshot rings out, you feel something hit near your left shoulder, but doesn't go through your armor, you dive into the nearest building and take cover. You look around and see it was an apartment type building, you hear a door slam, from the sound you guess it came from the third floor, \"another sniper\" you think to yourself, slowly you climb the stairs keeping your eyes out for and traps the sniper might have laid, you make it to the third floor with you rifle raised. You clear the first two apartment rooms, but as you approach the third one you hear shuffling coming from inside, you slowly wrap a gloved hand around the handle and slowly open the door with your rifle raised ready to take down whoever was inside, the first main room was clear, you head into the hall way and slowly check each room, empty, you reach the last two rooms, but before you reach for the knob you hear a faint noise emanate from the other room. You reach for the other door handle and slowly turn it, in one quick move you swing open the door and flick on the flashlight attached to the fore-grip, you find a small, female kitsune with grey fur in the corner and judging from the lack of nine tails, she was very young. \"Hey its ok I'm not going to hurt you, you can come out\" you say in a calm voice, she looks at you and slowly stands up, she was about the size of a 5 year old human, you reach you hand out to her, but before she could reach out to you something dark and furry wrapped around your face, smothering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your rifle and attempt to remove whatever was wrapped around your face chocking you, but slowly you begin to feel light headed and despite your best attempts you black out from lack of oxygen. You wake up zip cuffed to a pipe with all your equipment missing, you look around and find yourself in a dark room with no light, you can faintly hear the sounds of fighting in the distance, \"so your awake\" you hear a female voice say, you look around the room, but it was too dark to see. \"Your lucky that I don't like to kill\" says the mystery voice, suddenly moon light begins to come in as your captor raises a blind from the window revealing to you captor was a Kitsune like the little one you found earlier, but she was about your height and she had all nine tails and also had gray fur. \"Please, let me go I'm not here to hurt you\" you tell her, \"yeah right thats what they all say\" she tells you, she begins to walk toward the door, \"please I'm a United Stated soldier, I can help you\" you tell her, you didn't know what side she was supporting, but you had to take a risk. She stops and walks back over to you and kneels down with her eyes level with yours and stares at you, \"are you telling the truth?\" she ask, \"yes I am\" you tell her, she reaches behind her back and draws a knife, \"well I guess thats it\" you think to yourself. She brings the blade toward you, but instead of killing you she cuts your cuffs and releases you, you sit there confused, and then she wraps you in a tight hug, \"I never thought I would be so relieved\" she says. She gets off you and helps you to your feet, \"I'm sorry about attacking you, I thought you were one of those insurgents\" she says, \"It's ok, who was that I found hiding?\" you ask, \"my daughter, we were just about to go to a friends house when the fighting started and we took shelter in this apartment\" she says. \"What is your name?\" you ask, \"Sahara, like the desert\" she says, \"Ok Sahara can you give me back my stuff?\" you ask, she nods and walks out of the room and you follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to the room that you found the young Kitsune in the corner, she opens up what looks like a closet and hands you back all your gear, you put your vest and sidearm back on and checked your rifle to see it was undamaged when you dropped it. Your radio on the other hand was destroyed from a bullet, \"than must be what I felt when the sniper shot at me\" you think to yourself, \"my radio is busted, but I know where I can find one, unfortunately I have to go back out, but I will be back\" you tell Sahara, \"how will I know its you when you come back?\" she asks, \"when I get to the front door I'll whistle this\" you say and whistle a three note tune, she nods, \"I'll return I promise\" you tell her, \"do you have any weapons?\" you ask, she shakes her head, \"just the knife\" she says. You pull out your sidearm and hand it to her, \"you know how to use one of these?\" you ask, \"yeah a little bit\" she says, \"ok line up the dots with what you want to hit and pull the trigger, there are 15 shots before its out\" you tell her, you pull on the slide and load the gun, you hand the gun to her. \"Listen for my signal, keep the door locked until I return ok?\" you tell her. You leave the apartment and slowly make your way down the stairs and back onto the street, you pull out your NVGs and put them on giving you a better chance at spotting any snipers. You manage to make it back to where you woke up in the building, you find the overturned Humvee and crawl inside you find another radio in working order, you look around and find at least three more MRE's and two canteens which you place in a duffle and sling it over your shoulder. You crawl out of the Humvee and start your way back to the apartment building, you pause at the corner where the sniper first shot at you, you slowly peak around the corner and see nothing so your quickly run across the street to the apartment building, making it without incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up to the third floor and whistle your signal, Sahara open the door, \"I'm back\" you whisper, she opens the door and lets you in, she closes and locks the door again and follows you into the back room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk into the back room and set down the duffle from the Humvee with the extra food, you pull out your radio and set the volume on its lowest setting, \"Lima 2 charlie do you copy?\" you whisper, \"roger Romeo 1-5\" says your radio, \"be advised I have located two civilians that are currently hiding in an apartment complex, break, I think I'll stay with them until someone can get to me to get them out, how copy\", you whisper into the radio, \"roger good copy, reinforcements should make it to you guys by morning or mid day, how copy?\" says the person on the radio, \"good copy, I'm signing off for the night, I'll contact you if something changes, over\" you say into your radio, \"10-4\". You put the radio back in the duffle, \"you guys hungry?\" you ask Sahara, \"yeah a little bit we haven't eaten since this whole thing started\" she says, you pull out two MRE's and hand them to her, \"sorry they're not fresh food, but these are all I've got\" you tell her, she nods and takes them. \"Don't use the heater packs here, use them in the hallways to hide the heat signature from snipers\" you tell her, \"oh I almost forgot here\" she hands back your sidearm, you place it back into your leg holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip out to the hallway to heat up the MRE meals, after a few seconds you return with the heated meals, you hand one to Sahara and hand the other one to her daughter, who looks at you for a long time and then looks at her mother, who nods to her, she looked back at you nervous, \"its ok\" you say in a calm voice. You drop down to a knee and hold out your other gloved hand to show her that you weren't going to hurt her, she slowly walks forward and takes the packet of heated food and walks over to sit next to her mother. \"She reminds me of one of my sisters\" you tell Sahara, \"how old is your sister?\" she asks, \"almost seven years old\" you tell her, you walk to the opposite side of the room and sit on the floor leaning agains the wall, you take off your helmet and set it on the floor. You set your rifle down next to your helmet and start to drift off to sleep, you wake up in the middle of the night to find someone placed a pillow under your head and covered you with a blanket, you look over and see Sahara and her daughter laying together also cover with a blanket, you get up and find the bathroom and do your business, but you don't dare flush and risk giving away your position, you walk back to the room and sit back down next to your rifle, \"trouble sleeping?\" you hear a voice whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and see Sahara looking at you, \"yeah a little\" you tell her, you slide over to sit next to her so you both can talk and not risk wake her daughter, \"what do you do in the military?\" she asks quietly, \"I'm an infantryman, I used to work with tanks, but now I work as a sniper.\" you whisper back, \"I thought snipers work in pairs?\" she whispers, \"we do I just got separated from my spotter when we entered the city\" you tell her. \"What's your spotter's name?\" she asks, \"Sheila, she's a Kitsune like you , but she has red/ brown fur instead of gray fur.\" you tell her. \"Wait did you say her name was Sheila?\" she asks, \"yeah why?\" you ask, \"well my late husband was imprisoned by the insurgents and he told me he met a kitsune like the one you just described, and he told him a story about his daughter named Sheila\" she tells you, your eyes go wide, \"how recent was this?\" you whisper loudly. \"a little less that three weeks ago, why?\" she asks \" do you know where this detainment center is?\" you ask, avoiding the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah every one who lived in this city knew where it is, the insurgents didn't even try to hide it\" she says, \"can you show me on my map where it is?\" you ask, \"if you can get my daughter to safety I can take you there myself\" she says, you look at her, \" are you sure?\" you ask, \"yes, this man sounds important and I want to help the best I can\" she says. \"Ok you have my word I will get your daughter to safety even if that means I have to give my life to protect the two of you\" you tell her, \"I believe you\" she says, \"Do you know how long this man was there?\" you ask, \"my husband said he looked like he was there for a long time\", she says. You slide back over and lay down, cover up and fall back to sleep, you wake up and see its about three in the morning, you see Sahara starting to wake up too, she yawns and looks at you, \"what time is it?\" she ask sleepily, you look at your watch, \"3:40\" you tell her. You notice the date on your watch, you chuckle quietly, \"what?\" asks Sahara, \"well today is my birthday\" you tell her smiling, \"well then happy birthday,\" she says, she stops and looks toward the door, ears twitching. You remember Sheila doing that when you were training to be a sniper and she had sensed a patrol that was looking for you, you grab your sidearm and head toward the door to investigate, you make it into the hallway before something knocks your sidearm out of your hand and hits you in the face sending you back into the room. You land on your back and look toward the door to see someone in a mixture of camouflage uniforms and a scarf wrapped around there face standing in the doorway with a rifle trained on you, \"stupid soldier\" he says to you. He looks to his left at Sahara, \"for harboring this enemy you will be executed as an enemy \" he says, he draws his sidearm and aims at her and her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you jump to your feet and jump in between him and Sahara just as he pulls the trigger, you feel the round pass through your armor and hit you in the left hip area, but that doesn't stop you from charging and tackling him, you begin punching him in the face and head with your fists, he counters by hitting you in you now wounded side and throwing you off him, he shoves you toward the front room and runs at you with his knife drawn, he lunges at you, but you manage to grab his wrist at stop him from stabbing you, you counter by head butting him using your helmet to your advantage as he wasn't wearing a helmet. You bring one of your knees up into his groin making him drop the knife and fall to a knee, but he quickly recovers and slams into you forcing you out onto the balcony which didn't have any railings, just some metal posts sticking out of the concrete. He runs at you agin and grabs onto you knocking you on the ground, the two of you roll on the ground exchanging punches, unaware that you are rolling toward the edge on the balcony, he manages to get on top of you and goes to throw a punch, you see that you are at the very edge on the balcony and you throw a punch into his side and roll over the edge, but you manage to grab on to one of the metal post sticking out of the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attacker how ever falls to his death, you attempt to climb back up, but your gloves can't get a grip on the smooth concrete and your other hand is starting to slip off the post, \"I guess this is it\" you say to yourself, but just as your hand loses its grip on the post and furry paw grabs your hand and starts to pull you up. You look up to see Sahara pulling you up, once she manages to get your upper torso on the balcony she grabs your belt and pulls you the rest of the way up. After she pulls you the rest of the way onto the balcony you get to your feet and slowly walk back inside, \"thank you\" you tell her, \"I should be the one thanking you\" she says, she helps you walk back to the far room and sets you down. You sit down and carefully remove your vest to inspect your wound, the bullet had hit one of the far corners of the ceramic plate in your vest, but still went through and stopped in the rear plate, you pull up your combat shirt and look at the wound, \"here I can help, I worked at a hospital before this all started\" says Sahara, she looks at the wound, \"its not serious, but it will require some stitches, where are your medical supplies?\" she asks, you point to the backpack attached to your vest. She opens it and pulls out any medical supplies she could find, she finds some surgical sutures and prepares to stitch the wound, \"this may hurt\" she says, \"what like getting shot didn't hurt?\" you say jokingly, she begins stitching the wound shut on both sides, after stitching it shut she applied some gauze and wrapped the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all done\" she says, you roll your shirt back down and put your vest back on, \"thanks again\" you tell her, you look at your watch, it wasn't even six o'clock yet. You pull out the radio, \"Lima 2 charlie, where are you guys?\" you say into the radio, \"Romeo 1-5, our eta is about two hours, we are encountering heavy resistance from the west, wait one\" says your radio, \"be advised Romeo 1-3 is attempting to make their way to you from the east, break, they should be there in half an hour if they don't run into any trouble, over\" says the radio, \"roger that Lima 2, I'll advise you when Romeo 1-3 arrives, 1-5 out\" you say to the radio. You put your radio back in the duffle, \"looks like rescue will be here in half an hour\", you tell Sahara, you get up and locate your sidearm from where it landed during the scuffle and return it to its holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into the duffle and pull out a canteen, \"thirsty?\" you ask, Sahara nods, you open the canteen and hand it to her, she takes a sip and hands it to to her daughter who takes a bigger sip. She hands it back to Sahara who hands it back to you, \"there are two canteens and two MRE's in this duffle for the two of you\" you tell her, she nods, but stops and does the ear twitch thing again, \"what is it now?\" you whisper, \"theres a vehicle approaching, wait it just stopped and if I had to guess about a block from here\" she says. \"What direction?\" you ask, she shakes her head, \"can't tell\" she says, you grab you rifle and move into the first room to get into a good defensive position. You hear boots making their way up to the third floor and stop outside the door, you tighten your grip in your rifle and flick the selector switch to full auto and take aim.</span></div></div>",

All of you walk out of the apartment and head down the stairs the the main lobby where there was another soldier standing watch in the main door, \"anything?\" asks Sheila, \"no\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Sheila, Sahara, her daughter and three other soldiers cautiously walk down the street toward the waiting Stryker, as you approach the vehicle the rear door drops and you start loading into the back, suddenly a single gunshot rings out followed by a scream you turn around to see one of the other soldiers fall holding his leg. You run back you and help him back to the Stryker, to cover you the Stryker's heavy machine gun opens up in the direction where the shot came from, Sheila climbs back out and helps you carry the wounded soldier into the Stryker. The rear door seals up muffling the shots from the M2 firing on the roof of the Stryker, \"we're Oscar Mike\" you hear the drive yell as you feel the Stryker lurch into motion, one of the medic in the squad started treating the soldier's wounded leg. You continue riding in the Stryker for half an hour before coming to a halt, the rear hatch drops again letting the bright sunlight pour into the dark compartment, You climb out and wait for Sheila to climb out, \"take them somewhere safe to get cleaned up and properly fed while I go talk to Grimes\" you tell her pointing to Sahara and her daughter, \"you got it\" she says. She walks over to Sahara and leads her away toward the temporary mess hall, you turn around and look for Grimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Grimes, \"there you are, been worried about you\" he says, \"well I've got even more good news\" you tell him, this catches his attention, \"tell\" he says, \"I know the location of a prison camp that is currently holding innocent civilians most likely people who don't support these insurgents.\" you tell him, \"alright I'll task a squad to handle it\" he says, \"no I want to handle it\" you tell him. \"Why?\" he asks confused, \"because the person that told me said that when her husband was imprisoned there he met another Kitsune who talked about his daughter named Sheila...... I think I found Sheila's father\" you tell him, he pauses and thinks this over. \"Are you sure?\" he asks, \"yes\" you tell him, \"remind me to punch that spook when we get back\" he tells you, \"why?\" you ask, \"because Sheila's father was my squad leader when I was a private and that spook sent him on a mission that he didn't return from and told us all that he died in combat\" he says, you stare at him in shock. \"Alright you can take it, who else do you need?\" he asks breaking the silence, \"Sheila, myself and the civilian we rescued, she knows the way, we can scout out for the rest of the main rescue force\" you tell him, \"ok, get the civilian armored up, you and your girlfriend will set up here with the civilian and give us eyes on until the main forces are ready\" he says pointing to a map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait me and my what?\" you say, \"oh come on you don't have to hide it I know more than you think and besides there is no regulation against it as long as it doesn't hinder your ability to operate as a team\" he says, you nod and walk away, you find Sheila walking toward you, \"did you tell Grimes about us?\" you ask quietly, \"no, I told no one, why?\" she asks in a concerned voice, \"because he knows, but according to him its not against the regulations as long as it doesn't affect our ability to work as a team\" you tell her, you see her relax and breath a sigh of relief. \"Ok we have a prison camp that is going to be liberated, but they need us to go in ahead of the assault force and scout it out\" you tell her leaving out the part about her father possibly being at this camp, \"where is this camp located?\" she asks, you shrug, \"don't know\" you tell her, \"well how are we going to scout it out if we don't where it is?' she asks confused, \"the civilian we rescued knows where it is and she wants to help, so lets go get her snapped in and get her a weapon\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sheila walk to the mess and find Sahara and her daughter eating some fresh cooked food, you walk over and sit across the table from her and she looks at you, \"well?\" she asks, \"its a go, but we need to get you some type of protection and a weapon and a place for your daughter to be safe\" you tell her, \"what about leaving her with Grimes?\" Sheila asked, \"that could be an option since he isn't taking part in the assault\" you say, \"ok can i have a moment with my daughter while I explain whats going on?\" Sahara asks, \"sure take all the time you need and when your ready head to the tent across the street and you'll fine us there\" you tell her. You and Sheila get up and leave, you walk into the tent and gather whatever equipment you might need for this mission, after about ten minutes Sahara walks in without her daughter, you get up and start getting her some body armor, helmet, a fresh uniform, and a pair of boots, \"its going to take some getting used to, but this will help save your life\" you tell her as your adjust the straps on the vest. She didn't want a rifle so you hand her a sidearm, \"you still remember how to use one of these?\" you ask her, she nods, since she didn't have to carry any rifle ammo that made room for her to carry extra medial, food, water and pistol ammo. \"Alright we're all set, are you still sure you want to do this?\" you ask Sahara, \"yes I still want to help the best I can\" she says, you nod, \"lets go talk to Grimes and get briefed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in another tent and find Grimes with Sahara's daughter talking to her, he sees you walk in so he stands up and walks over to the three of you and goes over the insertion plan, \"the three of you will remain in this location monitoring the enemies movements until the main assault force arrives in two days, during the assault you will meet up with the lead elements and assist in anyway possible, you will then exfil with the main assault force once we have freed the prisoners, questions?, no ok load up\" he says. The three of you walk out to a Stryker and climb in. The Stryker takes you down a road for an hour before pulling over and letting you out, \"we'll be back in two days to assault that prison\" says the Stryker commander, you nod and head toward your look out marked on the map.</span></div></div>",

You look at your watch, \"hey its 15:30(3:30) I would like to get in position before 19:45(7:45), sound fair?\" you say, \"yeah at this pace we should be there before that\" says Sahara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip to top of mountain*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you finally reach the top of the mountain, you check your watch, 18:12(6:12), you walk along the mountain looking for a good spot to provide overwatch and remain hidden for two days, Sheila nudges your shoulder and points to a small cave in the side of the mountain, \"lets check it out\" you say, the three of you walk toward the small cave, it was small enough that only one of you could pass through at a time, but it was well hidden and had a good clear view of the prison compound at the bottom of the mountain. You turn on the flashlight attached your rifle and crawl in the hole, you sweep your light around the cave walls, it was tall enough that you didn't have to crouch down when you were inside, the cave ended ten yards in, there was no sign of any animals living inside, you walk back to the entrance, \"we're clear\" you say to Sheila and Sahara. Sheila hands her rifle to you and crawls into the cave, you help her in and then hand her rifle back to her, you turn around and help Sahara into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your gear down next to the entrance and you sit down against the cave wall and pull your boonie hat over your eyes and start to drift off to sleep, you wake up to the feeling of something sliding over your chest and arms, \"Sheila is that you?\" you whisper, a kiss on your cheek answers your question, she pulls you closer to her with her tails and arms, she lays her muzzle on your neck and falls asleep, soon you drift back to sleep. You wake up to something tapping on your cheek, you open your eyes to see Sheila kissing you repeatedly on your cheek, she stops and smiles at you, \"how long were you doing that?\" you ask sleepily, \"only for a few minutes\" she says.

You move toward your gear and pull out a radio and notepad, Sheila walks over with her spotter scope, the two of your set up near the entrance and begin observing the compound below, you continue for two hours until Sahara wakes up from her sleep. \"Sleep well?\" you ask, she nods and stretches her arms, \"how long was I out?\" she asks, \"at least 8 hours\" you tell her, \"hey I've got to step outside for a minute\" says Sheila, you move over and let her out. She climbs out and cautiously walks off, Sahara walks over to you, \"did you tell her about her father possibly being in that prison?\" she asks, \"no, not yet\" you tell her. \"I think you should, she has a right to know, but the choice is yours.\" she says.

For the next 13 hours you observe the prison, taking notes on troop strength, making notes when trucks enter and leave the compound, mapping out guard movement, and prisoner movement. \"Alright lets set up the radio and make a report\" you tell Sheila, the two of you climb out of the cave and head to the highest point that was closest to the cave, you climb up and set up the radio and make your report back to the main assault force. \"Is that all you have to report right now?\" asks Grimes on the other end of the radio, \"yes that conclude my report of the compound so far, will report if there are any changes\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be advised time until the main assault force arrives has been extended to three days, how copy?\" says Grimes, you sigh, \"roger good copy, main force will be here in three days,\" you say repeating Grimes' last transmission, you put the radio away and make your way back to the cave, \"coming in\" you whisper as you near the entrance to let Sahara know it was you.

The two of you walk back to the entrance and set up your observation gear again and begin watching to see if there were any changes during the night, after about observing for an hour, Sahara walks up behind the two of you with some heated MRE meals, and some MRE coffee.

You crawl out of the cave and turn around to help the other two, after gathering your gear the three of you make your way down the mountain, keeping watch for any patrols. You make it to the bottom of the mountain and take cover in some bushes, \"alright command we are in position, \"you say into your radio, \"be advised your new callsign is Romeo 1-3, main assault force is now Haymaker\" says Grimes on your radio, \"roger 1-3 out\" you say putting away the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting two hours you hear the faint sounds of helicopter rotors followed by the sound of a jet engine. You look up and see an A-10 warthog fight headed toward the prison, you see a cloud of smoke emit from the front of the plane that lasted for about three seconds and then it repeated. The plane then pulled out of its dive and flew off, you turn your attention to the prison and see the two watch towers disappear in a cloud of smoke, seconds after the towers fall you hear the \"BBRRRRRTTTTT.......BBBRRRRRRTTT\" sound of the main gun firing from the A-10. Second later you watch three Blackhawk helicopters land and drop off 8 soldiers per helicopter. You hear the sound of gunfire emanate from them as they run toward the prison to secure it, \"Grimes did the main assault force just arrive?\" you ask into your radio, \"thats part of it, the half the you are going to meet with will arrive in light armor and Humvees they should be there any moment now\" he says, just as he finished talking the first Humvee comes driving up toward the compound followed by a Stryker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you make your way toward the first Humvee, taking care not to get caught in the open to be shot at. You reach the first Humvee and take cover behind it, \"who's in charge here?\" you yell over the shooting, \"she is\" says on of the soldiers, pointing to a female werewolf anthro with the rank of Major on her vest, she turns and looks at you, \"are you guys Romeo 1-3?\" she asks, \"yes ma'am are you Haymaker?\" you ask, \"yes I am Sergeant, I need you guys to move up with a squad callsign Haymaker 1-5 and start securing the prison cells\" she says pointing to another squad taking cover behind a wall inside the compound. The three of you move from cover to cover, making your way toward the squad behind the wall, you reach the wall and meet up with the squad, one of the soldiers with the name White on his vest looks at you \"are you 1-3?\" White asked, \"thats us\" you answer, \"alright see that building over there? Thats where we believe the prisoners are being kept, we can't be sure, but thats our best guess from your intel.\" says the squad leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have someone to look after her?\" you point to Sahara, \"sure, Mendez you stay with her\" he says, \"yes Sargent,\" says Mendez, he moves over and crouches next to Sahara to protect her from any gunfire. \"Alright ready, go\" yells the squad leader and the eight of you run across the open yard toward the prison cells. As you run you can hear bullets snapping at the ground around you, you started swearing and praying to run faster, you all reach the prison cell doors and stack up on the door with four on each side and Sahara and Mendez following last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and White take point walking down a tiled corridor, the two of you stop when you come to an intersection, \"straight or left?\" you ask, \"I'll take straight you take left\" says White. You peak around the corner, but before you could finish turning the corner the wall around your head exploded in a shower of dust and rock, quickly you duck back around the corner, \"I saw at least two before they shot at me\" you tell White, \"draw their fire again, I've got an idea\" he says, you jump around the corner and fire off a burst from your rifle and then jump back before they had a chance to shoot back. You look over and see White had ran across the hall and was on the other corner, \"you take high I'll take low\" he says, you nod and then turn the corner again and fire off two shots, White does the same; four shots, two dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lets split up, you four with me\" says White he points to Mendez, Sahara, and a soldier named Jackson, \"the rest of you follow the Staff sergeant\" he says. You, Sheila and two soldiers named Bradley and Malcolm follow you down the left corridor while White leads his team down the other corridor. You and your team walk down the corridor with rifles drawn until you come to a turn in the hallway and agin you begin to peek around the corner, but this time no one shoots at you, instead there were rows of cells followed by an empty guard station at the end of the hallway. You silently signal for the other three to spread out and clear the rest of the room, after ten minutes they came back and reported all clear, \"White, we found some prisoner, but no guards\" you say into your headset, \"same here, its like they didn't even try defending the cells\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we're going to secure what prisoners we have here and try to move them to somewhere safer\" you tell White, \"roger that, its a dead end hear so we'll head toward you with the prisoners and meet up with you\" he say. \"I'll leave Bradley and Malcolm her to meet you while Sheila and I continue to look for any other prisoners,\" you say, \"roger\", you look at Sheila, \"check the computer in the guard station for any other prisoners and where they are being held\" you tell her, she nods and run into the station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Sheila into the guard station and begin unlocking the cells, Bradley and Malcolm open the cells and begin help the prisoners out, you turn to Sheila, \"find anything\" you ask \"there are no other prisoners any where else in the building?\" she says, \"what about your father?\" you ask, \"still looking\" she says. \"I hate to do this, but you got five minutes\" you tell her, she nods and returns her attention to the computer, a few minutes later she calls out, \"I think I found him\", \"where?\" you ask. \"Solitary one floor down\" she tells you, you walk over and look over her shoulder at the monitor, it said: Joseph Alekseev , followed by his description and a mug shot of him, it occurred to you that you never knew Sheila's last name. \"White, we have one more prisoner that needs to be rescued you begin the evacuation while we go get him\" you say into your radio, \"roger that we'll catch up with you topside\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets go get him\" you tell Sheila, the two of you run out of the guard station, \"get those prisoners ready for evac, White is going to met up here soon\" you tell Bradley and Malcolm. You and Sheila find the stairs and head down them at a fast pace, at the bottom of the stairs were rows of empty rooms, but at the end of the hallway was one locked cell. You shoot out the lock and open the cell door and inside was a male kitsune who looked like Sheila and he was in tattered clothing, sitting in the far corner. He looks up at the two of you standing in the doorway, \" whats going on out there?\" he asks \"we're getting all of you out of here\" you tell him. He tries to stand, but falls back down, Sheila runs over and helps him up, he looks at Sheila, \"I have a daughter that looks like you\" he says, Sheila starts to tear up a little, Joseph looks at you confused, \"do you remember what her name is?\" asks Sheila, he nods. \"Yeah her name is Sheila\" he says, then he pauses and looks over at Sheila and then it hits him, \"Sh--Sheila?\" he says slowly, she nods, they both embrace in a tight hug and sobbing into each others shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know you feel a pain in your upper back, you drop to a knee and spin around, rifle drawn and let off two shots dropping the insurgent that shot you from the end of the hall way. \"You good?\" you hear Sheila ask from behind you, \"yeah I don't think it went through the plate\" you tell her, you get to your feet, \"alright I hate to break up this reunion, but we need to get topside now\" you tell Sheila and Joseph, Sheila helps Joseph to his feet and walks him out of the cell toward the stairs with you taking point making sure there were no other insurgents hiding. You slowly make your way up the stairs to the first floor where you see Malcolm escorting the last prisoner out of the cell blocks, he looks at you,\"last one Staff sergeant\" he says, you lower your rifle and follow him down the hallway with Sheila walking behind you with her father's arm draped over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you walk until you reach the first intersection, standing there was White and Sahara directing the flow of prisoners, White looks at you, \"He's the last one\" you tell him, \"alright the fighting has died down enough I think we can risk loading them up into the Strykers\" he says, you nod, \"lets get it done\" you tell him. White runs off into the flow of prisoners to help load them in the waiting Strykers, you stay with Sahara to help guide the prisoners along, \"I think that's the last one\" Sahara says, but before you could say anything you hear an RPG flying through the air and slam into the wall next to you and Sahara bringing parts of the wall and ceiling down on top of the two of you.</span></div></div>",

You feel movement on top of you as the rubble begins to shift, you see a small crack of light pierce through the darkness, gradually that light began to increase in size until you could tell that someone was trying to dig you out. Your eyes focused enough that you could see that White and Jackson were digging you out, but you couldn't hear what they were saying, it sounded like someone put wax over your ears making everything sound muffled. after White and Jackson finished digging you out your hearing started to return slowly, \"where's Sahara?\" you ask, \"we're still digging her out\" you hear Jackson say, you look to where she was before the RPG hit and you see Bradley and Mendez digging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble over and start digging with them, after 10 minutes of digging you managed to uncover Sahara's head, you check her pulse, \"she alive, I think she only got knocked out from the explosion\" you yell over to White. The three of you continue digging her out, after finally uncovering her you notice that her leg is broken, \"I need a splint\" you yell over your shoulder, moments later Jackson runs up to you with a makeshift splint in his hands, you set the splint on both sides of her leg and tie it on. After checking her for any other wounds and finding none you pick her up fireman style and begin walking toward the front door, you find an empty Humvee and load her into the middle of the Humvee and then you climb into the rear passenger seat followed by White in the driver seat, Mendez in the front passenger seat, and the Major you met earlier climbed into the other passenger seat next to you, \" ok we're Oscar Mike\" she says into her radio, the Humvee speeds off with the rest of the convoy following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip ahead a few hours*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were asleep in the chair in Sahara's hospital room, you are woken up by someone hitting your knee, you look and see Grimes standing there, \"how long was I out?\" you ask, \"about an hour\" he says. \"What's the status on the city?\" you ask, \"we're rotating out, Bravo company is taking over\" he says, \"so what's up?\" you ask, \"I just wanted to check on you and Sheila, I hear you found her father\" he says, \"yes we did, where is Sheila anyway?\" you ask, \"down the hall with her father\" says Grimes. In the bed next to you Sahara started to wake up, \"where am I?\" she asks in a tired voice, you sit up in the chair, \"its ok your in the infirmary you have a broken leg and got hit on the head\" you tell her, \"can I see my daughter?\" she asks, \"sure, I'll go get her\" says Grimes, he turns and leaves. Sahara turns and looks at you, \"he's a good man\" she says, you nod, \"that he is\", moments later Grimes comes back with Sahara's daughter walking next to him, \"mommy\" she screams running over to Sahara, Sahara lift her up in a hug. You stand up and walk over to Grimes who was still standing in the door, you look over and smile at him and walk out of the room, he walks over and sits in the chair next to Sahara, you walk down the hall and find the room with Sheila's father in it and peek inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Sheila asleep in a chair next to her father's bed while he slept, you walk out of the infirmary toward you living quarters.

Then you head out toward the mess for breakfast, you finish your food and go back up and get another serving of food and a coffee to go and leave toward the infirmary, you walk down the halls toward the room with Sheila's father in it. You look inside and see Sheila still asleep in a chair and her father still asleep in the bed, you knock on the door; nothing, you walk in and tap Sheila on the shoulder, she jumps awake and looks at you,\" sorry, I thought that you could use some chow\" you say holding out the food and coffee, she takes them both, \"thanks\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at her father, \"how's he doing?\" you ask, \"dehydration, slightly malnourished, the usual prisoner injuries\" she says, you grab another chair and sit next to her, \"how are you?\" you ask calmly, she sighs, \"I'll be fine, its going to take some time, but I'm fine\" she says, you set you hand on her arm, \"if you need someone\" you start, before you could finish she lean in and gives you a small kiss on the cheek, \"I know\" she says with a smile. You stand up, \"do you need anything else while I'm up?\" you ask, \"it might sound weird, but some company would be nice\" she says, you nod and sit back down, the two of you talk about what your going to do once you get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of talking, Sheila's father starts to wake up, Sheila gets up and walks over to his side and takes his paw in hers. \"How are you feeling?\" she asks, \"still a little tired, but I feel better\" he says, the two of them lock stares and hold it with you watching confused, after what seemed like half an hour Sheila's father glances over at you and then back a Sheila. A smile forms on Sheila's face and she nods, \"I hate to interrupt this family discussion, but can someone tell me whats going on?\" you ask confused, \"we were just talking about you\" says Sheila, she looks over at you and sees that your still confused, <i>\"we were talking like this\"</i> you hear in your head, \"I forgot you could do that\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheila tells me you are a good man, you have your own troubles, but you've gotten better\" says Joseph, you look over at Sheila, \"did she tell you anything else?\" you ask, he nods, \"she did tell me that the two of you were sort of seeing each other\" he adds. \"What is your opinion on that?\" you ask calmly, he looks at you, \"I think you are a good choice for my daughter\" he finally says, you feel something brush your shoulder, you turn and see it was one of Sheila's tails. You look at her and see her smiling at you, you look back at Joseph and see he had a smile of approval on his face, the three of you talk for a few minutes. You offer to go get him some food and something to drink, he nods, you leave the room and head back toward the mess hall to grab some more food,  you walk in and grab another serving of food in a foam box, a coffee and a bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and walk back to the infirmary to Joseph's room and hand the food to Sheila and set the cup of coffee and bottled water on a tray next to his bed. You drag two chairs over and set them next to his bedside, you and Sheila sit in the chairs and continue talking to Joseph, telling him a little about your past, how you and Sheila met and later became sniper and spotter. While you are talking you feel one of Sheila's tails loosely wrap around your forearm, you hear a knock on the door, you look and see Grimes standing there, \"can I talk to the two of you for a minute?\" he asks, you and Sheila get up and follow him into the hall, \"I just got word that we're going to be sending him back home for better treatment\" he says, \"when are you sending him home\" Sheila asks, \"friday of next week\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also there has been a change in the deployment, we're going home a little early, two days after your father we are being sent to Italy for two weeks then back to the United States,\" he adds. \"Why so early?\" you ask, he shrugs, \"don't know. that's all they told me\" he says, \"ok thats all I got\" he adds, you and Sheila walk back into Joseph's room and sit back in the chairs and explain what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think for a minute before it dawns on, \"todays the day we're getting out of here\" you say, she smiles, \"there you go\" she says. She lays her head on your chest and sighs, \"we should start packing\" she says, \"well I can't do that with you on me\" you joke, she lifts her head and gives you a kiss, \"well then I guess we should get up\" she says.

You both grab some food and sit at a nearby table and begin eating your breakfast while talking about what to do when you get to Italy, Sheila nudges your arm, you look at her and see she is looking over your shoulder so you turn around to see what she was seeing. You see Sahara on crutches walking in followed by Grimes and Sahara's daughter, what surprised you was that Sahara's daughter was holding Grimes' hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk over and sit at your table, \"hows the leg?\" you ask Sahara, \"its getting better, I never got to thank you for getting me out of there\" she says. \"So are you and Grimes going to Italy too?\" you ask, \"yeah\" she says, you look back at Grimes, \"what time are we getting out of here?\" you ask. \"Three hours from now, we'll be flying out by chinook to an airbase and then transfer onto the plane that will take us out of here, bring your stuff to the squad bay when your ready.\" he says, you nod and finish your food. You and Sheila stick around and talk for a few minutes before leaving to collect your gear, you grab your bags and head to the squad bay to stow your gear and hang out till its time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*a few hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sitting at a table with your feet propped up watching Sheila practicing her abilities, this time she was trying to move a pen across the table, she levitates the pen up into the air and slowly makes it float toward you, without flinching you grab the pen out of the air and stick it in one of your sleeve pockets. \"You're getting good at that\" you tell her, she smiles, \"my father tells me that there is much more I can do, like healing\" she says, \"well that could be handy if we need it\" you tell her. You hear the faint sound to helicopters, \"I guess our rides are here\" you say, you both get up and grab your gear and head to the front of the squad bay. \"Oh crap\" you say patting your pockets, \"what?\" Sheila asks, \"I left my phone on my desk, I don't think I can grab it and be back in time\" you tell her. \"Don't worry I got it\" she says, you turn around and see she was gone, you search for her, but you don't see her, you turn around again and suddenly there she was, making you jump back and trip over your duffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs over and helps you up\" sorry I didn't mean to scare you\" she says, \"where did you go?\" you ask, \"to get your phone\" she says. She hands your phone to you, \"wha- how?\" you sputter, \"I can teleport\" she says, \"really?\" you ask, \"yeah watch\" she says. Suddenly she disappears, you feel someone tap on your shoulder, you turn around and see Sheila standing there, \"impressive\" you say, she smiles, \"come on helos are almost here\" she says. You grab your bags and follow Sheila to the heli pads with the rest of the company, ten minutes later a couple chinook helicopters land and you climb up the ramp inside where you find a seat and sit down with your duffle between your legs. Sheila follows you and sits next to you, Grimes follows behind Sheila and sits across from you with Sahara and her daughter sitting next to him. Grimes leans over \"two hours and then we get on the planes to Italy\" he yells over the sound of the rotors, he sits back in him seat as the ramp starts to rise and you feel the helicopter lift into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a pair of shooting ear plugs and put them in to block the sound of the engine so you can try to get some sleep. You feel something shaking your shoulder, you open your eyes and see Grimes shaking you awake, \"ten minutes\" he says, you look over and see Sheila asleep on your shoulder. You almost didn't want to wake her, but you had to, you raised your shoulder and shook her awake, \"ten minutes\" you tell her, she yawns and nods. You put away the ear plugs and get ready to get off the helicopter, you feel the chinook land and the ramp drops down, everyone in the helicopter stands up and makes their way down the ramp onto the tarmac runway. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You walk out to the living room and lay on the couch and turn on the TV to see what was on, you surf through the channels before settling on some movie that was playing, you didn't know what the movie was about, but five minutes later you begin to drift off to sleep on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up feeling a little bit refreshed, but you notice a weight on your chest.

She had changed out of her uniform and was barefoot, wearing a pair of shorts the stopped above her kneecaps and a tank to that showed some of her cream colored midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, apparently you were staring at her, \"sorry, its just that I've never seen you dress like that\" you tell her. \"Well I decided to put on something a little bit more comfortable\" she says as she walks into the kitchen to get two glasses of water. You undo your uniform jacket and lay it across the side of the couch and grab your food from the coffee table. \"Thats new\" Sheila says as she sits next to you, \"what is?\" you ask, she points to your left upper arm. You look at your arm and see she was talking about the tattoo half hidden under your sleeve, you roll up your sleeve so she can see the whole thing. It was a tattoo of the Grim Reaper dressed up in WWII style paratrooper gear with the airborne motto above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me and a couple other guys from my airborne group got them after we finished jump school\" you tell her as she runs clawed finger around the tattoo, \"did it hurt at all?\" she asks. \"Not really, but thats just me\" you tell her, \"come on foods getting cold\" you tell her, breaking her focus on your arm. She leans over and gives you a kiss on the cheek, \"thanks for running out to get this\" she says, the two of you dig into your food. You both finish your food and set the empty boxes on the coffee table and talk about what to do later, \"so do you want to go out and walk around?\" you ask, Sheila lays across your lap and looks at you, \"or we could stay in and figure something out\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Soon the plane was pulling into a terminal, you were fidgeting in your seat, anxious to deplane and finally be on US soil again for the first time in almost two years. As soon as the plane docked and the door opened you were already out of your seat and half way down the aisle toward the door. You walked down the terminal with your assault bag/carry on on your back, the first thing you saw as you turned the corner was a large group of people waiting to welcome you home. As you got near everyone began clapping and trying to shake your hand at once, after what felt like hours of shaking hand and receiving pats on the back you finally manage to get through the greeters and retrieve your duffle from the baggage claim. You feel someone lightly punch you on the shoulder, \"leaving without me?\" you hear, you turn and see Sheila staring at you, \"take any longer and I just might\" you joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou receive another punch in the shoulder, after the two of you retrieve your duffles you track down Grimes, \"hey Grimes we're headed out\" you say, \"ok, remember to report in back at Plattsburgh AFB in one month from now. Now shoo before I start to get emotional\" he says waving his paw at you. You pat him on the shoulder and leave with Sheila in tow, as you walk outside you got hit by a wave of frigid air filled with snow, \"Mmm snow, thats something I haven't seen in a long time\" you say to yourself. You turn and look at Sheila, who seemed surprised by the sight of the snow, \"whats the matter, never seen snow before?' you ask her, \"yeah I have, just not so much at once\" she says. You nod understandingly, the two of you sit at a bus stop and talk, \"so just to let you know, my mother doesn't know about us dating yet\" you say, \"well we're going to have to tell her eventually, but I won't say anything until you're ready\" Sheila says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a small smile and set your hand over her paw, just then the bus arrived, as you boarded you flashed your military ID to the driver and turned to take a seat. When you turned you saw there were only about four other people on the bus, but one face stood out, you must have froze up because Sheila gave you a light push from behind. As you take your seats and the bus started moving, Sheila turned to face you, \"what was that about?\" she asks, \"um the girl sitting behind us on the left is my ex-girlfriend  from high school\" you say quietly, Sheila shrugs, \"so I bet she's over that\" she says. \"Well I broke up with her because she cheated on me, but she tried to turn everything on me and lets just say she didn't like the fact that she couldn't control me\" you say. \"So you're saying she might make a scene?\" Sheila asks, \"I don't know she didn't seem to recognize me so...\" you say with a shrug.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you the bus ride to your mothers house wasn't that long, but the bus didn't go directly to the house so you and Sheila had to walk the last block on foot through the snow. \"So when do you want to tell your mother?\" Sheila asks, \" if the question comes up I'll tell her\" you say as you walk up the drive way to the house. You knock on the door and your mother answers, when she saw you she didn't say anything and just wrapped you in a hug, \"I didn't expect you to be home so soon\" she said. As she releases you she notices Sheila standing behind you, \" and you must be Sheila, I'm glad we can finally meet in person\" she says shaking Sheila's hand, the two of you enter the house and leave your duffles by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear three sets of feet come running through the house towards you, around the corner come your younger siblings ranging in age from seven to twelve. You drop to a knee and receive a giant group hug from all three them, \"easy\" you say as you almost fall over from the force of the hugs, just then they noticed Sheila standing behind you and let go of you. Two of your siblings named Violet and Michael walked over to Sheila, \"who are you?\" they asked, judging from their faces you could tell they've never seen a Kitsune before, \"my name's Sheila, I'm a friend of your brother\" she says. Suddenly Sheila stood rigid and looked over her shoulder, hugging one of her tails was your youngest sister named Abby, \"I'm sorry she likes to hug people\" says your mother, \"oh its ok, just caught me off guard\" Sheila says as your mother frees her tail from Abby's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Thomas?\" you ask about your other brother who was about sixteen, \"he's at his school helping set up something for tomorrow, I was just about to go pick him up\" answers your mother.</span></div></div>",

You and Sheila walk back outside towards the two door garage next to the house, \"what's your car doing here?\" Sheila asked, \"it started acting up before I shipped out so I dropped it off here for my stepfather to look at\" you explain. You enter the garage and see your stepfather working on a snow blower, when you walked in he turned around and saw you. He welcomes you with a small hug and a handshake, \"when did you get back?\" he asks with a smile, \"not that long ago\" you say, \"and who is this?\" he asks, indicating towards Sheila. \"This is Sheila, Sheila this is Bryan, my stepfather\" you say, the two of them shake hands, \"hows my car?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be good to go, here\" he says grabbing a set of keys off a hook and tosses them to you, you walk into the main part of the garage and see a car with a dust cover pulled over it. You give the car a hug, \"oh how I've missed you\" you say to the car, you pull back the cover to reveal an older and very rusted car, but it wasn't your's. \"Bryan is this a joke?\" you say, he pokes his head around the corner and after seeing your reaction let out a small laugh, \"your car is on the other side of the garage\" he says. You head into the second half of the garage and see another car with a dust cover on it, you remove the cover and reveal your black, 1973 Barracuda underneath. \"Where did you get this?\" Sheila asks, dragging her paw across the hood, \"it was my grandfather's, he left it for me when he passed\" you say. You both get in the car, but when you go to start the car, nothing happened, \"I thought he said it was fine?\" Sheila asked, \"I think the battery's dead\" you say, \"pop the hood\" she says as she climbs out. She lifts the hood and starts running her hands over the engine, but from your angle you couldn't see what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of doing whatever she was doing. she lowers the hood and gets back in, \"try it now\" she says, you turn he key and this time the car starts. \"What did y--, nevermind I give up trying to figure out your abilities\" you say as you drive out of the garage.</span></div></div>",

As soon as you take the paper from him, he salutes and walks away, you look down and start reading the paper, \"transferred?\" you say to yourself as you read the paper, \"but I just got here\" you add.
