Their appearance changes from blank slates to almost exact replicas of dark spyro with minor alterations to tell the difference between the five clones, the first clone began tearing out the wiring connected to them while the second and third clones headbutted their containment chambers simultaneously. When all five clones were done gathering the necessary dna to function they stood before dark spyro as his allies, \"come along friends let's see what this ship do now that I've got some new hands on deck\" he said as the clones followed after him arriving at the controls. With the press of a few buttons and the pull of a lever, the ship was asking if they wanted to warp into the next dimension over, \"this is captain dark spyro I control this ship from whoever may have controlled it before, initiate the warp sequence\" dark spyro said back as the ship flew into the air despite its damaged state and warped itself through the to their destination.</span></div></div>",
