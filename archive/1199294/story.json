She found herself looking to the ceiling, which was quite high and dome shaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the urgentcy in Jamie's voice, the boy turned around abruptly, his big, brown eyes shooting giving her an inquiring look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...where...\" Jaimie found herself at a loss for words as she looked around the unfamiliar room completely perlexed. The room was small and windowless and had nearly nothing in it, save the bed she now sat on and the dirty, tattered rug sprawled on the floor. She noticed, as her hand touched something dry and brittle, that the wooden bed that she was now sitting on, was lined with straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, his big round, brown eye's starring at her with curriosity, waited patiently for her to finish the question.\"Yes?\" he said in a rather polite manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..I..I..\" Jamie held her head in her hands trying to remember what she had done last before she fell asleep...think, think, she told herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok, Jamie?\" the boy asked inturpting her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked. \"Listen...please, tell me, who are you?\" she said, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you don't know?\" he said, his voice sounding more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, not!\" she yelled, her voice thundering in the domed ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should lie down...\"he said, striding back to her side. He gently grasped her right hand, giving her left shoulder a good squeeze, the sincere concern never leaving his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie drew back, pulling away from the boys hands and standing up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...I've never seen you before in my life...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Jamie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know my name?\" Jamie said her eyes widening,\"You've mentioned my name twice now, and yet I don't even recall having ever laid eyes on you ever in my life....and...\" her voice trailing off into a whisper,\"...how did you know that line...that line from my favorite movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you said it to me before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?!? I don't even know you! When could I have told you that line!\" she yelled not realizing the harshness of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When...when we became best friends....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie noticed tears in the boys dark eyes before he turned his head down, taking in a deep snivling breath. She didn't know what to say. Somehow, this boy knew her, or thought he did, and somehow, though she could not remember it at all, he and her had hit it off as friends...best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy wiped his eyes with his sleeve, looking up. They said this would happen...the profecies...but I had hoped that maybe...you would stil remember me...<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Her eyes burned as she stared out the dark doorway after the boy, but she dared not blink.  Though she felt convinced that this was a dream - what else could it be? - she could not suppress the anxious shivers which worked themselves up and down her back and made the room feel much colder than it actually was, nor could she force herself back on the bed.  She couldn't remember a dream this real, and thought it a little too odd that she was coherent enough to think about that in the first place.  Goosebumps rose on her arms, and she rubbed them furiously, as if to scratch an itch that would not go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat, frozen in place, the light which shone through the window slowly drifted accross the walls, shedding light gently across the room.  Though very sparsely furnished - almost glaringly so - it was elegant in the way it was constructed, and Jamie couldn't help but wander somewhat in her mind as she traced the scrolled wooden trim around window, door, and floor, and gazed at the blue marble floors which shone up at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly panic overwhelmed here as she realized this may not be a dream.  Frantically she looked around for any sort of escape.  She had no idea where she was.  All attempts to place this room failed, as did trying to remember how she had gotten here.  She simply had no idea where she was, or how she had gotten here.  She had no idea who the boy was, or who else was here, or what they wanted with her.  Or didn't want with her.  A torrent of images raced through her mind, and she fled the bed.  Not knowing where to go, she stood in the center of the room, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...\" whispered Jamie trying to be as concoling as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached over and placed her hand on the boy's shoulder.

She ran over towards it, immediately tugging furiously at the nob which appearently locked it in place. She had at first been worried that it would be stuck, or hard to turn, however she was startled to find the nob turn with amazing ease. The window nearly popped open as she fully twisted the nob out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Free....' she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the feeling was short lived as a sharp voice came from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie!\" said the voice. It had a hushed, scolding tone, the kind that mothers tend to use for their mischeivious children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gave a frightful start, nearly breaking the window off it's hinges. She turned around slowly to see a short, slender woman with dark hair and very tan skin. Her eyes were gordious, but frightfully so, and peircing. She stood, leaning against the doorway, her chest heaving as if she'd been running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will Roland say? You should have been down stares minutes ago!\" she whispered harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malia!\" a voice came from somewhere down the hall.

She frowned and stretched, grunting, then, squinted as her eyes met with that of the boy still crouched at her bedside. <i>'A boy...do I know him?'</i> She didn't recognize him, yet there was something familiar...and the room, is this <i>my</i> room and the candle....candle? Since when did she have a candle in her room...and a desk? And anyway <i>,'Who is this boy?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She felt lethargic, exhausted, her thoughts were muddled, and her head hurt, and nothing was making sense to her. However, to tell you the truth, she really didn't care. In fact, she could barely comprehend anything that was happening right now. She decided, or maybe half decided since she was, for the most part, only half awake, that this was all a dream. The boy just watched her now, a bit of confusion on his pale, freckled face, as she let her head thump back on to the pillow, or lack there of since it was more just a clump of hay stuffed into a rather smallish potato sack. It wasn\u2019t really at all very comfortable, but Jamie fell asleep almost instantly as her head met with the \u2018pillow\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie...\u201d the boy whispered politely into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d groaned Jamie, her slumber disturbed she found herself brought back into a state of half consciousness. <i>'This is a stubborn dream isn't it?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...its time to wake up...Mallia\u2019s made breakfast....\u201d he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNugh\u2026er-em\u2026ugh\u2026\u201d grumbled Jamie turning to her other side, the boy finding himself faced with her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how Mallia gets\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErmph...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he tried, he realized his efforts to wake Jamie in a pleasant manner were in vane, and went to the alternative....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d yelped Jamie, as she felt the boys soft, warm hands on her shoulder, shaking her back into consciousness, though this time she was completely awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boy shrank back, startled by her sudden exlamation. Jamie found herself a bit surprised too, as her voice unexpectedly echoed in the walls of the small room. She sat up straight in the bed, and absently her eyes wandered up toward the ceiling, which she observed was much higher than she thought and rather domed shaped. She then looked toward the boy who was now to his feet, starring at her with concern in his bright, beautifully brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>indent</i>Now, rather perturbed, Jamie rubbed the crusty sleep out of her eyes and starred right back at him. This was when Jamie finally realized what was happening...or more precisly...this was when she finally realized that she had absolutely no idea what was happening. Now comprehending that this boy wasn't just a figment of her imagination, she decided to confront him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....\" just, then, found that she was at a loss for words, as the fuzziness began to come back, and confusion clouded her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked with obviously sincere concern in his voice. It was about then that Jamie realized the good nature of the boy and how much he cared for her. Somehow, she could just tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm....what? I...I...\" she didn't know what to say. Nothing made sense. Where was she? Who was this boy? <i>How did he know my name?!?!</i>she thought, recalling how he had addressed her correctly without any hesitation. <i>And that line from my favorite movie...how....</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you...?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie...you...you don't know me?\" said the boy, his concern eminating from him, as he found himself stumbling with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, of course not! I've never seen you before in my life!\" Jamie exclaimed, now more perlexed then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, finding herself nearly hysterical, questions began pouring from her mouth, \"Where am I, anyway? What's going on? Have I been hidnapped? Where's my dad? Where's my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, though she couldn't exactly say why, the thought of her mother and father reduced her to tears. For a moment, she starred up at the boy through blurred vision as she let the tears roll down her cheeks and off her chin, then turned her head down. Unexpectedly she felt the boys warm hand again, this time on her forearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come...\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked up at the boy, only to see his face immediately turn away. But even as he turned, Jamie swore she glimpsed tears in his eyes. as well.</span></div></div>",

He lead her through the door, and into a candle lit hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" whispered Jamie, her voice echoing even more profoundly in the hallway than in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the kitchen...we must tell Roland what has happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roland? Who...who's Roland?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't remember do you? You...you don't remember anything?\" he said, his voice cracking with tears coming into his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that moment, Jamie wanted, with all of her heart, to be able to tell the boy that she really did remember....but she didn't. Everything she'd seen so far had been alien to the life she had once had. She didn't recognize this boy, for one thing. For that matter, she couldn't remember ever knowing a boy as nice as this one, and who seemed to care for her so. She definietly didn't recognize this halway, or \"her\" so called bedroom. Stranger than all of that, she couldn't exactly remember the life she'd had before this, or the last thing she'd done before she fallen asleep, yesterday, that is if yesterday really was yesterday. Oh, sure, she remember cars, houses, electricity. She remember the Earth and all that inhabinated it. However she couldn't remember any details. She remembered the world she belonged to, but not what her place had been in it. Though she knew she'd had a family, she didn't know what any of their names where or what any of them looked like, or how big her family was. Though she knew she had once gone to a school, she couldn't remember which one she'd gone to or what friends she'd had there or if she'd had any at all. Though she'd remember that that line from that movie had been her favorite, she could not remember what movie it had been from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kept walking along with Jamie still following behind. Suddenly a boy appeared from a door, his hair a firey red, and his form scrawny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never thought I'd see the day,\" the red-haired boy teased playfully, running over to greet the boy Jamie had been following,\" I don't think I'd ever seen <i>you</i> late to anything...and hear you are late to the most important meal of the day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jokingly shook his head and made a *tisk* sound with his tounge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie waited to see the dark-haired boy laugh in responce to his friend's joke, but he was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Isacc,\" he'd answered mournfully, breaking Jamie's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and turned to me,\"Um...Jamie...this is...Isacc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsacc's smile faded a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what do you mean Peter?\" he said, chuckling as  he talked,\"What kind of gag is this anyway? Jamie knows me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsacc looked at Peter than at me, and I hung my head to avoid his eyes, shifting from one foot to the other, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....its...its happened...h-hasen't it?\" he whispered, and I lifted my head just in time to see Peter's head nod in responce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsacc hung his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...come on...we'd better tell Roland...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys walked off down the hall, and Jamie followed, though she did so reluctantly. It was beginnging to anoy her that she didn't know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I guess this...er...Roland guy can fill me...'</i>she thought as the continued down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jamie looked around as they walked, while Peter and Issac extchanged an occasional whispering to each other. Jamie would have tried to listen in, but they sounded as if they were speaking in a different language. One she had never heard. The hallway's walls seemed to be made of sand-stone, or packed down dirt, and the ceiling, just like her bedroom, was high and domed shape, there were candles melting in strange candle-abra type things that prodtruded out of the walls, the flickering candle light giving off a gloomy feel. As they walked, Jamie noticed doors, just like the one that Isacc had emerged from, lining either side of the hallway. There seemed to be hundreds of them, and the hallway seemed to go on forever. After a long, and uncomfortble two minutes, the three finally came to an enormous pair of double doors. Peter reached over to the side and pulled on a long, tassled rope. Immediately the doors came open, swingling on their hinges with surprising ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Light flooded in causing Jamie to draw back a bit, squinting in the unexpectedly pourout light. Peter and Isacc continued through, and Jamie followed, still squinting. When her eyes had adjusted, she gasped as she saw an enormous, round room. Its huge, round shape reminded Jamie of the Roman Coliceum in Italy but it looked more like a banquet hall or ball room, though it wasn't very elabotate in anyway, quite humble. There were people gathering at a large table, a very large table. There were about twenty or thirty people there, and the all fit on the table, with still plent of room for others to join. There were people of all ages siting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most spectacular thing about the banquet hall was the tile floor, which had painted with a beautiful swirling patern of teal, gold and marun, though it was faded and cracked. The walls, just like the hallway, and Jamie's room, was also made with the same stone or dirt substance. She looked around to see where all the light was coming from, when she realized that it was coming from the ceiling. But when she looked up, she saw that their was no ceiling but a sky. A sky bearly breaking into early dawn.</span></div></div>",
