The cheesy stink is simply too much for the weakened Gardevoir and she passes out from a single whiff. I sigh and return her, I suppose it was a bit much to try and make her fight three pokemon in a row. But still, Roderigo is weak now and my next pokemon is still full of energy. I toss out my Arcanine, Nova. \"Alright Nova... gas him.\" Nova nods and tackles Roderigo to the ground and sits her sweaty rear end down on his face.

Despite a couple nicks and scrapes from his war days including a black eyepatch, he looks fairly handsome, and has a way of talking to women in his thick russian accent. He stands at a tall and broad 6ft, topped with his short brown hair and his crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Odrov was actually not born into royalty, in his far away land. But rather started his life in court as a Baron's son. His appetites grew over the years, in food, cigars, alcohol, young men and women, but most of all power. He plotted and schemed to get his way to the top, and become King. Unfortunately, he found the court politics impossible to navigate, and many of his plans were thwarted, leaving many in court wary of him. He left the court to serve his duty as a Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Odrov finally found an environment where he thrived, he commanded throngs of pokemon, the Wild Nose Battalion, and the Baron's son utilized there lack of hygiene in order to snatch victory from the direst jaws of defeat time and time again. One storm-wracked night, he was strategizing in his camp, when a cloaked Aloan Ninetails entered. Odrov nursed the Aloan himself, whilst keeping her a secret from the men, who had not seen a female in years. The Aloan returned the favour with her affection, and taught Odrov etiquette, and how to be charming among others. it was later Odrov learned she was an exiled Princess of her own Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdrov has now returned to his homeland, the court still moves against him, but they cannot deny him his titles, and has become popular with the common folk with his incredible war exploits. With the help of his Aloan wife, technically he became a Prince, and the new Odrov found himself easily plotting himself into higher places in Court, becoming a Royal Lord! However, with enemies in every corner, Odrov battles to find new allies. Beat him, and you've proven yourself to become his knight! Lose, and you'll spend your life at his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdrov seems accommodating and charming, but he finds it difficult to lustful and domineering side. His wife also loves to fight, but Odrov doesn't like her doing it, and will be endlessly protective, and makes her fight with her maid, Gwen, in order to look after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Resurrect, Paralyze and Mindlink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeat conditions: (what you can do to him if you win)<br>\r\nStink Torture By Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nStink Torture By Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\nTemporary Enslavement: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Gwen<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Froslass<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Ungodly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Putrid<br>\r\nButt: Unbearable<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 65/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Robin<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Mienshao<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Horrid<br>\r\nFarts: Putrid<br>\r\nBreath: Rancid<br>\r\nButt: Pretty Bad<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 50/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Lancelot<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Charizard<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Ungodly<br>\r\nFarts Unbearable<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Rancid<br>\r\nBody Odor: Horrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 75/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Gawain<br>\r\nGender: Male <br>\r\nSpecies: Flygon<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Rancid<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Rancid<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Unbearable<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 65/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Princess Celune<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Ninetails (Alolan)<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Bad<br>\r\nFarts: Bad<br>\r\nBreath: Bad<br>\r\nButt: Bad<br>\r\nBody Odor: Bad<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 30/100</span></div></div>",

His hair is medium length, long enough to cover his eyes and almost his nose in the front, but never goes below his shoulders. He wears a gray hoodie over a black sleeveless shirt, with baggy white cargo shorts. On his feet are a pair of black slip-on loafers, which smell pretty bad. His hands often get sweaty when he gets anxious, so he wears black fingerless gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Torr is competitive, in a friendly sort of way. He loves to compete, to compare his skill with others and make a few friends along the way. When he isn't engaged in something, he's reasonably laid back, and loves to make jokes. He's new to the idea of fighting with stink, but was excited (for more than just the idea of competition) when he found the tournament.

She wears a white T-Shirt which covers her flat chest and a pair of black shorts. She wears a pair of four-year-old white tennis shoes which mask her noxious feet and over worn socks. (Now for that explanation!) In addition, she has a plethora of headbands each with a set of ears on them that look like various eeveelution ears in addition to fake tails of the same variety. She also dyes her hair and uses color contacts to complete her little cosplay look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Eve is perky, kind, and optimistic if a bit flighty. She always enters a match with a genuine smile on her face. She's also usually fairly forthcoming with her thoughts, almost always saying what she thinks.

Well, if you're strategy is to use him to get rid of my legendary right off the bat, I'd suggest returning him for now. My entire team is comprised of legendaries and the one pokemon I defeated them all with. So while it's a sound strategy, it's utterly fruitless in the long run. Now Chill, why don't we do something about this stench?\" Chill nods and flies up into the air, he starts to flap his wings hard, creating severe gusts that not only blow his horrible body odor towards you, but also blows Caboose's toxic foot funk right into your face.</span></div></div>",

She wears a long white dress with long white gloves. on her fingers are a number of golden rings with various jewels on them, and on her wrists are a number of gold and silver bracelets. On her feet, she wears a pair of white high heels and a pair of long white stockings. Beneath the dress is a pair of custom made white panties. she smells of flower perfume<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Amy is a cheerful and polite person with very ladylike behavior... for the most part. She's a big socialite and enjoys talking. She always seems to be bright and happy with a seemingly unbreaking composure. however, she can be strict and stern when the moment calls for it. She's also very clever and her unassumingly sweet attitude can take opponents by surprise when she plays dirty. She can get a little upset from time to time though. Se does delight in tormenting opponents, but is never one to want to cause lasting harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther notes: Amy was born into a wealthy family and as a result, has adopted many of the proper customs of the rich. Though she developed good manners, However, she has one rude habit, that being that she enjoys ripping nasty farts, which have ruined numerous dinner parties with their room filling volume and vomit educing stench. as a result of this, her parents had some undies custom made to heavily reduce the power of her gas, even so, the smell that does get through is still strong. She has always had a fondness for Pok\u00e9mon and loves her team dearly, though her favorite is her Gardevoir whom she gets into some nasty mischief alongside. Amy is also a psychic and has practiced it quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Mesmirism (she greatly enjoys being able to manipulate the minds of others, eve if just for fun), Mind Link (her secret to her and her pokemon's successful Mischief), Stench (her farts smell like nothing any human should ever be able to produce.

His hair is medium length, long enough to cover his eyes and almost his nose in the front, but never goes below his shoulders. He wears a gray hoodie over a black sleeveless shirt, with baggy white cargo shorts. On his feet are a pair of black slip-on loafers, which snell pretty bad. His hands often get sweaty when he gets anxious, so he wears black fingerless gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Torr is competitive, in a friendly sort of way. He loves to compete, to compare his skill with others and make a few friends along the way. When he isn't engaged in something, he's reasonably laid back, and loves to make jokes. He's new to the idea of fighting with stink, but was excited (for more than just the idea of competition) when he found the tournament. That being said, despite his competitive nature, Torr often secretly wishes to be defeated and humiliated, especially by females.

Checking the match details he had written down, he could have sworn this was a 'stink' fight, not a perfume contest; not that he was complaining, though. It was a nice change of pace. Approaching his opponent, Torr finally realized the smell was coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. Torr's my name. And I must say, your perfume smells heavenly.\"</span></div></div>",

Suffice it to say, he'd be having nightmares about this for weeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jon!

I also give off a smile to your words to him, happy to see you're such a caring trainer  However, when it came time to battle your Toxicroak, there was little that the tiny fairy could do after she was grabbed. In a last ditch effort to fight back, Plum waved her flower around and caused it to smell rancid again, trying to make Paulina sniff as much as she could. of course, being buried under Paulina's foot made it impossible to get her flower up to her face, the smell still reached her to some extent. I See my little fairy suffering beneath Paulina's foot and I can't help myself as thoughts of Paulina pressing down to hard on her and hurting her haunt my mind. I know Plum doesn't have much fight left, but I don't want to see her go out, struggling so hard. I raise my hand and snap my fingers, signaling the use of another of my abilities. I hoist up my dress and hurry into the arena, approaching the two combatants and place my hands on my hips with a pout in a scolding manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin personal sweetie but, stink attack, stage one!\" I shout before turning around and pressing Paulina's face between my butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then rip a 7 second long fart that I've been holding in since the match began. Though the stench was muffled by my panties and dress, it was still nasty enough to cause her to reel, and loud enough for you to hear how nasty it was. I then back off and wave my hand in front of my face, realizing that I got a little carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, sorry, just don't hurt her, okay... umm, you okay Plum?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum slowly floats up, only seconds away from having been knocked out. she takes a sniff of her now sweet scented flower to regain some energy and gives a weak nod. I feel bad leaving her in like this but I know she'd rather go down fighting. I then hurry back to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Plum, focus on regaining energy, if she attacks, prepare to counter\" I order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlum nods, and I know she'll do her best, but she may be too weak to even counter attack.

I start with focusing my energy around simulating endorphins. First, I trigger enough to help him relax, next, I take it a step further and begin to simulate feelings of pleasure, making him associate the feeling with my invasion of his mind, opening up every bit of it for me to play with. All I needed now was to tighten the noose, and then Shylock was mine to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Miko, could you be a dear and entertain Iago for me? Just an appetizer for before the real fun begins\" I request to my Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko nods to me and runs over between you and Shylock, staring at you with his usual grin, hiding the fatigue he's feeling.

I smile and can hardly believe it. is this an opportunity for a two for one deal!? I've never hypnotized two people at once like this before! I was getting excited. Of course, once you realized what was going on, I doubted you'd want to stay linked. So, I'd have to make sure you didn't want to remove it. But how to do it, how to ensure the link doesn't break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Shylock, it looks like your master wants to get in on the fun too! oh, but he's so shy, he might back out! but we know how much he'll love it, so mind helping me keep it open?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shylock under my dominion, there's no resistance as he turns to you and tries to fill your mind with thoughts on how enjoyable this will be, all the while, strengthening my psychic connection on the link. But that wasn't all, now all I had to do was dive into your mind. With Shylock under my control, I follow the link to your mind with ease and begin trying to cement my place in your head. first, I send suggestion to trigger your endorphins further, associating incredible sensation with my mental presence, making it so you didn't want to sever the link, lest you be denied this sensation. however, as I do so, I begin to feel how taxing it is trying to take over two minds at once. I was gonna need some psychic backup. Though I can't see what I'm doing with my hands, I find Miko's Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Miko, time for a break.

She then uses her own hypnosis ability and I feel her presence enter Shylock's mind with me. With her there holding down the fort and psychic energy bolstering mine, my mind finds some reprieve and I focus entirely on your mind, putting in the finishing touches and triggering your endorphins some more before I tighten the noose on your mind as well.</span></div></div>",

I may have to try doing this more often. Incidentally, I wasn't even sure I'd make it this far, so I didn't have anything in particular planned right away. Still, it didn't take me long and I hatched a devilish idea. Before we end the match, I wanted to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, see, isn't it nice to have fun? Goodness, you must be in heaven right now! Still, right now is me time. we can have some you time after the match, I promise. now then, first order of business, how about I give your Mind link a bit of an 'upgrade'\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying around with your mind as if it were clay, I trace the mental signatures of your link with your Pok\u00e9mon and dive a bit into your subconscious.

I can't help but giggle at my own mischief as I had just tied your and your Pok\u00e9mon's sensory reception together, meaning that if your Pok\u00e9mon were to say, receive a face full of fetid flatulence, he wouldn't be the only one catching a whiff of it. If they were to bury there face deep into a swampy armpit, they wouldn't be the only ones feeling the warm and slimy moisture. If they were to lick a cheesy set of feet, they wouldn't be the only ones asking for some wine to go along with it. Of course, I didn't make it so it would work the other way around, at least not now anyway. Now, it was time to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you know what shylock? Helena has some really impressive gas. Quite possibly some of the smelliest around, and she would love to share it with you. Now, I wouldn't turn your nose up at this opportunity, after all, you love farts. I mean, you love all manner of stink, but right now, you could really for some farts. You love them so much that you would willingly give up the fight, just to bury your face into a cozy butt crack and sniff up ever bit of what comes out. Aren't I right sweetheart?\" I say to the Gengar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShylock looks over to me and gives a smile and a nod as I had just implanted a strong stink fetish into him. However, I hadn't yet done the same for you. Shylock looks down to Helena who is grinning from ear to ear, excited for the next part, before floating down to her. Helena then turns around and motions to her dress, lifting it up and allowing Shylock to dive beneath it. He then takes a seat with the dress covering him and presses his face against Helena's bare ass. You yourself can feel the warmth of being under there. Shylock then takes a sniff, eager to get some stink into his sinuses, but unfortunately for him, her butt is rather sweet at the moment. Of course now you see that you can smell whatever he smells. This only makes it worse when you hear a nasty fart rip through your ears as if it were you sitting beneath that dress right now. you can feel the heat of the gas spreading around Shylock's face and then... then came the deadly stench of Helena's fart as Shylock inhaled deeply. I giggle as I see your reaction and take it up another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shylock, that was sure some nice smelling gas right? Just imagine how good it tastes! open up and chug it down you wild boy you\" I say to Shylock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gengar happily does as I request and opens his mout wide before Helena releases another massive fart, which he gulps down happily. now you realize that you can even taste it. to make matters worse, he even goes in and licks Helena's asshole, much to her pleasure. and of course, you get to taste that too.</span></div></div>",

Looking to you, she smiles before letting out another fart. only this time, it's severely worse than any she had previously released and Shylock nearly passes out from pleasure alone as he is caught in Helena's rancid dutch oven that only just grew greatly more rancid. Of course, despite the fart being far worse than anything that came before, it was so much better to not only Shylock, but you as well, and I wait in anticipation to see how your new stink fetish is working out for you. after all, there will be so many more stinks to explore.</span></div></div>",

I of course trigger her endorphins to make moving around her head easier, and to loosen her resistance. Meanwhile, Odd looks on, excited for Tamora to smell his feet. he approaches her and stares at her as she stares back with the battle going on in her head, but she's gradually succumbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, feet are a good Choose Tamora. go aright ahead. It's what Iago wants, and he'll be experiencing it right alongside you, so you'll be doing him a favor as well\" I say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually acceptance of the idea takes complete control and she finally obeys her Master's commands. She gets down onto the floor and crawls the rest of the way to Odd, looking up at the overly cheerful Oddish as he smiles at her. She then rolls onto her back and lifts the Oddish's foot onto her face. One sniff of it however had her hacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonono, you're supposed to enjoy the stink. You love how terrible Odd smells. not matter what part of him you're smelling, you love it. Your only wish is that it could be worse. How fortunate that Iago wishes the same, isn't it?\" I ask you... well, rather tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy message gets to Tamora as well who is also soon enthralled by me, sniffing up Odd's nasty oniony and cheesy soles as the Oddish laughs at how much it tickles. He then pivots himself on her face, grinding in the stench more as he repositions himself with his free foot on her chest.</span></div></div>",

I had to admit, whenever Odd used that thing, it was almost too  much even for me. Tamora sniffed deeply in mindless bliss of the mind melting stink Odd's feet now produced. Getting more comfortable, Odd repositioned himself and sat on Tamara's chest, pressing his feet down gently over Tamora's face and rubbing them around, covering them in warm slimy Oddish sweat and the stink that clung to it.

I can't help but laugh at seeing how hard you're trying to masturbate and decide to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you look like you're having some trouble over there sweetie.

I even divert some of her mental assault to me in order to open the way for Helena's own assault. now that she was in, Helena began to poke at Gleam's mind, prodding it to release endorphins into her blood, weakening her mental defenses. This goes on for a little while as Helena not only continues to bombard her with endorphin releasing signals, but also implanting suggestion, telling her that this pleasure she's feeling is all thanks to Helena's mental influence, and how nice it will be to just give herself over to it. Eventually, Gleam's resistance finally breaks as she has become enthralled by Helena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her freshly dominated toy, Helena psychically commands Gleam over to her and under her dress, implanting her mind with a love of farts, yet doing nothing for her resistance to it.

The Gardevoir responds by throwing up her mental defenses and grinning before communicating with Fahrenheit via the mental link the Ninetails had just formed between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know this doesn't count as me grabbing your tails, correct?\" Helena jokingly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI myself find us in a bit of a situation.

I mean, I suppose hypnosis, but that could be finicky, I could gas her again, but I don't know if I'd get there in time. Then I recall Helena's Mega stone. Of course, it may not work, but if I can Mega evolve Helena before she's entranced, I might be able to get her out of this. I hold up my wrist and activate the keystone on one of my bracelets, triggering the brooch around Helena's neck which contains her Mega stone. It might not work, but I've got nothing to loose by triggering it. Soon, Helena is enveloped in a radiant glow before her form shifts into her Mega form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Helena, hurry, try to stink her off of you!\" I command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the stink increase, I can only hope it's enough to repel the Ninetails, otherwise, Helena would be in for whatever fun and games Fahrenheit has planned for her. Still being pinned by Fahrenheit, Helena has a brief moment before the Ninetails tries again to get into her head.

I take some deeps sniffs and start to choke as my nose enters Helena's factory of doom. And then, it happens. Helena rips the massive fart she'd been building up since I turned her into her Mega form, and it was nightmarish. I want to struggle, but the only protests I can manage are muffled screams as my body devotes its self to sniffing up as much of Helena's stink as my nose can possibly manage. I feel like I'm about to die, yet can't stop myself. If this keeps up, I'll be out cold very shortly, and I have no idea what happens with the match if I pass out. The worst part is.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I slowly return to consciousness, my last memories being Helena's butt gassing me into oblivion. I look around to see her sitting off to the side, still being held by Fahrenheit. I take a sniff to find my face still reeks of Helena's toxic farts. Before I could do anything, I hear Fahrenheit speak to me. I suppose this is the third curse, and probably the one I was the most questionable about because, this one wasn't just simply gonna go away. This was the one that was up to another, and could last until the end of time if they so chose. It wasn't until now that I realize that I had agreed to this without even knowing who the Pok\u00e9mon was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to the other Pok\u00e9mon who had been standing over me. So, if this is Centigrade, it would appear that my mate would be a Glaceon. The name seemed to make sense now. And Arceus!, he really reeked! I impulsively plug my nose at the stink before I sit up. This wouldn't be the first time I've had sex with a Pok\u00e9mon, but I've always made sure their stink was in check first. I sigh, knowing that I should probably mind link with him, as Fahrenheit suggested. besides, I suppose I was curious about his thoughts. This feels so bizarre, but I suppose that's why it was so tempting. I look to Centigrade for a moment before shutting my eyes, focusing my mind onto his. There is some unfamiliarity with establishing this link, though that was because I'd never even met this Pok\u00e9mon before. the process was quick however and I could feel his thoughts milling around before I spoke telepathically to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I'm your new mate then... or, you're mine? Anyway, umm, I'm Amy\" I say, at least letting him know my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's strange, but I feel a connection with this Pok\u00e9mon. likely due to the curse.</span></div></div>",

Despite a couple nicks and scrapes from his war days including a black eyepatch, he looks fairly handsome, and has a way of talking to women in his thick russian accent. He stands at a tall and broad 6ft, topped with his short brown hair and his crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Odrov was actually not born into royalty, in his far away land. But rather started his life in court as a Baron's son. His appetites grew over the years, in food, cigars, alcohol, young men and women, but most of all power. He plotted and schemed to get his way to the top, and become King. Unfortunately, he found the court politics impossible to navigate, and many of his plans were thwarted, leaving many in court wary of him. He left the court to serve his duty as a Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Odrov finally found an environment where he thrived, he commanded throngs of pokemon, the Wild Nose Battalion, and the Baron's son utilized there lack of hygiene in order to snatch victory from the direst jaws of defeat time and time again. One storm-wracked night, he was strategizing in his camp, when a cloaked Aloan Ninetails entered. Odrov nursed the Aloan himself, whilst keeping her a secret from the men, who had not seen a female in years. The Aloan returned the favour with her affection, and taught Odrov etiquette, and how to be charming among others. it was later Odrov learned she was an exiled Princess of her own Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdrov has now returned to his homeland, the court still moves against him, but they cannot deny him his titles, and has become popular with the common folk with his incredible war exploits. With the help of his Aloan wife, technically he became a Prince, and the new Odrov found himself easily plotting himself into higher places in Court, becoming a Royal Lord! However, with enemies in every corner, Odrov battles to find new allies. Beat him, and you've proven yourself to become his knight! Lose, and you'll spend your life at his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdrov seems accommodating and charming, but he finds it difficult to lustful and domineering side. His wife also loves to fight, but Odrov doesn't like her doing it, and will be endlessly protective, and makes her fight with her maid, Gwen, in order to look after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Resurrect, Paralyze and Mindlink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeat conditions: (what you can do to him if you win)<br>\r\nStink Torture By Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nStink Torture By Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\nTemporary Enslavement: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Gwen<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Froslass<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Ungodly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Putrid<br>\r\nButt: Unbearable<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 65/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Robin<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Mienshao<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Horrid<br>\r\nFarts: Putrid<br>\r\nBreath: Rancid<br>\r\nButt: Pretty Bad<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 50/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Lancelot<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Charizard<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Ungodly<br>\r\nFarts Unbearable<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Rancid<br>\r\nBody Odor: Horrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 75/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sir Gawain<br>\r\nGender: Male <br>\r\nSpecies: Flygon<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Rancid<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Rancid<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Unbearable<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 65/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Princess Celune<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Ninetails (Alolan)<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Bad<br>\r\nFarts: Bad<br>\r\nBreath: Bad<br>\r\nButt: Bad<br>\r\nBody Odor: Bad<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 30/100<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't tell you how many suitors I've lost after I've shown them mine and my babies habits. Dating for weeks, then they just suddenly up and run away once we start having fun with them. You know, it may be out of the blue, but if you have yet to find a suitor, maybe we could hang out some time and get to know one another?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon turned to me, a little surprised, and possibly even a little nervous that I would ask that.</span></div></div>",

And what a pretty wife it is too. A beautiful Ninetails that looks like a soft blue cloud. I'm not one for stealing husbands away, as funny as I find it when they're so taken by me that they would cast aside all loyalties to be with me, but an open relationship? Well, that's entirely different, isn't it? at least as far as I'm concerned. Simon's jaw drops as he looks back and forth between you and I. Eventually, he pots, crossed his arms, and looks away from all of us. I'm not sure why he's so upset. I've suspected him of having a crush on me for a long time but any time I'd ask about it, he denies it. I sigh and let him mope. He needs to learn to be more open. For now, I'm interested in the matter with your wife. I can already see her looking me over. It doesn't take a genius to know something's up. after all, Simon's just sort of standing there, so it's clear that we're not fighting at the moment. Perhaps it's my appearance, but from the look on her face, she doesn't seem to keen on this. Perhaps she was becoming jealous? Well, I suppose I should introduce myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, aren't you pretty. My name is Amaranth, though you may call me Amy. Your husband mentioned to me the nature of your relationship. You are in an open mirage, correct? Well, it just so happens that I find him rather fetching myself, and would love to get to know him better, so long as I have your blessing to do so\" I explain, being polite as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelune approaches me, glancing over at Simon who was now holding his ears down as if to avoid hearing anything that I was just saying. She then looked me over, walking around me as I stood proper with my hands folded in front. Though some may find this intimidating, I know how to keep my composure. Eventually she stops in front of me. I can't see her face, but I do see her tilt her head. Though I can't see it, her expression is skeptical. Though not entirely disapproving, it might appear that I have to prove myself somehow to earn her favor.</span></div></div>",

I giggle at the thought of how he'll react. He may be showy and charismatic when it comes to presenting himself to others, but he's extremely shy when it comes to love. We've only ever had sex once because of that. That said, I know he'll absolutely love this. I proceed to bend down so I'm face to face with the Ninetails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, how lewd\" I say to her before playfully licking her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, I make my way over to Simon who still has his back turned to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Simoooon\" I say as I approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill upset, he keeps his back turned, ignoring me. However, that does not stop me from reaching out and lifting him up by his sides. In response, he whimpers and flails around angrily, though I still turn him around to face me. His eyes are shut and everything as he throws his fit, but I look on with a caring, yet mischievous smile. Eventually he opens his eyes to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, are you done being a brat? You know, for someone who's so adamant that they don't have a crush on me, you sure do get bent out of shape whenever I try hanging out with another male\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's eyes open wide and he crosses his arms before glancing away in another pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, calm down you. Besides, I think you're going to like this next part\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI them proceed to place him with his back on the ground and he looks around confused. Getting on my knees, I smile to him while keeping my hands at his sides. My eyes then wander between his legs and before he even realized what's going on, lean over and drag my tongue beneath the length of his shaft. Simon gasps and looks around, confused as if asking me what in the world I was doing. especially with so many people watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, what, you don't want this? I have to prove myself at lovemaking and I figures, why not my little blue sweetheart\" I explain before giving Simon a kiss on the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his irritation from earlier, and how embarrassing he found being pleasured in front of so many people, he certainly couldn't lie. He definitely wanted this. As I see him finally relax, I start to get to work. I give his crotch a few more laps with my tongue before finally taking his member into my mouth. Of course, after all that sweat he produced, his crotch smelled extremely potent, and didn't taste any better, but o was used to this stink of course. As I went to work with my lips and tongue, I could feel his member gradually taking up more real estate in my mouth as Simon himself just relaxed and let it happen, his face forming into a smile. Gradually, the blue and white fairy's length grew and grew until I began to suck on the shaft like a popsicle. He's surprisingly well endowed for such a small mon when erect. As I continue sucking him to maximum length, I reach up and rub his belly. He's In heaven right now as his favorite girl pleases him. Finally, his member achieves full mast and I pull away. He has enough length there to please me no matter where he decides to stick it. I give his glands a few squeezes as I begin to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Simon, now just where do you plan to put that thing?\" I ask with a giggle.</span></div></div>",

With a final cry, Simon's cock convulsed and began shooting jets of fairy cum down my throat. There was a certain sweetness to it and him being a water type, it was rather refreshing. As his penis completed its final release, he leaned over and rested his belly against me, rubbing my hair lovingly. This moment ranked up there with some of his happiest ones. He then slowly slid off of me and flopped onto his back, though as a tease, once his cock slipped out of my mouth, I have him a few more licks, resulting in exhausted but satisfied twitches from him.

Guess I'll just have to use someone else. I give Simon's ball a kiss before returning it to the bag and retrieving another. With a smile, I cast it out. I can't help but giggle at the contrast we're about to see. When the light faces, it reveals my Floette, Plum. She looks to you, then to me, swaying back and forth happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, alright sweetie, you're up! Hey, why don't you give that Charizard a whiff of your sweet flower.

After all, she wanted him to smell that flower, and he wouldn't give her the satisfaction. instead, he bent over and pinned the fairy to the ground so she wouldn't fly away. Realizing what was happening, Plum inverted her flower and did her best to hold it against her face before Lancelot's hand was replaced with his nasty, grimy foot. Plum began to struggle immediately in response. A combination of the sheer stink combined with the fear of being crushed. I gasp as I see Plum buried under Lancelot's foot. I can only imagine how horrible it is down there. I'd probably be able to smell it if her flower wasn't dominating the room. Still, I have to do something. I can't just stand here.

Despite a couple nicks and scrapes from his war days including a black eyepatch, he looks fairly handsome, and has a way of talking to women in his thick russian accent. He stands at a tall and broad 6ft, topped with his short brown hair and his crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Odrov was actually not born into royalty, in his far away land. But rather started his life in court as a Baron's son. His appetites grew over the years, in food, cigars, alcohol, young men and women, but most of all power. He plotted and schemed to get his way to the top, and become King. Unfortunately, he found the court politics impossible to navigate, and many of his plans were thwarted, leaving many in court wary of him. He left the court to serve his duty as a Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Odrov finally found an environment where he thrived, he commanded throngs of pokemon, the Wild Nose Battalion, and the Baron's son utilized there lack of hygiene in order to snatch victory from the direst jaws of defeat time and time again. One storm-wracked night, he was strategizing in his camp, when a cloaked Aloan Ninetails entered. Odrov nursed the Aloan himself, whilst keeping her a secret from the men, who had not seen a female in years. The Aloan returned the favour with her affection, and taught Odrov etiquette, and how to be charming among others. it was later Odrov learned she was an exiled Princess of her own Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdrov has now returned to his homeland, the court still moves against him, but they cannot deny him his titles, and has become popular with the common folk with his incredible war exploits. With the help of his Aloan wife, technically he became a Prince, and the new Odrov found himself easily plotting himself into higher places in Court, becoming a Royal Lord!

His hair is medium length, long enough to cover his eyes and almost his nose in the front, but never goes below his shoulders. He wears a gray hoodie over a black sleeveless shirt, with baggy white cargo shorts. On his feet are a pair of black slip-on loafers, which smell pretty bad. His hands often get sweaty when he gets anxious, so he wears black fingerless gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Torr is competitive, in a friendly sort of way. He loves to compete, to compare his skill with others and make a few friends along the way. When he isn't engaged in something, he's reasonably laid back, and loves to make jokes. He's new to the idea of fighting with stink, but was excited (for more than just the idea of competition) when he found the tournament. That being said, despite his competitive nature, Torr often secretly wishes to be defeated and humiliated, especially by females. He acts like he hates losing and stench, but deep down he loves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorr has learned a bit from previous fights in the tournament, and has changed his setup slightly.

She truly was one resistant little Gloom. Deciding enough was enough, I activate Tenni's mega stone; as a Dragon/Fairy, she'd be vulnerable to poison, but she might get just enough of a boost to finish Serena off in time! With a brilliant flash of light, Tenni transforms into a Mega-Altaria! Immediately, her BO grows even more foul, and you can smell her feet (well, talons really) from where you're standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, finish her off!

Giving in, I began to lick the toe that was placed on my lips first; it was sticky and slimy from sweat, gunk, and dirt, making licking it a disgusting experience. The thickness of the gunk made it terribly hard to clean off as well, making me work even harder to clean it off. At the same time, the exertion was making me take in huge whiffs of her cheesy foot-scent.

I shuddered as it began to gently descend towards my face, landing softly over my nose... I dared not breathe in, but I knew holding my breath would only make this worse. Preparing for the worst, I take a sniff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately begin to cough and gag! This was probably the worst smell I have ever encountered!

I can handle your measly stink easily!\" I listen to you explain your intent; it was clear you wanted to find a new, possibly even more humiliating position to put me in. Well, after what you said earlier about how 'I should have won if I wanted to be on top', a new fire was lit under me to dominate you back. So, it was time to play along and put on a little show of my own. \"Switching it up, eh? Go ahead, 'mistress'. There's not much I can say to argue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched where you were going and began to think <i>\"How is she going to stink torture me from down there..?\"</i>. However, I quickly remembered what was going on in my pants at the moment; it wasn't my nose you wanted to torment any more! With you down between my legs however, some ideas began to form on how I could get my revenge on you. Not only was my crotch terribly musky and sweaty from being out and wrestling with you all day, but my feet were also still reeking and a great option for where you were. However, I would have to decide quickly as I felt you tugging at my pants. I let myself get a little embarrassed as you yanked my shorts down; after all, it was still a little embarrassing to be revealed in front of a crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably start to smell my musk from where you were. I couldn't let the embarrassment get to my though; my chance at pay back was coming up! I here you taunt me again; it was slightly true that I was hard from you sitting on me of course, so your taunt hits close to home. But regardless, I prepare to spring my trap as I feel my underwear being removed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's intended to be invincible \"on paper\" but lose a good chunk of his battles through inexperience and stupidity. Yes, it would make more sense thematically for him to take Mewtwo over mew and such, but what can I say, I love the cute legends.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Rayquaza (Mega Stone)<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Rayquaza<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 100/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jirachi<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Jirachi<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly <br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Ungodly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Putrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 75/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Victini<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Victini<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly <br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Putrid<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Ungodly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 70/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mew<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Mew<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly <br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 85/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Groudon (Scope Lens)<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Groudon<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet:  Ungodly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Ungodly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Putrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 90/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hoopa (Choice Band (Farts))<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Hoopa<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: N/A <br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Ungodly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Putrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 80/100</span></div></div>",

Of course, said stockings haven't been washed in years and smell absolutely terrible! His high heels smell even worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Riley is a maid under the employ of Andrew's family. Specifically Andrew himself. And through interaction with Andrew, he gained an interest in stink battling! Riley is flirtatious and upbeat, but can get flustered very quickly when forced to smell stink or when being dominated. Usually these things come together, since Riley has this strange kink. He absolutely hates stink, but being forced to smell it makes him hard for some reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Attractive, Stench, and Mesmerize<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeat conditions:<br>\r\nStink Torture By Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nStink Torture By Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\nTemporary Enslavement: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Samantha (Mega Stone)<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Absol<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Bad<br>\r\nBreath: Bad<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 80/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Travis<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Midnight Lycanroc<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Putrid<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Rancid<br>\r\nBody Odor: Horrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 75/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mitch (Psy Amulet)<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Meowstic<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Unscented<br>\r\nFarts: Unscented <br>\r\nBreath: Unscented <br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 25/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ginny<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Goodra<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Good<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Good<br>\r\nBody Odor: Good<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 40/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hazel<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Salazzle<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Good<br>\r\nButt: Good<br>\r\nBody Odor: Good<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 55/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Blake<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nSpecies: Ampharos<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Deadly<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 90/100</span></div></div>",

She loves building up the egos of her opponents before smashing them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up as the only girl in a family with many brothers, she was often at the bottom of many dog piles.

Big mistake i guess as i hear your heels plop to the floor and look back to see your beautiful feet, which catch my attention for a second, before the horrible stench brings me back to reality!  I start coughing and cover my nose. \"Gah ugh, c-cmon you cheated so you lost by default! Being my servant wont be so bad. Maybe itll even be better than your last job.

In reality she is actually absolutely cunning, perverted and sadistic. She has decided to compete in this tournament due to the fact she has an extreme fetish regarding stench; especially footstench. For that reason, she hasn't washed her feet in more than six years. She wears patent leather shoes without socks because they make her feet sweat the most without letting any stench seep through. Alice is determined to show the world that she has the smelliest feet on earth and that she is capable of using them to her advantage. Other than that Alice seems very adorable, and noone would ever suspect that such a girl would hold this stinky secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Attractive, Stench, and Mesmerize<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeat conditions:<br>\r\nStink Torture By Pokemon: Allowed<br>\r\nStink Torture By Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\nTemporary Enslavement: Allowed<br>\r\nSex With Pokemon: Not allowed<br>\r\nSex With Trainer: Allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lucas (Mega Stone)<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Lucario<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Bad<br>\r\nBreath: Rancid<br>\r\nButt: Bad<br>\r\nBody Odor: Horrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 70/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kathy<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Guardevoir<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Deadly<br>\r\nFarts: Bad<br>\r\nBreath: Deadly<br>\r\nButt: Unscented<br>\r\nBody Odor: Very bad<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 75/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Clara<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nSpecies: Vaporeon<br>\r\nStats<br>\r\nFeet: Unscented<br>\r\nFarts: Deadly<br>\r\nBreath: Bad<br>\r\nButt: Deadly<br>\r\nBody Odor: Horrid<br>\r\nStink Resistance: 80/100</span></div></div>",

Once I arrived home, I originally went to remove your boots so that you wouldn't get any of my furniture dirty, but I felt weird about taking your stuff even if it was just going to be left at the front door, and then I brought you into my living room and laid you down on the sofa before lightly having a seat on your midsection to check if you were going to wake up anytime soon. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alrighty then, here we are once again with yet another version of my Smelly Pokemon Tournament series! This time however, we're throwing humans in the mix! Combat will be pretty much the same as before, knock out all of your opponent's pokemon to win using various smells but there are a few differences. The point of view for this story will be from humans instead of pokemon. More specifically, the point of view of trainers who use their foul-smelling pokemon to battle each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the rules of this tournament are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon teams may be made up of any number of pokemon, however, there is a maximum of six per battle. In addition, a challenger is not allowed to use more pokemon on their team than the one they challenge. Battles will be based off of whoever has the least amount of pokemon on their team. For example: If someone has four pokemon but the challenger only has two, the battle will be 2v2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattles will continue until one trainer is out of usable pokemon, the winner is then allowed to have their way with the loser as long as what they do is in line with story rules and author preference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrainers who win may take their opponents to a more private area if they so wish. However, they are not allowed to keep them for more than 48 hours. (story time, not real time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this story only, the stench stats will be capped at Deadly, there are no multiples of said stat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this is a sort of alternate timeline/universe/world thing, characters from the other tournament stories cannot be included. Well, the sort of can, but they aren't the exact same pokemon in the other stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince trainers are the main characters, bios for pokemon will not include personal info about said pokemon. Only their name, gender, stats, species, and abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattles are fought using stink, such as farts, feet, bad breath, body odor, and butt-stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex is allowed, but only as a way to mess with a fallen opponent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing your opponent or their pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo scat, watersports, inflation, diapers, or any fetishes along those lines. However, anything that can be traced to a pokemon move or ability is alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pomemon's abilities do not have to be listed. They can have any abilities as long as you can logically argue why theywould have such a power. So no ice types using hypnosis or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Trainer Buffs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery trainer gets to choose up to three buffs that they can use during battle, each one has it's own limitations and advantages. Keep in mind that the list is still in progress so if you think of a cool trainer ability, let me know and I'll see about adding it to the list! The current list is as follows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mesmerism: The trainer is able to use hypnosis on a single enemy pokemon per battle. It may also be used on trainers after a match ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stench: the trainer smells foul as well as their strongest pokemon, allowing them to strike an enemy as well, but only three times per match. In addition, pokemon can not be knocked out by the trainer, no matter how foul they are, but they can be weakened to the point where a pokemon can finish them in a single blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Attractive: The trainer's good looks distract the enemy trainers and their pokemon, allowing for an unstoppable reversal in any situation. Can only be used twice per match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrip: The trainer has the ability to telekinetically shove the opponent's pokemon to the ground. Can control whether they fall backwards or forwards. Usable up to two times per match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Resurrect: Usable once per match. The trainer may revive the pokemon at the price of one of their other pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Paralyze: The trainer can hinder the opponent's pokemon by paralyzing up to three body parts. Can only be used once per match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grocer: Trainer has the ability to hand out berries. Either for boosting stink resistance or as a cure for status effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Predict: Can periodically read the other trainer's mind, to see future moves. Can only predict two moves of each enemy pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Silence: Has the ability to momentarily stop the opposing trainer from communicating. Can only be used twice per battle and wears off once a pokemon on either side faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pin-point: Trainer has the ability to examine the opponents to find weaknesses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorn Dog: Can make obscene comments or gestures, distracting enemy pokemon and trainers. Can only be used three times per match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashbang: The trainer throws out a light emmiting object that blinds the opponent and their pokemon. Can be used twice per battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindlink: The trainer can secretly send orders to their pokemon via telepathy. Can be used three times per battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a new feature: Items! Items are held objects that may be used by a pokemon in battle. The number of usgaes varies but only half of your pomemon team can have an item and if you have an odd number of pokemon, it's rounded down. The list for items is:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Band- Worn on the neck or on the waist. \"Activating\" it drastically increases the level of one stink, but also decreases every other stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLum Berry- One time status remover. Can be held in the paw or in a bag. Only one can be held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Stone- Only one per team. Must actually be able to mega evolve before they can use it. If they don't have a mega evolution, they can't have a mega stone. When used (once per match), they mega evolve and their stink increases GREATLY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax Revive: May only be used once per match, if a pokemon holding this faints, they are automatically revived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsy Amulet: May be used twice per match, can make one psychic based attack completely unavoidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScope Lens: Can be used twice per match. Will make the next attack from the holder almost impossible to evade or counter.</td>",
