He hopped in his old car and headed to the other side of town, where he was sure that he wouldn't run into any classmates, and parked in the lot of The Weight Room.  It was an older gym that had clearly seen better days, but because it was run down it was also more affordable for a high school student like Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the front door and headed for the check-in desk.  Nobody was present, so he decided to ring the bell on the counter.  As he reached for it, he heard a cheery voice behind him say, \"Hey there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned to find another young man standing there, but he looked vastly different than Ryan - this teen was tall, about 6'3\", had short blond hair and blue eyes, and clearly had been working out hard for quite a while.  His white t-shirt and blue athletic shorts looked like they had been painted on, and their canvas was the most muscular body that Ryan had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to join the gym?  Or are you just looking for a guest pass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...um...um...,\" replied Ryan as he started to tremble with fear.  All of the jocks he had ever known had picked on him, so he was instantly terrified of this gym employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man sensed their might be some sort of problem, so he reached out his hand and said, \"My name is Tim.  And you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R - R - R - Ryan.\"  He held out his hand gingerly, and the two shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryan, nice to meet you.  Are you interested in joining our little family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y - Y - Y -Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim went to the water cooler and poured a small cup, which he then handed to Ryan.  \"Here, drink this. And come sit over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took a set near the check-in desk and drank the water, and Tim sat down beside him.  \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, so what's up, Ryan?  Why do you want to join this gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the floodgates opened and Ryan spilled out all the reasons - the bullying, the teasing, and the girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim smiled.  \"Well, I can help you there, Ryan.  When I started lifting, I was about your same size.  But my father, the owner here, showed me all I needed to know about lifting weights, and soon my body went from little,\" he said as he flexed his right bicep, \"to b-i-g.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's eye grew huge when he saw Tim's massive muscles.  \"You would do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ryan, I am the head trainer at this gym, so I promise to help you attain whatever goal you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan thought about for a half-second and agreed.  The pair went into the office and Ryan signed up for a three-month membership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, little buddy,\" said Tim, \"I want you to come back tomorrow morning at 8:00am ready to work out.  Eat a good breakfast, and bring me some of that weight gainer powder you bought - I want to check it out to make sure it is the right kind of stuff.  If not, I have some free samples here you can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Tim.  Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Ryan.  Oh, and one more thing, so that I can design the right program, I need to know how big you want to get - are we talking swimmer's build, young jock, linebacker, or massive tank?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt like a little kid.<br>\r\n\"Young jock.\" he answered.  It was the best he could hope for.  Maybe gain 20 pounds of muscle and fill out a t-shirt.<br>\r\n\"OK, Ryan.  That should be no problem, so long as you stay disciplined.  Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Ryan answered. \"I can do that.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, here's how we will start.

He could do more reps and he believed that he could see some muscle when he looked in the mirror but he was still 130 pounds.  This wasn't going to be enough.  He needed to use those weight gain powders.  <br>\r\nRyan took out the powder which he had stored away back before getting into the gym program.  Now it looked like he needed it after all but where did he put the directions.  He tried to remember what the clerk had told him.  <br>\r\nDid he say 'with food', 'after food', before food'.  Ryan couldn't remember.  He didn't even know how to take it.  Should he make a shake with it, mix it with juice.  He just didn't know.  Finally he decided that as skinny as he was, what difference could it possibly make.  He would just mix a scoop with milk and chug.  <br>\r\nImmediately he felt bloated as the drink filled his belly.  He was sleepy too and lay down finally succumbing to sleep.

I remind you, with your metabolism, which is now shot and your increased appetite, it will be very hard, but don't give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Doc...\" said Ryan, shocked at the predicament he had put himself in.

Ryan pumped some iron on the little weight set his dad owns, took a jog, did some sit ups, push up, lunges and more. He worked up a sweat and thought about how much bigger he could become. A teen hulk made him smile deep down. Too big to fit into lockers or trash bins, big enough to intimate his enemies. Just big.<br>\r\nThe next day Ryan had not got around to his little work out plan, same with the next... And the next day as well. In fact a whole week had gone by and the only real activity Ryan had done was walk to the store and carry back a 10 pound bag of groceries for his mom.<br>\r\nAt the same time, unbeknownst to Ryan, his appetite was slowly growing larger by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now a week after the second treatment when Ryan was having lunch at MacDonalds. He had ordered two burgers, some fries and a large chocolate milkshake. He was munching down when he saw a huge man, maybe 400 pounds walk by with his own tray full of food and his massive gut smack right into a chair and caused a loud ruckus as the chair jumped and slid across the floor. The loud noise jarred Ryan out of his eating trance and notice the large man. He was massive. There was no way that man would ever fit into a locker or a trash bins. His thick legs were likely the size of Ryan's waist. He looked like he could get stuck in one of the booths or have troubles fitting through narrow doorways. He was massive.<br>\r\nA little something started to stir in Ryan. He put down the burger and whiped off his hands and felt his own little belly. It had grown a bit bigger. It pushed forward ever so slightly over his tight waist band. Ryan also noticed his once really loose 28\" pants were getting pretty soon tight. He was getting fatter.<br>\r\nIt wasn't the muscle he wanted but he felt bigger. He looked over at the 400 pound man who had taken his seat in a chair and awed over the man. The man's ass filled and overflowed over the seat while his thick back spilled over the back of the chair. His massive belly spilled forward on to his lap and stretched his shirt tight showing off every curve if his massive gut, thick love handles, bountiful man boobs, and other rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ryan decide to do?</span></div></div>",
