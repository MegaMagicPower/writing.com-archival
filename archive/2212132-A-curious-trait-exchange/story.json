As Mick opened up the door and got ready to head upstairs he noticed a package sitting to the side marked with his name.<br>\r\nNo expecting a package, Mick was confused but he took it upstairs anyway and after dropping his bag and jacket where they belong he decided to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package was only a remote and a note. It didn't look like just any remote however with the button configuration being a bit different. Most of the buttons were aligned to vaguely resemble a human body with the buttons marking each body part. There were also buttons off to the side with different markings like life, personality, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note however clarified a bit, it read:<br>\r\n<i>Hello Mick. You do not know us, but we know about you and have selected you to test our latest invention. It is one of a kind and we thought someone like you would be perfect to test it's capabilities. Speaking of which, the remote included in the package is no normal remote, it is a trait swapping remote. You can either set it to swap you with someone, or to swap two other people and whenever you press a button, the corresponding trait will be swapped. There is also an undo and reset button in case you need them, but they will only work for swaps within 24 hours, any swaps longer than that need to be swapped back manually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe should also mention there is a reality setting which allows you to set whomever can notice the swap, by default only you will be aware.<br>\r\nWe hope you enjoy your new toy and are looking forward to the results!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's not strange or creepy at all.\" Mick though to himself as he inspected the remote.<br>\r\n\"It may be worth a try though, could be interesting.\" He then thought to himself reading the instructions carefully.</span></div></div>",

The following morning, he grabbed his bag and lunch and went to his first lecture of the day, which was a general lecture for all students of his year. The lecture however ended being incredibly boring, talking about a bunch of random stuff he didn't really care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick looked around the room as he ignored whatever was being said and checked for possible targets. There weren't a lot of girls around, but one in particular caught his eye. Out of every girl there, she was definitely the cutest, though outside of his field, there were plenty that were cuter at his school, but he couldn't exactly target them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl that took his eye was a brown haired girl with a somewhat pretty face and a very thin body. She was wearing some skinny jeans and a tight t-shirt and looked to be bored out of her mind as well. Deciding to liven up his mood he picked up the remote from his bag and stealthily targeted her and himself, pressing the genital button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the default setting being set to only allow Mick to notice, she had no idea as Mick's cock grew inside her skinny jeans, causing her to shift her movement a little. Mick however felt her vagina replace his cock, causing a very foreign feeling. Mick slightly rubbed his new pussy through his jeans, making sure no one noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lecture was still as boring as ever as Mick listened in once again, causing him to once again consider the remote. Eventually, he decides to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noticing the girl's discomfort, Mick scanned the remote to see if he could, \"help\" her in some way. He quickly noticed options for each clothing pieces as well as a \"size change\" option for them.<br>\r\n\"I should give her some more space down there, maybe keep the sizes like this to help with that a bit.\" Mick thought to himself as he turned off the size change option and selected both underwear and legwear, aiming it once again at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment later, the girl suddenly took a much more comfortable position as Mick's jeans and boxers appeared on her, being ever so slightly looser on her legs. She was still unaware of course so there wasn't any real indication of the change on her face. Mick however was very much aware  as the tight feeling of panties appeared covering his newly acquired pussy and her tight dark blue skinny jeans appeared over his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tight jeans appeared on his legs, Mick rubbed over them feeling the soft fabric against him, making his pussy a bit moist, though he did notice his lack of hips and different legs made them fit just slightly off.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have done a size change, but I do have a different solution.\" Mick then thought to himself as he grabbed the remote one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe selected the legs, hips and waist options and once again fired at the girl. As soon as it hit, once again, due to her not being aware, there was no reaction from the girl and not even that much to see this time due to his jeans covering most of her lower body anyway. For Mick however, he felt his hips widen a bit, filling the dark blue skinny jeans jeans a lot tighter, however his legs slimmed down a slight bit allowing for more breathing room inside of the skinny jeans. Lastly, his waist thinned a little bit, allowing more breathing room around there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I basically have her entire lower body now, nice.\" Mick though to himself as he put away the remote as he reveled in his new parts and felt his pussy become a bit more wet because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lecture continued on for a bit and started to get kind of close to the end.

It worked and suddenly, he had all of his parts back and the girl's were returned to her.<br>\r\n\"This was certainly interesting.\" Mick thought to himself as class ended not long after. He put the remote in his bag and quickly left the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class there was a lot of free time, but since the last class was mandatory, Mick ended up just grabbing his laptop and finding a free table in one of the open area's available. It was quite hard to focus on his work though, he kept thinking about the remote as he stared blankly at his screen until a voice dragged him from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was Alexa, one of Mick's most recent friends. Mick always thought she was quite cute, her long red hair and skinny body looked amazing. Today she was wearing some light blue jeans and a tight fitting t-shirt with a small jacket and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you working on there?\" Alexa said as she sat down next to him.<br>\r\n\"Just been searching for something to fill my time in between classes.\" Mick said his friend sat down.<br>\r\n\"Same here, then I spotted you.\" She laughs as she grabbed some lunch from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick and Alexa talked for a little bit as Mick put away his laptop, but Alexa noticed the remote in his bag.<br>\r\n\"What's that? That doesn't look like an ordinary remote, if you don't mind me asking.\" She asked<br>\r\nMick thought for a moment, whether he should tell her. \"It could be fun to tell someone.\" He thought to himself before taking it out.<br>\r\n\"It's quite a strange thing that suddenly appeared today.\" He then told he and proceeded to tell her about the functions but left out his test in class just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want to test it out?\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure, you have anything in mind?\" Mick asked her.<br>\r\n\"I think I might have a fun idea, assuming it works.\" Alexa smiled.<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Mick asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Let's swap...\" She suggests.</span></div></div>",

Well genitals would be a bit too easy, so maybe we'll swap that later.\" Mich thought to himself as he aimed the button at her and pressed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up choosing to swap legs with her. He liked the feeling of having girl's legs when he tested out the remote before and Alexa's were a lot nicer. They were slim and might not be very curvy, but they were still very feminine. Mick felt his legs change inside his jeans as he felt his thighs change a little and of course felt the shape and length of his legs shorten a little bit, plus they were now completely smooth and completely devoid of hair.<br>\r\n\"That worked.\" Mick smiled as he gave Alexa the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am really curious what you swapped, I really have no idea what it could possibly be.\" Alexa said looking herself over, thinking the hairy male legs were hers. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, what to switch.\" She thought to herself. She was curious what a cock would feel like, but decided to refrain for it from now for the same reasons Mick did. She did however felt this was a perfect time to dump some of her extra weight on her chest and quickly pressed the chest options and aimed at Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Alexa's chest was replaced by Mick's hairy one. Taking a small peek under her tight t-shirt, she could see a bit of her new chest hair, but also quite liked how light it now felt. Her bra was now no longer supporting anything, but since she was only permitted one swap, it would have to remain that way for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick on the other hand noticed nothing wrong, for all he knew he always had b-cup breasts without wearing a bra. Alexa's smooth skin being slightly visible underneath his shirt.<br>\r\n\"All done?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep, looks like it works.\" Alexa giggled.<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean, I have no idea what you swapped.\" Mick said looking himself over, not noticing anything wrong at all, apart from his legs of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swapping their parts, the final class is about to start and they make their way over to their respective classrooms.<br>\r\nMick reveled in walking with his new legs, rubbing them together as he walked while Alexa felt really light with her new hairy chest.</span></div></div>",

His breasts however weren't supported, but he was used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done with class, he felt his hips sway ever so slightly as he met back up with Alexa.<br>\r\n\"Hey, enjoy your class?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Much more than usual.\" She replied back in a happy tone, enjoying her new chest.<br>\r\n\"I did think of something during class, what if every time we meet back up to have fun, we guess what part the other swapped, if we are correct we swap it back, if not, we keep it?\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"I like that idea actually, but for how long?\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\n\"Maybe over the course of each day? We keep the parts until the next morning, then we reset, reveal the swaps and every hour or so, we swap something like we just did and have one guess.\" Mick explained further.<br>\r\n\"I can agree with that. So we're guessing now and swapping one more thing?\" Alexa asked with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's your guess?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you swap chests with me?\" Alexa asked immediately.<br>\r\n\"Nope, I didn't, I enjoy my breasts, did you swap genitals with me?\" Mick asked in response.<br>\r\n\"Nope, I was thinking about it though.\" Alexa giggles.<br>\r\n\"Alright then, make your swap.\" Mick said giving her the remote.<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what I want.\" Alexa thought to herself as she pressed the genitals button and immediately felt Mick's cock grow inside her skinny jeans, causing a bulge as it became erect as soon as she felt it.<br>\r\n\"Done?\" Mick asked not noticing anything at all.<br>\r\n\"Yep, your turn.\" Alexa giggled giving him the remote.<br>\r\n\"Time to see what it's like having a cock.\" Mick thought to himself as he as well, pressed the genitals button and swapped with Alexa, feeling her cock grow inside his jeans, arousing him immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious to hear what we swapped tomorrow, I have no idea what two swaps you could have possibly done.\" Alexa said, very excited to try out having Mick's vagina.<br>\r\n\"Same here, we have a day off so we'll get in a lot of new swaps.\" Mick nodded, reveling in the chance to try out Alexa's cock.<br>\r\n\"Call me as soon as you wake up.\" Alexa winked as she grabbed her bag and went on her way home.<br>\r\n\"Time to have some fun tonight.\" Mick thought to himself as he slightly stroked Alexa's cock and went on his way home as well.</span></div></div>",

Mick never thought he'd see her parts like this and immediately softly stroke the cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mick stroke Alexa's cock, he felt it harden, slowly rising up and becoming more and more erect as he thought about Alexa and the swaps he could do with her. It was a very foreign feeling, but he kind of liked it as he gripped the fully erect penis a bit firmer and started masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take very long for him to feel a warm liquid pass through and squirt, luckily he did catch it inside of a tissue, he'd picked up on several jokes and comments about something like that, so he wasn't completely under-prepared. As he climaxed, he lay with his back on his bed, threw away the tissue and smiled as he stroked his now flacid cock again, he really liked Alexa's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa on the other hand, as soon as she got home did something similar. She took off her skinny jeans and panties, threw them to the side and saw Mick's vagina sit between her hairy legs. She carefully felt the lips of Mick's pussy, as she didn't have much experience with one. Slowly feeling waves of pleasure go through her body upon reaching sensitive spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did like how cleanly shaved the vagina was, \"At least Mick takes care of it well\", she thought to herself as she stuck her fingers inside of the snatch and felt it's waves of pleasure surge through her body. Mick's pussy was quite a tight one, making Alexa's experience a bit more enjoyable in her opinion, because it felt a bit more personal for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached her climax as well, she felt exhausted. She really loved swapping genitals with Mick and felt much closer to him than she ever did before. She did feel slightly guilty about using his pussy like this, but she also didn't think Mick would have done anything different, which she was right about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of their evening was fairly normal, nothing too special as they went to sleep with their new parts.<br>\r\nThe following morning...</span></div></div>",

It was fun exploring her cock however but it was time to swap back soon.<br>\r\nAs soon as he arrived at the park he quickly spotted her. Her red hair definitely stood out as he waved to her.

So that means....\" Alex said thinking.<br>\r\n\"This cock, is mine, even though I am sure it's yours.\" Mick said confused.<br>\r\n\"And the same for this vagina...\" Alexa said back.<br>\r\n\"Let's reset and see what that does for this.\" Mick suggested as Alexa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the reset button was pressed, the confusion cleared up slightly. Mick realized the breasts are Alexa's, but at the time of having them, he remembers thinking they were his, it was a bit weird. But not as weird as the thoughts about their own genitals, both were sure they swapped, even though they kind of didn't.<br>\r\n\"So, I guess we didn't invade each other's privacy.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"Even though we both intended to.\" Alexa grinned with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really fun, let's get started with our first swap shall we?\" Mick suggested.<br>\r\n\"Before we do that, just so you know and I know it is not because of any swap, there is something I need to tell you.\" Alexa said blushing.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I feel like swapping has made us feel a bit closer and I have been wanting to ask you for a few weeks now and... ugh, you know what, I'm bad with words.\" Alexa tried to explain but as soon as she finished that sentence she planted her lips square on Mick's lips. He didn't mind at all as he felt the same way as he now assumed she felt and their kiss was completely mutual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the kiss broke off, Mick smiled at her. \"Message received and accepted.\" He said as he hugged her.<br>\r\n\"So, now let's swap some things.\" Alexa smiled back as she grabbed the remote.<br>\r\nConsidering she just kissed Mick, she wanted to start with something a bit lighter, still a bit weirded out by the genital swap thoughts now inside her head and selected the hair swap option.<br>\r\nShe immediately saw her long red hair appear on top of Mick's hair, which looked kind of hilarious as his shorter blond hair appeared on her own head, which she actually kind of liked. Without any hair falling in her face she gave the remote back to Mick with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick had a similar thought, keeping it a bit more easy and quickly decided on a swap. He selected butt and fired at his new flame. He always thought she had a cute butt and felt his own butt change shape slightly. It felt kind of weird to feel it change, but he liked it as his own male butt appeared inside Alexa's jeans. He put the remote in his pocket and managed to slightly feel his new tight butt as he did, giving him a smile as he wiped the red hair from his face, which he didn't realize wasn't his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"How about we...\" Alexa suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh I see some people that could be fun to switch around.\" Alexa said nudging Mick and pointing out 4 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person she pointed at was a female college professor. She looked to be around her late 30's and was wearing a black skirt and a blouse as well as some pumps. She looked to be on her off day as she was relaxing on a bench. She had brown hair in a bun on top of her head and had quite a slim figure with some feminine curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second person was a nerdy boy with short spiky black hair. He looked to be in his early twenties and he was wearing a star wars t-shirt and some brown shorts and sneakers. He was sitting at a table alone with his laptop with his bag to his side. He was quite scrawny looking lacking any real muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, there was a skater boy, looking to be about 18 or 19, grinding some rails with his friends. He on the other hand did have some muscles and looked to be fairly fit. He was wearing some ripped jeans and a t-shirt with \"Tony Hawk\" on it and looked to be having fun as his blond hair looked to be quite wild due to all of his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was a cheerleader girl looking to be around the same age as the skater boy. She was with her cheerleader friends and was wearing her outfit consisting of a tiny skirt and tight top with her school logo and some comfortable shoes all in the red and white colors. She had her blond hair in a ponytail and had a fit looking figure, looking like what most guys would consider a killer body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas?\" Mick asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep, let me try something.\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\nMick gave the remote to her, but made sure to hold onto it as she swapped them to make sure he could notice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first swaps were done by Alexa, all four looked quite different.<br>\r\nThe nerdy boy now had the cheerleader's body from the neck down, but now dressed in own clothes, which looked quite weird to say the least as the beautiful legs poked out of the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader on the other hand now had the boy's scrawny body underneath her, which looked downright disturbing in her cheerleader outfit. She could still move quite well however, but her new penis slipped out of her panties as she did some tricks, being quite funny to see her struggle with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor was acting a bit different now, as she got up and decided to grab a skateboard that was lying around and jumped on it, grinding the rails at the park. The boy on the other hand took a spot at a nearby bench and watched his friends instead as he grabbed a book that was lying around and started to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite good, but let me make a few more changes.\" Mick said as Alexa finished her swaps.<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\n\"Watch.\" Mick said as he swapped the group one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy boy was suddenly dressed in the professor's clothes, which fit his new body a lot better. It was still weird to see his male head on the 19 year old girl's body, but dressed in the professor's skirt and blouse did look a lot better than his old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese clothes were now found on the professor who was now wearing the nerdy boy's clothes, which looked a bit out of place on her pretty body, but with her new personality, it fit surprisingly well. She continued on her skating session and not having a skirt seemed to have made her a bit more mobile at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former skater boy however now had the cheerleader's ponytail on his head as he continued reading. He also now had her voice, but Mick and Alexa were too far away to really verify that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, the cheerleader now now only had a nerdy boy's scrawny body underneath her cheerleader outfit, but also the skater boy's blond hair and voice. Unlike with the boy though, her cheers clearly changed as they were now being yelled with her male voice. The new hair also didn't look too bad, but she looked kind of like a crossdressing boy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really funny.\" Alexa said giggling.<br>\r\n\"Until the next time we reset, they'll stay like this, not like they notice though.\" Mick said.<br>\r\n\"Very true, but it's still really funny to see.\" Alexa said.<br>\r\n\"Can't deny that.\" Mick smiled agreeing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around the park, observing the swapped group, they...</span></div></div>",

He was wearing a plaid buttoned-down shirt and some black skinny jeans. and had his hair in a man bun and had glasses on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was similarly also wearing skinny jeans, though in a bit of a tighter fit of course and they were light blue instead. She was also wearing a yellow tank top and had dyed blue messy hair slightly kept together with a headband. She had a pretty face, but also had a nose piercing and had some tattoos visible on her skinny arms. Her figure was quite feminine, skinny and had A-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap them.\" Alexa suggested.<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea, let me get it started this time.\" Mick nodded as he aimed the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the guy now sported his girlfriend's blue hair, but it was still styled in a man bun while the girl now had her boyfriend's hair instead. Her tattoos also vanished and had hairy arms in their place while the boyfriend now had his girl's arms, though they were mostly covered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not bad, but I can do a little better.\" Alexa said as she made a few swaps as well.<br>\r\nAs soon as she was done, in addition to Mick's swaps, the couple now also swapped positions.

He did still want to keep it a little small for now, due to their genital \"swap\" still being in the back of his mind. As he looked at her he noticed how small and cute her hands were. He kind of liked the idea taking them, which would also mean that whenever he touching himself using them, it would be like she was touching him. Quickly pressing the hands swap button, he immediately felt his hand be replaced by his girlfriend's smaller smooth hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All yours.\" Mick smiled handing her the remote, feeling his former hands grab them as they were now attached to Alexa, being much rougher than his own, but she didn't notice.<br>\r\n\"Let's see if this works.\" Alexa thought to herself as she quickly made her mind up about what to swap. Also still having their genital <br>\r\n\"swap\" in her mind and how weird it was she was looking for something that would be either not bad if they both swapped it, or such an odd choice the chance of both swapping it being small. With that she settled on feet. Hers were hurting a bit from walking around and thought it would be a good test to see if that would go away if she swapped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the button and felt her feet grow in size a bit inside her boots. She couldn't really see them, but felt they were a bit rougher and bigger than her own and much to her surprise, the pain went away. \"Looks like it also swaps the sort of state they are in, I bet a scar would also be swapped over if I scratched my legs for example.\" Alexa thought to herself as she smiled at her feet feeling a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat.\" Alexa smiled as she swung her feet, getting used to the new feeling and Mick getting used to using his smaller and smoother hands as he ate his sandwich.<br>\r\nOnce they were done having lunch, they....</span></div></div>",

She had a fairly average body type, nothing too special from the looks of it at least. She was looking a bit tired however, most likely due to her kids, one being a 15 year old boy and the other being a 17 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had short spiky brown hair and looked to be into sports, due to his shirt showing some kind of sports logo and his build being fairly athletic. He was also wearing some loose jeans and sneakers and seemed to be a bit of a bully as he was teasing his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter had long brown hair reaching almost up to her butt and was your typical girly girl and was quite skinny. She was wearing some white denim shorts and had a pink girly tank top on as well. She was also wearing some white sneakers and was getting quite annoyed at her brother's teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh let me swap them.\" Alexa asked as she motioned for the remote.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Mick smiled as he gave her the remote and she quickly pressed a few buttons on the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the swaps were done, the siblings were having a bit of a role reversal. The girl was now the one teasing her brother, getting his personality, but not only that, she was also wearing his clothes, the jeans hiding her beautiful legs and the shirt hiding most of her torso and slim belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was conversely also now getting annoyed at his sister, who was still considered a girl due to it not being a life swap, but he was also wearing her outfit, which due to his personality kind of fit. His penis was slightly visible through the tiny shorts as well as his athletic legs. The top loosely hung on his chest due to his lack of breasts however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing, but we should include the mom.\" Mick said observing the swaps and made another swap.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that's rich.\" Alexa giggled as she saw the newly made swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, wearing his sister's clothes, was now the one trying to calm them down. He was now living his mother's life and it was a sight to see the mother acting like a girl being annoyed at being teased, while the boy was being the adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know how to entertain a girl.\" Alexa laughed as she turned to Mick and put her arm around him as they walked outside of the shop.<br>\r\n\"Anything for my girl.\" Mick smiled back as he give her a peck on her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Oh so I'm yours now?\" Alexa joked.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you?\" Mick asked confused.<br>\r\n\"No, you're mine.\" Alexa said back.<br>\r\n\"I can deal with that.\" Mick said back smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking around, they....</span></div></div>",

He was quite sweaty however, likely due to the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was also quite fit, though she had less muscles and was quite a bit more slender.

She thought about the last few swaps they did to some of the others and one stood out in her mind. She pressed the arms button and swapped them with Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa liked her new arms. Mick's hairy arms stuck out from her tank top, but was a bit different, it also fit her new hands a lot better, even though she thought her hands were still normal. She couldn't really flex or anything without giving away what she swapped, but she did feel a bit of a difference in strength and muscle as she passed the remote back to Mick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick reached out to grab the remote and Alexa took notice of his new bare smooth arms, which looked oddly hot on him. She kind of liked seeing Mick with her arms for some reason as she quickly touched them as she passed the remote. Mick didn't really notice but Alexa definitely liked feeling her own arms on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All yours.\" She smiled warmly as Mick took the remote back.<br>\r\nMick felt much the same way about the new swap, thinking of doing something a bit bigger now, he however had a different swap in mind. He thought back as well and apart from the genital swap, one swap stood out to him that was quite different, also excluding the life and personality swaps as well of course, since he didn't want to mess with their minds more than he already was. He pressed the button and swapped with Alexa, causing a smile to appear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMick chose to swap clothing with her, which felt oddly satisfying. Alexa was now wearing his comfortable jeans and t-shirt, looking maybe a bit plain and the black and grey colors, but she looked cute regardless.  His old arms were sticking out from it making it look a bit more natural, even though Mick thought those were her own arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself however, he was now wearing her purple tank top, with his smooth arms and Alexa's smooth hands sticking out from it, he liked the feel of it as well, but he could also feel her bra underneath, even though it supported nothing. He was also wearing her panties and on top of that was wearing her skinny jeans which tightly packed his new cute ass and still his own legs. Again, he really liked the feel of them, maybe even preferred them over his own, though the panties were quite tight. Lastly he was also now wearing her boots with his tiny feminine feet being inside of them, noticing nothing wrong with the feel however, but he did notice he could walk on her boots as if he had always done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\" Alexa asked.<br>\r\n\"Very.\" Mick grinned back.<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, we forgot to guess.\" Alexa said realizing that in their eagerness they swapped maybe a bit too soon.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't want to swap back anything yet, even if I'm unaware to some changes.\" Mick admits.<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we can skip it this time.\" Alexa smiled back as she took Mick's hand and they went on their way back to Mick's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit longer, they finally arrived, sat down on the couch and they...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Craig was walking into his work, for the first time since school let out in the summer. He worked at the local high school, so he  always enjoyed having his entire summer off. This last summer was pretty awful. He and his wife had recently divorced, so he was dealing with that for most of it. He was just happy he could start a new school year at work and put this all behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was the high school gym teacher. It was pretty apparent by his appearance. He was a well built man, and tall too. He had always been good at sports. While taking his education degree, he decided that he wanted to teach gym class. So he went through all the proper schooling so he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym classes were divided into boys and girls at his school. He taught the boys from all grades. Of course there were a few other gym teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian, he was around 28 years old. One of the younger teachers in the school. Brian also taught all levels of gym for the boys. It was a fairly large school. Each grade had a couple of classes. Brian was a proud gay man. Most everyone knew it too. No one had a problem with it either. He was fairly toned, definitely not as muscular as Craig. Brian was fairly short in comparison, standing at 5'8\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, she was about 35 years old. She was the oldest gym teacher in the school. She taught grades 9 and 11 gym for the girls. Amy was a tall, slender, athletic woman. She had shoulder length hair that was always in a tight ponytail. She had a fairly average sized chest. She stood at about 5'11\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca, she was about 25. She was one of the youngest staff members. Also one of the newest. She taught grades 10 and 12 gym for the girls. She was shorter, standing at about 5'6\". Though she was fairly built as well. She was, well let's say well endowed in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was always extra early for work. He loved to have time to just relax and have a coffee before having to deal with students. He sat in the gym office, drinking his coffee. His coworkers strolled in, one at a time. Amy, then Brian, and finally Bianca. Bianca was always last, and always managed to make it just before the first bell. Due to the size of the school, they actually had 2 gyms. So they could have at least 3 classes going on indoors at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig always had first period with Amy. Bianca had first period in the other gym. Brian basically did office work during downtime, or helped Craig with his class. The grade 11 class was always first. Bianca had the grade 10 class in the other gym. Since it was the first day back at school for everyone, there wasn't much office work to do, so Brian would help Craig with his class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few classes of the year were mostly warm ups, and straight up cardio. They were getting the students back into the swing of gym class. They knew most of them wouldn't do any physical activity in summer, so this was their way to break them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few students in class that the teachers favored of course. Typically the more athletic ones of course. The first class was not easy for most of the students, so they would all groan and complain about all the work they had to do. Class continued on, however, someone at the school gained a new ability over the summer. They were going to try it out here. They had gained the ability to swap traits between others, or to swap traits from others to themselves. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

She goes by Sab to her family and close friends. She and her brother have similar builds and features and are near identical except for their gender. They were harder to tell apart when they were younger, but it's easier now because Sab's feminine (though not overly curvy) figure compared to Sam's more masculine, but still quite slender, frame. Sab has straight, shoulder-length dark hair and generally wears tight jeans and tight t-shirts, but she does dress more femininely from time to time. Sab is more outgoing and popular than her brother, but she's not the most popular either. She and Sam still have a bit in common, especially their taste and music, and get along super well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon (5'7\" 42 years old): Sam and Sabrina's mom. She's been a single mother since her husband, Sam and Sab's dad, died several years ago, but she's recently put herself back out into the dating world. She has a great relationship with her kids and does her best to help them succeed. Sharon currently works as a nurse at a nearby hospital. In terms of looks, Sharon is quite attractive and is still in great shape and still has a good figure. Much like Sab, she's not overly curvy, but she's got a bit more of a figure than her daughter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"*Yaaaawwn*...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Wednesday in the morning. Sam rubbed his eyes and looked at his alarm clock. \"6:03 am\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam immediately woke up and realised he was running late for school. He quickly ran for the showers and went down for breakfast with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother prepared their meals and his twin had already finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you wake me up!!\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried at least....4...5...8 times I think?\" replied Sab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've at least did a bit more times!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would've taken me ages just to get you to wake up~\", Sab says with puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaarrggh.... I'm gonna be more late,\" Sam reached for his meal prepared on the table and rushed out the door. Moments later, he came back and said bye to his mom before going back out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy is always like this.\" Sharon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom, I won't let anything happen to him at school.\" as Sab said bye to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab left the house and breathed in the fresh air. \"It sure is a wonderful weather today.\" She set off for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two twins attended Everlast School and had some classes together. Today was just like any other Wednesday. First period was Math, then Science, Gym, History and English for Sam. Math, History, Gym, Science and English for Sab. It was just like normal, until a certain event happened that changed their course of fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late!\" Sam kept repeating. He was an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister was over a few blocks behind him but she wasn't rushing, she was completely calm. However, what was going through her mind was not something calm. Yesterday, she visited a fortune teller and asked for a reading. The fortune teller looked into her future (Not literally, only fictional. I don't know how real fortune tellers do it) and shuddered. The fortune teller told her to be careful on the road tomorrow because something unpredictable will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab didn't really believed much in the fortune teller but seeing their expression like that made her a bit wary. Again, Sam is an idiot, not that I blame him for being one. Nevertheless, Sam stopped awhile on a nearby stop sign to catch his breath, letting his sister catch up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment his sister made one more step closer to him, a truck suddenly lost control and steered off-course. The truck swayed left and right, professionally missing oncoming cars (soo cool\u2606) before heading straight towards the stop sign that the twins were resting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab thought, \"Is this the end... I haven't even accomplished much in my life... and my brother... Sam...\" Thinking her life was about to end, she closed her eyes and waited for the truck to send her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sam was speechless. A truck was heading in his direction. \"What should I do?\" He thought. He didn't prepare a will, he didn't get a girlfriend, he didn't have a chance to finish his creation in Ma*** Ma*** (Copyrighted Stuff). He covered his eyes and braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....... \"Huh? Why didn't anything happen?\" Both of the twins thought. They opened their eyes and feasted it on the world around them. Everything was black, grey and white, except themselves. Nothing was moving, humans, birds, even the dog peeing at a fire hydrant, were all stationary and devoid of colour. \"What happened?\" was a common question to be used in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a black cloaked figure suddenly emerged on the top of the truck and dusted themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I hate it when dust gets on my clothes.\" The figure dusted a particular spot on their cloak. \"Why hello there fellow humans. Sorry you couldn't get your ticket to heaven.\" It apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who are you...?\" Sab questioned it. Sam could only afford to listen as no words could come out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure smiled, \"I am anyone you can imagine to be! An angel, a devil, Kami-sama, anything! In regards to that, my name is Arrow Shadow.\" It bowed down.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Kami-sama = God]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were only confused by what it said. Angel? Devil? Kami-sama? (They don't know what Kami-sama means). They both tilted their heads to one side, synchronised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure, judging by their confused faces, explained, \"I am here for one purpose,\" Pointing out its index finger vertically into the air. \"And it is not saving you, but granting you a chance.\" Pointing out to the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, there are a lot of what you humans call 'fictional beings', that exists in this universe. We can be summoned into this world through the use of a catalyst, example human blood, for demonic summonings, or by prayers, for angelic summonings. Once we have arrived to this world, we are granted with our own special powers, but we are far too weak to use them, so we have no choice but to stick onto our summoner and perform our actions through them. Normally, the restrictions concerning our contract are heavy, but in our case, I have more freedom, compared to other beings. Nevertheless, I still need permission to perform specific actions. Now that that's out of the way, any questions kids?\" It brought a microphone to Sam's face, them Sab's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A question if I may,\" Sab said while raising her hand. \"What is this ability of yours that you keep on mentioning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that? Pssh, simple enough.\" It exaggerated. \"I can swap traits between you humans, but I need permission to swap any one of you two. Also, you can't swap me.\" It says with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swap traits? How?\" Sab questioned it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like this.\" It snapped its fingers and...</span></div></div>",

Sam also saw this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mouths were agape. They just witnessed something no other human could witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you see my fancy work, you need to get going.\" Arrow said looking at his wrist as if there was a watch there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Could you at least show your face?\" Sab shouted out to Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Fair trade I guess.\" It shrugged as it unveiled its cloak. It's figure resembled a highschool boy's, not bulky but not scrawny, fairly average. It was estimated to be 5'10\" and had some kind of black robe on. It had a fair skin, black natural boy hair, and was wearing a pair of sunglas- \"shades\". It looked like its gender is male...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know...\" Arrow said before a gust of wind blew beneath it. When the wind subsided, a cute and beautiful girl emerged from it. \"... that's not the only form I can take.\" It said, continuing Arrow's sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take up any form: a young male, an infant, an elderly man, a female nurse, a dog, a chair, anything. The only thing, is that only my original form carries said immunity against swaps. Meaning, in any of my other forms, they can be swapped so long as I have permission to do it.\" It said closing a book. (How'd a book get there?) \"Oh, and call me Shelly in this form \uff08\u2579\u25e1\u2579\uff09\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a 360 degree turn to let both of them take a good glimpse of Shelly's figure. It looked to be around 5'3\", way shorter than Arrow. It had flawless skin that every girl would wish for, making Sab feel slightly jealous. Its hair took a fierce shining glow of pink that reached only until above its shoulders. The chest area (Sam made this observation sneakily) was around A-cups at most (disappointingly (-_-) ) and had piercing bright green eyes. It was wearing a yellow kimono-styled dress that reached until its knees and was wearing red kindergarten shoes (seriously? Is that the best your imagination can think of?). It was wearing a blue musical note pin on the side of its hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two should really hurry up, you know, or else you're gonna miss first period.\" Shelly pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were quickly drawn back to reality and the truck (the truck almost sent them to an isekai world) was mysteriously stopped by an unknown force which was most probably from that being. So, the two continued on their way to school, not wanting to be marked absent.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Isekai = Going to another world, usually a fantasy world]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo boy... I neglected to mention that there are other summoned beings like me around them, especially this town... Nevermind, I'll tell them when the time comes. And it's not like anything is able to stop me!\" Shelly laughed at the clouds and chased after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair made it to their classroom just in time for first period and placed their items on their desks. Sam slumped over his desk, feeling exhausted after all that had happened. Summoned beings, truck accident, swapping powers, math... it was all too much for him to take in at once. He ended up dozing off in class as the teacher was teaching them about integration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab had her book opened in front of her, but she didn't listen to a word the teacher said. She was too busy taking everything in and assessing the dangers to it. Arrow -or Shelly right now- was summoned into this world, but how? She pried into her memories to recall what she did to summon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it came to her, last Sunday, they were cleaning up the attic and discovered a dusty tome underneath a pile of boxes. They read out the title, \"Book of Enchantments: Open up the doors to reality and summon thee, thou who is destined to be fated unto thy summoner. Aschente!\"<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Aschente, No Game No Life fans]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the chant, nothing seemed to have happened. So, they thought the book was just nonsense and left it there in the attic. They didn't know that was the thing that summoned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was snapped back to reality by the teacher pulling onto Sam's ear. \"Ow ow ow ow ow, I won't do it again! I won't do it again!\" Sam repeatedly say. Sab giggled a bit. Suddenly, it appeared, lying down on the air facing upwards towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you can solve this problem of yours,\" Arrow said, opening up his left eye. (You can't see this, Arrow is wearing shades)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sam said before getting his ear pulled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you can solve this problem just with a little swap.\" Arrow said, stopping time in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can you swap?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot I can do, just name anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would a swap fix this situation?\" Sam thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can offer at least two swaps for you here at this moment.\" Arrow stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, it just seems more troublesome right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, let's leave it at that.\" Arrow waved his hand, resuming time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was released from the teacher's tight grip on his ear and class had resumed like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrow didn't like waiting around in the classroom, so he just phased through the door and wandered the hallways. It was like any normal school: toilets, gym, cafeteria, staff room, principal's office, and a creepy janitor's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh... Nothing to do...\" Arrow sighed. Just then, it felt something. Something resembling an aura, the aura of something \"EVIL\"! Naturally, it hid its presence while trying to decipher what it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of its eye, a figure walked across the halls. It didn't look like a regular student, actually it didn't look anything like a human. The figure looked to be a female demoness. She stood at almost the same height as Arrow, but she was actually shorter since she was wearing 3-inch heels. Her outfit consisted of a sleeveless black leather crop top with a deep neckline, which was held together by a leather string that criss-crossed several times across her impressive cleavage, and a short black leather skirt with a skimpy black leather thong underneath. A long, thin tail with an arrow-shaped tip stuck out from below her skirt and her pointed ears were each adorned with a single silver ring. She had bloodshot red skin and looked very seductive to most men. Her three sizes were fascinating as well, she has full D-cup breasts, and a well-developed rear that men would drool at.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: This is the same demoness from Terry's path, so please don't file a lawsuit on me]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness was walking casually in the hallways, possibly bored as well as Arrow was. She was probably summoned into this world, and if that's the case, her summoner should be near. Arrow started to be cautious of the said summoner but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing? That's not like me at all. I forgot about myself for a moment there.\" Arrow spouted utter nonsense.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Even I don't understand what Arrow is saying]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrow approached the sexy demoness and made small talk with her. \"Why greetings fellow demoness, I seek your humble attention.\" Arrow spoke with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness didn't expect that and jumped back a bit. (Around 3 metres) \"Who are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a summoned being just like you.\" It calmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quiet and kept glaring at Arrow. Arrow felt uncomfortable under the stares of a beautiful demoness and felt like time would be wasted too much, so it introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do?\" The demoness said still wary of Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I'm bored, and my masters are having classes now, so I don't have anything to do...\" Arrow sighed at his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Then, is it okay if we do something then?\" She offered to Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that us summoned beings are granted an ability right. Well, my ability is swapping traits between humans, and I want to have some fun but my power is too weak without my master.\" She spoke, thinking Arrow doesn't seem to be manipulating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, what a coincidence, I have the same ability as well.\" Arrow gasped (Not really).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness was caught off-guard by Arrow's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally, we need to be within the range of our masters to use our abilities, but it actually comes down to how much mana we actually have in our body. We still actually do need our master's permission, but after that is just plain freedom.\" Arrow explained. \"Oh, and I can tell your contract isn't done correctly, so you also have more freedom compared to other beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... The offer is tempting... Alright, I'll try getting permission from my master.\" She agreed to your suggestion before running off to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All according to the hands of fate...\" Arrow said walking back to Sam's and Sab's classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring third period, both summoned beings had gotten permission from their respective masters and headed out to meet each other in front of the first floor's toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now stood face to face with each other and are now grinning as they were thinking about swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which swap shall we do Miss...\" Arrow said before stopping mid-sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xyllia.\" The demoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Xyllia, what swap do you suggest?\" Arrow asked.</span></div></div>",

I want some of your parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, then hold on for a second.\" Arrow put a stop signal in front of her face and started to shapeshift. Arrow reformed its body to be similar to its old immune form, but some noticeable differences were taken into account. It was now wearing a plain green shirt and a pair of brown pants, along with a pair of sandals. It was missing the shades, so now his eyes were presently seen, being red in colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Xyllia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because swaps won't work on me in my old form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXyllia again, observed Arrow's new form. Indeed, it was similar to the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want from me?\" Arrow said as he twirled around in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one will be good? Genitals? Chest? So many to choose from...\" Xyllia racked her brains and tried narrowing her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">Meanwhile:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the third period of school. Sam and Sab had Gym together, so they met up with each other at the field. There, the coach announced that they will be doing anything, so long as it doesn't break the school rules. So, the boys ran off towards the football field and assigned roles to play. Sab was a female, so she approached one of her female friends and sat together with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when are you going to confess to him?\" Sab teased her friend, Lila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh!?!\" Lila surprised while her face was blushing red. \"Umm... N-N-Not yet... I-It's still too early!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you need to steel yourself. Else, he'll be wooed by another woman.\" Sab said staring at her brother's back as he is playing as a defender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... are you really fine with this? I mean... it's your brother and all...\" Lila said before trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you better get him before he sticks onto someone else. Right now is your best opportunity.\" Sab encouraged her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Lila still not confident with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeeyy, Saaaam!\" Sab shouted. \"We're rooting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sab!?!\" Lila, surprised a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the enthusiasm from his sister, Sam got serious and waited for the ball to come across his hit boxes.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: hit boxes = a gaming term which refers to the area in which you can attack]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After school, I'll create an opportunity for you to tell him your feelings.\" Sab delightfully says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Lila looked down at her feet, face still beet red. Her heart was beating fast, she didn't know what to do when the time came. She was feeling nervous about what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Back to The Swappers:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the filler done yet?\" Arrow impatiently says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\" Xyllia confused at its sudden words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Have you settled on something yet?\" Arrow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could only narrow it to two choices. It's hard to pick which one to do, genitals or chest!?!\" Xyllia screamed out. (Quite literally)<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Maybe not]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares? I'll pick one for you, and I choose you, genitals!\" Arrow said, similar to A** Ke***** from Po*****.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: I don't want copyright]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we'll settle with that.\" Xyllia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two concentrated on switching their genitals with each other. Xyllia felt her ovaries (do female demons have ovaries?) being pushed out of her vagina and formed a sack filled with sperm in it. Her snatch closed up and a white shtick shot outwards from her groin. Arrow felt the exact opposite. It felt like its testicles are being sucked up into its body along with its penis. Soon after, the blank space turned red (to accommodate for Xyllia's skin colour) and a snatch was opened up, along with the formation of ovaries inside its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... That felt good.\" Xyllia said as she licked her lips seductively. \"Want to test it out for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more curious if our masters will recognise the swap. After all, we're not gonna let their reactions be passed up. But in the meantime...\" Arrow said, grinning at Xyllia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both made their way towards the infirmary, (Do they seriously know the interior of the school?!) eager to test out their new anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Filler Scene Again:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time had begun to pass, the bells rung signaling the end of the last period of the day. Lila, packing up her books, got up and left her classroom. She made her way to the courtyard to finally let out her feelings to the person she loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash back to during fourth period:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab: Here's the plan, I go tell Sam to meet me in the courtyard and you confess to him there.<br>\r\nLila: But what if it fails? What if he rejects me?<br>\r\nSab: I'm sure he'll accept your feelings, after all, he's dying to have a girl confess to him.<br>\r\nLila: But what if something goes wrong?<br>\r\nSab: I assure you, nothing can go wrong.<br>\r\nSab(thought): And I'll be watching over you two in a bush. I'm so gonna congratulate you two for being a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Flashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila steeled her nerves and waited under a tree for Sam to arrive. Around 3 minutes later, Sam appeared in Lila's vicinity, so she wrote the Japanese characters for 'man' on the palm of her hand and swallowed it.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Japanese belief that will make you calm when facing a nervous situation]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around the courtyard and couldn't spot his sister anywhere. He was about to give up until he saw Lila, his sister's best friend, nervously writing on her palm and shoving it into her face. Thinking his sister sent Lila in her place, he approached her with great strides. He was still an idiot.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: I say this because why would his sister call him out towards the courtyard if they can be alone together at home. And what's worse was that they had the same class together for last period]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSab hid behind a bush, a distance between the herself and Lila. She was anxiously waiting for Sam to arrive as the minute ticked by. The sunset was a wonderful atmosphere for a confession and (folklore stuff, I think) they said if you confess to someone under a tree, your chances of success are almost to 100%. She waited patiently until a figure came up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time was now, the cards have been set and the outcome was already determined, Sam and Lila stood face to face with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... did my sister ask you for something from me?\" Sam asked, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's... Umm...\" Lila quietly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day's getting late, you should probably head home now. Your parents might get worried.\" He said soft-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila's heart was beating at around 170 bpm right now, the words were still lingering around in her throat. She took a deep breath in and let it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam is a complete idiot!!!\" Lila shouted. Her words reverberated through their ears. \"Sam is the biggest idiot I have ever seen. He always sleeps during classes, always cramming the night before an exam, a weirdo, ignorant, yet still likes to act cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was almost speechless and only managed to get the words, \"Uhm...\", out of his mouth before getting interrupted by Lila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tries to act cool in front of his sister, and I find that admirable. So, I kept observing you during our classes together, and before I knew it, I fell for you. Sam... Kimi wo aishiteru.\" Lila nervously but proudly says.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: Kimi wo aishiteru = \"I love you\" in japanese]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the anime otaku that he is, he understood exactly what she said. Sam didn't know what to do, accept it or reject it? If he rejected it, his sister would most probably be mad at him and things would probably be more awkward. If he accepted it, things would never be the same again. What will become of Lila's relationship with his sister. He didn't know which was the correct choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sab's end, a figure loomed behind her and as she turned around, the figure covered her mouth and told her too stay silent. The figure looked to be a guy older than her, but what was he doing at a highschool.<br>\r\n[TL;DR: This was Te*** from the other story path if you didn't know]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with a hard decision, Sam was still thinking of a choice. Suddenly, the world had gone grey. It was the same when time had stopped. Arrow emerged from behind the tree the pair was under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrow!\" Sam shouted, surprised at his uncalled timing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, right now you are facing a crisis which will affect your social status. I will give you some advice on this matter seeing as though you are stuck on the matter.\" Arrow said, slowly walking back and forth across the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam listened intently on Arrow's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that dreams are meant to be chased? I for one, chased it back when I was living a life like this. You see, humans are fragile beings. Their lives only span until around 80 years. Quite a fleeting time to be honest. You humans only get to live once, so make everything count. Your feelings were granted to you by God, you developed those feelings by experiencing things. Take Lila for example, she has developed feelings for you. She knew what downsides you had, yet she doesn't care, because she had already tightened her resolve of loving you. So, what I am saying is, make your own decision, do what your heart tells you to do.\" Arrow quoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think I know what do now, thanks Arrow.\" Sam thanked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to treat her well,\" Arrow thought before taking cover behind the tree again and resuming time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam accepted Lila's confession. Lila was on the verge of tears before Sab popped out and congratulated them officially becoming a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group left the courtyard and set off for their home (bringing Lila along to Sam's and Sab's house). Occasional teasings were done between the new couple by Sab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...</span></div></div>",

A light breeze filled the atmosphere, leaves were falling, frogs were croaking, water was dripping from a nearby pipe. A gentle atmosphere was presented but Arrow didn't seem like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...? What did I do wrong...\" Arrow mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXyllia, a few feet away from Arrow, heard this and wondered what it was that was muttered. She tried taking a step forward only to be blocked by her master. Her master took her away, leaving Arrow under the tree, talking to the airs of distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I am only an observer. So why do you do this? Why am I being disregarded!? By my own junior at that! This is unheard of, blasphemy!... I should calm down a bit. I'm breaking my ego...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Storytime</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrow leaned back on the tree and thought deeply about his words. Arrow was a talent during his early years. He was regarded as a prodigy in the world of the gods, a fearful menace, a sharp dagger that can stab through anyone's flesh. Arrow became a god only when he was around 6 years (human appearance) and was in charge of the rule of time. Many badmouthed him, saying \"The creator god was merely choosing favouritism\" and \"He's not going to keep that title for long.\" It was all madness, Arrow was very young at the time and he was afraid of defeat. Just before giving up, he met these wonderful people who encouraged him, who guided him throughout his duties and blocked out any negative feelings towards him. He felt his world shining back up again only to be faced with a tragedy. Arrow was framed for the murder of these said people. What's worse was that Arrow also obtained the said people's powers, Space &amp; Distortion, but mysteriously, he didn't receive Death. Evidence was piled up on Arrow, his verdict was announced as guilty, and he was sealed away for thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the seal worn down, Arrow soon was awakened being at least 13 years old (human appearance). He found himself in some kind of human civilisation. He was standing on what seems to be gravel, and his surroundings told him that he was surrounded by these tall living organisms. He heard a sound in the distance and spotted a little girl, 13 years of age, drinking from the flowing stream of water. She was very cute, and his instincts told him to protect that girl from danger. He kept staring at the girl. The girl looked to be around 4 feet in height, and was wearing unusual clothing. The girl stopped drinking and immediately left the vicinity. Arrow sneakily chased after her. After following her for about three or so minutes, the girl had lead him to her village. It was a small residential area filled with a small population of humans. Using the powers of distortion, he opened up a distorted portal and went through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">Storytime 2</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise Freelight, 13 years old, profession: time traveler. Elise looked like your normal neighborhood girl, but she was actually a time traveler. She has time travelled to multiple phases of the world and is considered the youngest time traveler in existence. In this period, she was assigned to deal with a terrible threat that could disrupt history. Not knowing the details of this existence, she kept caution on her surroundings, never letting her guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to take a break once in a while...\" She said before heading out of the village. She mindlessly wandered the forest's jungle and soon she came across a river. Pure water was flowing downstream, so she took a sip and decided to cool off her mind there. Then, she could feel a foreign entity looming over her. She carefully scanned the area with her eyes, keeping her head down, and spotted a figure in the grass. It seemed dangerous, so she hurriedly went back to the village and prepared her hunting gear. That entity didn't seem normal, so she prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Storytime Part 3</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stepping through the disfigured portal, he reemerged from it, but in one of the residential houses. Fortunately, no one was home, so he spied on the little girl again, who was coincidentally next door. He saw her magnificent bright red hair, occasionally popping up on the bottom side of the window. She was taking something out from what seemed to be like a suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when she looked up, she saw Arrow staring at her. Her movements immediately went faster and more disorderly, only to be finished. She held up what seemed to be a long device that could release projectiles at amazing speeds. It was an assault rifle. She reloaded the rifle, and started approaching your current location. Thinking it may be dangerous, Arrow vanished into the shadows of the room, leaving no trace of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise was confused now. She could've sworn she saw some dark figure in that room. \"Maybe that's the threat.\" She thought. Elise lowered her rifle and searched the area for its presence. Her sixth sense was telling her to be cautionary and a hand covered her mouth. Her muffles cannot be heard by anyone. \"Is this the end? Can I really not stop this threat?\" She thought, until the hand let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise turned around and \"Peekaboo!\" shouted Arrow. Elise was stunned by his act, and quickly pointed the nose of her rifle towards his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill girl! Chill. I'm only an innocent little guy.\" Arrow said with a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise wasn't letting up and demanded Arrow to speak about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll speak.\" Then, Arrow told Elise of his life, his sealing and his awakening. Elise was surprised when Arrow called himself a god and was considering his unbelievable statement. \"Why not you tell me who you are as well, as fair trade?\" Elise glared at him, then relented. She told Arrow of her profession, her mission and her struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're looking for a anomaly in this period huh? And you're trying to eliminate it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think that I might be the said anomaly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly on point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I must be eliminated so history will not be altered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get it, any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I come with you to the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you outrageous? We're not allowed to bring anyone of the past into the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said that I was an anomaly, so technically, I don't belong in this period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Fair point. You can come with me, only if you behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that.\" Then, they sailed off towards the land of destiny. The land ruled by science, the future, is near.</span></div></div>",

Michelle works as a mid-level manager at an advertisement agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidney (5'9\" 22 years old): Terry's co-worker at the convenience store where he works. She started working at there around the same time as Terry and she's just about the only one people there he can stand. They get along pretty well and enjoy chatting at work. Sidney is isn't that curvy and she's on the tall side for a girl, but she's cute and attractive. She has shoulder length blonde hair, usually pulled back into a ponytail, piercing blue eyes, and an infectious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our trait swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let me show you,\" Xyllia grinned as she stood up from where she sat on Terry's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the demoness stepped forward into the light, Terry got a much better look at her. She was tall, about 5'8\" naturally, enhanced to 5'11\" by the 3-inch heels of the thigh-high black leather boots she wore. The rest of her outfit consisted of a sleeveless black leather crop top with a deep neckline, which was held together by a leather string that criss-crossed several times across her impressive cleavage, and a short black leather skirt with a skimpy black leather thong underneath. A long, thin tail with an arrow-shaped tip stuck out from below her skirt and her pointed ears were each adorned with a single silver ring. Her figure was quite voluptuous and Terry found himself wondering how her large D-cup breasts weren't spilling out of her top. However, despite the demon's curvaceous, feminine figure, there was also a hint of strong, toned, lean muscle to her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Xyllia asked teasingly, licking her black lips with her surprisingly long pointed tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry felt himself flush red as he realized he'd been ogling the sexy demoness in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humans are so predictable,\" Xyllia laughed, her bright yellow eyes alight with amusement. \"But enough about that.\" The demoness pointed a finger tipped with a sharp black nail at Terry. \"I was about to demonstrate my power.\" With that, Xyllia snapped her fingers and the two were suddenly standing in the street outside Terry's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Terry gasped as he breathed in the cool evening air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing,\" Xyllia said. \"Most demons can do that. My real power is my ability to exchange traits between people.\" Her pointed teeth locked together in a grin as she pointed out Terry's neighbors across the street, Linda and Steve, getting out of their car after a night out. \"Watch them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry watched, awestruck, as Xyllia worked her magic on the pair. The married couple, both in their early 30s, began to change before his very eyes. Linda, a petite blonde, suddenly shot up drastically in height and her body swelled with muscle as she gained her husband's height and physique. By contrast, Steve shrank in both areas as he gained his wife's height and physique. As if nothing had changed, the couple walked to the door and entered their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Terry practically shouted. \"They didn't notice a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My 'playings' only notice my alterations if I allow it,\" Xyllia explained. \"They only notice <i>me</i> if I allow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you allow me to see you?\" Terry asked, his curiosity growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if, you must know, you summoned me,\" Xyllia told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You summoned me ... technically. You did a particularly poor job of it, but it counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must've been that book ...\" Terry muttered, recalling an old book on demonology he found that morning when helping his mom clean the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a book mishap,\" Xyllia said. \"That'd do it. So, anyway, you summoned me and now we're bonded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're bonded? What does that mean?\" Terry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it means that you're the human I need to channel my power through in order to affect the world ... and there are certain things I need your permission for before I can do them,\" Xyllia explained, neglecting to mention that there were usually more restrictions, but the botched summoning job had left her with considerably more freedom than normal. Normally, she needed permission from her summoner to do anything. This was going to be much more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Terry asked. \"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as swapping myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, demon rules are weird. But who cares? Let's have some fun. What do you say, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Terry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Terry, how would you like to have some fun?\" Xyllia grinned. This human had no idea that telling her his name had the potential to give her more power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Terry, who was ignorant to the laws of magic and demons, had been enticed by the promise of entertainment. This was the excitement he was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and flashed a smile. \"You've got yourself a deal, Xyllia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXyllia grinned once more. \"Perfect.\"</span></div></div>",

People that have been swapped?\" Terry asked confused at what happened.<br>\r\n\"No not really, I am fairly new to this and my powers are somewhat... unique.\" Xyllia grinned as Terry sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this mean for us? Our bond?\" Terry asked.<br>\r\n\"You are a curious one aren't you?\" Xyllia giggled. \"It's like I said, a human I bond with becomes my vessel with which I can interact with the human realm.\" She repeated.<br>\r\n\"With no limitations?\" Terry asked further.<br>\r\n\"Only limitations with swapping either one of us, I'll need your permission and I can't swap anyone if I'm too far away from you, so you'll be stuck with me for now.\" Xyllia said as she slowly turned towards him.<br>\r\n\"Okay so..\" Terry started.<br>\r\n\"Now, no more questions Terry, I am a female demon, we are lustful beings and I can feel you want me too, so go ahead.\" Xyllia said seductively as Terry stopped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnchanted by Xyllia, Terry slowly moved closer to her kissing her on the lips, feeling a burning sensation on his lips as they touched. Xyllia slid her tongue inside of his mouth and slowly felt him up underneath his shirt. Soon, Terry and Xyllia started undressing each other and quickly moved into his bed. As Xyllia's hot body laid underneath Terry, he tried his best, but he didn't have much experience, especially with someone as beautiful as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Terry, if you want, we could trade equipment, might be more fun that way.\" Xyllia slyly suggested.<br>\r\n\"We... swap... genitals?\" Terry said nervously.<br>\r\n\"All I need is your permission.\" She grinned back.<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" Terry said as instantly a massive grin appeared on Xyllia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Terry gave permission, his cock slowly started to sprout in between Xyllia's beautiful legs, replacing her red snatch with a white cock clashing with her red skin. Her snatch however was now appearing between Terry's legs, causing a strange light burning feeling in that area. He didn't really get the change to concentrate on it however as Xyllia rolled him to the bottom and tested out her new cock by showing Terry how to properly use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry felt wave after wave of pleasure until they were both exhausted and laid cuddling in bed.<br>\r\n\"Wat happened?\" Terry asked out loud.<br>\r\n\"We swapped genitals and had sex, not very difficult to answer that one.\" Xyllia giggled.<br>\r\n\"No I mean, why did you do that for me, that must have been so much better for me than for you.\" Terry said a bit guilty.<br>\r\n\"Oh no worries Terry bear, I did have to take your cock, but my snatch suited you perfectly.\" Xyllia teased back.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, can I get that back?\" Terry asked.<br>\r\n\"I think we should stay like this a bit longer, we'd have to swap again next time anyway if we did.\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"So there's a next time?\" Terry said in a peppy tone uncommon to him.<br>\r\n\"If you are a good human.\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXyllia didn't tell Terry however, that even if she wanted to swap back genitals, all swaps between bonded creatures, eg. her and Terry in this case, are irreversible as long as the bond remains.<br>\r\n\"I could have had a worse human to be bonded with I guess, but he asks a lot of questions, might need to be careful with this one.\" She thought to herself as she felt Terry's cock between her legs.<br>\r\n\"I do like my new toy however.\" She grinned to herself as she stroked it a little.</span></div></div>",

She became a mother at the age of 20 and the father of her children is no longer in the picture. She's generally a cool mom, but is strict when she needs to be. Sometimes her kids can be a lot to deal with and can try her patience, but she does care for them and has their best interests at heart. She's still quite good looking with wavy blonde hair and a decent figure and she tries to keep up with the latest fashions when she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa (5'6\" 40 years old): A couples and family counselor who uses unorthodox methods. One such method is using hypnotism to alter how her patients behave. She has also looked into advanced technology and even magic. She's a somewhat stylish woman with dark brown hair and designer glasses and maintains a professional appearance at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris (5'7\" 19 years old): A somewhat nerdy college guy who enjoys video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and other nerdy pursuits. He's a bit shy and has some trouble bonding with people as a result, but he's looking to break out of his shell and make new friends who share his interests. He's a bit on the skinny side and lacks any athletic ability, but he's still decently attractive. He has short light brown hair and sharp blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney (5'7'' 21 years old): A girl who's into heavy metal music and believes in living in the moment. She likes to party and have a good time and has little patience for people she views as boring. As a result, she can be dismissive of most people outside of her friend groups. That said, she's a good friend and is very dependable. She's also quite attractive, has a great figure, and she has straight dark hair just past her shoulders. In terms of style, Britney generally wears tight-fitting pants and tops that show off her figure. She frequently wears tight jeans and leather pants and leather jackets, and from time to time skirts and other things that are a bit more feminine. She also has an affinity for boots and has many pairs in varying styles. She also plays the guitar.</span></div></div>",

She's quick to lash out when she doesn't get her way and the first to make a scene if she thinks she'll get an advantage out of it. She loves to hang out with her friends and dress to look hot, which mostly involves anything revealing enough to show skin, even though her mother doesn't always agree. She has wavy blonde hair like her mother, cut to shoulder length, and a great figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa (5'7\" 17 years old): Unlike her older sister, she hates to be around people in general and like to keep to herself. She can be kind of moody at times and is currently going through a goth phase. She shares some interests with her brother Quinton and actually gets along with him just fine, unless she's in a bad mood, in which case he can piss her off as much as anyone. She has long, straight black hair, wears heavy black eye makeup and dark colored clothes. She has a decent figure, but not as good as Vanessa's, not that she cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton (5'5\" 15 years old): The only boy in the family, and much like Clarissa he can moody at times and likes to keep to himself. He's into gaming and music and tries to avoid coming out his room when there's company as he hates being among lots of people. He has short black hair that gets wavy if it grows too long. He prefers a comfortable clothing style, but nothing with bright colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie (5'3\" 14 years old) The youngest member of the family. She's a girly girl like Vanessa, though not as extreme. She loves bright colors, especially pink, and usually wears shorts, skirts, or skinny jeans and girly tops. She likes pretty much everything and, much to Clarissa and Quinton's annoyance, wants to hang out all the time. She gets annoyed when she doesn't get what she wants. She has long, straight blonde hair and her figure is still developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our trait swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

Almost as if his hand was moving on its own accord, Chris took his room key and sliced open the tape that covered the box\u2019s opening flaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris flipped up the box\u2019s flaps up, removed the top layer of Styrofoam, and peered inside, he discovered what the treasure that was held within: it was a medium-sized tablet, sleek and minimalistic in design.

Chris selected the yes option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Marking individuals as swapees is a fairly simple task. Using Pygmalion 6\u2019s built-in camera, take a picture of the swapee by pressing the round button with the camera icon in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. You may switch between the front and back camera\u2019s by pressing the round button with the rotating arrows icon in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pressed the bottom-right button. Afterwards, he saw a picture of himself appear on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now tap on the person in the picture you wish to be marked as the swapee and you have completed the first step! Now, just follow the same steps for the second swapee. You may use the back button in the top left hand corner to reselect the first swapee. I will be back when you have selected the second swapee.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pondered on whom he should swap with. At first, he thought about swapping something with one of the several men whom all the ladies droll over. However, a weird thought crept into his mind. He was not sure it was going to work, but Chris booted up his computer and logged into his Facebook account. There was a girl named Lauren, on whom Chris had a huge crush since high school. By now, he had all but conceded that he would ever get a chance to ask her out, let alone date her. Therefore, he thought swapping something with her might be kind of hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loaded up a picture of Lauren from her Facebook page and used the Pygmalion 6 tablet to take a picture of it. He tapped on her picture to select her and waited anxiously to see if the device would accept this input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Congratulations, you have selected your first pair of swapees. Now it is time to determine what\u2019s going to be swapped.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new screen appeared on the tablet. It displayed two, generic human silhouettes, one male and one female. Above each silhouette there was a cropped version of each of their heads over the respective silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In Basic Mode, we only provide you with a select number of swaps you can perform. However, in Advanced mode, we allow you to have far more control over the swaps. For this tutorial, we have enabled only swaps between identical, or at least the corresponding part of the opposite gender, body part swaps. In order to select the type of swap, press down on an area of one silhouette and drag it over onto the same spot on the other figure. Please do so now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pressed down on his figure\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris pressed down on his figure\u2019s groin region and slid his finger until it landed on the crotch belonging to Lauren\u2019s silhouette. As soon as Chris released his finger, he heard the woman\u2019s voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A genital swap. Good choice! However, before you press that swap button, let\u2019s review the additional options that Advanced Mode provides so that you can customize the swap to your heart\u2019s desire. Each swap has a select number of additional options that you can activate or deactivate. Please peruse through the following options and, whenever you\u2019re done, press the swap button to complete the process.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris looked through the list, he found that there was a mixed bag of intuitive and bizarre options. Some were pretty simple, like indicating that you wanted to keep your balls or pubic hair. But some were quite involved. One option would make the sex cells match the recipient\u2019s DNA. In other words, the eggs produced by Lauren\u2019s swapped ovaries would be formed from Chris\u2019 DNA. Another option would make each swapee retain how long it would take them to reach orgasm. After Chris had reviewed the options and selected the ones he wanted, he hit the swap button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to feel a tingling sensation in his groin. It was not painful, just weird. This feeling only lasted a few seconds, but once it had resided, Chris immediately could tell that he was now missing something in between his legs. But what shocked him even more was that, when he looked down at his groin, the front of his jeans was not loose, but rather they clung tightly to his now flat groin. When he zipped down his fly and unbuttoned the front button of his jeans, he discovered that his boxer briefs were changed in a similar fashion. And when he lifted up the waistband of his boxers, he saw it: what he assumed was Lauren\u2019s vagina where his dick used to be. His own brown, bushy pubic hair still remained, causing a start contrast between these male and female features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he did anything else, Chris wanted to see how the swap affected Lauren. Instead of looking at her Facebook page, Chris pulled out his phone. When Chris and Lauren were freshmen in high school, they had been paired up for a group project in one of the few classes they shared. They both exchanged numbers for the project and after it was done, Lauren forgot that Chris\u2019 number was in her phone. Fast forward to the beginning of their senior year, Lauren accidentally sent a picture of herself just in her panties to Chris that was intended for her then-boyfriend, because the contacts of the two boys were right next to each other. Chris could not remember if he had deleted that picture, but sure enough he found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, the picture was the same: Lauren was standing in what Chris assumed was her bathroom. One hand held her cell phone, which she had used to take the picture via the bathroom mirror\u2019s reflection. Her other hand covered up her topless, meagre-sized boobs. But there was one big change in the picture. Now her panties, which had been resized for her new form, contained a massive erection. Even the text that had accompanied this photo was different, as it now read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201chope u <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">! Took me forever to get this boner!\u201d</div><br>\r\n<i>Congratulations! You have completed your first swap! At this point, you should have all the tools to use the Pygmalion 6. But before you go, there is one last thing I must mention. If you are not happy with the swap, you can press the \u201cUndo\u201d button below. This will revert the swap. You can also press the \u201cConfirm\u201d button if you are satisfied with the results. You may select one now. Afterwards, you can always select the help button if you need any more guidance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Chris heard these final instructions, he selected\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no way he could pass up on this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Chris had been looking at a picture of his high school crush sporting a raging boner, he was already starting to feel a little horny. Almost as if his fingers were moving on their own, Chris began to browse the internet for something to watch while he tested out Lauren's pussy. He settled on a video of a pretty woman performing a striptease before fingering herself. As he watched the sort of cringey introduction where the woman was doing some small talk before she started to strip off her clothes, a thought popped into Chris' head, which made him immediately stop the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then held up the Pygmalion 6 up to his computer monitor and marked the woman in the video as a swapee. After clicking through the options, he pressed the swap button and then set the tablet aside to gaze back at the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video looked exactly the same as it had just seconds before, but there was a different woman featured in it: Lauren. She wore the same, tiny red dress that the other woman had been clad with. Chris' old manhood was tenting out that very dress. And once he pressed play, he saw his crush perform the same striptease that he had seen the other woman perform several times before. When Lauren had discarded all of her clothes, she started to stroke her rockhard cock with her slender, feminine hands. Once Lauren began to masturbate, Chris slipped his hand down his pants and started to explore his new genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched Lauren moan with each stroke of her \"womanhood,\" Chris began to feel waves of pleasure reverberate through his body. For a moment, Chris just sat there and took in this new sensation. He was almost so distracted by this new experience that he almost missed the warm stream of semen jet out of Lauren's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his other hand, Chris tapped the space bar, thereby pausing the video. Then, with that same hand, he reached over and clicked the \"Undo\" button. When he looked at the video again, the woman who originally appeared in it had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this thing has <b>SO</b> many possibilities,\" Chris panted before getting up to take a shower. But before he headed into the bathroom, he made a quick stop in his room to pick out his change of clothes. When he opened up his closet, he looked for some clothes that would be perform for a visit to the...</span></div></div>",

She generally doesn't care what people think and just wants to do her own thing and live her life. She can be a bit of a flake sometimes, but will be there for her friends when she's needed. She's cute with a slender build and she has wavy shoulder length blonde hair. Kim's preferred clothing is whatever she finds comfortable, from jeans to skirts to band t-shirts to dresses, from more unisex tomboyish outfits to the very feminine. She also plays the bass guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki (5'5'' 21 years old): A rebellious girl with a chaotic personality who's into punk music. She has little patience for authority figures and \"normal\" people and she enjoys taking them down a peg when she can. She generally only associates with people she thinks are cool enough. Nikki has a very punky fashion sense, wearing ripped clothes and combat boots and the like. She has a decent figure but doesn't care much about showing it off. She has straight brown hair but she's always dying it different colors and trying different hairstyles. She also plays the drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, how does our trait swapping story start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clock read 3:00 A.M. and Britney was still awake. Despite having gone out barhopping with her roommates that night, she just couldn't sleep. She wasn't sure why, but she'd been dealing with a bit of insomnia lately. She wasn't just lying in bed fruitlessly attempting to sleep, however. She was reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney wasn't much of a reader normally, but she'd found an old book on the supernatural at a thrift store a few days ago that caught her fancy. She thought it might serve as some inspiration for her music. It was old, from like the 1930s or older, she thought, and covered a wide range of supernatural topics. It was all probably bullshit, but it was pretty damn interesting and it would be great inspiration. Due to her insomnia, she'd taken to reading it late at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was reading, Britney came across two pages that were stuck together. It didn't seem like there was something sticky had been spilled on them, but more like some unseen force was holding them together. Curiosity getting the better of her, she decided to try to pry them apart. They didn't want to move at first, but after she pulled a bit harder, they flew apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Britney gasped in surprise, dropping the book on the bed as a rush of cloud-like shadows spewed out from the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the shadows stopped flowing out from the book. They then began to condense just above the bed, forming into a roughly humanoid shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last,\" a sinister, whispery voice said. \"Freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I must really be sleep deprived,\" Britney muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my liberator,\" the voice said as what Britney assumed was the shadow's head looked down at her. \"As good a host as any, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Britney could even react, the shadow flew at her. It collapsed back into smokey clouds and entered her body through her nose and open mouth. She could barely breathe as the shadowy clouds forced their way inside her. Once whatever the thing was had fully entered, Britney passed out and collapsed onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" Britney shouted, bolting upright in bed. She looked around in a panic, but soon calmed down. Everything seemed normal. \"Must've been a dream,\" she reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock now read 8:00 A.M. She must've fallen asleep reading the book now lying on her bed and had a crazy dream. Yeah, that had to be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the bed, Britney threw on the jeans and tank top she'd worn the night before then took another look around. Early morning light was now flitting in through the window and Britney was sure she wouldn't be getting back to sleep now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" a sinister voice suddenly whispered, this time as if within Britney's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney jumped. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wasn't a dream,\" the voice said, responding to Britney's thoughts as she thought them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-- what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question. I guess you could say I'm a magical entity. You'll have to forgive my ... intrusion, but I had little choice. I am grateful for you freeing me from that dreadful book, but I am not yet strong enough to survive on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're .. inside me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, until I regain my full power. But that's something you can help me with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can get you out of me faster, I'll do whatever I can to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a smart woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to do?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the entity explained itself. It had the power to swap any traits between people and control who was aware of them, but it was too weak right now. It needed to rely on the strength of a host to do anything. With each swap, it would slowly regrow its power. Due to its weakened state, however, it needed Britney to do the swapping for it ... or so it claimed. Britney had no reason to doubt it, though ... or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity explained how its power worked and how Britney was supposed to activate it and then it sent her on her way. Stepping out into the living room of the apartment she shared with her roommates, she took a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim lay passed out on the couch, having not made it to her room. <i>Typical</i>, Britney thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Nikki. She'd left her door open again and Britney could see her lying in bed with the dude she'd hooked up with last night at the bar. Both were also passed out. <i>Again?</i> Britney thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window next, Britney saw that there were plenty of people to swap out there as well. She certainly had options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, make a swap,\" the entity's voice urged her from inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient,\" Britney quietly hissed back. Mulling over her options, Britney thought about what she was going to do.</span></div></div>",
