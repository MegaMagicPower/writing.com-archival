A large reception desk was placed in the middle of the room, chairs were scattered at the walls, a TV set played a sports game from somewhere. A door was directly at the side of the desk; big red words that read \"No Entrance; Employees Only\" were on the frame.Situated at the desk was a receptionist, she was lazily reading from a book and sipping from a cup. Barely glancing upwards, the receptionist suddenly shot upwards when she saw Rena. The receptionist, a dog-girl, snapped to attention and Rena felt an enthusiastic aura, which she didn't possessed before. Jumping over the counter, the dog-girl grabbed Rena's hand and shook it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why<b><i>hello</i></b>toyouhoney.MynameTrudy. I. AM. SO.

HAH,fetch.Doyoulikewater?Wait,noisthatbad?Yourafelinidsothatprobablymeansno\" the dog-girl,evidently named Trudy, blared to Rena. Rena was so rattled that she let Trudy lead her to a chair--while having her hand still shook-- sat her down  and let Trudy let go of her hand to fetch some water. Rena finally got a hold of herself to take the water Trudy brought to her. Rena looked up to the receptionist's face.Beaming a canine smile to Rena,Trudy asked her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry about that, so honey who are you representing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rena shook her head clear and told her \"Pardon, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rena Calico,I'm with the city's PR department. As you know they mayor's second term parade is soon and he would like to acquire one of your blimps. During his first campaign he purchased some of your wares. He says that your previous blimps were 'stupendous' and 'worth the buck, no offense to any bucks'. He also specified to get the, and I quote, 'Largest one in the entire stock, I want something to block the city skies', unquote. He personally sought me out and asked me to purchase what is called the 'Special Surprise' from your catalogue. The city is willing to pay any amount for it. Don't worry of the costs, the city would back him up on anything.\" Rena looked to Trudy, who for some reason looked particularly analytical after the information was said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The city sent you to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And the Mayor wants the \"Special Surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And he wants a, and you quote, \"something to block the city skies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trudy looked at Rena for a few minutes, then abruptly slapped her head. Walking away, Rena heard a small \"of course\" before going through the door. Rena was puzzled, was her appearance that provoking? She knew she had suit perfectly on: white, steamed, all the buttons sewn on. It couldn't be that, was it her body? She looked down and sighed; bosom as flat as a board, an ass like a carpet, and the curves of straight line. No, that couldn't be it--what type of store called out someone on that? Well, Trudy did seemed to be gifted in the bosom department. Was it because she was a cat? Black cats were considered unlucky, but did it translate towards discrimination? No, Mayor Stein was also a black cat and was the one asking for the blimp! So it couldn't be that and Trudy was nice to Rena. When it crossed her mind Rena instantly sunk, feeling a little shameful for the thought that all canine hated felines. Hearing a creaking noise, Rena looked towards the door. Opening up she saw Trudy standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Rena honey, Trudy called from the door,.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(As a fan of the old series, I hated to see it die and I added a few chapters as an alternative path and I wish to take this story to that point. I will need help to get this up to speed. This addition originally by Nameless One.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Rena stretched a bit and looked down at the ground. Then, slowly, a somewhat mischievous grin appeared on her face. It was times like this that she did one\u2026of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy most accounts, Rena was a fairly normal girl. She like new clothes, romantic comedies, the usual stuff most girls like. However there were two things about Rena that was a bit peculiar, one quirk that was still acceptable by society's standards and another that she had to\u2026keep secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far back as she could remember, Rena always had a fascination with comic books. Probably when she was still growing up, her uncle would show her his collection and read them to her like they were story books. As Rena got older, she would collect back issues and archives in paper backs. Rena also had a bit of artistic talent in her and learned how to draw rather well in a variety of ways but especially the super hero comic book style. The only thing better than super hero comic books would be if she could be a super hero herself. A bit unusual for a girl but still fairly normal. No, it was that other thing that made her truly strange which she guard most carefully from everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor reasons that not even Rena understood, she always had an obsession with water. Unlike most young kids growing up, she loved bath time and her parents had a hard time getting to come out even when she was cleaned. She swam almost every day and would become depressed in the winter because her pool would always freeze over...at least until she got her YWCA pass so she could swim in the indoor pool. She preferred baths over showers simply for the sake of soaking in water and always tried the swimming pools and hot tubs if she ever had to travel and needed a hotel to stay at. Some of her friends joked that if she kept swimming as much as she did, she might grow gills; even though she would laugh, personally, she thought that would be awesome. And of course, no matter what, she would never, ever let anyone know she was secretly an Aquaphile; after all, it would be rather embarrassing if anyone knew she sometimes got aroused while swimming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this obsession had very little of an outlet...that is, until she discovered the internet in all of its corrupting glory. Looking around Rena discovered the concept of \"water inflation\" and immediately fell in love with the idea. It was one thing to be IN water; what could be better than for water to be INSIDE her? She already had a Deviant art account but using another one under a different name and no personal information, she would soon find herself drawing tons of water inflation pictures under a slightly different art style to hide her tracks, earning numerous page views and several friends with the same fetish. She would even draw herself blissfully undergoing the said inflation, though for the sake of being anonymous, she always drew herself as a white-furred tiger with black hair instead of her usual orange and red self. After all...she didn't want to admit this to anyone in real life... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as much fun as drawing and reading about water inflation was, Rena's heart ached with the desire to actually experience it. Growing bulging bellies, massive mammaries, bubble butts, a combination of two or all three or getting large all over; it didn't matter as long as she was filled with water, beautiful water. Even having proportions that were completely impossible and caused brief immobility sounded wonderful as long as she could drain herself later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, pictures and interactive stories ( XD ) were her only outlet and the internet was the only way she could connect with others with minimal flaming. Logging out of her main account and logging into her fetish account, Rena was quite disappointed to find out there were no new pictures...at least no new water inflation pictures. Maybe if she formed an art club that encouraged that kind of stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Rena got up and decided a nice bath would make her feel better; after all, she actually forgot to take one last night, of all the things that could have happened. Filling her tub until it was just the right temperature, Rena disrobed and dipped herself inside, feeling every part of her relaxing as she soon had everything except her hair submerged. Sighing loudly, Rena couldn't help but think this was the best....well...almost the best....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty-five minutes, just when the tub was starting to get a bit too cold for her, Rena got out and dried herself, throwing some clothes on her, though something bothered her. Feeling around her face, she realized there was some soap she forgot to scrub off. Ugh, how irritating! Nothing is worse than having unwashed soap on one\u2019s face! Normally, Rena would have just used whatever was left from her bath but, of course, that already drained out; still, no use fussing about things you can\u2019t change. Rena let the sink run just enough to produced mildly warm water and pulled the drain, then proceeded to wash her face gently, being sure to get every washed. After she was sure that she didn\u2019t have any soap left on her, Rena grabbed a towel and dried her face off and was just about to pull the plug on the sink drain when she saw something quite odd. Right there, in the sink, was a little bit of water forming a\u2026column? No, wait a minute; if she looked closely enough, it vaguely resembled a female figure, a bit exaggerated in the hips and breast area. Rena rubbed her eyes and looked again. Still there; had her mind finally snapped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d A tiny voice said. This caused Rena to step back in shock. Who was speaking?!? Was it\u2026the water? No, that can\u2019t be, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ve come to offer you a gift in exchange for a service to help your fellow man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait\u2026are you talking through the water column?\u201d Rena said, looking around a bit. If this was a dream, it felt very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m speaking THROUGH the water column. My name is L\u2019acquaser. I am a water spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026.water sprit?\u201d Rena asked, stepping forward a bit. She certainly wasn\u2019t expecting this. Perhaps if she wasn\u2019t anxious from fear, she might have been a bit more excited about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. See, I sense unusual thoughts from this house. While I\u2019m not telepathetic, there is very little about water that we do not know and I have sense that you are a woman who loves water, far more than any other mortal. In exchange for a service, I\u2019m willing to give you a gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026kind of gift?\u201d Rena asked, not sure what a water spirit\u2026that is what it called itself, right?...could ever offer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, your desire to fill yourself with water, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly got Rena\u2019s attention. Did it just offer to give her the power of water inflation?!? She would do ANYTHING for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll give me the ability to perform water inflation on myself! Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Rena said, tail wagging furiously. If this wasn\u2019t a dream, then this certainly was the best moment of her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the enuthasim but first I am required to explain the conditions. In exchange for your heart\u2019s desire, you must use the power of water in order to fight injustice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, like a superhero? That\u2019s like giving me two gifts!\u201d Rena said, having trouble controlling her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026yes, but please understand this is a serious undertaking and should not be taken lightly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, with great power comes great responsibility. I accept already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.well\u2026I suppose I can give it to you early if you think you are ready\u2026.\u201d The water figure said, holding out smooth, undetailed arms. From its \u201chands\u201d, a ball of blue light gently floated towards Rena until it sunk inside her chest, a cool sensation billowing inside of her until it was complete gone, leaving Rena with a strange, yet wonderful, power flowing within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now what?\u201d Rena asked, anxious to see what she can do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t expecting this, but your services are needed already. If you could just draw up some water in that bathtub of yours\u2026.maybe about three inches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, eagerly plugging her tub and turning on the water. She wasn\u2019t sure what was about to happen but she knew it was going to be awesome. Super hero powers and water inflation? What could be better than that? After Rena quickly got some water inside her tub, not even bothering to adjust the temperature, Rena turned around, waiting for more instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you believe you are ready, simply stand inside the tub, place a fist on your chest and concentrate into becoming a great warrior of justice.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*original by Namelessone*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd request to be sure but Rena didn\u2019t hesitate. Oddly enough, even with her bare feet and the cuff of her jeans touching the water, Rena didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit cold\u2026a little wet, but not cold. Still, Rena pushed even these thoughts out of her mind, focusing only on transforming into a superhero capable of fighting crime. As she gathered her thoughts, some of the water from the tub began to creep over her clothes and body, until only her muzzle and part of her hair was left unexposed. A few seconds later and Rena could no longer feel anything wet but instead a vaguely rubber-like mass covering most of her body. Curious and excited at the same time, Rena jumped out of the time, not even noticing the water she was getting everywhere on the floor and stood in front of the bathroom mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was starting to suspect, Rena\u2019s usual attire of jeans and a black sweater was now replaced by a somewhat form fitting rubber suit, jet black with dark blue trims, dark blue gloves and boots built into the suit, and a few strips of material that covered the space between her legs to her rear and two patches on the front of the breast; Rena could only guess it was to keep herself decent in public. Even more curious was the fact that almost every part of her was covered by the black suit, even her tail, with only her white muzzle and the back of her head exposed, showing her fiery red hair that contrasted with the rest of her suit. While it was still obvious that she was a catgirl underneath, it did a great job of covering her fur pattern, ensuring her identity was safe; even her eyes appeared to be little more than white spots on her head, just like in the comic books and animation adaptations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, cool\u2026so this is my outfit? Not bad, not bad at all\u2026so what are my powers, anyways? I mean, you mention water, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time but I\u2019ll guide you as best as possible. Just know that your powers are easy to control as they are accomplished simply by thinking about them.\u201d L\u2019acquaser said, just before the water figure jumped at Rena\u2019s flat stomach and seemed to disappear. However, Rena felt something enter her\u2026.did\u2026she just absorbed her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Quickly, sit back down in the tub.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena jumped a foot in the air and looked around, trying to find the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;It\u2019s alright, Rena. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m inside your body. Like I said, water absorption is one of your abilities. I\u2019ll stay inside you to guide you.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, a little surprised, but hearing L\u2019acquaser mention hurrying caused Rena to obey, sitting in about an inch of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Now, imagining yourself melting into the water below, almost becoming a part of it. With just enough water, even a small puddle, you can use water to teleport yourself anywhere.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked down, thinking about what she was just told to do. Rena then felt her body become strange and lost all sense of touch as she felt herself getting lower into the water until she was looking from a very small vantage point, seeing the sides of the tub. It was very strange, like being a fish yet she didn\u2019t seem to have a physical body, so \u201cswimming\u201d was so effortless\u2026like...a video game, or at least Rena might have made that comparison if she was actually a gamer. Still, swimming into a certain part of the tub caused everything to become a fog of blue, until Rena found herself in a wondrous place, comprised of nothing but water and millions of bubbles that held suspended in place, stretching out seemingly infinitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Where am I? What is this place?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;This is a power only you now have. With water, you can connect to any point in the world that has some sizeable amount of water. Anywhere from a dog\u2019s dish to the deepest part of any ocean. While you can explore at your own leisure, that will take too long and we do not have the time. I\u2019ll be your guide when you are here. For now, swimming towards that bubble that I have given a golden glow.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, out of all of the bubbles hanging in space, only one had a golden aura around it. Swimming into it, Rena found herself in a very strange place; while still nothing more than water, she could have swore she was inside a water cooler! Rena looked around and saw that she appeared to be inside a bank and, what do you know, a gang of five men were robbing the place. Rena wished her first mission was a bit more\u2026dramatic, but all superheroes have to start somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I think I can see my target, but what can I do? I\u2019m stuck by plastic, my mortal enemy!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Actually, I think electricity and extreme heat are your mortal enemy now. As water, no, as the human who controls water, you also can control pressure and force, simply swim towards the frame with all of your might, and you will burst out like a mighty stream. With this on your side, you can use as little force as a splash and enough force like fire hose or even a bullet.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure if that would really work, Rena \u201cswam\u201d back and then move forward, imagining herself with the force of a mighty river or tsunami, anything that could destroy plastic. It worked and Rena felt herself bursting through the container, falling to the ground in a puddle. Several people looked on in surprised at the mess on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Now, reform yourself and fight in the name of justice! Do not fear, attack and your instincts will take over!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, Rena felt her level of vision rising until she was first a humanoid mass of water and eventually her clear body quickly became opaque and soon she was once again herself, only still clan in that odd outfit that perfectly hidden her true identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell is that thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-she came out of the water from the cooler! I knew that thing was processed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up and shoot already!\u201d one of the men said, firing a bullet while all but one of the others quickly joined in. Rena instinctively shrieked and brought her arms over her face\u2026.only\u2026she didn\u2019t feel anything. Opening her eyes and looking behind her, there were several holes in the wall, behind where she was standing\u2026how could she have\u2026? Looking forward, Rena saw shock and horror on the face of the would-be felons, one of them firing again, into her stomach. This time, Rena watched, turning down just fast enough to see her stomach\u2026splash? Water seemingly splash out of her body and feel to the floor but Rena didn\u2019t have hardly a scratch on her. Did\u2026her body automatically turn into water? Rena looking up with a new found confidence. This is what so many superheroes didn\u2019t have that she possessed: invulnerability. The men looked on in confusion and terror at the one thing they could not solve just by shooting at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who are you?\u201d one man asked, the one who didn\u2019t shoot and was on the verge of giving up; after all how can you fight against something you can\u2019t shoot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the Hydraulic Superheroine, the woman of water, the liquid-based dispenser of justice! I am\u2026Hydro Lady! Give up now and I\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the more curious one fell to his knees and placed his gun on the floor in defeat, the others rushed at Rena, who only laughed; after all, if bullets couldn\u2019t hurt her, how could punches? In fact, that is exactly what happened; as the men tried to punch her, large sections of her body simply turned to water at the last second as some sort of defense mechanism and the men simply found themselves punching water, splashing it on themselves. Now it was Rena\u2019s turn, though just before she made her connections, her fist always turned into water and hit at the men with severe pressure, adding quite a bit of power that her small frame simply lack. Within seconds all men were on the ground, unconscious. Rena then surveyed the location; no one seemed hurt though everyone was understandably scared and confused. One guy was recording the whole thing on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou there!\u201d Rena said, hand on her hip and pointing at him with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuah! Y-yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop trying to make the next big hit on YouTube and call 911 already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s Hydro Lady. And you there!\u201d Rena said, pointing to the only gang member that gave up when Rena offered to go easy on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stay right there and don\u2019t move and I want you to confess everything. Because if I have to chase after you, I can guarantee that you will suffer just as much as your thick-headed friends, got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026I-I won\u2019t cause any trouble\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just to be sure\u2026\u201d Rena said, grabbing the gun. While she maintained a steel face, it was a bit scary holding a live gun, even if she didn\u2019t have to worry about getting shot. Interestingly enough, he still had the safety on; was he clueless or just hanging out with the wrong crowd? Either way, Rena managed to empty the bullets out and take them with her, then threw the empty gun on the floor and placed the bullets on the counter, telling the bank staff they better keep it behind the counter, as evidence. Looking around for her escape, Rena noticed there was still a bit of water left in the cooler. Thinking about turning into water and hoping her guess was right, Rena defied every imaginable law of physics and wavered into the shallow pool of water, her now watery legs following once her upper body completely disappeared inside the water. It wasn\u2019t long until she found herself swimming again, surrounded by the millions of bubbles that connected this scared place with the rest of the world.</span></div></div>",

Miss Westfall, you are a natural!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What can I say, it\u2019s all the comic books I read. Now, which way is home? Or do we have another mission?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;No, I do think you can head home for now. I\u2019ll show you the way.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena followed a glow to the right until she soon found herself looking up at her own tub and, after thinking about it, turned back into herself\u2026mostly. Meanwhile, some water flew out of her body and gracefully splashed into her still filled sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026not that wasn\u2019t fun and all but how do I get back to normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do as you did before, place your fist over your chest and concentrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena did so and, sure enough, the suit turned back into water and fell down into the tub, filling it up more again. Still, Rena couldn\u2019t let out a sad sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019ve received the honor of being a great warrior, something no one else has been chosen for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Rena said, looking down at the water in her tub. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get a chance or even an excuse to try water inflation. Well, maybe the next time I have to fight or help out I might have an excuse to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but Rena, that part of the bargain applies even when you\u2019re not on a mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.come again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you do not have your ability to turn into water when you are normal, you still have all of your other powers, meaning-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can practice water inflation right here in the privacy of my own home?!?\u201d Rena asked, tail wagging furiously and getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that was the agreement between us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, how do I do it?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please settle down, Miss Westfall. Just like most of your powers, you simply need a resource and think about it. You can completely control water, its shape, its speed, even the direction where it flows so long as it is touching a surface. You can\u2019t make water float completely off the ground but if needed, you can cause condensation in humid environments in emergencies. For now, just focus on absorbing the water in the tub. You aren\u2019t a sponge per say, as you have to focus but you can absorb water when desired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning broadly, Rena held out her arms and thought about the three or so inches in the tub flowing inside her and watched eagerly as her body started to expand. Since she was only concentrating on absorbing the water, it went inside her almost equally throughout her body. Once all the water was gone, she tried getting out, noting that while she was able to move just fine, it did felt somewhat heavy. Looking in the mirror, Rena could only fun her hands around her body, noting that while she looked like she just gained a few pounds all over, she didn\u2019t quite look fat, just\u2026puffy. But when she pressed against her sides, her body gave in a lot and was rather squishy, a very noticeable \u201csloshing\u201d sound. Rena could only purr. It wasn\u2019t like she imagined, it was even better! And now she could do this all the time! Odd that her clothes didn\u2019t rip by now but that was something not worth complaining about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026.if desired\u2026you can localize the water within your body\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only grin mischievously as she thought about sending the water to two points; her breasts. Within seconds, Rena felt all the water quickly flow within her and turned her flat board chest into two large melons that easily broke the cup-size scale. Cupping them, squishing them, pressing them together, Rena could only giggle and laugh. They didn\u2019t feel heavy (at least not too heavy) and while they didn\u2019t feel quite like normal breasts (after all, they were more like water balloons at his point), Rena loved it. She even bend her knees and stuck out her tongue naughtily after letting her breasts lay on the counter, as if she were displaying them for someone. Rena didn\u2019t notice but L\u2019acquaser turned to the side a bit, somewhat embarrassed. Even though this power could only be wielded by someone like Rena, it was a bit silly with how much she was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena paid no attention as she put some water in her rear and the rest in her belly, squishing her palms against her butt, feeling it\u2019s softness before drawing it all into her belly, giving herself the appearance of being at least nine-months pregnant, with triplets even. Still, as Rena stood there, hands on her belly, she frowned a bit as she thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026I probably can\u2019t afford to do this too often\u2026otherwise the water bill would go through the roof\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken care of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter observing you, I knew it would take a lot of water to make you happy and you can\u2019t keep the same old water in the bathtub; otherwise, how will you enjoy the baths you like so much? That\u2019s why I have altered many of your pipes. From now on, all water from your garden hose to your sinks will, instead of using water from your usual service, will mystically pump in water from a fresh water spring. You will never have to worry about \u2018running up a bill\u2019 as you humans put it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. And I assure you, while no water will ever be too hot or too cold for you anymore, you can still adjust the temperature with the knob as always. Of course, your dishwasher and washing machine still uses normal water from your utility service; otherwise it would be rather suspicious if you stopped using water at all completely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you mean I can get as big as I water with the tub here?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithin reason. I suggest you keep the blinds closed and stay indoors when you have your\u2026fun\u2026but otherwise, you can so long as you as careful not let others see you; otherwise\u2026that would be problematic for both of us. Now, I must go but I shall return when you are needed. All I ask is that you keep some water close by so I can come forth and communicate with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a bucket for each room in the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026really not necessary\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got plenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026very well\u2026I must go. Please, enjoy yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, L\u2019acquaser melted back inside the water still in the sink and vanished; in fact, it almost seemed some water disappeared. Now that she was alone with the knowledge that she had almost free water for life, Rena grinned as she leaned her belly against the side of the tub and turned the water on. Rena already tried a little water, now she wanted more. Using the water itself to\u2026shut off the water, Rena then proceeded to float a stream upwards to her and then inside her own body, feeling it pumping into her stomach and the rest of body. After refilling and shutting off the tub a few times, Rena squished her large body and proudly looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to overdo it too quickly, she absorbed enough water to look like she might have weighted about\u2026.450 lbs? Didn\u2019t matter, she wasn\u2019t fat, she was just filled with water and loved it as she used her large arms to run her chubby hands over her body and squish herself. She developed cheeks on her face like large grape fruits on either side of a muzzle with a little bit of water under her jaw and her large neck almost completely blended in with her soft shoulders. Her arms were at least four inches in diameter near the shoulder, ending in chubby hands with fat little fingers. Her body frame was at least two feet long in width and two beach ball-sized breasts, both about a foot in diameter, were lying neatly on top of a large belly that was about two feet in diameter, hanging in front of her legs just above her knees by a few inches. Turning a bit, she noticed her rear were the almost the size of two medicine balls stuck together, at least three feet wide, and her legs were so large that they were constantly rubbing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t help but hop once and let the water jiggle around, purring as she felt like she was getting massaged from the inside. She then tried placing water in various locations with different amounts in different places, and then even experimented with placing them all in just one area. After that, Rena returned the water where it were and tried one more quick thing. Turning on the water and keeping the faucet on, Rena started absorbed more water than she could carry, at least not without stretching her proportions out first. Using the water in the tub to shut off the water after she ungracefully but painlessly fell to the floor, Rena found herself barely able to move, her water bloated limbs blocked by both their size and the size of her body. Seemingly impossibly big, Rena nuzzled the giant breasts that blocked her view and felt her belly. Even in the middle of her bliss, clearly becoming aroused by her fantasy come true, Rena could feel her stomach growling. Sighing, Rena drained enough water out of her breasts so she could see over them, then used the water she just emptied out to pull the plug out, then proceeded to drain herself until finally not one drop was left in her. Even if she didn\u2019t want to quit just yet, she couldn\u2019t ignore the basic needs of her body. And it might be a good idea to close all of the blinds\u2026</span></div></div>",

She still had a full day ahead of her and without work today\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had to think. At first, she thought she might drag one of her hoses though a window (the side window, inside the backyard, way from the street) and see just how big she could make herself and test the limits of her powers. It would be fun to see if she could distort her proportions while being filled with water and see just how much she could hold\u2026.well, at least while inside her living room, which Ws by far was the largest room in the house aside from her empty garage. And since she had a hose attachment and the water tended to leak, if anywhere, outside and she could just float water straight from her body to the tub if necessary\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Rena remembered that she the digital camera she won in that contest a few months ago, the one that came with a tripod. She didn\u2019t have any use for it but now, Rena thought, while not take a few pictures of herself while filled with water at various locations in her body and then use those pictures as references? After all, she has the power of water inflation, so if anyone in the world knew what it was like and how it should look, she would! Hmmm\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1. Rena decides that since she is the ultimate model for water inflation, it\u2019s time to take a few pictures and draw them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Original by System_Crash*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging in her closet for a time, ending up having to look in another, Rena found the camera and tripod. The camera was still the box, practically unopened except for the few minutes Rena had played with it whens he had first won the blasted thing. Still, after taking the time to familiarize herself with the camera, figuring out the buttons and how to attach the tripod, she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, hardware ready was different from drawing ready. She could draw fairly quickly, especially in her superhero like style, but she had to decide what she wanted to do first. Would she do a single panel, or a comic. Finally, after debating with herself for a time Rena made her decision. She wouldn't do a full comic, just a few panel shots showing the progression of her inflation, with a hose and maybe a few other details in the background. Still, Rena could stand to wait any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rigging the camera and getting a hold of its remote control, Rena brought the outside house from the backyard through the bushes and the side window, letting it drape across the carpet and eventually into the living room. Rena could have tried to take the picture in the bathroom, but with so many shiny surfaces there would have been a lot of lens flare. So, living room would have to work. With a control valve securely on the end of the hose, Rena gently placed it close to her mouth. She knew she could just pull the water in from outside her body, but she wanted to have the sense of actually swallowing that much water, just having it absorb through her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena began slow at first, her vision of the image series starting to become a solid concept. It would be a simple background with a lion woman, a hose, and some small chibi like thing in the background controlling a valve. Rena would have liked to use a cheetah, but they usually had slightly different proportions then a tiger-like person. Lion-women were far closer in overall body shape and dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rena began, sucking down the water like it was life air itself. She took picture often at the beginning, that way it could look like the drawn process had started out slow and then had gotten faster. For Rena, however, it was only one speed, but that just meant she could enjoy the whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out in her stomach, slowly making her usually flat, athletic form become puffy before the inflation began to spread to other places. Rena could only purr with every step. The water from the hose was very cold, but it felt pretty darn good. Like when you've been in the sun all day and you have a glass of cold water. It felt something like that. Still, the simple sensation of feeling her body expand was driving Rena through the roof. The fact that it was happening so slowly only made it more enjoyable and longer lasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inflation continued, Rena quickly gaining the apperance of someone that looked like they weighed 200, 300, and then 400 pounds. Rena even went a little farther, getting to the point where she could just barely waddle before stopping and closing up the valve on the hose. With that series of pictures done Rena waddled over to the kitchen sink, guiding the water as it slipped out of her and down the drain until she was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though Rena had enough to draw with, she wanted to do more inflation. Well, after full body, Rena couldn't help but giggle and hold her very flat chest. Guess she might as well hit every major expansion group. Checking to make sure the camera had enough space on its memory card, thank god for digital, Rena got the hose going again but this time, instead of drinking, she just let the water hit her right in about the center chest, her body drawing in every drop and, per her mental command, began channeling it into her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena giggled as she litterally watched her breasts grow out like a pair of water balloons, getting larger with ever passing moment. Up the scale she went, Rena quickly loosing track when she had gone past any natural size. Still, she kept going, using a button on the camera's remote control to take a picture every once in a while. Eventually, her breasts were the size of those large medicine balls, and Rena had to admit she was having trouble standing up. Still, she kept going, keepingn herself standing until, finally, her breasts reached the floor and all that water weight shifted away from Rena to the houses support beams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stopped when her breasts were about to couch the roof, unable to see anything in front of her and even the camera had fallen out of view. Her breasts were huge, so big that if Rena could get them to roll she could have easily lain on top of them and had her butt touch the roof of her home. Still, with that expansion sequence done Rena drained herself, a little harder since found her breasts were to heavy to drag closer to to the kitchen sink and she had to carefully float a large portion of water until she was able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time Rena's clothing seemed to bend and stretch to make room for her growing form. It was peculiar, and Rena began to wonder if her powers somehow let her increase the size of her clothing. Still, if it was in her power to make them grow, she should be able to stop and just let them stretch and break. With that Rena got the urge to do one more breast expansion, quickly going into the room and grabbing a T-shirt she didn't want anymore, putting it one and starting the process over again. This time, however, she also gave her body the silent command to let the shirt rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only smile, she could now tell that her shirt was actually stretching naturally, the fabric becoming tighter across her form as her breasts took up more and more space. It got to the point where Rena began to wonder if the shirt would rip, the seems starting to dig into her skin when, finally, the shirt hit its breaking point, a loud rip down the front indicating the front had broken and, with a bit more expansion the whole top blew off, falling on the floor and leaving Rena giggling and jiggling half naked in front of the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her breast expansion shots done, Rena went onto just a simple belly only expansion. This time she started sitting down on the ground, hands resting on hers stomach as she let the hose pour into a nearby bucket. She simply placed her tail inside, and using it as a secondary hose she began to fill her stomach up, feeling it expand and push her legs and arms out while taking pictures every once in a while. Rena resting her head on the expanding gut, purring as she rubbed it with her own hands. It felt like she was some crazy water balloon, and it was almost to much enjoyment for Rena to take in. She was living a dream, and she would for many years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her stomach was nearly four times larger than the rest of her body, Rena let the water drain and went onto the final area of her body. Using her tail as a hose again, Rena put the bucket up on a stool so she could stand, her back to the camera as she let the water come up her tail and down into her butt. This was the expansion that really started, for lack of better term, to turn Rena on. She was an Aquaphile file after all, and after having every part of her body filled with water Rena was somewhat surprised it hadn't started earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rena kept herself under control, rubbing her but as it ballooned. Each cheek became larger, spreading out like a pair of oddly shaped balloons. Rena bounced a little on her heels, laughing as she felt the water in her butt bounce up and down. Still, through it all Rena managed to keep taking pictures, and after her butt was so big her feet were lifted off the ground she stopped, drug her big behind to the kitchen, and drained herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith pictures at hand Rena got to work, but quickly changed her idea to use other characters to use her online representation, the white furred tiger with black hair, as the model for all this. It made sense after all, they would were exactly the same body wise after all. Rena spent the rest of the day drawing, her hand flying across the tablet drawing tool she had gotten for her computer. She had never worked of fast, but then again she had never been more inspired. She finished all the sketching and black lining she needed that day, stopping when it got close to dinner time. She'd finish the coloring later, a process that would take much longer. Still, it was an amazing start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making a quick something Rena sat down, chewing her food at the table with a glass of water meant for drinking nearby when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: L\u2019acquaser comes up from the glass of water. Hyrdo Lady is needed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena turns on the television, and hears a news report about the bank robbery. She's mentioned, by her correct name thankfully, and Rena can't help giggle. She was a superhero and she could inflate herself with water. Her dreams had come true. Still, as Rena thinks about this she remembers L\u2019acquaser wanted her explore the strange bubble world she used to teleport to different places. Its time to go around the world in an hour.</span></div></div>",

Now, folks at home may find this hard to believe, but what we are about to show you is all real.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The video in question showed Rena taking down the robbers. It even showed her getting shot to no avail. Finally it ended with her taking the weapons of the robbers and leaving the scene. It even zoomed in on her exit in the small puddle of water<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Yes. What we have shown was all real, something by all accounts came like a scene from a comic book. Many eyewitnesses could only guess the good doer was young and eager to help. The only name she gave out was 'Hydro Lady', before disappearing.Now many police....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rena ignored the rest of the newscaster's voice, lost in her own little world. She was acknowledged of saving of those people at the bank! She had powers to stop the villainy of the world! She could inflate herself with water! This was a dream come true, she couldn't be any happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rena hugged herself and squeed in her own mind. If this was a dream, she wished she never awoke again; it wasn't a dream however, but reality that she was living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Just then a thought came to her mind, stopping Rena in her thoughts. She was so pre-occupied with her thoughts on of inflation, she forgot her other power: the ability to literally travel anywhere in the world! Well, she couldn't let that go unaddressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" I can't let that be, now could I?\" Rena addressed herself. Taking off from the chair she was on, Rena headed towards the bathroom. Turning on the faucet for her bath tub,Rena first put her hand into the tub. Her costume wrapping itself around the cat-girl. Stretching a little, Rena took one look at the tub and jumped in it. Her world swirling by as she traveled into the water world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Swimming in a large expanse of water, but strangely not absorbing any, Rena saw the world around her. Millions of bubbles floated by her, each one showing a scene from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One bubble showed a woman showering;another showed a cat-man eating fish near the pier of a beach;and another showed a dog-girl and her pups making cake, the perspective from a bowl of water. There were millions of more that Rena couldn't comprehend. However, she did noticed three things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One, the closest bubbles showed mainly her city or at least what Rena thought of her city. She recognized famous landmarks, restaurants,  and jaunts. The farther bubbles from her city's bubbles were of places she only seen in pictures, news, and other media. Like she saw ,from the perspective of rain, New York City on the eastern coast. Farther from those bubbles were those of different countries and places. Even farther still were of unknown places that she couldn't place as areas of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second thing she noticed was that the bubbles size correlated to the size of the water source. The perspective of lakes had <i>huge</i> bubbles, being eight to nine times bigger than Rena. While the perspective of water bowls and bottles were only the size of her fist. Not that this revelation really mattered, seeing as Rena could go through any liter of liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The third, and final, thing she noticed was that were crime was happening, the bubbles quaked. She probably didn't notice it when L'acquaser was with her, but without the her guide she received a full view. The bubble violently quaked, looking as though it might pop. And there were seven to eight bubbles currently quaking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At the moment she could go into one of the bubbles or she could ask L'acqacser for some answers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena stared up at the quaking bubbles and bit her lip, what could this mean? She didn't know the schematic of this place, nor the rules. She worried if she did anything it would do more harm than good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in remembrance, she had someone who could explain this to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I call him though?\" Rena exclaimed.\"Do I say his name? L'acquaser! L'acquaser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo movement was seen, so Rena took that as a sign that it wasn't an avenue to pursue. He didn't appear when one said his name, so what else could Rena do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can summon him with a dance? I don't know any, but I can try.\" Rena said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flailed her arms up and down, in an effort to mimic a dance. This went on for a good while before Rena stopped herself, she wasn't getting anywhere with that as well. What could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L'acquaser, where are you?\" Rena said. Her mind wandered towards the appearance of the water serpent, her mind doing its best to get his attention. Slowly did she feel something odd happen, it was like her mind was putting all of its attention onto a particular task. Rena could feel her mind doing its best to try and locate L'acquaser. Then she noticed a picture appear in her vision: it was L'acquaser! He appeared to be floating in the water plane, although, he did seem to be in the middle of a task at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, I must've been so caught up with my search, I went a little batty! No offense to bats, however\" Rena said. She watched the vision of L'acquaser do...<i>something</i> with the water. It looked important enough, though, why did she imagine this scenario?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you require assistance, Rena?\" L'acquaser spoke after ten or so minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its nothing, i'm sorry that- wait, why did you just speak?\" Rena replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have the ability to talk and I'm concerned about why you need me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,you're a vision, right. A figment of my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena, I assure you, I am not. You see, a bearer of the water power can formulate a link to me at any time. Now, do you require assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do. I'll get over to wherever you are so we can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll come to you. Just focus on me at the moment and then an area in front of you. Combine those two images together and imagine me wherever you focused on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on the little picture in the vastness of the ocean plane, a shift began to form in front of Rena. She could faintly see the outlines of L'acquaser, his body was darker than the surrounding water. Finally, the guide of Rena had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what do you need assistance on?\" L'acquaser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see those quaking bubbles, what do they mean?\" Rena said, she pointed up towards said bubbles. If L'acquaser was a Ani, Rena would swore she saw his jaws drop in horror. The best thing the water serpent could do was bend its \"neck\" in pure bewilderment. Rena waited as it bobbed gently do to the water plane's current interacting with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they bad?\" Rena said hesitatingly, that seemed to knock the water serpent out of its stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason that those bubbles are quaking, is because each one represents a major disaster. And not just any disaster, ones that may require the direct intervention of Hydro Lady, herself.\" L'acquaser answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe \"flew\" up in the air and slowly coiled around each bubble as if to examine them. Whatever he took out of that, Rena did not know; though, he seemed a little more at ease because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, here are the things that are happening at the moment.\" L'acquaser made smaller versions of the quaking bubbles above Rena. The cat-girl swam over to L'acquaser to get a better look.\" Bubble-one:a drought going on somewhere on the other side of the world. Bubble-two: Cruise liner is sinking, but thankfully  not horrible enough that we should be there right now. Bubble-Three: Winter has frozen over an large area of a city and it may need to be dealt with. Bubble- Four: another drought, although, we can purify the water instead of making it. Bubble-Five: inter-city gang fights that are endangering the locals living there. However, its like the cruise liner, we don't need to go at it right now. Bubble-six: a wild-fire is starting to spread and it may need our attention soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena slumped as she heard all of these news, she had her work cut out for here. This was the life she chose though, she couldn't just sit around all day and blow herself up into a balloon! Just when she was about to choose her option, she saw out of the corner of her eye a miniature bubble L'acquaser went over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, L'acquaser, what about this bubble?\" Rena held the surprisingly durable bubble up. L'acquaser looked at the thing for a few moments, than shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its probably wrong, ignore it,\" L'aquaser spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't felt a thing like that in a while, and the ones I do feel were always nothing to write home about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't so bad, why don't you tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL'acquaser looked, or more accurately turned it central point, towards Rena. So, it began to speak what the deal was with the bubble: \" It feels like, using the modern term, a supervillain.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, there was a small fireball hitting the ground just ahead of the thugs and it was starting to feel warmer. Everyone was looking to a person holding a fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is reasons why crime exists, but normal people could be heroes if get over the fear and find that inner courage.\u201d The person said in a even tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d The leader of the thugs asked feeling brave or stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo people like you, I'm your worst nightmare. For these people, I'm a light in the darknessess and a pillar of hope.\u201d The person said as the bystanders were feeling the said feeling and had hope for the new hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? A pillar of hope for these weakings? You are like nothing more than a firebug.\u201d He said as the person sighed before vanishing in a small pile of flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really, really hate people like you.\u201d The person said behind the leader while the other gang members turned to see him behind their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow he move that fast?\u201d One of the other thug lackies asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person just fought off the gang before melting the guns minus the bullets. The person stepped into the light. The person is wear a red, orange, and white suit with flames motif, a yellow mask on over his face, red like ember eyes, and black as smoke hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you great stranger?\u201d an old man asked the peron that saved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just a person passing by and wanted to help.\u201d He said gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that. What is your name?\u201d A teen boy asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me, Blazeman.\u201d Blazeman said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazeman looked over to the thugs and took everything before giving it back to the good people of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: Not my first choice of a name for a hero, but it was funny because I was thinking of hydro lady)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazeman smiled to the people before leaving the group as police was arriving looking at the cheering folks and the downed thugs. He left in a pillar of fire without leaving a scorch mark on the cement. He appeared in from a fire in his living room before putting it out with a bucket of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlame in.\u201d He said as his suit was sucked into his body leaving him in a red shirt, brown pants, burnt orange socks, and black shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, seems like there like another hero besides me making an appearance.\u201d He said sitting on a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thinking back on the news reel that was talking about the new hero, hydro lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazeman's real name is Ryan 'Rick' James, a normal person in the society and a jack-of-all-trades in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate dumbasses like that.\u201d He said thinking about the other gangs he put down before in that fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazeman was looking at the gangs fighting in an inter-city gang war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is just stupid and I have to get this handled before the good officers show up and make it worse.' He thought before looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello. I have an idea.' He thought before making balls of fire with little heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he was throwing the balls at the ground as they explode like flashbangs. Jumping off the low building, he brought down most of the gangs within seconds. He had one left gang left as the flashbang worn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d One of the minions asked pointing his gun at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a person passing through and stopping idiots like you killing innocent people.\u201d Blazeman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you work for us since you took down the other gangs with ease.\u201d The leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, working for you is against my morals.\u201d He said as he vanished in flames and appeared behind the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall off your men and you will saved from my hands. If you don't then your gang will be the first I kill.\u201d He said with a hot edge in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make his point, blazeman made a fireball the size of cannonball and the heat of one near exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to try me, boys?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay. Boys standdown.\u201d The leader said as he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lackies ever knew that the hero made couple of fire clones as the main hero knocked out the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks boys.\u201d Blazeman said as he suck the flames back into his body to refill his energy a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe melted the guns minus the bullets and went to find that last gang before calling it a night and go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback: end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRough night?\u201d a voice asked as a female humanoid cat mixed with a dragon appeared from a candle of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Ryan said sweeping a hand through his chocolate brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are still mid way with your powers, but your control is getting better.\u201d She said putting a clawed hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, my Lady Heat.\u201d He said and she nodded as they cuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill been 8 years since you came into my life as a mother figure and our fire lord as a father figure.\u201d Ryan said looking a photo of a kid looking version of him with the woman in her arms like she was his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven without your gift I still would have chosen to take care of you to make sure you were ready for your gift.\u201d She said and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mama Saphira.\u201d He said revealing her name and she nodded before he drifted off on the couch.</span></div></div>",

She turned her head to L'acquser and asked him simply: \"Who was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL'acquser seemed to be contemplating something, his \"tail\" swiveled to touch his \"chin\". He floated for a few moments then answered Rena's question. \"He is empowered by something that, you could say, belongs to my species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHydro Lady's thoughts briefly went through a scenario of her mind, where the hero grew just like her. Especially growing around the crotch area and breaking right through his-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll monitor that, but hopefully it shall not be a problem. She could be more trusted than the others.\" L'acquser broke through to Hydro Lady's lewd thoughts. She shook a little and went back to the subject at hand. That little scene was only a \"drop\" in the bucket of crime that was going on in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What even is this place?\" Hydro Lady announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A look into what happens when a economy crashes or what a producer that can't diversify becomes eventually.\" L'acquser responded. Hydro Lady looked at the water elemental in confusion, who only gave back another in response. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just weird a water elemental knew so much of the economy and infrastructure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't just float around doing nothing, I go out and scout some areas first, Not this place, but when you see one derelict city, you've seen all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can <i>I</i> do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can stomp out the worse aspects of the place. Currently a gang war between six rival factions have been tearing this city apart for the last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just intercepted a television stream\" L'acquser answered, Hydro Lady swam over to his side. They watched through a cup full of water as a reporter was at the scene of a recent gang fight. The dog-girl on stream seemed distressed as she reported the innocents injured during the fight. The scene cut to a helicopter overview of four fleeing rhino thugs as they rumbled out of the area.They were tearing through the backyards of some innocent people. Hydro-Lady felt something inside her start to figuratively burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, L'acquser. You see that puddle coming up ahead of those thugs?\" Hydro-Lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get there right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Keep it up, J\" One of the bigger rhino anthros screamed as they barreled through a fence. The subject of the warning sped a little faster to outrun the cops behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dong my best br- I mean 'T'\" 'J' said as he catched up with the third rhino from \"T\", who looked at  J with a little bit of annoyance. The four thugs had their heads covered and people would be surprised that even with their large bodies, it would be hard to recognize a disguised rhino anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stampede reached another backyard, which seemed to be recently cleaned. Water was everywhere and large puddles seemed to be covering the ground. Two of the rhinos managed to cross over to the other side, while the one who was beside \"J\" over took him again. Unlike the others though, he seemed to want to stomp through the puddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly a his leg was sucked into the ground, the rhino shrieked out. The leading two turned around, while \"J\" watched in scared confusion. Instantly the nimble form of Hydro-Lady popped out of the puddle to climb her way to the top of the rhino she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, isn't that the 'Water-Lass' from outta state?\" The thug beside \"K\" whispered. \"J\" meanwhile was doing his best to get Hydro-Lady off of his friend's head. Hydro-Lady, jumped off, right in time to see J deliver a teeth rattling punch to her impromptu jumping board. The figure instantly went down for the count. J looked down at his fist and muttered out a quick sorry to his friend. Which he followed by going into a rampage against the one who inadvertently made him hit his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, we gotta go, K\" The rhino besides K said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets give time for J to come over.You go over and get 'Z'.\" K whispered, right before using his hands to microphone what he wanted J to do. \"J, get over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ wasn't having any of that, as he charged at Hydro-Lady. She laughed and slipped like water through his hands. She twisted around J's grasp and moved towards his head like she did the other one. J seemed not to remember the first time he did it and banged his own fist against his noggin. However, this didn't seem to knock him unconscious like the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys usually this hard-headed or am I thinking of bulls?\" Hydro-Lady joked.This seemed to only incite J, who now looked like he wanted to rip Hydro-Lady apart. K seemed to realize that J seemed to be in one of his \"rages\" at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third rhino came over to the downed \"Z\" and began to pick him up. Hydro-Lady saw this and began to prod \"J\". She reached over his vision and began to speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm right here. Are you blind or am I  that good at fooling you?\"Hydro-Lady jostled him. \"J\" took that as response to charge forward, a rhino's natural imperative, and did so with Hydro-Lady covering his eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'J', you're going to hit\" K spoke too late. \"Z\" seemed to be helped out by the third rhino and was about to get back onto his feet. Right until the charging form of \"J\" knocked him and the other right back down. Like bowling pins, the two flew through the air. \"J\" tumbling right through a fence and heading downslope to who knows where. Hydro-Lady thankfully watched this scene, for she had jumped right off of the rhino before he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got, because I just showed you what I had!\" Hydro-Lady proclaimed, her back turned. Which was ample time for a large shape to \"bearhug\" her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my little brother, you bitch, If he is dead, I'm going to enjoy doing this.\" K whispered in Hydro-Lady's ear. She struggled for breath, her concentration keeping her from turning into water and keeping her subconscious from doing it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crushing me. How am I going to get out of this? Hes stronger than me. He gonna crush me like a tin can! Damn, is his breath heavy on my-wait, heavy. I think I have an idea.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first off....i'm a cat...not a dog.\" Hydro-Lady said through strained breathes.\"Second off,make sure you get a <i>deep</i> breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" K said dumbly as he loosen his \"hug\" a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHydro-Lady took this lapse in judgement to begin to call up all the water in the backyard. It flowed towards her like hungry snakes, flowing towards any open area on her. \"K\" only had a little moment of confusion as he saw the once petite Hydro-Lady turn into a giant blob of a cat. His bound around broke from this action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timber!\" She yelled, her normal voice strangely contrasting with her rotund body. She dropped straight ontop of \"K\", she felt her skin ripple as he banged against her large form. She laughed, it felt like he was tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Hydro-Lady has gotten her catch!\" She announced, the crew inside the helicopter could only look slackjawed at the mountain of flesh the was currently Hydro-Lady.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up still feeling groggy he heard the news report talking about the new greenhorn hero, hydro lady, taking out some thugs. He noticed his mother figure went to sleep in her room. Looking in the mirror, ryan looks like a human with patches of red fur and scales of rose red color. His eyes are amber orange, but his body is still developing the other traits. He has a job of writing series of books and one of the series is being hold at the local library where a certain catgirl works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Need to get back to working on those stories.' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drank some spicy tea to wake him up before watching more news reports and he was looking at the room his mother figure was sleeping peacefully. He lit the candle again with his lighter before taking a pose on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let my mother sleep and let me use the flames for the night without her worry.' He thought has he had changed into his hero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to use my own power this time.' was added as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the home through the fireplace again before jumping to the highest point in the city. He was focusing his power into an orb of fire before it was growing in size. He threw it into the sky as it was growing bigger. A few minutes later, it was the size of the sun and he went to the tv station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but I have a message to deliver to the gangs of the city.\u201d He said to the people in charge of the station. After 10 minutes passed, he was standing with a mic in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to impede on your programs, but I'm here to send a message to all of the remain gangs who soon will get a visit from me and the police. Outside in space is a ball of fire the size of the sun. By the time its disappears, all of you will be caught, stopped, and maybe for the stupid ones, slightly burned. The time has come for all of you to be in jail or prison.\u201d He said with a nod to the crew before leaving the building to his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a squad of fire clones with a plan in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach of you will take out a gang before moving on the next gang. If you run into the greenhorn, lead her to me and I think we can work together. Disarm the gangs, melt the gun, avoid the bullets. Most of all knock them out hard.\u201d He explained and they nodded before fire flashing away. He looked up and the fireball before watching it shrink a bit. He went after a select group of gangs that his clones aren't gunning after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the span of 2 hours, he and his squad of clones rounded up almost most of the gangs except for one and the ball of fire was almost gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to get to watergirl so we can think of a plan before the last of my energy is gone.\u201d He said before taking the clones back into his body and ball grew by a chunk. He went off to find where she was from what he read on the news report.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The hell was that?\" Hydro Lady proclaimed as she watched Blazeman recite his speech. Watching various videos from different aquatic viewpoints;each one showed off a clone of the fire-themed hero taking on the gangs of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I do that?\" Hydro-Lady exclaimed as she saw one scene of a bison beating down a clone, only for two more to come rushing in to take him down. \"It almost makes me want to give up my expanding powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her breasts, frowning, she allowed a few pints of water to expand them. They grew heavy on her chest and Hydro-Lady purred a little but.<i>\"Almost.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, lets focus on the task at hand.\" L'acquser popped into existence right beside Hydro-Lady, who yelped in shock.\" Hothead may have some of this place covered, but we still have our work cut out for us. Remember this place was considered so bad that it needed you to come down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Hydro-Lady shot off towards any water sources. First, arriving at a lake of some sort, she saw a few jaguars run down the bank. Smiling to herself, Hydro-Lady shot out of the lake at high speeds. She landed on the bank and posed, a few large drops of water covered her, expanding her curves by a noticeable margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt, evildoers!' She announced and was quickly shocked as the jaguars were gathered into a pile overseen by some of Blazeman's clones. She raised an eye at that, but quickly left her spot to see if their were others in need of her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Oooh, I think I made a wrong turn in Albuquerque.\" Hydro-Lady exclaimed as she sat on the rail of a bridge. A cheetah and a parrot opened their mouths in shock before they collapsed abruptly in Hydro-Lady's view. She turned around and saw a clone of Blazeman holding his arm outwards. Turning back around, Hydro-Lady saw an aura of sizzling heat around the two gang members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, point two for you.\" She said crossly at the clone, who only stared at her blankly. She laid back and let herself fall into the river with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Oh, thought you were Blazeman for a second.\" A Wolf said as Hydro-Lady appeared around a corner of an alleyway.\" I mean, I know its insane, but the boys and I have been on edge for the past hour o-\" He was quickly stopped by a fist into the jaw, followed by being blown into a wall by a blast of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, baddies, I got you now!\" Hydro-Lady proclaimed and bashed her foot into a door. She quickly yelped in pain, remembering that she only had super strength when expanded. Grumbling, she willed some water around her to travel up her body. She waited for a few moments, before she had gotten a good pair of thighs and calves, although, they did appear to be fat more than muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking the door again, she smiled in satisfaction, only to frown as she saw all of the other wolves unconscious.She looked up to see the flying form of a Blazeman clone disappear over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3-1,gah!\" Hydro-Lady exclaimed before running into a puddle of rainwater.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">==</div><br>\r\n\"Did he seriously take on the entire city and win? Hydro-Lady asked L'acquser as they traveled through the watery lands.\"If he was so powerful, where was he before now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably preparing for a day like this.\" L'acquser replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just wanted to show off,that's probably what.\" Hydro-Lady muttered, the two had searched far and wide, but it seemed that only one thing was clear: almost all of gangs were gone. Except one that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me about the Coffins again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Coffins; another of the 'pure' animal races, but this time only accepting arachnids into their ranks.\" L'acquser replied.\"Mostly they deal with 'burying the evidence' and contraband. But they do know how to keep under the radar, thats for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at a port and Hydro-Lady saw a few dozen police cruiser blocking every single road. She smiled as she realized that Blazeman hadn't appeared yet, but her gaze hardened as she saw a couple of the officers being tended to at the moment. Popping out of the water, she slowly slinked her way into an alley and watched as the officers began speaking to some of The Coffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You here for them too?\" A voice spoke into Hydro-Lady's ear, she turned around and disappeared into a puddle. Slowly did she see who the figure that spoke to her was: Blazeman. Who appeared at the moment confused on wear his companion disappeared to.</span></div></div>",

He walked to the building as he was heating up. He fired small fire blasts stopping the bullets. He spartan kick the door like a boss as he sent a wave of fire destroying the guns by melting them.

Behind the group of defenders were the rest of the gang, who stopped packing all of the contraband the Coffins had brought to the warehouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, show is over!\" Blazeman proclaimed. A crash made all occupants look around, before noticing the source of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up above came a shadowy mass,a rope of webbing crashed down onto the floor. This startled one of the gang members who dropped a pile of weapons onto the floor.What crawled down a string of web was probably the leader of the Coffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of course another spider-anthros,but by far the <i>largest</i>that Blazeman had ever seen before. He could've laid himself flat---he was six foot three--- and he still would be short by twr feet. How the leader of the Coffins wasn't caught already was anyone's guess.Strangely, the thing was slender and not bulky. Besides the height, the Coffin leader was colored a vivid, dark blue, unlike the black carapace of its gang. It gave the leader an almost mesmerizing look  as it crawled down its web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt blinked and waved one of its legs(or was it hands?) around the warehouse. From the mandible throat came a sultry, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So its a girl</i>.\" Blazeman thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start packing up!\" The leader screamed, the workers suddenly seemed to have regained their senses and quickly began doing just that. Apparently ore scared of their leader than the multiplying fire summoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of spider who once seemed wary of Blazeman, now came rushing at him. He was about to summon more of his clones, before he saw his group being blasted away by a gout of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look at the sink he blasted open at the beginning of the fight, their stood Hydro-Lady with her arm pointed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings everyone, its me: <span class=\"cteal\">HYDRO-L-argh</span>!\" Hydro-Lady didn't finish her question as a piece of machinery came flying at her. The duo turned their heads to the Coffin's leader as she bombarded them with machinery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazeman and Hydro-Lady dodged to the side as the machinery came down onto them. Moving and weaving around columns, right until the bumped right into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why aren't you melting those things she's throwing at us?\" Hydro-Lady said, jumping a little as another piece of artillery crashed somewhere in their general area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but their being thrown to fast! If I were to bring the heat up to the point I could instantly melt them, I would set this place on fire!\" Blazeman shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why not your clones?\" Hydro-Lady questioned, Blazeman pointed down onto the currently wet floor and then to the sprinkling sink. Hydro-Lady slapped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is<i>my</i>environment! Its my turn to shine!\" Hydro-Lady happily stated, before a large piece of concrete crashed besides her. Sitting back down, Hydro-Lady closed her eyes as she summoned the water towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you doing that balloon thing I saw on-\" Blazeman was cut off as he was bounced to the side by the growing mass of water Hydro-Lady was being filled with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that was a lot faster than I expected!\" She apologized. Now bigger than Blazeman, she sumo stomped her way over to the Coffin's leader. The girl spider dropped what she was holding, gaping at the large Hydro-Lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you have a large caboose? Well guess again!\" Hydro-Lady announced as she butt bumped the spider to the back of the place. She flew, crashing into multiple crates, which caused a shock wave knocking the last few of the Coffins over.. A group workers dropped some of their stuff and quickly made haste, with what they had left, into a side room. Blazeman, meanwhile, was gaping at Hydro-Lady corpulent form, doing his best to hide his...blazerod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dammit, its one thing to see it on TV, but seeing it here is another thing.\"</i> Blazeman thought, his face \"heating\" up in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"Do whatever you want at home, but we have a job to do!\"</span> His fiery spirit companion said in his mind. Blazeman steadied himself and regained his dignity, his head swiveled to the escaping Coffins. He blazed towards them, narrowly dodging Hydro-Lady's butt, until he reached his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he saw the Coffins pushing whatever they had into a hold in the ground and lucky for Blazeman the spiders still had a ton of stuff up top. The remaining Coffins looked at him, before taking whatever small and loose stuff was near them and jumped into the hole. Blazeman followed, making a small light for himself. He quickly blasted one of them spiders, who was about to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blazeman eyes widened as he saw wisps of smoke from the spider's body. He rushed to its side and wiped the sweat off his head, it was only the spider's clothing.Thanking luck that he only knocked the guy out, he walked forwards into the tunnel and found to his dismay that there were multiple, branching entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I got you and the guys upstairs.\" Blazeman told the unconscious spider.\"And I hope Hydro-Lady got her target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back up, Blazeman's eyes widened as he saw the still enlarged Hydor-Lady tearing apart webbing from her eyes. Once she accomplished that, she saw Blazeman with a Coffin slumped on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sprayed me and busted out of a window.\" Hydro-Lady pointed to the hole in the building's window. \"She couldn't have gotten far,the police have this place surrounded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling came from outside the warehouse,making Hydro-Lady temple her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I did stop their crimes, but I made sure that they make time so they could heal before trying something stupid again. I don't show off, but if you want we can help you become your own hero, but you need the control so you won't bee too big to move on your own.\u201d He explained and she nodded gotting his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut still I think we could work well together after you get your feet wet.\u201d He said and she chuckled at the pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you didn't mean that pun, but I get your meaning.\u201d Hydro-Lady said with a nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a card with his number on it. \u201cThat is for when you need to or want to reach for training or tips on controlling your element.\u201d He said and she nodded before looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we should get home before it gets too late.\u201d He said as she agreed before the mentors disappeared into their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vanished a pillar of fire as she dived into a puddle of water down below. Both of them made it to their homes and got ready for the night. When morning came, rena was busy getting ready for work and ryan was working on his next book for his series of books when something pop into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think maybe I can start a comic, but I need a better artist than what I have.\u201d He said thinking outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to include our new friend?\u201d His mother in all but blood asked him breaking him from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, but I need to ask her and find a good comic artist.\u201d He said before going back to his writing. She had some time before going to work herself in the city law office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 hours of writing, ryan broke away from his writing for a break and to make himself something to eat for lunch. His mind was thinking about the comic idea amongst other things, but he was more focused on his writing for now because of a deadline. After lunch, he was stretching so get his body loose and get the kinks out. He heard his phone ring and he went to pick it up after seeing his publisher calling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm writing the fastest I can without hurting myself, but I still remember the deadline.\u201d Ryan said with an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember who my mother is and how you are even lucky enough to see a part of the money I'm making?\u201d Ryan said in a near dangerous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi! Keep talking and I will find a new publisher.\u201d Ryan said darkly before hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Add that to my list. I'm tired of that greedy slimeball.' He thought before going to the computer and cool down before he was going to write more while he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan logged into an account on a website for artists and was looking around seeing different skilled artists. A random thought pop into his head of hydro lady inflating like a balloon made him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's go on a limb here.' He thought. Deciding to do a random search of water inflation art, his reaction was between amazed, flat out annoyed, or not even interested. Then he noticed a comic of a tiger lady getting inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is pretty good. I like the style and the concept is solid.' Ryan thought before favoriting the artist and was looking through the art gallery on the account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, I like what I see as the skill and style. If you want, I'm looking for an artist for a comic and I'm willing to talk about it. Message me back if you want details of the job.' He said the message and logged out of his account before looking up publishers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kaa-chan got me the best deal with that jackass, but I need someone who I can trust and not scared of my mother when she is doing her job.' Ryan thought before looking back at his writing desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'On the last chapters for all of them some days aren't worth getting out of bed.' he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan logged into another account for writers looking for publishers. He was stuck with the current one because it was the only one his mother could get in the beginning of his writing job. Now he has books out on the shelf, he can look for a better publisher. He was looking through review after review of different ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Going to have to call them tomorrow morning after the chapters are done.' Ryan thought before getting multiple numbers and putting the computer to rest mode for later use if he gets a message back from that artist he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent most of the time writing till dinner time in the span of another 5 hours. Two of the three books are done and he will finish the last one after dinner. He made himself some spicy tea and ordered some take out chinese food from couple of blocks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one left before I'm done with that and that slimeball.\u201d He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dnner, he threw himself back into work and was working hard to get the last book done. He heard the door opening knowing his mother was coming home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sochi, how was your day?\u201d She asked coming into the room seeing stacks of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know, kaa-chan. I got a call from the publisher and I'm thinking changing to a new one. I have numbers to call tomorrow. I have two books done and working on the last before going to sleep. Also I had a thought doing a comic story, but was looking for a better artist than what I have now. I message them so I'm waiting to hear back from them.\u201d Ryan explained and his mother was happy for him, but she knew he was going to change publishers and it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't burn yourself out too soon, sochi.\u201d She warned him ignoring the pun she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to make her something to eat for dinner and going to sleep for the night. He went back to work on the last chapter. At the stroke of 11pm, he was finally done with the last book and he went to bed after a shower to help him relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope to find someone to love so mom won't have to worry.' He thought before letting sleep take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, rena was getting home and spent time on the computer and relaxing from work at 5pm. Before going to sleep, she noticed she got a message from someone about her drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is this?' She thought before reading the message and wait to reply to it tomorrow after work.</span></div></div>",

Still in her pajamas, Rena stared at the screen,showing off the message she received yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Hey, I like what I see as the skill and style. If you want, I'm looking for an artist for a comic and I'm willing to talk about it. Message me back if you want details of the job.' </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled,before she typed in her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,I'll message you in five hours, I got a thing to do.\" Sending it in,Rena sat down on her chair. Rubbing her eyes,she quickly got herself up to handle the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" L'acquaser, what is still going on that I can help with?\" Rena questioned aloud in her empty room. \"Are any of the problems from yesterday still going on? You know,inside of the giant bubble things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena waited,before she remembered that she was in her certainly,not aquatic,bedroom. Standing up,Rena marched over to her bathroom and opened a vale in her sink. She tapped her foot,about to speak again,but was interrupted by a wave of water splashing onto her. The water began to move,and sway,trying to formulate a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Ugh, now I gotta clean this place up.\" Rena said to the forming water snake.Spinning around for show,Rena's stripped her pajamas off,summoning up the Hydro-Lady attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly waited as the floor water began to move towards,and while there weren't many puddles,the amount that was on the floor gave Rena a little boost in the curves. She smiled as she saw that,before quickly turning back to L'acquaser,who had now formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her mouth,Rena was about to ask L'acquaser the question she had on mind earlier,she stopped as the water being nodded back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that, I could clearly hear you speak.\" L'acquaser answered. \"And as to answer your question:yes. However, the disaster with the crashing cruise liner seemed to have resolved itself. Every life on that vessel made it out with minimal injury and barely any casualties.But everything else is still going on; the two droughts, the fire, and the frozen in winter city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL'acquaser only looked at Rena, or pointed forward,as if to say \"We still have a lot of work to do\", Rena stretched at the stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is that all?\" She sarcastically proclaimed.\" Well my watery companion, how about we...</span></div></div>",

He took a shower to get ready for the day and one of the things is to call a new publisher. After a few minutes, he was ready for the day, but he isn't worry about writing today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kaa-chan, why do you have a clone?\u201d He asked while drinking tea and eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be going to work as we have some hero stuff to do.\u201d She said and he sighed with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of the frying pan and into the fire eh?\u201d He joked before she went to the fire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quick look at his computer to see a reply from his message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure thing, I'll message you in five hours, I got a thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled before putting his computer to sleep and meeting his mother at the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look happy. Got a girlfriend so I can have children to spoil?\u201d She asked and he blushed at her teasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot a message from an artist for a comic I have been tossing the idea around. They need five hours because of a thing.\u201d He said and she nodded happy to see him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned into fire that went into his body as his hero suit appeared. Before leaving the house, there was the news about a wildfire and he felt he needed to take it. He left the house in a pillar of fire, but he was focused on the job. Blazeman appeared at the wildfire and he hold his hands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back. I got this.\u201d Blazeman said channeling his energy over the flames as everyone there was getting clear of the fire. Gritting his teeth, he focused his power into the flames as they were slowly gathring into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Grit your teeth!' Blazeman yelled in his mind as a flash of power made the flames move faster into his body. The strain is building, but he isn't stopping till the flames are out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, the flames were out and blazeman was on a knee breathing extremely hard from doing something he had little practice with. 'To think we used that as part of the training, but I need to get better with that skill.' Blazeman thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think you are right, but you stopped something fire related without using more fire.' His mentor said in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while, blazeman was good to stand on his own feet without falling and he went looking for the cause of the fire. It took some time, but he found the source and it pissed him off to no end. A burnt to ash cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a few minutes to get the police where he found the source. The firefighters were searching for any flames he missed. Blazeman thank them for trusting him and left them to their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to let the flames out or use them for something else.' He thought before feeling a chime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some news for you.\u201d His mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it kaa-chan?' He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a frozen city and you can use the flames from the fire to warm the city up and melt the ice.\u201d Was said in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect.' Was he said before he left in a pillar of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a while to find the frozen land, but it was cold enough for him to feel it even with his inner flames keeping him warm. Channeling his energy and power, he was slowly warming up parts of the city and making his way through it. Took him about four hours to warm the city and the people there. He just made it to the other end of the city before falling to both of his knees. His mother came out of in a small ember of fire before rushing him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appreared in their house and she rushed him to his bed before resting on the couch. She got on his computer to noticed a number on the desk. She spent most of the afternoon talking with the publisher that ryan was going to talk with about using them and she was happy to know that ryan was going to get a better deal than the former one they were working with. She set up an appointment with them in the future, but both of them were going to let ryan set the day for them to meet. Thanking for their time and the knowledge, she hung up and went to make something for lunch for both her and ryan. It was during the evening that ryan woke up from the two missions that was taxing on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed to up the training when I have the time.\u201d Ryan said to himself as he shifted to sit on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally huh sochi?\u201d He heard his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened? I only remember finally getting the city out of the ice and cold age.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou passed out and I brought you back here to rest. I have some dinner for you.\u201d She said and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood sounds great, but I was going to call a publisher that I found yesterday.\u201d Ryan said as she led him to the table and helped him to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you were out like a light, I called them and I was happy for you. You did the homework and all you had to do was call them.\u201d She said with a smile as she sit across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be getting a much better deal than that other one we were dealing with. They and I agreed to let you set the day of the meeting.\u201d She added and he smiled with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk good. I was thinking around the day that the new books will be released, but now I was thinking of showing them to the new one before showing them to the former one. Just in case something happens.\u201d He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished the meal, he noticed the time and left for his computer. Once he sit down, he had pulled his idea notebook out for comics. He signed in the site and messaged the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I'm late. Just finished eating dinner and I just woke up from a nap by working too hard.\u201d he sent to artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, he had sent them an invite to a chatroom. While waiting patiently for a reply, he was coming up with ideas for the comic and new book ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to go to the library after the books are published and ask for ideas from the kids there.' Ryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother went to make both him and her some tea, but for her to help her sleep. Thanking her for the tea, he got to work on some ideas for a comic before talking with the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's been too long since I have seen rena or even spend time with her. She helped me more than me helping her.' Ryan thought thinking of his high school friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'College took my time and even more with writing full time, but I never did forget one of the driving forces of my work.' He thought before pulling out his phone and send a text to rena:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry for a text after a long time, but I was thinking of you and thought we can spend a day. I want to know how you been since high school. I will treat you to lunch and we can talk then. If milady permits it, I will also buy you dinner to make up for being busy for so long.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the text was sent, he was focus on his ideas while waiting for the artist to reply back to him. But really he didn't mind waiting because he was in a good mood. Tomorrow will be a good day indeed.</span></div></div>",

Someone else beat her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...what?' Hydro-Lady exclaimed. \"Where's the fire? There was a raging fire, it was going to burn up the entire forest! Where did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at what she thought would be an raging inferno,but instead found nothing but the aftermath of it.Nearly three acres,or four, were burnt down to cinders. While much of the other parts of the forest were not in any better shape,they weren't as bad as the area that Hydro-Lady stood in.This disaster could've been much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hydro-lady knew that was the most important thing, that no more injuries would occur from this disaster. But she would've like to fix it so if it happened again she would know what to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHydro-Lady was quickly brought out of her brooding by a the sound of cracking branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you just missed it.\" A gruff voice belonging to someone called behind her, Hydro-Lady turned around. Behind her stood a very large bear,currently dressed in the clothing of a park ranger. He gave the heroine a small tip of his hat, as if he was apologizing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this?\" Hydro-Lady questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Blazeman, that hero a little out East.\" The Park Ranger replied. \"Came outta nowhere and started absorbing the fire,flying around like a buzzard. All the flames just kept flowing right into his hands before <b>'poof.'</b> And it was all gone, all that fire that was destroying the land.The guy even had the courtesy of showing off what caused this damn thing in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was it?\" Hydro-Lady looked at him with a raised eyebrow behind her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cigar\" The bear growled out with unbridled fury,so gruff that even Hydro-Lady flinched. \"You know, I'm going to have to start a slogan or something. It could be like 'Only you can make sure your park is safe from infernos.' Is that too long for a slogan? Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear scratched his head in thought, while Hydro-Lady took the initiative to search if she was needed. Around her, Hydro-Lady saw various workers, firefighters, and rangers clean up the mess left behind by the destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help with something?\" Hydro-Lady said to the various helpers in the area. The word \"No\" was the only response to her question and after awhile, Hydro-Lady figured out she wasn't needed at all in this place. Stepping away, Hydro-Lady made her way to the nearest ice-filled bucket. Placing her hand into it, Hydro-Lady disappeared in a stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n\"Well at least there is that frozen place I can help out with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that is already taken care of.\" L'acquser interrupted. \"Fixed by a certain matchbox hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Hydro-Lady yelled in exasperation. \"What else did he fix right now? Do I just call it a day? I feel like he is doing everything for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have those droughts I told you about, you can see what you can do for them.\" L'acquser assured Hydro-Lady<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers, the water heroine spun around in her mystic getaway. Happily dancing, before she stopped herself. Rubbing the back of her head as she remembered that lives were at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, this looks like a job for <span class=\"clteal\">HYDRO-LADY</span>\" Hydro-Lady spoke aloud, before shooting off towards her next destination.

Ryan is a dragon anthro dragon/fox mix, but somehow still was human. He knew nothing of his birth parents, tried to make friends with the other kids, and help out like a good boy. He was treated like an outcast, but it didn't stop him from trying to help and make friends. During one night, he was sleeping and heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle one, are you ok?\u201d Heard in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sad that no one would let me help or the other kids be my friends.' He said in his mind as his body slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want most?\u201d The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A mother.' He said before he didn't hear the voice again that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning was going to be a big day. Ryan kept trying to make friends and help the staff, but he was shy away like he was needed or wanted. With a sad face and a frown, he went to sit under a tree and rest his head in his knees. A bit later there was something coming down the road to the orphanage. A lady wearing a business suit that was altered for her cat and dragon body got out of her car means she works for the city. Her eyes appeared to be slit and golden yellow eyes with orange pupils, her body has red dragon scales and orange cat fur, and felt that she would find the one here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That boy will have his wish granted today.' The lady thought before walking inside after locking her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the staff's thoughts, she went to look him on her own. It took a couple of minutes,  but she found the boy sitting under a tree alone. She walked by him and sit next to him under the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish to be adopted?\u201d The lady asked him as he turned his head to see an older lady talking to him. The voice was the same as the one from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease adopt me. I'm tired of being ignored and treated as an outcast.\u201d Little ryan said crying into and she hugged him and rubbing his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, little one. I will take your pain and grant your wish.\u201d She said to him before he stopped crying and went to sleep in her arms. She went to the desk and asked for the adoption papers. She had a dragon tail and a cat tail holding him in a snake bind while she was signing the papers to adopt the boy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime skip: 9 years<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 9 years since that day, ryan grew happy with his new mother and he still wanted to help people. This time it worked for him, he was given odd jobs and done them well. On a side note, his mother told him that he had a will of burning fire and she can give it a form. He wanted to use his own power, but thanked her for talking to him about it. She smiled before giving him the power over flames. It took him months to control it before getting close to a year that gave him near master control of his flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you get older and stronger, so will your power. You have to train to keep your control up most of the time.\u201d His mother said as he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something you want to do after high school?\u201d She asked him. He was thinking about it  for a minute before it came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be a writer to make my stories help parents and give other kids something I never had before you appeared in my life.\u201d Teen ryan said and his mother hugged him. His head resting on her large chest. (AN: In a motherly way.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so proud of you wanting to help is still going strong. Well if you want to be a writer, then you need to have a story to be published.\u201d She said before letting him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think a good first story would be my time as spitfire.\u201d He said and she smiled liking the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood write the first one out and I will find a publisher for it. I want you to have a good education and go to college.\u201d She told him and he nodded before going to write his first story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his high school years he kept up his grades, made some friends, outwitted his 'enemies', and kept popping out a story of days as a young hero from his memories. The one thing that stood out in his mind was meeting a fellow hero comic, Rena Westfall. They bonded and debated on comics, but she grew to be his best friend. She walked with him to his house so they could do homework together, and read their comics in his room. She met his mother and rena was loved by her. She had read his first completed series and liked the story, but wanted him to keep writing. Little did she know, that ryan had a crush on her, but it inside him because he didn't want to ruin his frienship with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are going to college?\u201d Rena asked ryan as they were at his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo an art college that has writing courses. If there was one closer, then I can stay.\u201d Ryan said, but rena shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't do that to yourself, both your mother and I want you to have this chance to follow your dreams.\u201d Rena said while saphira was listening to them by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't forget us.\u201d She said as a sad joke and ryan hugged her before kissing her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks rena. Trust me when I say that I will always be thinking of you and my mother while I'm away.\u201d Ryan said and she nodded giving him a smile. Ryan could have told rena the truth of his feelings, but he couldn't do it then. The next day, his mother and rena watched him drive away to his college and work hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rena-chan, your words have caused a fire to burn within me. So I will make a series dedicated to you and mom. Heh, talking about heroes when you are one to me.' Ryan thought with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his college years, he spent most of his time pulling all nighters, drinking tea, and little writing because of the assignments. He would take small breaks to call his mother and rena to give them updates, but mostly to tell them that he was thinking of them and appreciate them having his back. Rena was the one again to restoke his flames and to keep pushing forward. His mother knows that ryan had a crush on the cat girl, but was sad that he didn't tell her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rena. When this is over, I want to talk to you about something serious as is my feelings for you.' Ryan thought as he was working on his papers and things for his classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost right out of college, ryan moved back in with his mother and she was happy to have him back. Ryan did graduate while nearly became the validvictorian. They went to look for a publisher (AN: Ryan's now former publisher in a previous chapter) and he got to research for the first books of a couple of series. Between his writing and researching, ryan felt there was a sense of doing something like this before during his college days. He kept up is training and use the excuse taking out thugs as a stress reliever. Spitfire had grown into Blazeman and it was time for a comeback while giving people hope. During the years from then to now, ryan was busy writing book after book that he couldn't find time for his mother or even calling rena to let her know that he was back for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days he would look at the dedication he wrote for his mother and a one for rena. Though he wished rena knew she was the one he was referring to in his dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my mother, for making me feel special and a high school best friend as both became the wind to feed my fire. They gave me the drive to push further and always had my back. To them, I dedicate this book series to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now that I'm back, I can tell rena my feelings and hope for the best.' Ryan thought closing the first book he written. When ryan was training both at home and at college, his body grew well-toned and not bulky with muscle and gained some serious speed from those muscles when he runs.</span></div></div>",

While looking through it, he was lost in his memories of that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in high school, ryan was a good kid and worked on his studies.

Their tails shook like shaking hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth realized that they had a same classes together and shared a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan and rena were friends and they tried their best, but also tried to be each other's lab partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan seeing the aged photos smiled softly. One of his journalist friends took a photo of him and rena for the yearbook and had joked that they were cute together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Back then, it wasn't a possibility. Now it might happen if she return my feelings.' Ryan thought with hope in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost count on how many times rena had came over to help with the homework and the projects. There was a coupke of times that his mother had called rena's parents to let her know that rena would be staying the night. In the end there was a promise between the parents that they should meet and let both of them have some fun. The parents become good friends and ryan was welcomed to stay the night if there was a project they had to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There wasn't a project when I took up the offer, but because to return the favor.' Ryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlasblack:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night of graduation and rena was again at ryan's house in his room. They were in their robes and the high school life has endded for them, but not forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are going to college?\u201d Rena asked as the two talk. Ryan's mother is listening by the door with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo an art college with writing classes that seemed like the best for me.\u201d Ryan said with a sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there was one closer, I could be closer to both you and mom.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her head at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't do that to yourself. Both her and I want you to go and take the chance to follow your dreams.\u201d She said and saphira was smiling at rena being strong for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I had known sochi-kun had feelings for her, but what would be the chance that she had feelings for him. Maybe time could help them guide them. I hope they find each other when he comes back from college.' Saphira thought with a small smile and an amused look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't forgeet about us.\u201d Rena said as a sad joke, but ryan hugged her close to him petting her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks rena. Trust me, I will be thinking about you and mom while I'm away.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded her head, but she was given a large wrapped box. She looked at him confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour graduation present from me and mom, but don't open it till I come back from college. I want to see the look on your face.\u201d He said and she nodded her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning both his mom, rena, and her parents were there seeing him off. He gave hugs to his and rena's mothers, shook her father's hand, and for rena he kissed her head with a heartfelt hug. He opened the door before looking at her and gave her another hug, but also gave her a peck on cheek. The small group was surprised at the action, but ryan drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rena-chan, I hope when you find out about your present that you will have a smile that will last through all of time. Your words last night caused a fire to burn strong within me. I hope a future series that I write will be up there among your favorite. Another goal is that I will have a series dedicated to you and mom.' Ryan thought as he was driving to the next step towards his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a chuckle. 'Talking about heroes, she is one in my books and she doesn't even know it.' He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope to get to my real goal of making that series with a real dedication from my heart. I don't know how long the comic will be in its own series, but maybe hydro-lady could help answer that. The books are about done as a series and I should write one final book each. Then plan out  the new one.' Ryan thought closing the yearbook<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'College was hell and I almost didn't make it, but once again rena came to breathe life into my dying flames.' He thought with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n' I need to put an honest review for that old publisher. He kept trying to steal from me and that last call from him was the final straw that broke the raging camel's back.' Ryan thought getting up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege flashback:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple of days was easy because students were coming to get situated. Other than his writing classes is that he was taking one or two art classes for his ability in drawing or sketching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With the following years before graduation, I was doing all nighters, drinking spicy teas to help me stay awake, and almost stopping ALL of my writing because of the assignments, tests, and projects. The stress was building so much I had to release it either fight the gangs aournd there or dunking myself into a pool and turn it into a hotspring.' Ryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure the work was hard, but it was worth it. During a night, he called rena while he was a working on an art ptoject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan? Why are you calling this late?\u201d A tired rena asked with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need help. It's like high school, but worse.\u201d Ryan said sounding almost defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong, ryan?\u201d She said a bit more awake now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep driving through and getting the work done, but the stress almost getting to the point where I might actually errupt like a live volcano.\u201d Ryan said. He already talked with his mother about almost using his powers to make a dessert into a sea of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you are pulling all-nighters since I'm not there helping you like in high school, but calm down. Take a few minutes and come back to it later.\u201d Rena said before letting out another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Ryan said as he gave her a quick good bye before hanging up. He finished taking his break before hammering everything into his work and got it done. Seeing the time, he took a cold shower before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rena-chan, I wish I can there for you like you are there for me.' Ryan thought. During the rest of his college years, he put his will into overdrive and nearly became the valedictorian. The graduation was a bit over the top. Rena couldn't make it due to finding a job and he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope she is doing well.' Ryan thought during his college graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother made it and was happy for him as usual. Now he could start writing books like he wanted. It took ryan a couple of hours to pack everything from his dorm after graduation, but it would be his last night. His mother left for home after he was done packing, but would come back to help him putting things in the back of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege flashback end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When I came back, mom and I had to meet with that piece of crap publisher just to work on my starting books. Maybe with the new one I can work on my real book.' Ryan thought as he looked at the number of the new publisher that his mom talked to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That will have to wait till I meet with the artist for the comic and spend a day with rena. Maybe I can throw that into the deal, but not till I meet with my chosen artist.' Was added as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his face has a blush while his thoughts were of the heroine of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder on who she is.' Ryan thought before laying on the bed before taking a nap before it shifts into a dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

If she was just normal Rena at the moment, her fur would've dried her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her form and gasped out a wheeze in shock at how emaciated she looked. In fact, she looked near skeletal in appearance!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L'acquser!\" Hydro-Lady shirked.She rushed forth to a tiny puddle and began to scream into it.

The pile rumbled for a moment, before it shot forth and blasted Hydro-Lady in the chest. The cat girl held up her hands for a moment burbled out curses as she felt her body begin to expand. Her breasts and hips swelled followed by abdomen. She slowly regained her normal proportions until even that began to reach past the norm. Her curves expanded into her costume, stretching it,,but never ripping it entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Hydro-Lady had stopped expanding, leaving her with curves that would make a car weary.Hydro-Lady sputtered out something some water and her pupils looked down onto L'acquser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I wanted some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there was 'some' water! No lets get back to work!\" The water snake disappeared and the puddle flew straight into Hydro-Lady.

She looked around at the desolate space she arrived at and huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. That isn't a good sign.\" She quickly absorbed the puddle she arrived from to gain some curves,as well as a nice water source. She placed a flat palm over her eyes to block out the sunlight.

Thinking that was where she needed to go, Hydro-Lady began her journey forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in this place made Hydro-lady's eyes widened.With various cracked dirt and hot wind blowing through her hair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel puffed out some of his breath, dragging the suitcase-like box into his modest apartment. Smiling, he thought of all his travel to get it, worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't just drive over and get the box back to his abode. His car was in the shop at the moment, making the guy have to travel three miles to the post-office by using the bus. Bring it back to the bus station, and then have to bring for an additional mile. The reason being the bus station wasn't close enough to  his apartment complex. Daniel then had to travel up a flight of stairs to the fifth floor, because the elevator for his complex was out. But in the end, Daniel made it with his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into his kitchen, Daniel took out a long knife. Walking back over to the box, he carefully began to slice off the tape. Slowly did he make sure to cut it, like a surgeon cutting open a patient. He didn't want to destroy or cut the product. Finally, when he had enough of an opening to tear apart his section. Looking down, Daniel could see the plastic-wrapped form of a orange-cat girl, with black stripes like a tiger. There were black stripes over her eyes,making her look almost raccoon-like<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the more <i>feline</i> side of the spectrum, but still had enough human in her;she was never the less pretty to his eyes.And most likely the best Daniel could get. Daniel was average in build and intelligence, meaning he never could get a girlfriend. Or at the very least, one around his area. So instead he opted for OmiGene 'Fetish Doll';Model: Feline; Fetish: Inflation. It cost him a pretty penny, but he had the cash to spare. He also noted the positive; unlike a real girl, she could live out his fantasies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her flattened form, Daniel wondered what was the magic word to bring her to being. Taking her out of the box, Daniel inspected the flat figure, looking over her like a detective. She was three feet in diameter, making her easily transportable. Still, she would be better in the third-dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do it though?\" Daniel said. He did another take into the box, that had produced results. A slip of paper was at the bottom, probably covered by her.Taking it out, Daniel read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hello, Dear Costumer.<br>\r\nAs a fine consumer of our products, we are proud of your purchase.</b> Blah, blah, blah. How about some instructions for his dream-girl, dammit! Looking for that necessary part, Daniel noticed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>To bring your OmniGene 'Fetish Doll' to life, simply take out the gel included in his/her wrapped form. It will be marked as 'OmniGene Vita Gel', and will be a cylinder shaped container. Next, pour it down the doll's throat and wait five to seven minutes. Give your doll time to adjust, and presto, you'll have your product come to appease you! </b> Daniel ignored the rest of the paper, and began to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flapped her open,and saw the rest of her.Noting that she would be around five-foot and six inches. And that she had plugs for nipples and for her...lower lips. Black stripes were around those areas, almost as if they were supposed to be highlighted. He also noticed that she had intense,green eye. Another addition was her red, flowing hair. Her mouth was a faint muzzle, but not too exotic in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel blushed at her nakedness, and then noticed the Vita Gel rolling on the ground. He almost lost the damn thing by flapping her open! Grabbing it, Daniel noticed the green glow to it; interesting, but not as interesting as the results it could give!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it, Daniel poured it down the throat of his doll. Noticing the lifeless eyes of it, creepy, but that not going to last! Finishing with the last drops, Daniel put the now empty cylinder down on his counter-top. Not knowing that in the instructions that it specified not to use the entire thing, but Daniel wasn't one for reading things the entire way through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in his loft, waiting for his doll to come alive. After a few minutes, he saw the results of his action. Slowly did he see his doll move her hand a little, twitching on the floor. Daniel shivered, but she wouldn't keep doing that, would she? Next he saw her flat form twist around like a fish out of water. The phase didn't last for long as he saw the deflated cat-girl fill up with whatever gel was now in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a balloon attached to a hose, did she start to fill out. Puff,puff, puff, did she grow. Right until she was to a filled out size, or a third dimensional one. Daniel noted that she was flatter than a board;where was her curves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl stretched a little, licking her faint muzzle. Then she looked at Daniel, and smiled. \"Hello there master, I am your OmniGene 'Fetish Doll\"!<br>\r\nSurreal Number: 626. Model: Inflation. And under generic name: Rena. How may I assist you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a question relating to your curves okay? I don''t mean to intrude.\" Daniel asks. Rena looked momentarily startled, and proceeded to turn her head downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Rena then looked back up at Daniel. A toothy grin greeted the man. \"Ahh, yes. You see, the corporation didn't receive any specifications in my design, besides the ones you picked out. They instead picked the smallest form they had, just to give my larger sizes a <i>huge</i> difference.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your curves will grow when I blimp you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct;and because of my smaller form, I can grow to larger heights than that of my 'sister' models.\" Rena stated with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel licked his lips, and sweated a little, this was great! Rena still beamed at him, and followed with a question. \"So, master, what would you like to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It scanned the area, using its alien eyes to find a target and it did find one. The serpentine creature licked its \"lips\" and slithered slowly after its target. It reached it soon enough and just when it was about to chomp on the unfortunate being's head, a bolt of plasma ripped right through it. Its target wasn't prey, the beast was the target's prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got another \"creeper\", Boss. How is everyone else doing?\" Rena announced, she looked at the size of the serpent she got.\"Creepers\" referred to the snake-like monstrosities that invaded the station. Right now, Rena had acquired a fair sized specimen, although, she had to compare that to her other trophies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena craned her neck behind her, almost a mountain of alien corpses were behind her. Even with the mountain,she still had her work cut out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nRena thought she would have an easy job, she just finished her basics and just had to mentor under another station. She picked one of the lushest, and most hospitable, colony and station around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurvok possessed a measly population of 20,000, on and above the surface of the planet. Its training station was spacious enough to contain the 600 soldiers working on the place. Rena thought she was just going to train, drinks some nice beverages, and hang out with some guys. However, it seemed that fate had taken her relaxation as a sign of hubris, it decided that it wanted to mess the whole thing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome,<i>life-forms</i> had crashed both on the station and near the colony on Turvok. And unlike the other aliens that the Collective had encountered, these were intelligent.This would be a monumental moment in all of history, these were the first alien-life forms that showed true sapience. However, when they started killing civilians on the station and colony, the novelty wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on fortune's luck that most of the soldiers were down on the colony itself. Unfortunate was the fact that they weren't up at the station, which was doing its best to send an S.O.S back home. And so here Rena was, doing her best to keep these aliens from destroying the last hope for salvation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">====</div><br>\r\n\"Everyone else has gotten their quarry, Rena. Its okay to come back to the barricade now.\" \"Boss\", because he was the undisputed leader of the soldiers after their real commander died, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming chief, hopefully I can cap off a few more of the bastards\" Rena  went behind the pile of corpses and put down a device, flicking on, Rena moved back as a flash of light engulfed the corpses. Almost instantly after she had turned it on, the corpses disappeared. Apparently satisfied with her action, Rena walked off, her plasma gun ready for action. While she made her way down the corridor, Rena heard a scuffle going on. She readied herself and ran to the battle and she was greeted by two soldiers firing off at a horde of creepers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on men, i'm coming!\" Rena jumped into the action, she fired off round after round to thin out the horde. She also made sure she wasn't in the line of fire for the others, who seemed to be thankful for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo caught up in her action, she didn't even hear the beast that made its way behind her. One of the soldiers looked at Rena's position and shouted a warning. \"BEHIND YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard his cry and instantly turned around, a alien form called a \"Grabber\" behind her. A weird form that was comparable to a jellyfish and octopus floated gently; whether it was the cry of the solider, or Rena's aggressive stance, didn't matter much in the short-term. With a horrific roar, it came at Rena; at the moment,the cat-girl had tried to transform her armor into a shield. With this action, it changed Rena's life forever. The tentacle pierced her armor and the strange energies of her armor reacted to that. Rena fired a few rounds into the beast, unaware that its blood was causing even more strangeness to happen inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rounds of shooting it, Rena figured it was dead. Which was easily discernible with the car tire size hole in its form. She could hear the sound of the battle finish without her and with that the call of one of her companions-at-arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay solider? Do you need medical assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena waved him off. \" I'm fine, the gel will fix things up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was, again, unaware that she made her situation worse. The blood of the Grabber was slowly changed her DNA without Rena knowing the true extent of its machinations. What would she do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Las Vegas, Nevada. Where fortunes are won and lost, but mostly lost. Most stories that begin here tell how some lucky bastard hit it big, but then lost it all in the same night. Most of them. But not this time. This story is about an average catgirl, who by a stroke of luck, or fate, depending which one you believe in, her life was changed forever. For better or worse? That's for you to decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a typical night on the strip. Bright lights flashing everywhere, illuminating the casinos and hotels in an attempt to lure even more suckers in, to blow their hard earned money in the slim hopes of getting lucky and winning the jackpot at the slots, blackjack, craps, roulette, or whatever their game of choice may be. Outside one of these casinos, The Mirage, to be exact, there was a bright neon sign, advertising the casino's entertainment for the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nONE NIGHT ONLY! THE AMAZING ALEXANDER DUFONT, ILLUSIONIST EXTRAORDINAIRE! A SHOW LIKE NO OTHER! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the backstage area of the Mirage, a skinny catgirl with tiger-striped fur held a clip board in her hand, taking inventory of the props for that night's magic act. \"Piranha tank, check. Guillotine, check. Disappearing cabinet, check.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPompous A-hole, Rena though to herself, double check. She turned around to see Alexander Dufont, her boss, storming up to her. He was a bald man with a curly handlebar mustache, and a distinct French accent, dressed in a black suit and tie. He was also an egotistical jerk, thinking himself the greatest magician since Houdini. Rena, along with a good number of others, saw him as a Criss Angel wannabe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do with my hat?\" Asked Dufont, angrily. \"I haven't seen it, sir.\" \"Don't give me that! You were the last one to touch it when you picked up my suit from the dry cleaners, so where is it?\" Rena was used to this sort of treatment from her boss. She had been working as his stagehand since she was sixteen, and he would always blame her whenever something was misplaced or went wrong. Not to mention, Dufont was too cheap to hire more assistants, so Rena had to pretty much do everything by herself. If Rena didn't depend on this job as her only means of income, she'd have told Dufont to shove it a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time I saw your hat, it was in your dressing room, with your suit. So if it's not there, someone must have moved it.\" Dufont grunted \"Stolen, more likely. That hat is my trademark! When I find out who took it, their ass is mine!\" As Dufont stormed away, Rena scoffed to herself. That egomaniac was about as intimidating as a basket of kittens. Rena's stomach let out a loud rumble. She looked at her watch to see that it was 7 PM. She had been so busy preparing everything for Dufont's show tonight, she had skipped lunch, and it was past dinner time. \"Might as well take my break now.\" Dufont allowed Rena to take one half-hour break everyday to do as she pleased, about the only decent thing he had done for her. Placing her clipboard aside, and grabbing her purse, Rena made her way away from the stage, and towards the buffet area. But in order to get there, Rena would first have to go through the slot machine area of the Mirage. Rows upon rows of flashing lights and spinning symbols, each occupied by tourists with cups full of quarters, all trying desperately win the grand jackpot. Nobody had hit the big one on the slots at the Mirage in quite some time, and every night it kept growing and growing, bringing in even more gamblers in the hopes of being set for life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena made her way through the section of the casino, one thing in particular caught her eye. It was a grand slot machine designed to look like a throne, surrounded by neon signs, with lights shaped like various jewels lining it's frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name of the machine was The King's Ransom. It was currently occupied by a man who was swiftly inserting quarters into the machine, and yanking down the lever in such a fury, Rena was expecting the man to break it clean off. At his feet was a large cup of quarters nearly as big as a bucket, and was rapidly becoming more and more empty with each attempt the man made to win. With her superb hearing, Rena heard the man muttering under his breath \"Come on, come on, baby, three crowns, daddy needs a payday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten straight minutes of this, the man plucked his final quarter from the bottom of the cup, inserted it into the slot, pulled the lever, and crossed his fingers. When the symbols stopped spinning, he got three lemons. Defeated and furious, the man swore loudly, banged his fist on the side of the machine, and stormed off, ranting and raving that the game was rigged. Rena looked up at the electronic sign at the top of the machine, and then understood why the man was so mad that he had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKPOT: $10,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Rena caught a glimpse of silver out of the bottom of her eye. She looked down and saw a single quarter glistening in the light. She picked it up, held it in her palm, and simply stared at it. Rena wasn't the gambling type, but even so, it was extremely tempting. Should she go for it? Could she possibly win the grand prize, and instantly become a multimillionaire? She imagined what she could do with all that money. She could quit her job and never have to put up with Dufont and his insufferable ego ever again. She could actually get a decent home, instead of her cramped little apartment that was more like a broom closet. But most of all, she'd be financially secure for the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, what the hell, she thought. It couldn't hurt to try. She approached the machine. According to the rules posted next to it, in order to win the jackpot, the symbols had to land on three crowns in a row. Rena inserted her one quarter, and pulled the lever. The symbols instantly began to spin, going so fast it was impossible to tell them apart. Rena stood there and watched, fully expecting the symbols to stop on a losing one. She held her breath as the first symbol began to slow, eventually coming to a stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne crown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the second symbol began to slow. In the back of her mind, Rena knew that it would no doubt land on a losing symbol, and she would lose her big chance. The second symbol stopped. Another crown. For a brief moment, Rena felt excited. Could it be true? Could she really have some luck for once in her life? The final symbol started to slow. Rena suddenly began to lose hope, as she thought about how she had never been that lucky, and would lose by a hair's width. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rena nearly jumped out of her skin, as alarms and bells suddenly went off, and the machine's jewel shaped lights began rapidly blinking on and off. The sign above the machine flashed a single word in bright red letters: WINNER. Rena looked down at the symbols display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree crowns in a row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did it! She'd won! Overcome by a wave of triumphant euphoria, Rena began jumping for joy, raising her fists in the air and shouting \"YES!\" But her celebration was cut short, as she was approached by a man in a black suit and tie, with dark sunglasses. \"Excuse me, miss, I'm the head of security at the Mirage. May I have your name please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena Westfall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Miss Westfall. If you'll come with me, please.\" Rena followed the man to the owner of the casino's office, who shook her hand vigorously. \"You are one lucky lady, Miss Westfall. If you'll just give us your bank account information, your prize money will automatically be transferred to it.\" Rena did so, and left the office as a millionaire. She couldn't believe it, in one night she had acquired more money than most people make in their whole life! More money than she knew what to do with! Actually, that last part wasn't true, because at this point, Rena was reminded of her earlier hunger as her stomach growled loudly. The first thing she would do with her newfound wealth, was hit the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena is so hungry, she gorges herself at the buffet. Having never eaten this much delicious food before, she decides that from now on, she'll eat whatever she wants, and as much as she wants. Afterwards, she tells Dufont to blow it out his ass, and goes on a shopping spree with her newfound wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Same as above, except instead of going shopping, Rena is confronted by the man who was trying to win at The King's Ransom before she did. He might try to rob her, or assault her, wherever the story goes from there is up to the author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Reader's Choice.</span></div></div>",

Hey, she was rich now, she could afford it. Once she got to the buffet, Rena found some fresh fish and immediately started going to work on it, leaving the bones in a neat little pile. \"So good.\" She said with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good, after all, as a stage hand she was once off limits to this kind of high quality food. She even dipped some fish into mustard and before she knew it, the fish was gone. Rena let out a slight belch and then covered her mouth. \"Maybe I better stop it. If I eat all this, I'm going to get... hey, it's my body.\" As Rena was eating, she was about to be interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENA!\" Rena stopped eating as a steak bone was sticking out of her mouth and let out a groan. She saw that hack Dufont coming forward and he was steaming mad. \"You lazy cat! Stuffing your face at a time like this, and so close to showtime! You better drop what you're doing right now or else!\" Rena spat out the T-bone and cracked a smirk as she turned around. \"Or else what Alexander the Not so Great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDufont gives a glare Rena's way as the patrons look on in awe. \"What was that?\" Rena walkes in front of Dufont and hisses as she shows her claws. \"You heard me. I'm sick of your crap Dufont. I'm done being a slave. You're a no-talent hack whose threats are as empty as Homer Simpson's head. But I've hit the jackpot now. I don't need you any more. In fact, you were the one who needed me. Go soak your head up that top hat loser!\" To get her point across, Rena picks up a pie from the buffet table and splats it right in Dufont's face as the magician yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughs as Dufont runs off and Rena gives a satisfied smile. Now she'll never have to deal with that creep anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smiling with satisfaction to herself at having told off Dufont, Rena resumed eating. Never before had she eaten so much delicious food in one meal! By the time she was finished, she had eaten at least three pounds worth of fish, prime rib, steak, ice tea, shrimp, and several other dishes. Rena leaned back in her chair, picking her teeth with one of her claws as she let out a small burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently patted her now full, slightly distended stomach and smiled. Today had been quite interesting to say the least, not many people could say they became a millionaire overnight. Speaking of which, Rena began to think of what she would do next with her money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless possibilities came rushing through her head all at once. She could get herself a nice new house, a car, maybe even her own private island. She giggled at the thought. Then her mind turned to the extravagant meal she just ate. She had always been on the thin side, and usually ate lite. She never really knew how good it felt to eat until you were actually full and satisfied. It was a wonderful feeling to her, and she wanted to feel it more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that Rena decided that from now on, she would eat whatever she wanted, and as much as she wanted. And if she put on weight, so be it. She was tired on having a stick figure body anyway. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRena looked at her watch, and saw it was nearly ten thirty. All that food had made Rena sleepy, and she decided she might as well go to bed. She paid for her food, and checked herself into the hotel section of The Mirage. She usually slept on the sofa in her former boss's trailer, but seeing as she just quit her job, that wasn't really an option. <br>\r\n                                                                                                                                      Not that it bothered her, because she had ordered the best suite in the hotel, and was pleased to finally sleep in a real bed again . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Collapsing onto a bed as soft as a cloud, Rena fell asleep in minutes. She awoke the next morning, and was surprised to see that her formerly flat belly had developed a bit of pudge to it. She supposed this was to be expected, after all that food she ate last night. Speaking of which, she felt like ordering room service for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She picked up the hotel phone and ordered the biggest omelet they had, along with bacon, toast and a whole gallon of milk. As Rena ate, she thought of how she would spend the rest of her day. She decided since she now had millions of dollars to her name, she might as well put it to good use. She was going to need new clothes if she was going to eat as much as she wanted from now on, to accommodate the inevitable changes to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Rena took a taxi to the nearest mall. As the taxi pulled up in front of the mall, she tipped the driver for the trip. As she approached the building, she decided to, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Go to the local clothing store and buy herself some new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Head to the grocery store and buy herself as many treats as she can carry<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grabbing her purse, she head outside, caught a cab, and went back to the mall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to the nearest clothing department, a store that sold sports equipment, and also sport uniforms for soccer, football, and hokey, caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the window, a mannequin was put on display, dressed in a strange blue leotard. A tag hung from it that read, \"One size fits all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea popped into Rena's head, and she went inside. Catching the first employee that walked by, she asked him, \"That weird suit on display in your window, does it really fit all sizes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said the employee, \"From what I heard it's supposed to be made out of super stretchy fabric. So, yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll take it.\" Rena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl had a simple plan: with this super elastic suit she would not have to buy any more clothing for a while. The cost didn't bother her, for she had a ton of money, but it was annoying to go out shopping for new clothing every time she got a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the leotard under her clothing, Rena left the store, heading off to the nearest all-you-can-eat restaurant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena practically skipped into the restaurant, a diner-style buffet called <i>The American Dream</i>. She was soon seated at a table for two near the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, ma'am,\" the waitress, a gray-furred wolfgirl who was more belly fat than anything else, said. \"My name is Lei, and I will be your server. What will you be having tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled hungrily. \"I'll have the buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice,\" Lei said. She then leaned in close and stage-whispered to Rena \"You probably can't tell, but I'm particularly partial to the buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena and Lei both chuckled. The wolfgirl jotted something down on her notepad and waddled off to take the next order. Rena meanwhile walked up to the buffet table and picked up a plate. She almost giggled to herself before she walked down the line and took a handful of everything. By the time Rena reached the other end of the table, her plate was piled high with French fries, burgers, and at least twenty different kinds of hotdogs. She plunked her plate on her table before going back three more times to create a total of four near identical plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bite was heaven. Rena had to force herself to moan in pleasure right there in the restaurant, no matter how orgasmically delicious the greasy burger in her hands was. Rena quickly wolfed down the rest of her burger and moved on to the next. And the next, and the one after that, until the next bite she took was of an equally delicious hotdog. After that bite, she was lost in a food induced utopia until her fingers scraped porcelain. Rena looked around her table for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any. Rena had eaten all four plates of food, and judging by the fact that she had a six-inch high stack of plates on her table, she had eaten far more than she'd intended. Rena was snapped completely out of her reverie by the shooting pain coming from her stomach. Her previously mostly flat stomach had rounded out quite a bit- it not stuck out roughly a foot and a half from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" A familiar voice asked Rena. The catgirl in question managed to see through the haze of pain to see that it was Lei, the wolfgirl waitress from before. Rena groaned and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to drive you home?\" Lei asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't... you... have... work?\" Rena groaned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei looked amused. \"The restaurant closed two hours ago. I'm the only staff member here 'cause I volunteered to stay behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei gently guided Rena's hand to her massive stomach. To Rena's pain-numbed surprise, it was taught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I couldn't help myself and I just <i>had</i> to have some food for myself,\" Lei said fake bashfully. \"So where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't... have... a home,\" Rena said. \"Won... jackpot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there,\" Lei said. \"Save your strength. And how about I let you crash with me until you get your own place?\"</span></div></div>",

She then grasped her belly in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei, clearly worried, asked, \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, still holding her massive gut, said, \"Yeah, just still hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei then asked \"So what did you say about a fortune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena then recited everything that has happened before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei, having heard the entire story, said \"Gee, that guy must have been a complete ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena responded, with a light giggle \"Yeah, he was.

It didn't shrink a lot, still about the size of a beach ball, but this made it easier to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into the kitchen, where Lei was preparing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sunshine!\" Lei said, noticing Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's cooking?\" Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei responded, \"Oh, just a little meal for us. Nothing to big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. I'm going back to the living room. Just bring it out when you're done.\" Rena said, trying to not fall asleep right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei giggled and shook her head as she watched the obese cat girl waddle her way back to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, breakfast was served. Rena was taken aback by what was in front of her. A full spread of breakfast foods was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei was sitting next to her, smiling. She then said, \"Well, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, still surprised, asked, \"What's all this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei responded, \"Oh, just thought I'd give you a welcome gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, now realizing it was all for her asked, \"What are you going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei replied, \"While you were out cold, I made a small breakfast for myself, and I was gonna make one for you, but then I thought about how you tore through your burgers at the buffet, and thought you'd might enjoy something bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was flabbergasted. She had actually impressed someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei noticed the look of amazement on Rena's face, and asked, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena told her, \"I was never really able to impress anyone before, my boss always did knockoff tricks that only amazed kids. But You're amazed at how much I was able to eat at the buffet, now that... That makes me feel way more than just being fake sawed in half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei, not sure what she meant by this, asked, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena replied with, \"I mean, all my life, I thought I was a side character... but you made me feel like I was someone important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei, now understanding what Rena has been through, told her, \"I felt the same way. When I first got the job at the buffet, I felt like I was making the worst decision ever, but turns out that I was wrong, cause I met you. You showed me what being amazing can be like. You were in total bliss when you scarfed those burgers down like they were nothing! I knew you were something, but when I noticed you were in pain I knew I had to step up to the plate. The only reason I stayed behind was to see how you did it, but I soon figured out that you've never been like... This before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I know I'm fat. I think I'll get used to it though!\" Rena responded, \"So basically, I was an inspiration for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was speechless. She never thought she would have someone looking up to her, but, low and behold, Lei outright said it. \"So im assuming you brought me here is because you're becoming a crazed super-fan and want me for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?! No! Of course not! I wouldn't stoop that low!\" Lei responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to make sure.\" Rena affirmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You ready for breakfast now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the feast began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 12 minutes later, Rena had finished the entire set up. Lei sitting next to her, with a look of congratulations, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I've never ate that much in my life!\" Rena said, clearly stuffed beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei responded, \"Well, get ready, cause we're going to the mall today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, REALLY!?!\" Rena nearly screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLei replied, \"Yep, and you get to choose where to go first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena said \"Well, what are we doing here, sitting around? Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into the car (Rena had to move her seat back due to her large gut), and drove off to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where to first, Rena?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young feline woman stood atop the leaf-covered hill, deep in the woods outside her hometown. She took a deep breath, enjoying the musty smell of the various plant life. Brilliant emerald green eyes flitted back and forth as she used the hill as a vantage point, searching for a particular clearing. Her eyes lit up, her tail giving a happy flick, as she found the place she was searching for. Shifting the straps of the heavy pack on her back, so large it dwarfed the scrawny catgirl, she made her way down the hill. A few stumbles that thankfully didn't result in her rolling down the hill later, and she was plopping the oversized backpack on the ground with a small 'oof' of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah!\" She exhaled deeply, having sucked in a large breath of refreshing forest air. She loved that musty, woody smell. She camped in this exact spot every summer, had ever since she was a little kitten of a girl. She'd always loved the woods and having some peaceful quiet to herself for a few days was jut the thing she needed after a year of hustle and bustle. Taking a moment to push aside some stray strands of her long red hair, she set about getting all her things unpacked and in their proper place. After nearly an hour of work, she was done. Slapping her furry hands together to rid them of dirt, she plopped down happily on a small fold-up chair. Between the long hike lugging that heavy pack around and setting it all up, she definitely needed to kick back for a bit. Her thin legs were sore and complaining, and she took a moment to arch her back in an effort to work the kinks out of it and her shoulders. The hard part was over though! Now she got to sit back and relax, not worrying about anything and just enjoying the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled, reminding her of the other thing she liked about camping; camping snacks! Rummaging through her much lighter pack, she retrieved the essential ingredient: extra large marshmellows! As far as she was concerned, it wasn't quite a camping trip unless you had marshmellows to roast and to make s'mores with. Plus, since she was out here alone, that just meant she got to keep all of it to herself! Tail flitting about in anticipation, she fished out some matches and got a campfire going. It was still a little early to be lighting a fire, but the sun wasn't that far from going down and the night would be cold anyways. Giving a small giggle of amusement as she squished a plump marshmellow between her fingers, she popped it into her mouth. She had long since found she was too impatient to simply wait for the marshmellows to be roasted, so as she chewed the tasty treat she set about impaling a handful of the fluffy white cylinders on a large stick and held them over the open flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire crackled and snapped, the flames just short of reaching the tantalizing treats she was dangling above it. Swallowing her small sample, her free hand dipped back to her bag and popped another marshmellow into her waiting mouth. Just as the marshmellows started to turn a crispy golden brown, her hand dipping back down to the bag for one more marshmellow... She found to her confusion that there was no rustling of her furry hand on plastic and no plump and squishy treats between her outstretched fingers. Confusedly, she glanced away from the roasting marshmellows and found the entire bag had somehow vanished! A rustle of movement caught the corner of her eye, snapping her gaze back in front of her to find that the roasting marshmellows on her stick had vanished as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" She muttered, confused and alarmed at her vanished treats. Standing up, she glanced around in search of an explanation or culprit. Not far away she spotted one. A big lump of snow-white fur sat on the ground. Big floppy ears and large hind legs, and the large puffball of a tail, gave it away as a rabbit almost immediately. Just a very fat one, looking like a ball of fluff more than a lean and spry animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hit the spot...\" A loud sigh of contentment came from the rabbit, and it patted it's chubby paws on it's large belly appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Those were mine!\" The tiger-patterned catgirl objected, an annoyed look on her face. Her stomach gave a rumble of support for her protest, having not had it's fill of the marshmellows either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit didn't pay her any mind, pulling a gold pocketwatch from a fold of fur-covered fat. After fumbling with the latch and getting it open, the rabbit let out a surprised squeak and quickly stuffed it back where it came from. With surprising agility for such a fat creature, it bolted off into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! I'm late! I'm late for a very important date!\" The rabbit's cry floated back into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for her to register what had just happened, her annoyance replaced with confusion. After a moment that was replaced with indignation as she realized it'd just stolen her food and run away, and she gave chase. There was no way she was going to let that rabbit get away with that! Her sandal-clad feet slapped against the leaves and snapped fallen twigs as she pursued the thieving hare, accidentally snagging her hair or shirt against a low branch here and there. Despite these mishaps, the large ball of white was easy to keep track of against the green and brown of the forest floor. The rabbit made a sharp turn towards a large tree, diving into a large hole at it's base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" The fat hair grunted as it's rotound middle stopped it from passing through completely. Flailing it's hind legs, the pursuing catgirl gave a cry of triumph as she quickly caught up. Just as she reached down to grab the thief by it's hind feet, a sound like a cork popping free of a bottle sounded and the hare vanished into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She cried out in frustration, fingers closing around empty air. She quickly dropped to her hands and knees, peering into the hole. Only pure black met her inquiring gaze, far to covered in shadows for her to see even the hint of a white rabbit in there. It was a large tree the rabbit had fled into, so she supposed even one as fat as that would have enough room to hide. Reaching one hand in tentatively, she flailed it around in search of anything. Her hand again met only open air, and with a frown she reached in with her other one as well. Still finding nothing, not even the feel of solid wood, she ducked her head through the hole as well. Having expected to smack against dirt or wood, she was surprised when she pitched forward, unbalanced and tumbling into the hole entirely. While she was much taller than the rabbit, her scrawny form was much thinner and had no trouble making it through at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown she fell through the pitch black darkness, air rushing past her, and she let out a surprised shriek. Suddenly the darkness was broken by light far below her, and she screamed louder at the sight of ground below her. If such a long fall didn't kill her, it'd certainly break something! She slammed into the yellow ground hard... Bouncing back up? Too confused to be scared, she bounced a few more times, each time with less momentum, before she found herself simply sitting on the ground in confusion. She smacked the ground a few times with her hands, the spongey material wiggling and smooshing in response before going back to it's natural shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sponge?\" She mumbled to herself, pinching it between two fingers. A small piece broke off, and she brought it up to her green eyes to get a better look at it. Squishing it between her fingers and turning it, her nose tickled as she got a whiff of a familiar smell. She tilted her head curiously, confused. That smell was... Sponge cake? That was impossible! How could the floor of a cave under the forest be made out of sponge cake? Compelled to prove it couldn't be sponge cake, she tentatively gave it a lick. To her amazement, it tasted exactly how it smelled. Now more curious than confused, she popped the piece of sponge cake into her mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. Her stomach gave a rumble of approval, and her eyes lit up in further amazement. It was sponge cake! Impossible or not, she was absolutely sure that's exactly what it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up tentatively, giving an amused giggle as she bounced up and down on the spongey surface a few times, she glanced around for the first time. The 'cave' wasn't very large. It was a big round room, the ceiling so far up as to vanish in the darkness. She couldn't even tell where the hole she had fell through was. The entire floor was made of bright yellow sponge cake, and the walls seemed to be made of dark, smooth stone of some kind. On the far wall, the size of a mousehole, was a door. She blinked at it curiously when she saw it, but the large white table set in the middle of the room caught her attention first. A note sat upon it, along with a small clear bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat me...?\" She read aloud, puzzled. She lifted up the small bottle, eyeing the contents. \"Chocolate chips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she shrugged. She didn't know where she was or what was going on but, that rabbit had come through here too. This note seemed like it was some kind of instructions, and there didn't seem to be any other way out. Unscrewing the lid, she fished out a single chocolate chip and popped it into her mouth. The taste of chocolate met her tongue, and she made a small 'mmm' of appreciation. Fishing out another chocolate chip, she popped it into her mouth as well when a strange tingling sensation prickled across her orange and black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\" She murmured, looking at her hands and arms in confusion. Still wanting more chocolate, she dumped the whole thing into her hand and set the jar aside. Popping another into her mouth, she returned to examining the room. That doorway seemed like the only other thing worth looking at. Another chip into her mouth, the tingling still present. With a sigh, she looked back towards the table. That door was way too small. Another chip, and she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't that table taller?\"</span></div></div>",

For untold years they ravaged the land, until finally, the Grand Council of Mages banished them to an empty dimension for all time. A millenium passed, and the Malabestia faded from all memory, except those of the council, who from that point forward passed the knowledge of the Malabestia and their imprisonment on to their successors, so that if they would ever escape, the council could once again send them back into oblivion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, as the centuries passed, the knowledge of the spell that was used banish the Malabestia was lost. So now, if they were to be released, the only hope to save the world from their plight, was for someone to do the impossible. Someone would have to destroy them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no ordinary weapon could harm the Malabestia. In order to slay them, one would need an exceptionally powerful enchanted weapon, not to mention the one wielding it would have to be extremely powerful themself. Someone like the legendary sorceress, Rena the Striped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaised since childhood in the arcane arts, Rena quickly discovered she had an exceptional talent for magic, and was always looking to increase her already extraordinary powers. She was a member of the race known as the Kath, humanoid cats of various breeds. She was famous throughout the land, not only because of her power, but because of her massive ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Rena her academy days, Rena had developed quite the superiority complex, believing herself to be the most powerful sorceress in the world, and while that may not have been far that from the truth, the Council, as well as her fellow mages, grew more and more fed up with her arrogance by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as she was soaking in her personal hot springs, a phoenix swooped down from the sky, with a piece of parchment clutched in it's beak. Rena knew the phoenix had been sent by the Grand Council of Mages, those old geezers had always communicated by way of mystic birds. Rena never understood why, then again, she didn't really care for anything the council did. She considered them all to be foolish old men, spending all day in their tower on their gilded thrones, debating over such petty matters as whether they should revoke the entrance fee for the Arcane Academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena set the scroll aside as she stood up and exited the spring. She used to have such a scrawny figure, but thanks to a little alteration spell, she now had a sizable bust, as well as an admittedly perky rear. With a snap of her fingers, her body instantly dried, and her fur was nice and smooth against her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the phoenix was still there, seemingly staring at her nude self. Rena scowled. \"Why don't you carve a statue? It'll last longer.\" She aimed two fingers at the bird, and a bolt of lightning shot from her hand, striking the ground directly next to the phoenix. It flew off with an angry squawk, as Rena gave a light smirk. After dressing herself in her usual attire, a red cloak and hood with a emerald green tunic, Rena sat on a nearby rock as she opened the scroll and read it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena the Striped,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are cordially summoned to the Tower of the Grand Council, to discuss a most urgent matter. We feel you are the only one qualified to handle this dilemma, and urge you to come to the city of Tytus post haste. Complete the task we bestow upon you, and your reward shall include half of the gold in our vaults, the Heart of Torim ruby, and the Gauntlet of Menomitus. Please come at once the safety of the world depends on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh Wizard Borus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena grinned. So, those old fools we're willing to give her their greatest treasures, in exchange for completing a measly task? This would be the easiest score of her life! No matter what their little assignment was, it would no doubt simple for someone of her power. She had made her living by saving entire cities from natural disasters, monsters, and other such things, but only at a great price, usually in the form of gold or a powerful magical artifact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her staff, Rena focused her mind on the city of Tytus, the capitol of Torim, and with a bright flash of light, she appeared outside the entrance to the Council Tower. the tower itself was easily the tallest structure in the city, if not all of Torim, and symbolized the status and power of the Council itself. They didn't govern the land, but acted as advisors to the emperor, as well as providing various services to the public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena entered the gates, past the sentry golems that guarded the entrance, and stepped onto the stone disk with mystical symbols carved into it. Rena banged bottom of her staff three times on the disk, which began to glow with a bright purple light. In an instant, Rena was was standing in the center of the Council chamber, facing the seven council members as they sat on their thrones. They all wore dark blue robes, and had long white hair and beards, Rena always wondered if it would kill them to let a woman on the council, not that she would be interested in the job, she had much better things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Rena the Striped. Glad you could make it.\" Said Borus, the head of the council. He sat in the center chair, with three other council members on either side of him. \"Whatever.This had better be worth my time, old man.\" Rena replied. Borus put on a slight scowl as he continued, this was not the first time they had commissioned Rena for a task, and he and the rest of the council have had just about enough of Rena's arrogance and disrespect. \"I promise you, complete this task, and we shall make it worth your time. You must hunt down and slay the Malabestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena arched an eyebrow. \" I thought they were dead already.\" \"Not dead, just banished from this plane by the original Council.\" Said Borus \"We don't know how, but they have escaped their perdition, and are running amok throughout the land. Only an extremely powerful artifact can destroy the Malabestia, and so we present you with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorus clapped his hands together, and a magnificent sword materialized in mid air in front of Rena, who gasped in amazement. \"Is that...\" Borus nodded \"Yes, the Sword of Souls.\" Rena set her staff on the floor, and grasped the sword, drawing it frown it's scabbard. It's blade was forged of pure gold, and a silver handle with a large ruby in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This blade will absorb the souls of those it slays.\" Borus continued, \"It will also grow in power with each soul absorbed. After you've slain all fifty of the Malabestia, you are to return the sword to us. We also ppresent you with this enchanted feather.\" Borus produced a white feather from his leave, and it levitated over to Rena. \"It will point you in the direction of the nearest Malabestia, and will glow once you have found it. And finally, to help you succeed in your quest, we will place a spell on you that will resurrect you right here, should you die on your journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena scoffed. \"Oh please, I don't need your help. I will slay these petty beasts on the first try, without the aid of feeble old fools.\" Taking the sword and feather, Rena prepared to leave, but she had already crossed the line. There was a noise like thunder as Rena's body was suddenly paralyzed and Borus' voice boomed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENA! YOU HAVE DISRESPECTED THIS COUNCIL FOR THE LAST TIME! YOU ARE VAIN, ARROGANT, GREEDY, AND AN ALL AROUND PAIN IN THE ASS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash of light, and Rena could move again. \"What just happened?\" All seven council members looked down at her with a sneer as Borus answered \"We have had it with your disrespect towards this council, so we have decided to teach you a lesson in humility. We have placed our spell of immortality on you, but each time you are resurrected, you will gain more and more body weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A SPELL LIKE THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. You are known for three things, your magical prowess, your immeasurable ego, and your lovely figure. By placing this spell on you, we hope to remove the latter two from the equation. In fact, let's make a little wager, hmm? If you complete your quest without dying once, you may keep the Sword of Souls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Rena was furious, how dare they do this to her! But then she remembered, she was Rena the Striped! She would destroy the Malabestia without even trying, curse or no curse! \"Fine, old man, you have a deal.\" With that said, she slammed her staff end on the floor, and teleported back to the gates. After Rena had gone, the council members all burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Rena's quest begins, but where will it take her first? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena goes to a remote village where the Malabestia Zombie is spreading a deathly plague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena hunts the Malabestia Werewolf in the Forest of Bane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Rena must slay the Malabestia Dragon, who is terrorizing a nearby kingdom.</span></div></div>",

The zombie should be the easiest one to kill, after all, he's already dead.\" Rena decided to head off to the village where the Malabestia zombie was spreading his plague as she waved her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Malabestia zombie resembled a decayed Cryptkeeper-style corpse, except with purple veins over his body and wavy light purple-blond hair. The zombie was groaning as he leaked out toxic purple slime from his mouth. The zombie coughed as his jaw dropped into the river nearby Crystal Lake Village. The zombie fished out and put his jaw back in right after it leaked out a foul smelling black ooze that turned the water a purplish color. A few birds drank the tainted water, causing them to mutate into skeletal forms that moaned out and decayed. The zombie walked into the deep water as more animals started to drink the tainted slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had arrived near the village and was holding up the feather that had been given to her by the magic council. It pointed to Crystal Lake village and begun to glow. \"Aha,\" said Rena. \"So that's where the zombie has been hiding. Well, he'll have to return to his grave soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena walked closer to the village and saw that the village houses were covered in a thick moss and that there were toxic purple clouds flying above the village. Rena looked around and there were corpses everywhere, apparently having succumbed to the plague brought on by Zombie. Some corpses even looked like they died in the middle of their work since one corpse had been carrying a hoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena begun to cough and she took out her magic scarf to cover her mouth in order to protect herself from the poisons in the air. She bent over and saw a young girl corpse holding a doll and as Rena shook her head, she had to rub her eyes because she thought that she saw the corpse's hand moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rena heard a loud snort and then she turned her head around to see that a zombified bull was running forward. Apparently not all corpses had completely stopped moving. Rena held out the Sword of Souls and swung it just as the zombie bull came at her. The sword took off the bull's horns but the bull ran past Rena and was coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Rena as she held out her sword. \"Time for a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich spell would best defeat the bull?</span></div></div>",

Rena swung her foot and knocked zombies head to the side. \"Head's up!\" yelled zombie as his body came out of the ground. Zombie then waved his arm to call back his head. \"How's kicks with you?\" asked the Malabestia corpse. Rena then held her sword dangerously close to the zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that, Rena the Striped,\" said Zombie. \"Somebody could get hurt. And we definitely want that to happen.\" Zombie let out a laugh before Rena kicked him in the face and knocked him back. Zombie had to readjust his jaw. \"Prepare to return to your grave, corpse breath,\" said Rena. \"Because you're about to be destroyed by the greatest wizard in the world.\" Zombie took out one of his own eyes to polish it before speaking. \"And people say that I'm full of hot scare.

The sword hit a zombie horse hilt-first and clattered to the ground. There was a moment of stunned silence before the Malabestia broke out into laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" He said between guffaws. \"Your aim is terrible! That's why you use spells! You couldn't aim if your life depended on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zombie abruptly stopped laughing. \"Which it did. Kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat zombie that had Rena in a headlock grabbed her at the base of her neck. With a wet tearing sound, Rena's head was torn from her shoulders. The zombie dropped it to the ground. The Malabestia walked over to Rena's corpse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, girlie, but looks like you were <i>dead</i> wrong,\" he said. He raised his arms over his head. \"Move, body of Rena the Striped. Join my army!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black bolt of lightning struck Rena's body. It crackled around her a bit, but nothing happened. Just as the Zombie was about to cast the spell again, white light shone from Rena's body. Her head reconnected itself with her body, and when she opened her eyes, the white light exploded, killing all the zombies except for the Malabestia. But the blast still did heavy damage to his body, blowing off all of his limbs. Even so, his limbs slowly began to regenerate. Rena, the Soul Sword in hand, walked over to the Zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I honestly didn't expect that,\" the Zombie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you- I'm Rena the Striped, most powerful sorceress alive,\" Rena said. She positioned her sword to stab it into the Zombie's chest. \"Any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually,\" the Zombie said. \"Two things. First, we Malabestia can only be defeated by the Soul Sword. The Soul Sword gets more powerful the more Malabestia it has slain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of that, Zombie,\" Rena said, poking the Zombie's chest with the Soul Sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is where the fun part comes in!\" The Zombie said. \"If you learn the true name of the Malabestia you've killed, you can use a little bit of their power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow <i>that</i> was interesting. \"What's your power?\" Rena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is, obviously, to raise the dead,\" the Zombie explained. \"If you say my true name, you can summon a single enemy you've killed at a time. That enemy will have all of the abilities that it did while alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, Zombie, what's your true name?\" Rena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zombie smiled- a genuine smile, not the sneers he'd been doing- and said. \"It's kinda hard to say: Dfgapy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your second thing, Dfgapy?\" Rena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you gain weight?\" Dfgapy cackled before being impaled. Rena angrily sheathed the Soul Sword and cast a diagnostic spell on herself. Sure enough, she had gained weight- ten pounds of it. She poked her stomach- sure enough, she had gotten fatter. Of course, the diagnostic spell had told her that, but she felt she had to double check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned around at the sound of groaning. She readied a fireball spell and whirled around. As it turned out, there were no zombies like she'd thought, but the zombies she'd slain had turned back into normal humans. The first to recover, a muscular woman wearing an apron, walked over to Rena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer the one tha' saved us?\" She asked in a thick drawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm the one that saved your town,\" Rena said, preening herself. \"Are you going to give me a free room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blinked before scowling. \"I was, but yer attitude has made me think othawise,\" she said. \"I'm the owna and cook of tha town's inn. If ya can eat all o' tha leftovas afta tha bar closes, I'll let ya stay one night fo' free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena resisted the urge to blast that woman right then and there. Who the hell did she think she was? But Rena calmed herself. The High Council wanted her to learn humility, so she might as well start here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I answer,\" Rena said, \"what if I want to stay more than one night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then ya hafta eat tha' night's leftovas too,\" the woman answered. \"So, what'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

Rena had killed Dfgapy at roughly seven. For the next four hours, Rena ate nothing. She would have also cast hunger-inducing spells on either the patrons or herself, but Lynn had been smart and disallowed magic. Eventually, the last patron shuffled out of the inn, and Rena and Lynn were alone. Lynn spent a few minutes gathering the leftovers onto one table. Rena was about to sit down at the table when she noticed something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of these are untouched!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some folks orda ahead o' time,\" Lynn answered. \"Normally, it's no' this much, bu' all o' this stuff with the Malabestia made folks forgetful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sighed and sat down at the provided chair. After Rena had shifted to make herself comfortable, she grabs a fork and knife and began to eat a half-eaten steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Rena hated to admit it, Lynn was an amazing cook. The flavors in her dishes were exquisite, and Rena could hardly control herself. Before she knew it, she was scraping the last bit of pudding out of a bowl and licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be damned,\" Lynn said. \"Ya actually ate all o' it. I'll put your room key on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena barely registered Lynn's words, as she was trying not to pass out from the pain. The leftovers had been enough food to stuff ten humans, and Rena had eaten it all. Kath physiology was near identical to a human's on the inside, with the exception of the stomach. The stomach started out at the same size as a human's, but could stretch much further. No one knows why this is, but the most accepted theory is that that trait is a holdover from when Kath were much less humanoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScientific babble aside, Rena cast a pain numbing spell, grabbed her keys, and tried to stand up. She nearly overbalanced and fell of her massive stomach, she managed to catch herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her stomach, it managed to be large enough that gravity noticeably affected it. The mass of food and a tiny bit of fat was dragged down to mid-thigh, and a diagnostic spell told her that she weighed twenty-two pounds more than when she'd started eating. Rena groaned and lumbered her way to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7.........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up and cast another diagnostic spell on herself. The meal had been entirely digested, and she now weighed eight pounds more than she had yesterday. Immediately after she cast the spell, she felt woozy. Rena cursed. Magic Deprivation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Deprivation was caused by a sorceress' magic running dangerously low. How long it took to recover your magic depended on how much magical power you had. If all you could do was simple party tricks, a few hours was all it took to fully recharge. But someone as powerful as Rena took <i>months</i> to recharge. And until you were fully recharged, you couldn't use magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Rena do? Travel to find the second Malabestia, and hope her sword skills are up to snuff? Or stay in the village and get fat?</span></div></div>",

Instantly, the catgirl's emerald green eyes widened, her tiger stripe fur standing on edge. Holy crap, that was sweet! She spat the leaf out, wiping her tongue to rid her mouth of the overly sweet taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Rena, take little bites this time,\" Rena said, reaching up to pick another leaf. She absent-mindedly nibbled on the leaf while she inspected the tree's bark. The minty smell of the leaf overpowered everything else, so she just peeled off a small piece of bark and popped it into her mouth. Rena moaned. Chocolate, and the highest quality Rena had ever tasted. She discarded the half-eaten leaf and attacked the tree. Rena ripped off huge chunks of bark and practically inhaled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Rena had quite the sweet tooth. She never could resist candy, especially chocolate. It was her sweet tooth that had led to many weight-related problems in her youth. In seventh grade, at her heaviest, she weighed over 500 pounds. One visit to the doctor later, and Rena was told that if she continued to gain weight like she had been, she would die before she turned 30. By the time her senior year of high school rolled around, she had gone from morbidly obese to almost underweight. However, she never truly lost her sweet tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a creaking groan, the tree Rena had been eating fell over. Not wasting a beat, Rena picked up the surprisingly weightless fallen tree and shook all of the leaves off, before inhaling the remaining chocolate. She reached for another tree, before realizing that there were no more trees. In her chocolate-induced haze, she had eaten the entire forest, and it showed. Rena sported a chubby face, with cheeks so fat she was forced to squint. Her sixty chins melted into a neck as thick as the trees she'd been devouring. Below that was her previously flat chest. Before she had been like a wall; now her cleavage could be called a valley and not be hyperbole. Each breast extended for miles from her chest, and would have pooled on the ground were it not for her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly covered all of the land Rena could see. Even when she managed to look behind herself, her belly was there, enveloping the globe, drowning it forty miles deep in blubber. While she couldn't see her butt, Rena still knew that it was shelf-like; continental shelf-like, that is. Her massive thunder thighs were bigger than cities, and tapered off into hilariously normal-sized feet. Rena opened her mouth and let out a huge belch, creating a shockwave that destroyed the moon. Chunks of moon fell onto Rena, including one that impacted with her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up with a gasp. She couldn't quite remember what her dream was, but she remembered it had been a good one before abruptly ending. Rena tried to get back to sleep, but was stopped by a curious sensation in her gut. It was an odd, bloated feeling, and it bugged her to no end. Sighing, she got up to go to the bathroom. She stumbled forward slightly, but chalked that up to being tired. She entered the bathroom and flicked on the lights. It took Rena a minute to realize what she was staring at in her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" Rena asked. \"Why am I fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Rena was fat. Her previously flat belly had puffed out to form a rather large potbelly that made her shirt ride up to show most of her belly, her breasts had popped out of the top of her shirt somehow and now were as long as her upper arm, and her flannel pants had ripped while trying to contain two globes of ass that hadn't been there before. Curious, Rena stepped onto a set of scales. The dial spun for a second before landing on the number 250.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena let out a low whistle. \"Whatever just happened, it made me put on 130 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter marveling at herself for a little bit, a wave of tiredness washed over Rena. Yawning, she flicked the bathroom light off and flopped down onto her bed. She fell asleep instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later she was awoken by the beeping of her alarm clock. Groggily, she turned off her alarm clock and stretched her arms above her head, unintentionally diving her nose into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Rena noted. \"So that actually happened last night. Weird, I thought my clothes were too small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Rena's clothes had been too small, but not anymore. Her white sleep shirt now hung loosely off her frame, like it had previously, and her pants were just a little too long for her legs once again. An inspection of her closet revealed that the same thing had happened to the rest of her clothes. Intrigued, she picked up a bra, wondering how big she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36K,\" she read aloud. \"Sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then briefly panicked, before remembering that it was spring break. Grinning crazily, she rushed downstairs. Time to marathon more online FPS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt midnight, Rena groggily made her way back into her room. The marathon had been fun, but draining as usual. Not even bothering to shower, Rena stripped down to her underwear and went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young tiger-striped orange and black catgirl stifled a yawn as she stretched in her seat, scratching one of the triangular ears jutting through the sea of long red hair atop her head. She leaned back in her chair, free hand bringing the sheet of paper up to her face to continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sample... store at freezing... Blah blah. Can't he get to the point?\" She grumbled to herself, skimming through the rest of the report. It wasn't so bad when it was on paper since then her boss was limited by room, she supposed. The rare emailed report was like an entire biology book by comparison. Sometimes she wished she was interning under some other researcher. Finished skimming, she tossed the report onto the desk carelessly, leaning forward and eyeing the box it had come with curiously. It was one of those cold storage containers, so good at staying cold that it looked chilled on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from her chair, she scooped up the container and made her way over to the sample freezer. Delicately pinning the box between a boney hip and one hand, she gave the freezer door a sharp tug with her free hand. No dice. The freezer was practically vacuum sealed shut or something. Trying to get it open was always a huge pain. It didn't help that the door was on the top and opened upwards, making the angle really odd to try and get any sort of leverage on. Another two attempts finally saw her succeed though, and she was met with a blast of chilled air. Shivering slightly despite her lab coat, which was too thin to really keep her warm, she set the box on the lip of the open freezer while keeping the lid propped up with one hand. With her other hand, she undid the latch that kept the box sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral test tubes nestled securely in a small styrofoam mold greeted her green eyes, filled with bits of rock and soil and a few small nuggets of ore. Prying them from their cozy container, she set them one by one in the slots for test tubes, taking a moment to curiously examine the contents of each one. The tubes were extremely cold however, and her poor furry fingers were starting to ache from holding them a little too long. Technically she was supposed to wear gloves for this sort of thing, but she didn't bother unless it was something actually capable of hurting her. As she hurried to unload all the test tubes from the container, her numb fingers fumbled and one of them tumbled out of her grasp. The tube smacked into the lip of the freezer, the lid popping open from the impact and sending a small handful of lumpy soil into the freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Not good!\" She cried out in surprise, quickly catching the test tube before it could roll off the lip and ducking into the freezer. Scrambling frantically, she scooped all the soil back into it's test tube as quickly as possible. Teeth chattering from having her head and upper torso in the freezer, she glanced around frantically for the missing cap. Shuffling the contents of the freezer around gently, she found it's hiding place in the corner under the test tube holder. Grabbing it, she frowned as she noticed a bright green sprinkle stuck to the side of it. She contemplated where it could have come from for a moment, shrugging and licking the sprinkle free and returning the cap to it's rightful place on the test tube. It was just some soil samples anyways, so as far as she was concerned the five-second rule still applied and it was only like... Eight seconds, tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the storing of the samples accomplished and catastrophe averted, she began rooting around the obscure corner where she had found the test tube's cap. Her efforts yielded her a frosted-over ice cream sundae, covered in sprinkles. The syrup had hardened like a shell, and there were visible ice crystals jutting from it all over. The ice cream had definitely gone more towards the 'ice' side of things, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this get here?\" She murmured to herself out loud, trying to recall. She didn't remember hiding this in here... Oh, that was right! She'd hidden it during the christmas party a month back. They had all kinds of food and stuff, and she decided to hide a sundae there to snack on sometime while working. She'd apparently up and forgot it was there and never got around to eating it. Giving a shrug at the solved mystery, she took the sundae with her as she pulled herself out of the freezer and let the lid slam shut with a loud 'thwump' sound. Still shivering slightly, she made her way back to her desk and set the frozen treat down as she plopped back into her sight, sighing in boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe supposed she could busy herself reading or something. She'd completed all her tasks with storing those samples, all she had to do now wait until she was off the clock. She stared contemplatively at the sundae, giving it a poke with her no longer numb finger. Hard as a rock. There was no way she was going to be able to eat that thing, not without giving it time to thaw at least. Was watching ice melt the equivalent of watching paint dry? It probably was, although in this case at least she got a tasty treat out of it as a reward. Turning her attention to the small stack of books on the side of her desk, she rummaged through them for a moment for something to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read that one ten times... No... God this one had a dumb ending...  Eh, maybe... Ahah, here we go!\" Her rummaging ended as she found a book she had only recently purchased, having not actually had a chance to read yet. Leaning back in her chair, resting her feet up on her desk, she settled down to read. Every few pages she would look up from the story to glance at the ever-slowly thawing sundae. After the first chapter, she had started to pry a sprinkle off now and then. By the second chapter her stomach had started to rumble, causing her to glance at the clock mounted on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, still a half hour...\" She gave her flat stomach a pat under her shirt in an attempt to placate it. She was always starving when she got off work because of the no snack rule. Sure she got a lunch break, but they always made her take that early on in the afternoon and she didn't get off until well into the evening. Returning to her book to kill the remaining time, the catgirl assistant soon found herself out of sprinkles. The sundae was still far too frozen to attempt to eat, but the rumbling of her stomach wasn't so easily dissuaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, she propped the book open against her lap, holding the sundae in one hand and turning a page with the other. She'd turn a page, take a lick of the sundae, and repeat. Then it went from turning a whole page between licks to reading half a page. Then a paragraph. Then a sentence. In short order she was taking a lick for every word she read. By the time it was closer for her to leave, between the room temperature slowly thawing it and her constant licking, the sundae had softened considerably. Once she had finished the second chapter, she had started to nibble on it, and by the time the clock hit the hour, the entire top half of the sundae had been whittled away. Her stomach was appeased at first, but it was quickly demanding to actually get some substance into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding the page to mark her place, she tossed the book back into the pile. Ready to leave and get a proper meal, she contemplated what to do with the rest of the sundae. She couldn't walk out of the room with it, since someone would probably catch her... Best to finish it off, even if it was still a little frozen. Tipping the small plastic container up to her mouth, she used her tongue to pull one side up and out, opening her mouth wide to take a large bite out of the frozen treat. A few tough moments of chewing, her tongue thoroughly numb from the cold, she swallowed the sizable bite of heavenly vanilla and chocolate. The very instant it hit her stomach, her belly rumbled and she found herself taking half the remaining sundae in one large bite. Without pausing, the rest of the sundae was in her mouth and down her throat. Licking the plastic container for every ounce of ice cream that might be left on it, she blinked rapidly in surprise at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven accounting for how hungry she usually was by now, she didn't usually go at her food like that. A little embarrassed and glad nobody was around, she tossed the container into a waste basket and shuffled out of her lab coat. Hanging it up on the rack, she quickly left the room and made her way out of the building. The sundae had quieted her stomach, but she still felt hungry enough to be in a hurry. Giving a quick wave good bye to the secretary and the security staff she passed on her way out, she made her way to the parking lot and into her car. It was a short drive home, but her stomach had started rumbling halfway there and she found herself compelled to get something on the way instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short stop at a drive through found her ordering a large burger with fries, and that sundae earlier put her in the mood for a large shake as well. The burger was devoured in a mere three bites, driving with one hand as she ate, and the fries just barely lasted her to her neighborhood. The last fry went past her hungry lips as she pulled into her driveway. The milkshake, already half gone during the drive, was finished off by the time she opened her front door. Her stomach full and strained from eating so much so rapidly, the young tiger-patterned catgirl shuffled her shoes off and stumbled over to her couch, flopping onto it with an 'oof' and quickly drifting off to sleep. The sound of soft snoring quickly filled the room, accompanied by a gurgling sound from the young intern's bloated stomach. Despite having been packed with food mere minutes ago, her tight stomach was visibly returning to it's normal flat shape at an impossible speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnawares of any strangeness, the feline young woman shifted in her sleep as the pressure in her git vanished and allowed a more comfortable position.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena woke up at six in the morning. Groaning, she sat up trying to massage the kink out of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, what happened last night?\" She asked herself, her head still foggy from sleep. Soon, that fog cleared up. \"Oh, right. Hope I didn't put on too much weight from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked her stomach, and was pleasantly surprized to find out that no, she hadn't put on any weight, or at least none she could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I shouldn't've been worried,\" Rena said, patting her stomach. \"My metabolism's amazing. I wouldn't put on any weight from ju-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's eyes went wide as she cut herself off. Nausea bubbled up in her throat as she made a mad dash for the bathroom. She barely managed to make it to the toliet and flip it open before Rena's stomach heaved, a small amount of vomit passing between her lips. She dry heaved a few times, then collapsed to the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...shit,\" she muttered to herself. \"This is from that soil sample, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach seemed to growl in the affirmative. Rena sighed and pulled herself to her feet. The smell of vomit in her fur was bugging her, so she splashed her face with water and began to scrub. Multiple times while Rena was washing her face, she felt hunger pangs so strong she nearly collapsed again. As fast as she could, Rena dried off her face and washed the acrid taste out of her mouth. Once that was done, her mind was consumed by one thought and one thought only: FOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stumbled out of her bathroom before loping over to her fridge. She tore the door open and grabbed the first thing she saw, a chocolate cake so big it took up an entire shelf in her fridge. There was some story as to why Rena had such a huge cake in her refrigerator, but she was too hungry to remember it. Rena slid the cake out of the fridge and into her arms so she could carry it to the table. Due to a combination of how weak she felt and how heavy the cake was Rena almost fell over. A quick step back with her back foot was all that prevented the monster cake from falling onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disaster of sugary proportions averted, Rena made her way over to her breakfast table, going red in the face from the strain. The damn thing must've weighed fifty pounds! The catgirl set the cake down on the table with a heavy thunk before grabbing a chunk of cake as big as her head and biting into it. Rena moaned through the first bite. Maybe it was the fact that she felt like she hadn't eaten in a week, but the chocolate cake tasted like heaven to Rena. Her appetite seemed to double as Rena tore into the cake with her bare hands, before just taking huge bites directly out of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of Rena's binging were primarily shown in two places on her body. The first was the area around her mouth, as more and more chocolate got stuck in the fur there. The second area affected, and probably the more noticable of the two, was her belly. Barely a tenth of the way through the cake, and Rena's belly was already nearing the size and shape of a bowling ball, unrestricted due to the button on her jeans popping off solme time ago. When said event happened, Rena briefly stopped eating to wonder where the button went, before shrugging and going back to eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Rena ran out of cake, which she realized when her claws scraped against the serving dish the cake was on. Almost as an acknowledgement of that fact, the catgirl let out an earsplitting belch, complete with cake crumbs flying out of her open mouth. Sated, Rena faded out of her feeding frenzy to assess the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, her jeans were completely ruined, the sheer volume of food Rena packed into her stomach ripping the waist beyond repair. Her shirt wasn't much better, the white cotton stretched and ripped near the bottom, and stained by chocolate near the top. All of this damage was done by her gargantuan stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena knew how tall she was and how much she weighed. She was 5'4\" and weighed, or rather, had weighed, 130 pounds. Looking at her stomach, Rena guessed that it stuck out somewhere near five feet. Strangely, Rena felt no pain from it. In fact, she still felt a bit hungry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There's got to be some kind of limit to my hunger,\" Rena mused. In thought, Rena's eyes flicked up to the clock, before going wide at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's only seven?\" Rena asked. She made to get up to look at the clock, but was weighed down by her heavy belly. Sighing to herself, Rena wrapped her arms under her belly and waddled over to the clock to get a better look at it. Sure enough, only an hour had passed since the catgirl had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Rena breathed. \"Whatever caused that weird amount of hunger aside, that's impressive. I wonder how much I actually ate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting slightly to a more stable stance, Rena waddled to her bathroom, as she had a set of scales there. Even with her giant belly, Rena was able to pass through the door without touching either side, although just barely. It was a bit akward getting onto the scales so Rena could see her weight, but she managed. The scale churned slightly before spitting out a three digit number- 180.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty pounds in an hour,\" Rena noted. \"That's... way more than should be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena set her belly down on the bathroom skin so her could bring her hand up to her mouth in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if there's any limit to my stomach's capacity, considering I don't even feel full at the moment,\" Rena mused, her stomach growling as if on cue. A flash of inspiration coming to her, Rena pulled her phone out of her ruined pants pocket, dialing a somewhat familiar number. The phone ringed exactly once before the person on the other end picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good morning Rena!\" A middle-aged male voice answered from the other end. \"How are you doing this fine day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine, Doctor Gast,\" Rena answered, leaving her unnatural hunger problem out. \"I was actually going to do some research on a personal project of mine, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wish to use some of the lab's funds for your research?\" Gast finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, although Gast couldn't see. \"That's right, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGast made a thoughtful sound. Rena could picture in her mind what the scientist she was interning under was doing- running a hand through his black and gray hair. Dr. Vincent Gast was the world's most famous biologist. There was literally no one in the entire scientific community who didn't know who Dr. Gast was. And the best part was, none of his reputation rode off of other's successes. The only potential black mark on his records was a some arbitrary number of greats uncle of his that lived almost four hundred years ago, who was... not the most moral of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Gast eventually said. \"You have access to two percent of the lab's funds to use as you see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt her heart skip a beat. Two percent of the lab's funds was enough to run an entire army with state-of-the-art gear comfortably for five years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, sir,\" Rena stammered out before hanging up. With shaking fingers, Rena dialed up the number of a nearby delivery place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much I can eat?\" Rena muttered to herself while her phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to Rena's question was, predictably, a lot. Pizzas, sub sandwiches, Chinese, and many other kinds of food passed through Rena's lips and into her ever expanding stomach. Eventually, however, Rena started to feel full. However, she was determined to find the full capacity of her stomach. So, some time later, Rena finally found her capacity, her stomach throbbing in agony as one final noodle was sucked down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the haze of pain, Rena looked at the time. It was five in the morning, and according to the digitized calendar next to the time, Rena had started eating almost two days ago, and her belly really showed it. Rena sat on one side of her house, but she could feel the other side with her belly. It was so heavy that Rena couldn't move it. Somehow, however, Rena had gotten her scale to give her what she assumed was an accurate reading- 2480 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs muddied by pain as her thoughts were, Rena couldn't help but marvel at how much she weighed, almost two and a quarter tons! Rena quickly scribbled her weight on a nearby piece of paper before passing out from exhaustion and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena slept, her stomach gurgled, digesting the food inside rapidly as it shrunk down to a fraction of its size, distributing fat all over the catgirl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up and stretched, yawning as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... my arms feel really heavy,\" Rena said, her eyes still closed. When she opened them, she shrieked in surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm fat!\" Rena shouted. \"Fat\" was a bit of an understatement, however. Rena's formerly slim frame was now extremely obese. Each of her breasts were somewhere around the size of her head, and her butt was about four times larger than her boobs. The \"piece de resistence,\" however, was her belly, a massive gelatinous blob that threatened to overtake Rena's knees while she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena struggled to stand, her body unused to so much weight. The obese catgirl did eventually stand, and waddled over to her scales. When Rena had settled in a position in which she could see the scale's readout, she looked down and blanched. An even 600 on the display stared back up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I remember correctly, I had eaten 2,350 pounds of food,\" Rena said. \"If I now weigh 600 pounds, that means I gained 470 pounds overnight. So, unless something changes, I gain one fifth of whatever I eat in weight, apparently only while I sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud sound distracted Rena.</span></div></div>",

But for some reason she had trouble maintaining her footing. \"Huh?\" she asks. The cat girl noticed that her room is dark and then blinked her eyes to activate her night vision. She then spotted a mirror and gasped as she looks into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she saw her orange and black striped fur and red hair. She was a cat sith, or rather a neko from the land of Enigma, a plain where the creatures of myth and legends live. But she distinctly remembered being scrawny and flat chested. But for some reason that was no longer the case. Rena saw that she was taller than she once was, her guess was that she was now 8ft tall, but that wasn't the only thing that changed about her. She had for some reason become totally fat. Her stomach had to be five feet wide with H-cup breasts and a monster sized butt, each cheek was twice as big as a watermelon. Rena looked down and saw that she was wearing nothing but a white bra and a sumo thong that looked as if it was painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked. \"What's happened to me? I'm fat!\" Suddenly she heard a banging noise and realized that she's not alone. There was a window on the side of her wall with a view of the next room. \"Keep it down in there!\" yelled a voice coming from the next room.\" Rena waddled up to the window as her fat shook and then looked through it to see another monster girl was in the very next cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was a large ogopogo girl, a sea serpent resembling a giant eel with several hunches on her back. She was bright pink with purple spots and had a dragon like face with bright blue eyes. The ogopogo woman even had spikes jjutting down her back and purple hair. The ogopogo was just as fat as Rena but seemed taller. She was wearing nothing but a purple loincloth and a seashell bra. \"An ogopogo?\" asked Rena. \"Out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogopogo girl walked up to the window and let out a yawn, showing her large white teeth. \"The name's River,\" she said. \"And you must be new here. I take it you were a twig just yesterday.\" Rena nodded her head and pushed her hands against her fattened cheeks (her face, not her ass) before she answered. \"What happened to me. Just last night I was cutting wood in the forest. I mean, it's not as if there are any other monsters around. Wish I had a boyfriend. But then I got home and saw a basket filled with blue apples. I found a note that said they were sent from a secret admirer. I love apples and I thought somebody finally loved me and so I ate them all and then everything went black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver let out a sigh and shook her head. \"I'm afraid you fell for a trap. Those blue apples were laced with sleeping medicine and a filled with a potion that balloons monsters up like Thanksgiving blimps.\" Rena felt her stomach again and saw several rolls. \"Who would do such an awful thing?\" she asked. \"The White Apple Club,\" said River. \"They're a human crime group that abducts monster girls, fattens them and has them fight in sumo matches. I hear that you're going to be next to fight today. Be careful, you could be up against any amazon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver walked up to her bed in the corner to lay down and then Rena was more scared than ever. But before she could do anything, she heard her door open up and saw men in mechanical armor carrying taser staffs. \"Come on kitty. The crowd's waiting. The five men walk forward and surround Rena. Rena could probably take them at her much bigger size, but unfortunately they were armed and she went with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored men took Rena to an arena that looked like some kind of coliseum. As Rena walked out, she saw that in the stands there were tables like there would be in a fancy restaurant. All the guests were wearing masks and dressed in either tuxedoes or cocktail dresses as they awaited the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked up to see a figure in a hoverchair. The figure looked like a girl with long golden red hair and a white jack o'lantern mask. She was wearing a gold colored dress as she held up a microphone. \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" she yelled. \"Today the White Apple Club has a new kitten in the ring. Meet Rena, the cat sith. Weighing at 600lbs, she's still a little green, but don't worry. One of our veteran girls will break her in and show her how things work around here soon enough. Let the games begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena gulped as she saw the opposite side of the arena open up. She heard stomping and realized there was a monster girl bigger than her that was coming out. Her opponent was a large sumo...</span></div></div>",

This was a goldish furred cerberus covered in scares. She had six glowing red eyes and her fangs dripped with drool as she stared down her opponent. All she was wearing was a chainmail bra and sumo thong. The cerberus woman held all three heads in the air as they let out a roar and turned their attention to Rena. Rena stepped back out of fear, but then an electric barrier appeared right behind her and made her scream and jump back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked back and rubbed her oversized rear where the electric fence zapped her before the announcer was about to introduce the cerberus girl. \"In this corner stands Rena's first of hopefully many opponents. Weighing in at 900lbs and three heads of razor sharp teeth, here comes Trianna.\" Trianna stomped up towards Rena and growled as they both bowed. \"Get it over with!\" yelled one of the patrons. \"Let's see some bloodshed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer flew down in her hover chair and whispered into Rena's ear. \"Alright pussycat. Listen here. I've got customers who've paid millions to see you sumo beasts duke it out, so you better keep it interesting. You don't get out until either you beat 100 gladiators, or until you can't fight anymore. Now let the mangling begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer left the ring and gestured for her cronies to ring a gong. The fight started and Trianna ran at Rena hammering her with her large fat belly and pushing her back. Rena meowed in pain as the electric ring burned her large butt again. She then growled as Trianna came at her and was forced to push against the cerberus's massive breasts while using her own enlarged belly to drive Trianna towards the electric ring herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Trianna's center head growled and her heads at the sides bite Rena in her breasts and made her scream as Rena was forced to let go. Trianna then punched Rena in one of her blubbery cheeks as the crowd cheered. \"No fair!\" yelled Rena. \"This is sumo! You can't use your hands in sumo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Trianna growled and foamed at all three mouths before slobbering on the fat neko girl. Trianna then slapped Rena at the sides of her face with her fat breasts before wailing on her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Rena knew she had to fight dirty back and so she turned around and slapped all three of Trianna's heads with her tail before jumping up and slamming her butt into Trianna, knocking the cerberus into the electric barrier around the ring. The metal bra and thong on Trianna intensified the electric shock and made Trianna scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" said the announcer as she took an interest. \"Looks like our kitty cat has claws. But can she handle the dog fight?\" Trianna ran at Rena and then grabbed the neko girl to press against her belly. In retaliation, Rena bit Trianna in the navel before scratching the cerberus's second head in her scarred face. This makes Trianna bleed slightly before Rena pushes her breasts against the two heads on the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Trianna got mad and roared louder than ever. Trianna grabbed Rena by the shoulders and Rena grabbed her by the shoulders as they both tried to push each other into the electric ring. But at this point they were both equal in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smirk appeared on the announcer's face as she noticed the struggle. \"Just who among these tubby titans will yield? Who will triumph? The newcomer neko or the three headed monster mangler?\"</span></div></div>",

It will take a miracle to save this fat feline from the jaws of this triple terror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrianna snarled and suddenly, something came over Rena. It was as if a survival instinct had brought out her more primitive side and made her roar out loud. Rena hissed and scratched Trianna in her left and right heads. Trianna's two side heads covered their faces and screamed in pain and Rena had to thrust her stomach into Trianna's and caused Trianna's large gut and breast to smack her in all three of her faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrianna moved about dizzily and Rena jumped up to slam Trianna on the head. The cerberus girl struggled to get up, but combined with her own weight and the weight of the cat girl on top of her, Trianna couldn't move. All she could do was tear at Rena's thong and bite Rena on the behind. Rena shrieked and then had to jump up and drive Trianna into the ground to end the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was panting and her fat body was sweating. But the crowd around her cheered and the announcer flew down. \"It looks like the new kitten in the ring isn't so weak after all. Cats rule over this round, but remember Rena, you need to win 99 more battles to leave the club. Take her away boys.\" Several armored guards came in armed with tranquilizers and shot sedatives into Trianna as she tried to get up. It took twenty guards to get the cerberus girl out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rena was still panting as she felt her enlarged stomach. She just won a sumo match against a vicious cerberus. But was it still or just luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She saw that she had been shot in the butt with a sedative. She felt a little woozy and then she turned and saw more men shooting her with tranquilizer darts. \"Oh no.\" She said. With that, Rena fell down and collapsed to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she was brought back to her cell and was eating several large tunas. For some reason she was so hungry. She felt like she was getting bigger, especially in the hips. She was so starved she was even eating the bones. \"What could've gotten into me?\" she asked. \"I can't be this hungry. I'm a giant fat neko. I can't be...\" That's when some handlers tossed in more fish and the giant neko girl pounced on it. She was snarfing up every bit that came her way. As Rena was snarfing she heard grunting. She turned to her side to see that River, the ogopogo girl had been brought back to her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"River!\" yelled Rena. River held onto her arm and was rubbing it in pain. \"So newbie,\" said River. \"How was your first fight in the big ring?\" \"Well,\" says Rena as she wipes a chunk of fish off of her face. \"I went up against a large cerberus girl even bigger than me. It's a wonder I survived. Let alone one.\" River let out a chuckle but held her shoulder. \"I wish I could be so lucky. I went up against a big werebear girl who nearly tore my arm off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is sumo.\" Said Rena. However, River let out a scoff. \"Wake up kitty cat,\" she says. \"There's no fair play in this game. This is the White Apple Club, the underground ring.\" Rena handed a fish through the bars to River but River is hesitant. \"Come on River,\" said Rena. \"Eat up. Surely I don't need this fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dreaming,\" said River. \"That fish is laced with chemicals made to induce appetite. That's how you got so fat. You're getting larger right now.\" Rena looked down and saw that she was indeed getting bigger and gave a look of pure fear. \"We have got to get out of here,\" she said. \"Who knows how big we'll get now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, the wicked host of the White Apple tournament was counting the money made from the fight and smiled to herself. \"That new cat girl really paid off,\" she said. \"Nobody expected her to win. Now if I can build up that girl and win her the favor of the audience, it will pay off big when she comes crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host then pressed a button and revealed a pit trap with a snarling creature inside. It was too dark to see what kind of monster the creature was and it would appear that it was ten times bigger than Rena and appeared to be quite ferocious. The host lowered what appeared to be a large cow into the pit as the creature mooed loudly. The beast growled as the cow frantically tried to escape and was lowered into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster quickly devoured the cow as the host looked down and smiled as she took off her mask and rubbed her brow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon my champion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be facing a rival worthy of your abilities. The monster let out a growl and spat out the cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skull. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook out Rena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the host. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White Apple club has plans for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The monster in the pit reached out and then tried to snatch away the host of the club, but the host closes the pit quick and begins to inhale and exhale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gotta remember to be careful around her. But not as careful as Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The next day, Rena looked and saw that she had indeed gotten bigger. Now she was 12 feet tall and from the looks of it, she weighed a ton. Rena sighs and taps her oversized stomach to realize that what River said about the tainted food was all too true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver had gotten larger as well and was actually larger than Rena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did I tell you kitty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is our fate as monsters in this tournaments. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be stuck in this sadistic game until we die in the field.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when River\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cage is opened and the guards chained her up to take her off to her fight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming with us ogopogo girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d River let out a sigh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere we go. Hope I see you later Rena.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After River is taken away, Rena shuffles her bloated body up to a window on the top of the wall to her cage. She could see the arena and saw the Host ready to call the next fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone,\" she said. \"Time for the first fight of the day. In the red corner, we have a veteran monster of the White Apple club's most grizzly division, the ogopogo, River.\" River waddled forward as the crowd cheers and she panted as she lowered her head. Her massive weight was getting to her and Rena could see it. \"And now,\" said the host with an evil smile. \"Her challenger.\" Rena heard a loud roar and then saw River's opponent coming forward. The monster was an intimidating sight. She appeared to be a seventeen foot tall minotaur that had to weight at least 5 tons. The minotaur had teal fur with green spots and an udder bigger than her head with a monstrous belly and rear. Rena looked in pure fear at the minotaur as the minotaur giantess looked down at River and huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said the host. \"River's opponent will be the unbeatable Wow Cow, the biggest, meanest minotaur in the entire club. Will the ogopogo bring home the beef or is sea food on the menu tonight.\" Rena was in pure fear as she looked to see the fight beginning and both opponents charging at each other.</span></div></div>",

Rena stepped back rather clumsily with her fat body and fell flat on her enormous butt and that's when she saw her opponent come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposing monster was an enormous fifteen foot tall gargoyle girl. She had reddish purple skin and long flowing strawberry blonde hair. This gargoyle woman was wearing a bar and sumo thong made out of skills and was much bigger than Rena. She had thighs as thick as tree trunks and a stomach that had to be seven feet wide, to saw nothing of her H-cup breasts and watermelon sized butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle had glowing red eyes and she was drooling as she glared at Rena who was trembling. \"Oh, tough luck Rena,\" said the announcer. \"Today, right off the back you're gonna be fighting our champion, the unbeatable stone cold diva of the entire White Apple club, Melissa. When this gargoyle gets through with her prey, they don't know what hit them until its all too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa growled at Rena as she stomped on the ground and then roared as Rena was shaking her flabby self as she stepped back. Melissa stood up and held up her large bat like wings before she flew up in the air. \"Wait!\" yelled Rena. \"She's flying! There's no flying allowed in sumo.\" The patrons all laughed loudly as the announcer hovered overhead. \"In ordinary sumo, no. But anything can happen here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa roared and then flew down before slamming her stomach down and pinning Rena as Rena screamed. Melissa growled and held up her claws. \"One thousand battles,\" said the gargoyle as she licked Rena's chubby cheek. \"One thousand bloodbaths.\" Melissa flew upwards again and then flew down, slamming her belly into the smaller girl, covering Rena completely as Rena screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa got up and pulled up Rena by the hair, forcing Rena to bite the gargoyle and make her let go.\" Rena then scratched Melissa's oversized stomach but her claws could barely make a dent in Melissa's thick skin. \"Ooh,\" said the announcer. \"Looks like this kitty has some claws after all.

Weak from hunger, Rena stumbled under the bridge that would be her home for the next few days. With a herculean effort, Rena dragged herself into a comfortable position under the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena hadn't always been in this situation. In fact, it was a fairly recent thing. Four months ago, Rena had been a member of the mafia, and a rather successful and wealthy member at that. In fact, she was so successful, that the boss, a husky by the name of Antonio, told the other members of the mafia to, ahem, \"deal with\" her. One bumpy car ride and a bullet in each shin later, and Rena was no longer a problem. A little more meddling on the mafia's part, and Rena Westfall was declared legally dead on October 5th. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed like Rena would <i>actually</i> be dead in a few days if she wasn't miraculously saved somehow. The bullet wounds in her legs had gotten infected with something nasty, and Rena could almost feel her body shutting down. She supposed that it was the middle of February didn't help either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena curled up to go to sleep, possibly for the last time, she spotted something near her head. It looked like some kind of stone tablet with weird symbols on it. Rena didn't know what compelled her, but she tried to dig up the tablet. It took a long time, but as the sun's last rays touched the earth, she managed to pulled the tablet out of the hole she dug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you?\" Rena asked quietly. She rubbed her hand across the lower half of the tablet to wipe the dirt off. As she did so, the symbols on the tablet flashed briefly. Intrigued, Rena slid her hand across the tablet again, slower this time. As her hand passed over the center, the symbols lit up again. Curious, Rena placed her hand of the center of the tablet, lighting up the symbols once more. After a few seconds, a voice spoke in Rena's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rena Westfall, for awakening me from my slumber,\" the voice boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell? How do you know my name?\" Rena asked the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your name for I am Epsilon, the god of exchange,\" the voice answered. \"I know of anything that has been exchanged between two mortals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A god of exchange, huh?\" Rena said. \"Say, could you use your godly powers to get me out of this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can,\" Epsilon said. \"However, you must give me something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell? Why?\" Rena asked. \"I've been living like shit for the past four months! Can't you exchange that for a better life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot reverse an exchange by making its opposite,\" Epsilon said. \"Someone has already wished this upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena growled. \"Who? I'll fuck 'em up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also cannot reveal the creators of past exchanges,\" Epsilon said hurriedly. \"I can give you a better life, but you must exchange something you hold dearly if you wish to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena thought to herself. What did she have left that she held dearly? She didn't really care about her blanket or her clothing. She didn't have any jewelry. The only thing she did hold in high value was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offer my looks,\" Rena said. \"I've always been highly attached to my looks. They're the only thing I hold dearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Epsilon said. \"The exchange has been made. When you wake tomorrow, you will have a better life, but you will gradually lose what you consider to be your beauty over a course of nine months. When you wake, you will have lost ten percent of your beauty. Farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbols on the tablet stopped glowing, and the tablet faded away. Rena laid down on her side and closed her eyes on the last day of her old life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7.........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up in a large white bed. Blearily, she rubbed her eyes and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf... I think that deal worked,\" Rena noted. Lethargically, Rena stood up, and had to steady herself slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Rena noted. \"I'm off balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena fumbled her way into her bathroom. Rena stepped onto her scale and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. When she saw the number on the display, she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? I can't weigh that much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much does Rena weigh?</span></div></div>",

The place had an almost \"NERV-ish\" vibe to it, she thought, connecting the building to one of the latest anime she had seen. She almost expected a blue-haired girl with nearly blank eyes to pop out, but that was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a testing session for a new nutritional supplement! It's not like I'm signing up for military duty!\" she laughed, walking through the halls as she noted the door numbers. Stopping at number 777, she snickered. \"More like casino duty. Who sets up shop in a room whose number is a gaming standard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, she looked around, noting there was no one else inside. As her line of sight swept to a table, a voice popped up near her ear, asking \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around in shock, Rena came face to face with a blue-haired young man with a kind smile, dressed plainly in a white chef's tunic and neatly pressed blue slacks. His red eyes contrasted with his hair wildly, but still felt kind. He was wiry, with glasses and a gangly body, but he carried himself well. Topping off his appearance were a pair of dog ears poking out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...oh...yeah! I'm here for the supplement testing.\" Rena replied, smiling and letting the young man in. \"Is this the right room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! I'm Thiel. Thiel Fenrir. Unfortunately the other applicants all pulled out, so you'll be the only person tasting my dishes today, Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Westfall! Rena Westfall. It's nice to meet you, Mister Thiel.\" Rena said, walking into the room as Thiel flipped on the lights. \"So...the dog ears...you're a Dog-man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Werewolf. I just trained myself to be like this all the time. I think it's a bit cool, don't you?\" he asked, chuckling and making his way behind the kitchenette in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You look just like Inuyasha. Rena laughed, sitting down in front of the small kitchen while watching attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that alot. I don't think I look quite as good as him, though! I'd need to dye my hair white, get a red robe...too much hassle.\" Thiel answered, already busy cooking. \"So, why'd you sign up for this testing?</span></div></div>",

Besides, I heard a gourmet chef would be cooking, and I really wanted to try some great food.\" Rena said, smiling and watching Thiel cook away, a nice sized piece of fish sizzling away in a naked pan with a light coating of lemon zest and fresh ground white pepper. The light smells made her tail whip about and a barely audible purr escape her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me. I'm not quite gourmet, but I've got a few years of culinary school under my belt and I studied under two separate renowned chefs. I hear they've been working at a hotel recently.\" He replied, deftly slicing a green onion before adding it to the fish and wafting the scent towards his nostrils. Nodding in a satisfied fashion, he pulled out a tray of small, crispy bread slices from a small oven beneath the kitchenette and slid it towards Rena. \"Want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one, Rena took a small bite, her eyes lighting up in bliss from the nibble. \"Wow...what is this?\" she asked, finishing off the first one and nibbling on a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toasted bread with a sugar and lemon glaze. I always find crispy bread to be a good start to a good meal.\" Thiel replied, flipping the fish with a swift motion before pouring a glass of white wine for Rena, scooting the glass over to her and smiling. \"Just a heads up: The wine was bottled here and the supplement is inside. I just wanted you to know to avert any little questions about where it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Rena took a sip of the wine, watching Thiel scoot the fish onto a nearby plate and begin to deglaze the pan with another white wine, reducing it down to a pale sauce. Pouring it onto the fish, he smiled. \"One slice of Pollock with white sauce for the young lady.\" Thiel said, smiling and taking his hat off, sweeping into a bow. \"I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting on the light meal, Rena's eyes truly lit up as she ate. Easily the most delectable fish she had eaten, she still took her time out of respect. Before long, the fish was gone, the toast was eaten as a small dessert, and the glass of wine had been drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'm going to take a page from the two much more admirable writers that work on most of the other arcs in this story and give the two choices ahead of time with a bit of what I hope to see and how I think it should go as a bit of advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The supplement functions as a metabolizer, causing a larger portion of the food to be stored as fat, which means the project was funded by the military for people stationed up north. Rena is told that since she is the only person who signed up, she will have to stay at the facility for further testing. Of course, this also means more gourmet meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Nothing happens, apart from a slightly upset stomach from more upscale food than Rena is used to, and she returns home. The supplement is still there, though, and could possible cause something...odd to happen.)</span></div></div>",

I'm nowhere the skill level you say...\" he replied, setting the pans in the storage space beneath the kitchenette and pouring himself a glass of brandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Rena opened her mouth to reply only to have a cute little half second burp escape her lips, causing her to blush. Covering her mouth, she giggled. \"Pardon! But anyways, I think you're not giving yourself enough credit. That fish was so flaky and moist...and the sauce was just right...the toast was divine...\" Rena fawned before her eyes misted over with the memory of the delectable fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThiel simply laughed and drained his glass in one swig. Setting it back down, his eyebrows arched up in a curious glance. \"Umm...Rena? You don't feel...bloated in any way, do you?\" he asked, looking at her now ever so slightly cushy midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...why?\" Rena answered, looking down only to notice her slight paunch. \"Eh?! What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a complete success!\" a third voice stated, before the door opened and a stern faced, clean-cut military man clomped in. \"It looks like the Winter Survival Supplement is a resounding success. On behalf of your country, I, General Mid, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter Survival Supplement?\" Rena echoed, clearly confused. \"But I read it was going to be commercially available ? What is all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I only signed on because I thought this was going to help people.\" Thiel said, walking around to the front of the kitchenette and taking off his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be commercially available...to any country that can pay for it,\" General Mid said, smirking. \"And the price is going to be astronomical. Just think of the potential of a food additive that can instantly metabolize a layer of fat, giving the consumer a more insulated body for the Arctic. Or imagine a supply of food laced with this for one of our own spies placed in a freezing country! Other nations will TRIP over each other in order to get a piece of the pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what this is for? Greed and espionage?\" Rena cried in disbelief, a hand on her pudgy midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Westfall...making it sound like that is so crude. I like to think of it as...good wartime business.\" Mid replied, his eyes showing his insincerity. \"Now then...on to business. Miss Westfall, as the only one who signed on to this project, you will be held here for further testing. Any personal effects you wish for can be secured and brought here. My guess is that the full testing cycle will take about four months. You will not be returned to your former shape, and if you refuse you will be confined as a threat to security and forced to undergo the testing. We hope it will not come to that, but if necessary we will travel down that path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's mouth fell open in disbelief, her whole body numb. Thiel spoke up, though, asking, \"What if I offered to prepare Rena's meals? Would that be acceptable? I can't stand the thought of this girl being fed rations when she's already being practically forced to take all of this. I would ask for no compensation, apart from accommodations here in order to supervise Miss Westfall myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Mid nodded, his face unreadable. \"Of course. Better a chef preparing her meals than having to waste our own on her.\" he replied, the smirk back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her head, her eyes wide. \"Wait...this isn't fair! You lured me into this!\" she cried, tears in her eyes. \"I can't just drop my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already been done. All your connections to the world have been severed, and your house is ready to be sold. After the testing, you will receive the funds from the sale, and you will be given an apartment that will be paid for by the military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena slumped back in disbelief, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Rena accepts, and it turns out her stay may be pleasant, as she has access to anything she would want, including any entertainment she desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Same as the first, except it turns out that her room will only be allowed what she wants from home, though a large bed is already in place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm just doing what Anonymous One asked me to do)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Rena slowly nodded her head, her eyes coming back into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...just...can we keep the scientists to a minimum? I know I'm just a test subject, but I don't want to have to wake up every day and know right away I am.\" she said, sitting up properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I may be firm, but I would never invade a lady's privacy.\" General Mid replied, standing aside and motioning towards the door. \"Now, if you'll follow me, I'll lead you to your quarters. Maybe your personal chef can whip something clean up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Rena stood and followed the General, Thiel following close behind as the three made their way deeper into the complex. Coming to an elevator, Mid bent down and performed a retinal scan, followed by a voice confirmation password, confirming his identity and allowing the three onto the elevator. Sinking down a half dozen floors, the trio walked out, Rena looking around in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...this is incredible!\" she said, keeping in step as she took in the polished steel walls and various labs around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree...it's going to be eerie staying here, though.\" Thiel chimed in, shivering at the cold sterile appearance of the floor. \"And for months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked back at him, stunned. \"Wait...you're going to be staying too?\" she asked as General Mid turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...I wonder where you got the idea that you'd be allowed to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't want your secrets getting out, do you?\" Thiel said slyly, his mouth curling into a grin. \"I might just spill a few if I'm not allowed to keep an eye out to see if Rena is being properly taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, Mid turned back and resumed walking while Rena smiled gratefully. \"Thanks...I'd have gone crazy if all I had to talk to were scientists and military men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, Rena.\" Thiel assured, walking alongside Rena now. \"It's the least I can do for someone who likes my cooking so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping outside a door, General Mid ushered Rena and Thiel in, following quickly and chuckling at their amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was enormous, easily taking up two floors on it's own. A large flatscreen TV sat at one end of the room, taking up a space equivalent to a single story from the floor up. A king size bed sat opposite it, along with a few chairs and a sofa. Game consoles lay around the TV, with beanbag chairs nearby. On the wall opposite the trio, a kitchen had been erected, a quartet of refrigerators and a trio of stoves in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this...this...\" Rena stammered, in awe of the luxury of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speechless, eh? We may be soulless, greedy, espionage maniacs, but we know how to treat a subject. Now, go on and get used to things. There's a communicator on the wall, and you can ring up anyone you need.\" Mid said, turning to go. \"Have fun, Miss Westfall and Mister Fenrir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Rena's stomach growls, and Thiel gets to work right away, whipping up a meal that Hiroyuki Sakai would be jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Rena figures it would be good to get some shuteye and then take everything in with a refreshed mind. Afterwards, she finds her hunger has been turned up five-fold, and Thiel is called to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I intended for Thiel to speak with someone about walling a section of the room off for him. If someone wants to take an option and branch him into the lab sleeping quarters, that is just as good.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One late summer evening, a young catgirl named Rena lay on her bed in her PJ's, a large storybook in her hands. The title read 'The tale of Herra Swordfang' one of her favourite story books. Smiling, the tiger striped catgirl read the book chapter after chapter, green eyes flipping from left to right as she read the book, despite knowing every verse off by heart, she smiled as she reached her favourite chapter, 'the battle of Ostarigan' where Herra did battle with the evil Demon King Raijoro, and his undead army with her own army of loyal amazonian warriors, the two sides suffering heavy casualties as their leaders went at each other ferociously attacks with enough power to create canyons being displayed by the two mighty warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was so well described that Rena could practically picture herself in it, imagining the fires of battle, the sounds of clanging metal, the screams of the vanquished and the vanquishers, and of course, the battle between the titans of the army, Raijoro and Herra fighting tooth and nail, attacks occasionally missing and hitting the armies instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book told that the battle raged for three whole days, then, as the ashen fog of war finally lifted, the surviving soldiers of both sides awoke to find that their mighty leaders had both vanished, the two most powerful beings in their world, gone without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oooh...what i wouldn't give for them to have made another book...\" she said, sighing as she put the book on her bedside table, getting up to go to the bathroom, taking out her toothbrush and toothpaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know what happened...\" she said, brushing her teeth, before yawning and walking back to her bed, getting under the covers and drifting off to sleep, unaware that she was being observed, by someone very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to know what happened eh? well...ask and you shall receive...\" the male said, smiling as he stared into a crystal ball, Rena's image held there, his purple, serpentine eyes filled with curiosity and reviere. Smiling, he clicked his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn't know it but at that moment Her entire house had been taken to an entirely different dimension, like it had never existed in the human world, the house appearing with her inside it in a strange world, with red grass, a strange purple sky, and a massive temple in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena slept till her alarm clock rang, slowly groaning and getting up, rubbing her eyes and stretching, joints in her back popping as she did, eliciting a gentle purr from the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...\" came a masculine voice from behind the girl, who promptly screamed, turning around to look at the intruder in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer green eyes widened at the sight of the invader, who sat on a chair by her bed, his long blonde hair covering his face partially, five distinctive bangs over his face, six small horn like spikes of hair on his head, his eyes a deep purple, with reptilian pupils staring at her with a predatory look. The man's gaze was set on her, a calm smile on his face as he sat relaxed before the catgirl, who was starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! what the hell are you doing in my house buddy?!\" She asked, eyes narrowed at the strange man, who proceeded to get up, standing a good head taller than her, shocking her with his muscular build and height, the smirk on his face remaining. \"Oh nothing really...just admiring the newest toy in my collection....\" he said, walking round the bed to her, standing right before the skinny feline with that same sinister smirk, his hand slowly reaching up and caressing her cheek. \"....after all...i have to make sure your comfortable...my pet...\" he said, grinning toothily, Rena looking confused at him, till she felt something suddenly appear around her neck, making her look down in horror, seeing a bright red leather collar with a license, possessing her name and weight engraved upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK! What thee F'#K!?\" she screamed, clutching at the collar and trying to remove it, before she looked back at the man standing before her, chuckling like he found the display amusing. \"w-whatever you've done...y-you better stop it or-\" she began, only to have the man lean in to her face, smiling. \" OR you'll what? call the cops?\" he asked, before laughing like a madman, making Rena shiver, and then, run, bolting from her bedroom, much to the man's amusement as he slowly walked after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you can run kitty, but there ain't no hiding from Raiju...\" he said, smiling as he followed the girl through her home, watching her make a break for the front door. \"heh, boy are you in for a shock kiddo....\" he said, as Rena flung the door open, freezing in shock as she saw that she was no longer in her sleepy neighbourhood, but in a foreign place, the red grass beneath her feet, the Purple clouded skies, the massive temple and mountain ranges, and, to Rena's shock,the animals, which were all obscenely fat, elephants wide as houses, tigers and lions waddling around with their bellies dragging the ground, it was ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" came the same frightening voice of her captor, who now stood behind her, leaning against the doorframe. Rena turned to the mysterious man named Raiju. \"W-What is this place...?\" she hesitated to ask. Raiju smiled, offering the girl a hand. \"my world of Abdel\" he said, smiling as Rea slowly took his hand, using his magic to take them and the house to a new area, seemingly within the temple Rena had seen, allowing her to realise just how massive it was, easily holding her two story house within it, along with several other buildings that Rena looked at with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...your gonna have to do a lot of explaining here....\" she said, looking to Raiju, who smirked. \"sure thing, however, you gotta do something in return.\" he said, before he held up a finger. \"now, i want you to know that I'm giving you a choice of knowing more...like you wanted...or going home and living with a lack of knowledge for the rest of your mortal life.\" he explained, making Rena arch a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hmm...uh...well...\" she began, biting her lip some as she wondered what to do, looking at Raiju, who offered his hand once more. \"if you seek more..be prepared for wherever the road leads you...and take my hand...\" he said, awaiting her answer stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked at his hand, slowly reaching out, just about to take the mans hand when a roar was heard, making both look up to one of the buildings in the Temple, a smaller temple, who's doors burst open, Rena gasping as a massive Sabre-Tooth-cat girl emerged, Massive in the sense that Rena thought she had to have weighed at least a ton, her entire frame laden with fat, her legs dainty at their feet, but quickly thickening into massive calves and even more into thighs and hips wider than Rena was tall, a massive round belly dominating the front of the woman's body, looking like it could hold Rena within it five times over, and the Sabre-cat's boobs were absolutely massive, hanging over her belly about half way, each mammary the size of a large boulder, perfectly round and perky, much like the rest of her, there was no flab, or even stretch marks on her body as she waddled towards them in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! don't take his hand!\" she yelled, making Rena look at her hand, which she had put in Raiju's from shock of seeing the massive woman, Raiju smiling a bit. \"too late Herra....\" he said, before quickly vanishing with Rena, making the Sabre-cat girl snarl in frustration.</span></div></div>",

It was Saturday; no work, no busy day ahead of her. <br>\r\nShe jumped out of her bed and opened her curtains. The sun was sighing brightly in the air, the birds flying merrily around, and strange men in hazard-suits were walking across her lawn...Wait, what!?<br>\r\nRena rubbed her eyes, not quite sure if she was just imagining this. But it was all real, regardless what she thought. Who were these strange men? Why were they dressed like that?<br>\r\nShe stormed out of her room, ready to bombard these men with questions, but when she opened the door she ran straight into some sort of strong plastic.<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" Rena exclaimed, touching the plastic.<br>\r\nThrough it she saw dozens of other men in hazard-suits, walking around, taking notes, doing scans with strange beeping devices.<br>\r\nRena's heart began to race. What on earth was going? Two men closest to her noticed her, and one man ran off somewhere while the other tried to calm her down, saying: \"Don't worry, madam, we'll explain everything to you when the doctor gets here.\"<br>\r\nAnd the doctor did come, a thin mouse dressed like his other peers for obvious reasons, holding a clipboard in his hands.<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see your awa-\" The doctor didn't finish his sentence before Rena began to yell at him, more in fear than anger.<br>\r\n\"What's going on here? You the hell are you people? Let me go, please!\"<br>\r\nBut the doctor shook his head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my dear, but we can't do that; it's much too dangerous. Your house has been quarantined from the rest of the neighborhood.\"<br>\r\nRena felt her blood run cold.<br>\r\n\"Q-quarantined? B-but why?\" she stuttered, placing her hands on the plastic seal.<br>\r\n\"Because of a virus, obviously,\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n\"Virus?\" she said outraged, \"But I clean my house everyday; how can there be viruses?\"<br>\r\n\"Simple: through this,\" the doctors gestured with his hand, and a container was brought forth.<br>\r\nInside Rena could see her water bottle she bought yesterday. It looked precisely the same, but she had to admit the water looked a bit yellow.<br>\r\n\"Apparently this bottle had a strange virus inside it. We have been tracking it for some time, but when we found it, it was already too late,\" the doctor explained.<br>\r\nRena began to sweat. She was infected by a virus. What would happen to her? Was she going to die? Or worse, turn into some kind of radioactive monster?<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out. \"What's gonna happen to me?\" She asked.<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at the bottle in the container for a while before he replied: \"Well, this virus is very odd, to be honest. It has the ability to clone fat-cells in your body.\"<br>\r\n\"Fat-cells?\" Rena asked, looking curiously at the doctor.<br>\r\n\"Yes, fat-cells,\" he confirmed.<br>\r\n\"So your basically saying that I'm just gonna fatten up?\"<br>\r\nThe doctor nodded.<br>\r\nOkay, that was strange. A virus that made people fat. Who knew! Personally Rena wouldn't mind to put some meat on her bones. She was a thin catgirl anyway, and some fat might give her a more attractive figure, but then she thought how her fat-cells in her body would continue multiplying, turning her into a grotesquely huge sack of fat.<br>\r\n\"Can you do anything to help me?\" she asked desperately.<br>\r\nThe doctor paused, deep in thought.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, miss,\" he said finally, \"We'll fix this problem. But for now you must be patient.\"<br>\r\nRena nodded in agreement </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a dark night in Rustymum, a city populated by the monsters of mythology and folklore. At the hospital, there was a weretiger girl named Rena who was just about to leave the Rustymum Community Hospital where she worked as a doctor. On her way out, she heard grunting and saw her boyfriend Kevin messing with a vending machine. Kevin also worked at the hospital as a doctor and was a somewhat portly yellow-skinned cyclops with medium length blonde hair. \u201cCome on,\u201d muttered Kevin. \u201cCome on. You trying to gyp me?!\u201d \u201cKevin,\u201d said Rena with a giggle. \u201cBe careful with that vending machine. That\u2019s a very easy way to break a finger.\u201d Kevin just gave a nervous laugh. \u201cCome on, Rena. I\u2019ll be with you once I unstick this chips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her head and went on ahead with a laugh. Rustymum was like any big city and it had its fair share of crime, which meant that it was not recommended that even monsters came out at night. However, Rena lived on a very quiet part of the city, so she wasn't at all worried in the least. \"Kevin eats way too much as it is. One of these days I'm going to force him to go on a diet. You don't see me gorging myself like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rena heard strange motions and turned around. \u201cHello?\u201d asked the young cat girl. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d As Rena turned around, she heard somebody creeping up behind her. \u201cKevin?\u201d she asks. \u201cKevin?\u201d It was there a large garbage can fell to the ground and made a loud noise. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Rena. It was at that moment, Rena felt a chill in the air. She turned around and gasped at the sight of a large man. It was too dark to tell what species of monster he was and he was wearing a Hannya mask that had a vertical blue stripe where the nose should\u2019ve been, black high tops with yellow socks a black tank top and black shorts with red highlights. Above all, he was carrying a large tennis racket that he rose into the air. \u201cLong ago,\u201d muttered the man in a distorted voice. \u201c21st century.\u201d With that, the man in the mask brought down the tennis racket and Rena screamed. She tried to kick the stranger in the groin in an attempt to hold him back, but the assault had no effect on him as he whacked Rena to the ground with the racket and Rena let out a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rena came to, she was at the hospital and let out a moan as she felt her head. She realized it had been bandaged and then looked up to see Kevin looming over her, worry in his big round eye. \u201cRena?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, thank Heavens you\u2019re alright.\u201d \u201cKevin?\u201d asked Rena weakly. \u201cOw! What happened? The last thing I remember was seeing a large man and then he... he attacked me.\u201d Kevin gave a look of worry. \u201cFrom the look of the wound, he was only aiming to wound, not kill. It wasn\u2019t a particularly strong weapon from the looks of it.\u201d Rena just felt more head pain and thought again about the man who attacked her before she let out a scream. \u201cRena,\u201d said Kevin. \u201cCalm down. You need rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena then heard a loud pounding noise and two enormous monster women entered the room, both of them were dressed like policewomen. The first of them was an enormous copper-brown furred minotaur resembling a buffalo with long bluish black hair reaching to her large rear. She was large all over but her E cup breasts and udder put the rest of her body to shame. She was wearing a black tanktop with a red jacket and blue jeans as well as a police badge. Her partner was an equally huge silver-skinned werehippopotamus woman with a tattoo of a hippo\u2019s footprint over her right eye. She had long orange-red hair that was worn in a ponytail and compared to her partner, she was much more bottom heavy. She wore a blue traditional policewoman\u2019s outfit with a skirt and a hat. Both women were so tall that they had to duck to get into Rena\u2019s hospital room and each woman was so wide that they had to go in one at a time to avoid getting stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena Bengal?\u201d asked the minotaur woman. Rena gulped as she looked up at the two women who had to be twice as tall as Kevin. \u201cYes,\u201d said Rena. \u201cTh-That\u2019s me.\u201d The minotaur and werehippo policewomen flashed their badges at Rena and the werehippo gave a snort. \u201cDetectives Janine Yancy and Ellen Xavan. We\u2019ve come to ask you questions about the alleged assailant. What species of monster was he?\u201d Rena saw the grimace on the werehippo cop\u2019s face and was filled with fear. She tried to remember but instead, grabbed hold of her head and groaned. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Rena. \u201cHe wore a Hannya mask. But from what I saw, he was wearing hi-tops and a tank top. He attacked me with a tennis racket. Then he said \"Long Ago, 21st Century\".\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine gave a snort and showed her intimidating hippo teeth before speaking. \u201cA tennis racket as a weapon? Are you ****ing kidding me.\u201d However, Ellen gave a snort and stepped forward, her bovine form looming over Rena. \u201cKeep an open mind, Janine,\u201d she said. \u201cStranger things can happen. Ms. Bengal, I can assure you, that this villain will be caught.\u201d With that, Ellen and Janine waddled out of the hospital room, in the process, Janine accidentally damaged a vending machine with her large behind. Rena begun to sweat as Kevin held her hand. \"I <i>am</i> worried.\" For the next few days until she was released from the hospital, Rena had nightmares about the assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day that Rena was released, Kevin was walking her out of the hospital. \"I never thought you'd come to work as a <i>patient</i>, Rena,\" the cyclops said. \"Are you feeling alright now.\" Rena gave a sigh. \"I guess.\" The tiger girl said. As they both walked down the street, the couple passed by a TV shop. On the news was a lizard woman resembling a dinosaur with a large spike on her nose and jagged teeth. \"It has been three days since a young doctor from the Rustymum Community Hospital was relentlessly attacked by a mysterious masked man dressed for a tennis match. The assailant, known by the press as Johnny Hightop has not been seen since and it is unknown when and who he will strike next.\" Upon hearing that news report, Rena shivered in fear as Kevin grabbed her by the shoulders. \"Come on, Rena,\" the cyclops said to his girlfriend. \"I know a place you can go to forget about this unpleasantness.\" Rena nodded her head as Kevin walked her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, in a police car, Janine was driving as Ellen was stuffing her face with donuts. \"Is that <i>really</i> what they're calling him?\" asked Janine. \"They have to call him something, Janine. We have no idea of his real name or species. Long ago, 21st Century.\" \"Sounds like the last lyrics of a Japanese superhero show,\" said Janine as she came to a red light and bit into a Boston cream donut. \"But what we do know is that it's a race against time to stop this lunatic before he strikes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ellen and Janine were busy looking for Johnny Hightop, Kevin took Janine to a restaurant atop a mountain overlooking Rustymum. It was a pancake house from the looks of it and there was a mascot of a tiger without stripes on the outside. \"Black Flapjack's?\" asked Rena. Kevin nodded his head. \"This is where I usually go to eat away what's bothering me. Some pancakes should put you in a better mood.\" Rena nodded her head and then went inside. At the front table of the pancake house was a balding male yeti with a hunched back and a gold fang sticking out of his mouth on the opposite side of a healthy fang. \"Kevin,\" said the yeti. \"I haven't seen you in days.\" Kevin gave a smile. \"This time I brought my girlfriend with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yeti noticed Rena and nodded his head. \"And what can I get for you both.\" Kevin smiled. \"I'll take the usual.\" The yeti then turned to face Rena. \"And for the lady?\" Rena looked over the menu but then she gasped. She remembered her attack from Johnny Hightop and begun to sweat. She remembered those words he said to her. \u201cLong ago.\u201d Rena screamed and tore the menu in half. \u201cJust get me a double order of what he\u2019s having!\u201d Both Ivan and the proprietor looked in worry. However, soon Kevin and Rena received their orders. Ivan\u2019s order consisted of three stacks of blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon while Rena was having twice as much food. Kevin was about to take the first bite when he turned and gasped because Rena was already half-way done with her meal. She was eating at a rapid speed out of stress and even screamed as she choked down some blueberry pancakes slathered in syrup. All she could do at this point was eat away her fear.</span></div></div>",

Rena!?\u201d Rena had finished her pancakes and then stuffed her face with bacon right before she yelled at the proprietor with her mouth still full. \u201cProprietor!\u201d yelled Rena. \u201cAnother round over here!\u201d The yeti gave Rena another round of pancakes that she started to dig into as she begun to sweat heavily. \u201cRena?\u201d asked Ivan. \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d Rena then begun to gag before she drank some milk to stop her choking. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Kevin,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me. I-I...\u201d Rena then gasped and looked back because she thought she saw the shadow of Johnny Hightop. Rena turned and saw nothing and then she nibbled on a piece of bacon as her eyes all but bulged out of her head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat so fast,\u201d warned Kevin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get bloated.\u201d Unfortunately, Rena was too stressed out to pay any heed or worry about her waistline. She was already starting to develop a slight bulge in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Janine and Ellen had returned to the scene where Rena was attacked by Johnny Hightop. Ellen was looking down at a footprint left behind by the assailant\u2019s sneakers. It was made from Rena\u2019s blood from the attack and spell out the word \u201cCritan\u201d. The minotaur looked up at her werehippo partner before speaking. \u201cSize 16,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a rather large monster species.\u201d Janine lifted her mountainous belly to get a good look at her bare pachyderm feet and then looked at Ellen\u2019s hooves. \u201cWell, whatever he is, he\u2019s definitely not a werehippo or a minotaur. What does it say, Ellen?\u201d \u201cCritan. It\u2019s a very popular sports brand. Among monsters that actually wear shoes that is. If memory serves, there are only three stores in Rustymum that sell Critan Sporting Goods. Come on, Janine. We have no time to lose.\u201d With that, both obese ungulate-based policewomen left to find anything to be used to find out Johnny Hightop\u2019s identity. However, as they were driving towards the first sports store, somebody passed them at rapid speed, forcing Janine to stomp on the brakes as Ellen spilt hot coffee onto her udder and screamed in pain. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine gave a snort and gave chase after that driver. \u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered. \u201cA manic driver. Doesn\u2019t this moron know that we have better things to do than to chase speeders? I\u2019m a detective. This isn\u2019t my job.\u201d Janine turned the siren on to signal to the speeder to pull over. Once the car had pulled over, Janine and Ellen got out, Ellen holding her legs together in pain from the coffee burning her udder. Janine banged on the roof of the speeder\u2019s car and showed her fangs. \u201cOpen up, you chowderhead! Don\u2019t you realize how fast you were going!\u201d Out of the car came another female monster who the same height as Rena. From the looks of it, she was the anchorwoman from the television. She was a teal-skinned and blue-striped lizardwoman whose body shape resembled that of a velociraptor but with a ceratosaurus\u2019s horn on her nose.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the lizard giantess. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize who I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was surprised to see the anchorwoman as she was wiping coffee off of her pants. \u201cBlue Newworld,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cChannel 5 news.\u201d Janine just gave a snort and the hippo woman went through her notepad to write a speeding ticket. \u201cNewscaster or not, nobody is above the law.\u201d However, Blue seemed unconcerned about receiving a speeding ticket in the least and smiled. \u201cIt will be worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, Detectives, tell me, do you have any leads in the Johnny Hightop case.\u201d \u201cYou expect us to tell you that?\u201d asked Janine indignantly. \u201cA reporter. You\u2019re just going to blab it and then we\u2019ll be back to square one.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already at square one, Janine,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what species of monster, Johnny Hightop is. The only thing that we have to go by is the brand of shoe that he wears.\u201d Blue gave a smile. \u201cInteresting,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I see the brand?\u201d Janine just stuck the speeding ticket in Blue\u2019s mouth before she and Ellen got back in their patrol carl and drove away. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Blue. \u201cInquiring minds want to know! There\u2019s still such a thing as freedom of speech!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue gave a pout and then started to drive away, closely following Ellen and Janine. \u201cThis is going to be the scoop of the year,\u201d said the newscaster to herself. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019m missing a chance to get the dirt on Rustymum\u2019s own version of Jack the Ripper. I might even score a Pulitzer prize.\u201d But before Blue could get any farther, she was forced to step on the brakes as she reached a red traffic light. Blue gave a slight growl as Ellen and Janine drove away. She hissed and pounded the steering wheel, making the horn go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanine and Ellen at this point had reached the first stop on their list. It was a shop called Asgard Sports and the manager was a male werewolf with pitch white fur and graying hair who wore a pair of glasses and had blue tattoos over his body. While Janine and Ellen were getting ready to interrogate the manager, Blue was outside the store eavesdropping. \"Size 16?\" asked the manager. \"We only carry up to size 14, Detective.\" \"That being said,\" said Ellen. \"Did a particularly large monster come in here? At least 8' high.\" The werewolf saw that he was only up to both policewomen's waists. \"Nope,\" said the wolf man. \"The biggest monsters we've seen in here are you two. However, there's a shop on the other side of town called David Jones's. The stock boy is a yeti. They also sell Critan brand.\" Janine gave a snort as she wrote down notes. Outside, Blue was doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the store trying on a pair of shoes was another monster who was dressed as an ice skater. From the looks of it, she was a female gargoyle with purple red skin and long red hair reaching down to her rear. She had several small horns on her forehead and a pair of snake-like green eyes. She was speaking to an employee who from the looks of it, was a teenage gremlin boy who didn't even come up to her knee. \"I would've never expected to see a gargoyle in a shoe store.\" \"Well,\" said the gargoyle girl. \"Gargoyles also don't like their talons to touch the cold, cold ice. Now. Do you have anything in a size 15?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, back at her apartment, Rena was nervously eating cookies as she was reading a newspaper article. \u201cWho is Johnny Hightop?\u201d Rena ate cookie after cookie as she read the paper. She could even swear that she saw the artist\u2019s rendering of Johnny Hightop blink before staring at her menacingly. She then heard the door turn and gasped before she swallowed an entire gallon of milk. She picked up an umbrella from the coat rack and held it up before she advanced to the door that was opening. Rena saw a shadow coming and imagined it as the evil shadow of the nefarious Johnny Hightop and begun to sweat. She remembered what Johnny Hightop said to her. \u201cLong ago, 21st Century!\u201d In that instance, Rena panicked and was about to bring down the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could, the figure held out his hands. \u201cWait!\u201d he yelled. Rena stopped herself just before she was about to hit the man over the head. She was very close to hitting Kevin over the head as he walked inside. Rena breathed out a sigh of relief. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cKevin. Oh, dammit Kevin. I could\u2019ve rung your bell.\u201d The cyclops gave a sigh of relief. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t. You must\u2019ve thought I was Johnny Hightop.\u201d Rena shivered. \u201cDon\u2019t even joke about it. That maniac is still out there.\u201d Rena walked away as Kevin focused his single eye on her rear end that looked like it had gotten slightly bigger. He looked in concern. \u201cRena?\u201d the cyclops asked his girlfriend. \u201cHave you been overeating. You\u2019re starting to look a little... pudgy.\u201d Rena turned her head and then hissed. \u201cWell, when was the last time YOU saw your toes, Kevin.\u201d kevin wisely shut up as Rena looked to the window and saw rain coming down. The drip of water was in a shape that resembled Johnny Hightop to Rena and it filled her with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, it was growing dark and Ellen and Janine were driving away from Asgard Sports. The rain was coming down so heavily that they didn't know that they were being followed by Blue Newworld in her car. \u201cDang,\u201d said Blue. \u201cAn evil night. Perfect for Johnny Hightop. I almost wish I\u2019d run into him. Boy would that be a scoop.\u201d Blue was forced to stop her car as she approached another red light. She grumbled to herself and took the opportunity to adjust her makeup. But as she looked into the mirror, she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight behind Blue was Johnny Hightop wearing a dark green raincoat and holding up an umbrella. He stared at her menacingly and forced her to drive off the road as he swung his umbrella and the lizard woman was forced to stop. There was a loud honking from the horn and Johnny Hightop disappeared just as the sound of sirens filled the air...</span></div></div>",

But all is not well with her father, Lord Murray, who is desperately trying to find his daughter a good suitor, who will bring forth a heir that will proclaim all his possessions the day he dies. But, alas, all the wealthy men of the county revises his offer, saying, although she is fair, that Rena is far to bony and will not be able to give birth to children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Lord Murray would have to result to drastic measures or his daughter would have to change her eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Lord Murray (resulting to drastic measures now) decides to go and seek help at a self-proclaimed sorcerer, who gives him a special potion that will give Rena the necessary qualities to attract a suitor and survive childbirth. Excited, Murray slips the potion into Rena's tee. The following morning she wakes up with much larger hips, breasts, and a sturdier body. Her father is thrilled and invites many important and wealthy men to a ball, so that they can swoon over Rena, and then, hopefully, Lord Murray can find a few marriage proposals. But little does he know that the potion had a few tweaks that needed to be sorted out, resulting in Rena gaining weight during the feast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Rena's father persuades her to give up her healthy lifestyle and start eating more fattening food that might put some meat on her bones.

Today was Monday, the first day of the work week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSluggishly Rena roused from her single bed, dragging her feet over the floor of her apartment, heading towards her small bathroom. Pulling off her night shirt and letting her panties fall to the ground, Rena climbed into the shower, adjusting the flow of water until the heat was just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm water soaking her body was helping the catgirl to wake up quicker. After washing her fur and hair and brushing her teeth, Rena climbed out of the shower, feeling fresh and awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping a towel around herself, she exited her bathroom. But when she left the small space, Rena stopped for a few moments to survey her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a cheap complex in a urban area, the catgirl's apartment was not much. With both her kitchen and bedroom crammed in one room, there was scarce enough space for Rena to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was all she could afford, for the rent was low and it was close to her job. She needed every penny to survive in the big city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen spite this, the catgirl did her best to make it a comfortable home, keeping it tidy and doing some touch-ups when she moved in, like repainting her walls neatly a bright yellow color, replacing broken floorboards, and nailing up a few picture frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting herself dressed in a pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath, her work uniform, she ate a breakfast of cereal to start her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking that all the windows were properly closed, for the area had problems with burglaries, Rena left her apartment, locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason the hallways of the complex always had a sharp smell to it, like a janitor used far too much bleach. It was irritating her, but Rena at least had to admit that it was better than the terrible, musky scent of filth. It showed that the landlord actually cared about the residence staying here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Rena unchained her bike, climbed on, and rode off to work. Jackson's Mart was a supermarket where she was employed, sorting boxes in the back of the store, helping costumers, putting stray shopping carts back in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClocking in at 7:25, Rena discovered that her first job for today was to help unload a truck that just delivered a shipment of supplies. It was luckily not heavy, and Rena could carry it with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sorting out a bunch of boxes, stacking them neatly on each other, when a familiar, but unwelcome, face appeared between the cardboard pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Rena,\" said Marty, a tall, but slightly overweight, fox, who had the typical orange and white colored fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis overalls were unfastened at one button, making the top half hang downwards, exposing his yellow shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" asked Rena with disinterest, packing a box before his face, obscuring his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" he said, appearing around the corner of the stacked boxes, \"Just wanna ask you out on a date, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena rolled her eyes. She had no idea why some men thought she was attractive. Sure she had a pretty face, but her scrawny body and small breasts usually turned them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you want,\" she said, giving him a sharp glare, \"You only want to use me as a one night stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like that!\" he said, looking hurt, but she could see straight through his act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the bull, Marty,\" Rena said with a sigh, \"Everyone around here knows your little games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's a no then?\" he asked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Definitely,\" she answered, walking away from him and leaving the back store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty did not bother her further that day, which relieved her greatly. She had no idea how the clumsy idiot could manage to sleep with dozens of female employees. He was so bombastic, so annoying, so spoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was just glad that she didn't have to deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midday, a few hours before the catgirl could leave and go home. Currently she was struggling to lead a train of shopping carts when Jessica, a rather chubby catgirl with brown fur, appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with that,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Rena, glad that someone could take some of the weight she was pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your day?\" Jessica asked, giving her a cheery smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough,\" Rena said, \"I had to sort out a thousand boxes this morning, handle a bitchy client, and nearly got ran over by a car when I was helping a elderly lady carry her bags to the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jessica said slowly, a little taken aback, \"Anyway, any thing else? I saw you being checked out by someone today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Marty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was a costumer, a lion, I think, and boy was he a stud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the stalls where the shopping carts were held and pushed the train in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still he won't come over and talk to me,\" said Rena sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I know why, \" said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get some meat on your bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rena said, a little bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, \"No offense, but you look like someone suffering from anorexia. If you got a little fatter I'm sure that you'll attract some handsome guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could,\" Rena said, \"But there's one problem: I don't know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll through the the catgirl's life, Rena had been very slim. She owed it much to her high metabolism. Even in her adulthood she filled out little, but the fault also went to her diet and regular exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was time to let herself go a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you struggle to gain weight,\" Jessica offered, \"You can come around my apartment. I'll fix you up a shake that would help you gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Rena, \"I'll drop by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did she know that that would not be necessary, that the universe, for some reason us mortals could not dare fathom, would make her gain weight from seemingly nowhere.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few moments later there was the sound of feet shuffling across wooden flooring, and then the door swung open, revealing it to be Jessica clothed in a blue dress, who's mellow expression turned into one of delight the instant she saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena!\" she chirped, throwing her arms around the catgirl, \"I'm so glad you could make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had little choice,\" she said, \"If I want to learn how to gain weight, I have to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed you should,\" Jessica said with grin, inviting her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long hallway extended from the door to the end of the house, three doors on the right leading to the main bedroom, bathroom, living room, while the left to the spare bedroom and kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavenly smell of cooked food was drifting through the air, which sent Rena's stomach growling. She knew who was making dinner tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey!\" Jessica called, \"Rena's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the kitchen came a crash followed by a curse before a cheetah lean, tall cheetah appeared dressed in tank top and baggy pants, wringing his wet hands dry with a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena!\" he exclaimed with a smile, \"It's so good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you too, Ronnie,\" said the catgirl, hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's for dinner?\" she asked, stepping into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, really,\" answered Ronnie, \"Just some baked fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much?\" Rena said, taking a seat at the kitchen's table, which was set with salads, plates, forks, knives, and glasses. \"Your food is amazing. You really got a talent for it. I'm surprised you didn't become a cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie grinned, feeling a little bit embarrassed about the praise. \"It's not that great,\" he said, pulling out the fish from the oven, \"It's more of a hobby, really. I won't use it as a profession. Besides, I'm doing well as a electrician.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we would do great if you decided to start your own cooking show,\" said Jessica, also taking a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, dear,\" said Ronnie, bringing the food to the table, plumes of steam drifting from it, \"We're not struggling that bad. We got food on the table and enough money to pay off the bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we would have a house on a hill and enough money to buy a new car if you just started with your career,\" Jessica retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie's response was only a eye roll while he cut up the fish in neat portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Rena received from Jessica what she originally came there for: a box with the title \"gaining shake\" on it, filled with a large bottle and a package containing chocolate-flavored, brown powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this'll work?\" Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positively,\" said Jessica, \"I used it for a while, and as you can see it worked perfectly well on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stand witness to that,\" said Ronnie, groping the brown catgirl's large butt cheek on his way out from the kitchen, causing his wife to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could not help but smile; they were such a cute couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already dark when Jessica waved her friend away, watching how she dwindled in size the further she rode, the box she gave her on a basket on the back of her bike. She could not wait to see how much her friend gains over the weekend.</span></div></div>",

There was a good chance of rain this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a great day at work, honey,\" Ronnie called from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, dear,\" Jessica said back, closing the door, walking towards the store as he drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClocking in at 6:50, she took her place behind a cashier and began ticking off products, wondering how Rena was doing with her weight gain, but Jessica knew that she would arrive at least half an hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed. The catgirl just finished helping a customer when to her surprise, and irritation, Marty appear, cutting in line before a elderly women, wearing a stupid grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the women cried out, \"I was first in line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a sec here, okay,\" the fox said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the women did not wait. \"Rude,\" she mumbled, walking off to stand in another line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marty, what do you want?\" Jessica said, \"Shouldn't you be working or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" he said, \"I'm on my lunch break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always on a lunch break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" he continued, \"I want to thank you on the excellent job you did on Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What job?\" she asked, looking at him suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one where you made her sexier,\" he said, his grin growing wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it clicked. \"How did you know?\" Jessica asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena told me, of course,\" he said, \"Though, she's still playing hard-to-get with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's here?\" Jessica exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" answered Marty, gesturing with his thumb, \"She's in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was alarmed by how she lost track of time. \"Make yourself useful,\" she said, suddenly pulling Marty, with a surprising amount of strength, over the the counter and plopping him down on the seat, \"Man my station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hurried off before he could abject. With a snort, Marty made an attempt to leave, but a shadow fell over him. Turning around, he saw that it belonged to a burly bear that loomed over him, glaring, his huge hands filled with dozens of products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to let me pay for this?\" he said, his question sounding more like a freight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty felt a cold sweat breaking out and he smiled nervously. \"S-sure,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Rena gained a little weight would have been a understatement. She looked like a whole different catgirl! With her voluptuous body, large breasts, thick thighs and ass, features that strained her overalls every time she bent or reached for something, she turned the heads of costumers and employees alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible!\" Jessica thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gainer shake was nothing special, and at best it could, if one drank it frequently, allow you to gain at least five pounds in two days' timing. The tiger-striped catgirl looked like she gained more than twenty. Something wasn't right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena,\" she called, sounding far more astounded than she intended to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at what she was doing, which was sorting out boxes as usual, Rena turned around, her breasts swaying in the momentum, and Jessica realized that she was not wearing any clothing, not even a bra, underneath her uniform, exposing a questionable amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, morning, Jessica,\" she greeted happily, \"Notice anything different today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proudly struck a pose, placing one hand on her hip and puffing out her chest, which was a bad move for Rena's buttons on her shoulders suddenly unfastened. The torso part of the overalls flopped downwards and the catgirl's large, tender breasts, each dotted with a pink, erect nipple, spilled forward, bouncing in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather fortunate that no one was around to witness what happened, for Jessica was sure they would have fainted, blood leaking from their noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!\" Rena cried, gathering up her boobs, fastening up her buttons, blushing, \"Didn't count on that happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you didn't,\" Jessica said, still struggling to come over her disbelief, \"I see that my...shake worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, isn't it amazing?\" Rena said, running one hand over her thigh while another over her breast, \"You don't have any more of it, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Jessica said, \"But, Rena, I thing something's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly cut off when there was a loud beeping noise coming from Rena's wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8:15,\" Rena said, looking at her watch, \"I promised to help Mary restock the shelves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jessica could say anything more, Rena turned around and left, leaving the brown catgirl to marvel at what happened to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was having the best day of her life! Not even the confrontation with Marty earlier that morning, or her uncomfortably tight clothing, or even the rain that caught her on the way to work, ruined it. She did not know what was in that shake Jessica gave her, for she woke up every morning over the weekend bigger, but she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, even though her gorgeous body turned heads, Rena found that no man had come up to talk to her so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering the reason why, stacking shelves alone, for Mary, a badger, had ran off to the back of the store for more supplies, a deep, smooth voice, which sounded eerily similar to a singing Barry White, spoke: \"Well, hello there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly startled, Rena turned around and saw a tall, very muscular brown bull behinds her, large horns sticking from the side of his head, curving at the tip. He wore a red shirt, blue shorts, a dark glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen spite his intimidating demeanor, he was smiling friendly at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this was her chance to show off and impress someone, she struck a pose but avoided to puff out her chest this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello to you too,\" Rena responded, batting her eye lashes, \"My name's Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And mine's Anderson,\" he said, \"I was watching you and I can't help but notice that your figure is exactly what a need for my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what business would that be?\" Rena asked, more curious than suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he began, taking off his glasses, exposing his sharp blue eyes, \"I'm the manager of a club a few blocks away. It's one of those typical places, you know: food, drinks, karaoke. But the one thing that keeps bringing costumers back is my waitresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all sexy, like me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to be one of them, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Rena, \"But how much are you paying me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred dollars a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's eyes grew wide with surprise; that was at least thrice the amount her lousy job was paying her per week. And all she had to do was deliver people's food and beverages. She did a little waitering in her high school years for pocket money, so she had a little experience. Rena could not miss this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" Rena said, \"I'll take it. When do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Friday,\" he said, \"Though I must inform you about some of the Ts and Cs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, and what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he began again, rubbing his neck, \"I acquire my employees to wear uniforms, and they could be a little skimpy for some, but I assure you that you won't be too naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement made Rena pause. Walking around half-nude was not what she was expecting. But at the same time, she would be able to show off her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll still take it,\" Rena said, grinning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rena, with a platter stacked with a few alcoholic drinks, maneuvered herself past party goers, who were either standing idle and talking to one another or dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dame thing,\" Rena said to herself, pulling at her clothing, \"Keeps digging into my rear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Anderson said that the clothing was skimpy, he was not kidding: the body was shaped like a swimsuit, black in color, which had a nasty habit to ride up on her, with transparent legging and sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in high heels were also tough, Rena discovered. They demanded a good balance and got painful if you wore it for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was a small amount she had to repay to what she receiving. After she fulfilled her order, she went to sit down at the bar table, taking off her shoe and rubbing her swollen foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" came a familiar, \"Stuff can kill your ankles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked up and saw Sapphire, a petite fox with white fur, walking towards her. Like all Anderson's employees, she was of course very curvy, supporting a well-shaped rump and large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome might say she's attractive, but Rena thought she was more cute due to her size; if the catgirl stood she would tower over Sapphire by at least a head and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they're not as bad as these uniforms,\" Rena said, ones again tucking at it, \"Keeps riding up on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happens if you take a size too small,\" Sapphire said, taking a seat next to Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't!\" Rena exclaimed, \"Or at least I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Sapphire mentioned it, Rena's uniform had fitted her very well earlier; now it was hugging her frame, causing an endless amount of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Rena continued, \"It at least has its up sides: I don't have to wear a bra anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wearing bra!\" Sapphire said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With clothing this tight you don't need 'em,\" Rena said, fingering one of her ample breasts, \"Though, the fabric is causing my nipples to go erect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your at least wearing panties,\" Sapphire said, \"I know some workers around here don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you two get back to work?\" someone said behind them, causing Rena to jump in fright, but the white fox wasn't startled; she was apparently used to this by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson was the club's bartender, a well-built panther with a cocky attitude that reminded Rena of Marty; but unlike the fox, Jackson was not the least bit annoying, knowing when to stop before his jokes became unfunny or his flirting turned into harassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute,\" Sapphire said, \"I'm just catching my breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better catch it fast,\" Jackson said, \"You don't want the boss to find you lazing around on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we shouldn't,\" Rena said, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to walk off when she suddenly felt a strange pressure build up in her stomach, which sent it gurgling and rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to the bathroom to freshen-up,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely empty when Rena came barging in, but as soon as she did so the pressure in her stomach finished, only to be replaced by a lightheaded feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wobbled over to the nearest tap, opening one and splashing her face. The cool water helped a little, but when Rena lifted her head and examined herself in the mirror did she notice something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face seemed a little pudgy, like it was losing its sharp features. She turned her head side to side, studying her jowls and chin. Yup, the looked pudgy alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was suddenly cut off when she felt the strange pressure returning, this time focusing itself on her breasts. She looked dow and witnessed with growing astonishment her own breasts growing larger and larger, straining her uniform so badly that it caused her tender mounts to explode from its confines, spilling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" she tried to say, but was cut short when loud ripping sounds caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind her, she saw her hips, legs and ass expand, causing large tears to form, exposing her pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly rumbled again, and it began to advance forward, the soft tissue being restrained tightly, causing her to get a round belly the size of a yoga-ball, though Rena could see that her bellybutton was deep and cavernous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, the Rena looked back at the mirror and beheld a corpulent catgirl, with a round, moon face, two chins, and chubby cheeks. Her breasts had far surpassed the size of DD's and were now on the way to F-cups (though they still stayed surprisingly perky). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, causing her fat to jiggle and her belly to sway, Rena saw that her ass was still bubble-shaped and firm instead of Square and sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rena had a scale with her she would have discovered that she gained at least a hundred pounds in a few minutes, making her weigh at least 280 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl didn't know what happened to her, but she could not risk letting anyone see her in such a state, especially so ill dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for a exit, Rena saw the window just above the bathroom stalls. If she was thinner she could have escaped with ease, but she was not, meaning that it would be a tight fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside and closing the door, locking it, she pushed shut the lid of the toilet and climbed in it. Rena opened the window and with a tremendous effort pulled her body upwards, causing her to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was halfway through the window when disaster struck: her belly, ass and hips got stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O no!\" Rena cried, \"Not now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed and she pushed, grunting and wheezing, but she could not break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she heard the restroom's door swinging open, followed by the deep, smooth voice of Anderson saying: \"Hey, what's all the noise in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull came stomping inside. \"What did I tell you party goers?\" he shouted, \"No sex in my club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he noticed someone that someone was stuck in the window, her feet kicking violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena!?\" Anderson exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by a fit of adrenaline, Rena give herself one mighty push, popping free, but she plummeted to the hard concrete below.</span></div></div>",

Reaching up to rub it, she found that it was wrapped up in a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" she though, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena saw that she was not in her own home, or laying on the concrete outside the club (thankfully), or even in the hospital, but she was in someone's bedroom, laying on a queen-sized bed, tucked between soft covers and pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the bedroom, the catgirl saw that had a modern look to it, meaning whoever owned the home was fairly rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she listened closely, Rena could hear the sound of waves. Gazing out the window, which the sun was signing brightly through, she glimpse swaying palm trees and the bright blue ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be in a beach house,\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the sheets, the catgirl saw, to her dismay, that she was still fat, but it did not seem that she gained anymore weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was somewhat glad for that, but now she had to figure a way to find some clothing, for she was completely nude! (Save for her panties, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Rena saw a conveniently placed yellow bathroom robe hanging off the edge of the bed. She dressed herself, and discovered that it fitted her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off her bandage, Rena now began to wonder who was it that decided to take her into their custody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she heard heavy footsteps coming towards the room, followed by the clinking and wobbling sounds of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the door came Anderson carrying a tray, which had a large glass of juice, forks and knives, and plate stacked with eggs, bacon and toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in his tracks, Looking equally surprised as Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be up,\" he said. \"Please, lay back down,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena wanted to protest, but ones the smell of food filled her nostrils she found that she could not resist. The catgirl climbed back into bed and Anderson sat the tray before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to eat like she had not seen food in months, slurping and shoveling her meal into her mouth, crease, juice and bits of egg dripping down her chin, soiling her fur and robes, but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, girl,\" Anderson said, \"Your going to choke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe luckily didn't, and when Rena was finished she found that she was still hungry, but ten spite that, she chose to ignore her hunger for now, because she wanted answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" asked Anderson, taking away the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" was Rena's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your probably wondering how you ended up here, hey?\" Anderson said, sitting on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see,\" Anderson began with a sigh, \"After you fell out the window, I rushed outside and found you unconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you call an ambulance or something?\" Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to,\" he explained, \"But then I though twice. You were not in the best of...situations, and explaining it to the paramedics would be a little hard if not awkward. So, I got some of my employees to help me get you into my car and drove you to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Rena suddenly said, \"Who helped you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire and Jackson,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they know!?\" Rena exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Anderson, sighing, \"But they promised not to tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief at least,\" Rena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me, how did you end up this way?\" Anderson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Rena cried, feeling hot tears come to her eyes, \"The first thing I know I'm standing in the bathroom, freshening up, and the next thing I'm swelling up like a balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down,\" said Anderson, \"We'll figure this out in due time, but, if you want to, you could stay here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn't like taking charity from someone; it said that she wasn't independent, but she had little choice. She could not go back home, for it would be very hard to explain her sudden weight gain to friends and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, Rena realized, she could kiss her new career goodbye, because she was far too fat for the business, and there was no man who liked a fat women, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here for a while,\" she finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Anderson, clapping his huge hands together and standing up, \"Anything else you'd like to ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Rena, tucking on her robe, \"Did you undress me? And who's robe is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, don't worry,\" he said, \"It was Sapphire who undressed you. Your clothing was completely ruined. As for the robe, it's my grandmother's; she forgot it here when she last visited me. She's a big women, and I guess it would also...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know,\" Rena said rolling her eyes, \"I'm a whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt her belly growl. \"Can I get more food, please?\"</span></div></div>",

It's grand hotels and rich mansions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fact that it's hit with supervillains nearly everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Mathison, like many comic book cities, suffers a deluge of superpowered maniacs and criminals. Thankfully, there were just as many heroes to stop them. Some were magic. Some made tech. And some came from accidents at First Rate Labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Rate Labs usually delt in creating medical and ecological formulas to save people and plants. But it's developed a bad reputation as \"The Hero and Villain Birthplace\", since nearly 80% of the cities superpowered beings came from there. But despite that, it's a great place to work on most days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU AIR HEADED BIMBO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was not one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead reseacher Tyler Marlan was currently yelling at his assistant, a skinny orange catgirl named Rena Caine. Rena had gotten an order mixed up by mistake, and Tyler was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Marlan.\" Rena said, worried. \"I misread the address. It's an honest mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks to your \"honest mistake\", a shipment of grass regrowing formula was just sent to a HOSPITAL!\" Tyler said. \"I swear, you are useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had a reputation for making many mistakes at the lab. It'd either be misplaced equipment, incorrect orders, or spilt chemicals. Many workers laughed at Rena's mistakes, causing her self-esstem and self-image to plummet, making her the nervous wreck we see now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the address was 116, not 119. I swear, I didn't mean to-\" Rena protested. But Tyler wasn't listening. He started advancing towards her, ranting the whole time. Rena backed up in fear, only to back right into a cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where things take a turn. On top of it was a beaker with a glowing blue formula that had been in the lab for some months. Most workers didn't even know what it did, so they just left it. Unfortunately, it was now about to get use. Rena hitting the cabinet shook it, causing the beaker to topple over and fall. Tyler saw it and jumped back, but Rena wasn't as quick. The beaker smashed open on her head, spilling the formula all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \"Amazing. Now you've made a mess. You know what, just get out. You've caused enough trouble today.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, now covered in the formula, left the lab saddened. The other lab workers looked on, until a glare from Tyler convinced them to get back to work.<br>\r\nRena left the building, about to start crying, when a familiar voice stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena! What happened?\" The voice said. Rena turned and saw Marla Emmet, a ecologist on the team. Marla's black hair was in a bun, and she was wearing tinted protective goggles. Her uniform didn't really hide her hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rena saw Marla, her heart raced. Most of the people didn't know it, but Rena was a lesbian, and had a crush on Marla since she started working at First Rate Labs, but never acted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Marla.\" Rena said. \"Just another stupid mistake. Sent chemicals to the wrong place, and got doused in some chemicals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarla cocked her head to the side. \"I don't see any chemicals on you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Rena felt her face and looked at her lab coat. Suprisingly, she was completely clean. \"What?\" She said, confused. \"But I was-\" She shook her head. \"Never mind. I need to go home and shower.\" With that, Rena walked away, leaving Marla confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Rena didn't know was that the formula had seeped through her clothes and into her skin. Soon, it would take effect.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Rena was in her aparment. After taking a shower, she changed into a tee shirt and shorts and sat on the couch. She grabbed the remote and turned the TV on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-again, Captain Lightning has stopped Gravity Well's plan, and is taking him to prison as we speak.\" The news report stated. \"Now, Lady Pixel is once again doing battle with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shut off the TV, deciding not to hear it. She was envious of both heroes and villains. Getting to do what they want, having epic battles, while she gets chewed out by Tyler and covered in chemicals. She felt it wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she suddenly felt very tired. It wasn't even close to night. Rena got up and stumbled to her bedroom. She managed to get to her bed in time, before she completely passed out.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nA few hours later, at around Midnight, Rena slowly woke up. Wondering what had happened, she slowly got up out of bed and onto her feet. She lumbered over to her door to get water, only to find she had trouble getting through the door. After a bit, she did get through, but was confused as to why that happened. She passed by a full lenght mirror that had been in the apartment since she moved in, and she caught a glimpse of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fully woke up from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in a few hours, Rena had become monstrously fat. Her face now had somewhat bloated cheeks, and she had gained a second and third chin. Her previously skinny arms were now bloated. Her previously flat chest had ballooned into a pair of ZZ cups. Her hips jutted out three feet from her side. Slowly turning, she saw her butt was huge. Each cheek was a big as two beach balls. What she could see of her legs were just as bloated as her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that paled in comparison, when she turned to face the mirror again, and finally looked at her belly. It was gigantic, easily twice the size of her chest. Rena was standing five feet away from the mirror (the hall was seven feet wide) and her belly was still able to touch it. It wasn't a perfect sphere, having two rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did Rena realize that she had burst out of her clothes, and was standing naked in the hall, with only her belly covering her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked at herself in the mirror in...</span></div></div>",

She hefted up one of her massive breasts, confirming that they were in fact real. Then, she dropped them onto her enormous gut, turned, and gave her inflated ass a nice big smack. She watched as it jiggled like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this could be fun.\" Rena said to herself, smiling a bit. \"I've always been so skinny. This could be a nice change of pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she didn't even know how much she weighed now, she slowly lumbered to her bathroom, and, with great effort, squeezed into it. Then, she looked at the electronic scale near the tub. It was supposed to hold up to 10 tons and had an electronic voice. Slowly, she stepped onto the scale. She waited for a few seconds, and it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Current weight: One thousand pounds.\" The scale said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Rena exclamied. \"I'm surprised I haven't broken the floor!\" Stepping off the scale, she turned and saw that there were cracks in the floor shaped liker her feet. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering out of the bathroom, Rena entered her living room. She then sat on her couch, which groaned under her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" She said. \"That chemical must have done this to me. But, if I'm a thousand pounds, how can I move?\" Then something clicked in her head. \"Could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she rose from the couch, and looked at something to her right. It was a large chest that she bought at a flea market. It weighed a ton, and took 3 men to move. Walking over to it, Rena grabbed one of the handles, and lifted. To her amazement, it felt as light as a feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" She yelled. \"I'm super strong!\" Setting the chest down gently, she turned and went out the sliding door onto her balcony. Now outside, she looked out at Mathison. It was near a desert. Grinning, she ready herself, and jumped. Instead of just jumping an inch, Rena went flying.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Rena landed in the middle of the desert, leaving a small impact crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" She cried out. \"So, I have super strenght, super jumping powers, now what else?\" Looking around, she saw a boulder. \"Oh, this is going to be stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the boulder, and lifted it up with no problem. Holding it over her head, she prepared herself, and dropped it on her head. The boulder shattered into tiny pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so I am invulnerable. Thankfully.\" Rena said. Then she started to giggle. \"I don't believe it. I have super powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn't be more overjoyed. This was an incredible discovery. But how to use her new powers? After thinking for a second, she decided she would use her powers too...</span></div></div>",

All heroes of all stories must pass through the Crossroads before their stories can begin. Most that pass through the Crossroads don't remember doing so until they return, after their adventures end. However, changing regulations now allow for those looking for a less serious adventure to retain their memories of the Crossroads.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Rena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're reading that out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena squeaked and shrunk into her seat a bit. She was a diminutive catgirl, with emerald green eyes, tiger-stripe fur, and shoulder length red hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. She wore a white T-shirt, blue jeans, a pair of sandals, and a pair of black-rimmed glasses, all of which (even the sandals!) seemed to hang off her twig like figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena hailed from a world where a freak accident with a burst of gamma radiation mutated the humans into various human-animal hybrids. She had heard of the Crossroads, and was enamored with the idea. So, she gathered her two best friends, Lucy and Bailey, and headed to the omniversal hub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was, simply put, really tall. She was nineteen, two years younger than Rena, and yet she was brushing seven feet, more than two feet taller than Rena. Lucy was a foxgirl, with reddish brown fur, bright blue eyes, and light blonde hair that stopped halfway down her back. She wore a pair of denim hot pants, a pair of flip flops, and a low cut shirt to show off her frankly <i>giant</i> boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's other friend, Bailey, was the only one of the trio that was of average height. The cowgirl had black fur, dark brown eyes, and black hair in a pixie cut. She wore a white tank top that strained against her muscles, a pair of blue jeans that strained against her bubble butt, and a pair of combat boots. There was a lot of straining in Bailey's attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while we\u2019re talking about it,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWhat kind of adventure do we want? I\u2019m thinking something lighthearted, but not too much so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d Bailey shouted. \u201cYou don\u2019t just go to the Crossroads for some pansy-ass field trip! You go there for the badass adventures where you rip out your opponents\u2019 guts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s way too violent!\u201d Lucy shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what if it\u2019s violent?!\u201d Bailey shot back. Before the argument could escalate into yet another brawl between the two, Rena, her nose in the pamphlet she was reading earlier, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it says in the pamphlet that if you\u2019re unsure what kind of experience you want, you can just pick the \u201crandom\u201d option,\u201d Rena read from the pamphlet. She looked up at her two friends. \u201cIf we do that, then there\u2019s no hard feelings over what we end up with, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy and Bailey looked at each other, then at Rena. \u201cRight,\u201d they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve decided!\u201d A cheery voice yelled out. All three girls yelped and jumped back. Standing on the other side of the room they were in was a human woman with curly black hair. She had brown eyes, and she was wearing a black pantsuit, the top strained by her titanic bust. On her right ring finger she wore a small ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Beth,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one setting up your journey. Before we begin the selection process, do you have any questions? I\u2019ll answer them to the best of my ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big are your boobs?\u201d Lucy asked immediately, much to the other two\u2019s embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c34J,\u201d Beth answered quickly and shamelessly, much to the trio\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cThree sizes bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny other questions?\u201d Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any Limit Break style abilities?\u201d Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Beth said. \u201cFinal Fantasy is just one of the many series that use the Crossroads. If you want, we could even call that ability Limit Break during your adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d The trio said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThe deed has been done. Any more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Beth said, a tablet appearing in her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s begin. You wanted the world to be random, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Rena said. Beth tapped a few things on her tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish to retain your memories of the Crossroads and your world during your adventure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned to Bailey and Lucy. They both nodded. Rena turned to Beth and nodded as well, who tapped a few more things on her tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assume the three of you want to start out together?\u201d Beth asked. The three nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Beth said. \u201cNow we can get on to which classes you\u2019ll be. One at a time, please step forward.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Beth looked at her a hummed in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a few classes in mind,\u201d Beth said after a moment. \u201cI could see you as any physically oriented class, but I have three in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Bailey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first class in mind is the Knight class,\u201d Beth said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have high attack, defense, and HP stats, but your magic, magic defense, and speed stats will be low, with an average luck stat. Its Limit Break is called Brave Slash. It hits once and does 1.5 times your normal attack damage, and boosts your attack and defense when you use it. Additionally, once you reach level 50, you\u2019ll have the option of choosing one of two sub-classes. The Dark Night sub class has higher attack and magic than the standard Knight, and you gain the special command Dark, which sacrifices 10% of your HP to deal however much HP was sacrificed in damage to all enemies. The Paladin sub class has higher defense and magic defense than Knight, and gains the special command Hero. While using Hero, you will be unable to attack, but the rest of your allies\u2019 stats with double.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey digested that for a few seconds. \u201cIt sounds powerful, but I\u2019ll pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThe second class I have in mind is the Dragoon class. It has similar stats as the Knight class, but it has average attack and defense and high speed. The Dragoon\u2019s special command is Jump. When you use it, you will jump high into the air, rendering you immune to all damage and spells. You will stay in the air for a while, after which you will come down and land on the target, dealing double normal attack damage. Its Limit Break is called Death From Above. It is a powerful jump attack that hits once and deals three times normal jump attack damage, with no extra effects. Once you reach level 50, the Jump command will change to the Multi-Jump command. Multi-Jump does exactly what it sounds like- it allows Jump to hit multiple times. You have a 100% chance for Jump to high twice, and the chances are halved for each jump after that, for a maximum of twenty jumps, although that only has a roughly 0.0002% chance of happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey sighed. \u201cAgain, it sounds powerful, but not really my style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThe third class I have in mind is the Brawler class. Again, it has similar stats to Knight, but trades the high HP for the second highest luck value of any class we offer. Its Limit Break is called Slots. Based on how you roll, it can do anything from summon a powerful beast to wiping everything off the board- including your party- to absolutely nothing. The Brawler doesn\u2019t start out with a special command, but at level 50 gains the Dice command. When you use Dice, you will roll three dice, and your next attack will deal a different amount of damage depending on what you roll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey hummed in thought. \u201cI\u2019ll take the Brawler,\u201d she said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI will teleport you to your changing room. When the light flashes green, you may begin your adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey then disappeared in a flash of blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, please!\u201d Beth said. Lucy stepped up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two classes in mind already,\u201d Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, no thinking for a bit?\u201d Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth laughed. \u201cThe instant I saw you, I knew which two would be your options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they then?\u201d Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first option is the Dancer class,\u201d Beth said. \u201cDancer has high HP, defense, and magic defense stats, with an average magic stat, and low attack, speed, and luck stats. Your special command is Dance. Depending on the environment you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll use certain abilities, such as healing your party or attacking with an element associated with that environment. However, you cannot stop dancing until either you fall in battle or the battle ends. The only exception to this is its Limit Break. Your Limit Break is called Climax. When you use it, you will use all of the abilities of whatever dance you\u2019re currently using at once. If you are not using a dance when you use Climax, you will begin dancing. Dancer is one of the few classes that do not gain anything upon reaching any level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my second option?\u201d Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Seductress class,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThe Seductress has extremely high speed and luck, the best we offer, and every other stat except magic is low, while the magic stat is slightly below average. Your special command is Entice, which causes the target to attack their allies. Its Limit Break is also called Climax, only the Seductress\u2019 Climax raises all of the user\u2019s stats. When you reach level 50, you gain the Devote command. It causes the target to guard you until it dies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought for a minute. \u201cI\u2019ll be a Dancer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Beth said. \u201cNow you can change. Again, when the light flashes green, you may begin your adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Bailey, Lucy disappeared in a flash of blue light. Beth turned to Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any class for you,\u201d Beth said sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI\u2019ve already thought of what class I want to be. Its-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Beth said. \u201cGive me a hint so I can figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI\u2019ve always\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved machines,\u201d Rena said. Beth\u2019s eyes went wide with understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you want to be a Machinist, huh?\u201d Beth asked rhetorically. \u201cWell, Machinists have high attack, defense, and magic defense stats, with an average HP stat, and low magic, speed, and luck stats. Your special command is called Tools. Tools lets you use various tools that you can find and buy in stores, each with different effects. However, only one tool is needed to use it, and having multiple tools does nothing, except during your Limit Break. Your Limit Break is called Omni-Tool. Omni-Tool uses all tools that you currently have in succession. If you have, say, two of one tool, during your Limit Break you will use both tools. Machinists don\u2019t get anything when they reach any level. Sound good to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \u201cSounds perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Beth said. \u201cNow, like with the other two, I\u2019ll teleport you to your changing room. Once the light flashes green, you can begin your adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief flash of blue, Rena was teleported into a small room. The walls were white, and just a little bit longer than Rena was tall, while they stretched up for farther than Rena could see. One of the walls, the one to her left, had a mirror built into it, while the wall opposite the mirror had her outfit hanging on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s outfit consisted of a pair of denim overalls, a pair of brown work boots, a pair of gray work gloves, a white tank top, and a pair of goggles. There was just one problem with them- Rena would be swimming in them when she put them on! The overalls looked to be made for someone who weighed at least four tons, with the rest of the clothing to match! Even the boots, when she looked at the size, were size 22, while she wore a size 9! Nonetheless, this was Rena\u2019s outfit she had to wear, so she had to put it on. And before she could put this outfit on, she obviously had to take her current one off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was definitely not happy with how she looked. Sure, she wasn\u2019t anorexic or anything like that, but she just felt too small. Not height wise, but weight wise. When her friends- especially Lucy- hit puberty and started to grow and get boobs and such, Rena was excited for her turn to come around. So she waited. And waited. And then she realized that this was as big as she was going to get: 4 feet 11 inches, 95 pounds, A cup size. Sighing, Rena put the tent like tank top over her head, and was in for a pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rena put the tank top on, it shrank down to fit perfectly. She then tried it with one of the gloves- again, it shrank down to fit perfectly. Rena quickly threw on the rest of the outfit, all of it shrinking down to fit her perfectly. Once Rena put her goggles around her neck, her glasses replaced by a pair of magic, intangible contacts, an unseen light began to flash green, and the mirror she had been using fell away to reveal a shimmering portal of blue. Excited, Rena stepped through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena appeared in the middle of a forest. She shook her head to rid her mind of the fog that came with that portal. She heard a low whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, Rena, they even made your twig body look good,\u201d Bailey\u2019s voice said. Rena turned to face where the voice came from, and also let out a low whistle. Bailey was wearing a white crop top, a pair of denim hot pants, a pair of combat boots, and her fists were wrapped in white sports tape. Like Rena, all of it fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, Bailey!\u201d Lucy said. She was wearing a purple sarong around her waist, and a purple bikini top to match. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you, Tits McGee,\u201d Bailey said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, meanwhile, had managed to figure out how to look at her stats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rena Westfall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob: Machinist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP to next: 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHP: 150/150<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 30/30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATK: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEF: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMGC: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMDF: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPD: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLCK: 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPL: 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck does GPL mean?</i> Rena thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, could you two take a look at your stats for a second?\u201d Rena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBut why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fine,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cStats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that command, Bailey\u2019s stats screen popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bailey Allen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob: Brawler<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP to next: 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight: 120 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHP: 150/150<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 30/30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATK: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEF: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMGC: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMDF: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPD: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLCK: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPL: 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy Smith<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob: Dancer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXP to next: 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight: 200 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHP: 200/200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 50/50<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATK: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEF: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMGC: 30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMDF: 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPD: 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLCK: 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPL: 10</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo either of you have any idea what GPL even means?\u201d Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Bailey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a clue,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWell, might as well walk around until plot happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot three seconds after saying that, a small child ran past them screaming for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Bailey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got trouble!\u201d Rena said.

The monster was stopped in its tracks by the punch, dazed slightly. It shakes its head and roars at the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the battle begins, the trio hears this starting to play: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMd6V1IOJ5k&amp;t=40s.\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMd6V1IO...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster bellows and charged as Bailey. She takes the hit, her arms crossed to try and reduce the power of the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-35 HP! Current HP 115/150!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, this thing hits pretty hard!\u201d Bailey called out. She lashed out again, hitting the beast with a straight jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-336 HP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Lucy\u2019s turn. She closed her eyes and began to sway, a dark green aura flaring up around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nature\u2019s Harmony: Forest\u2019s Healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestored 75 HP to Bailey!

Her breasts had jumped up from their previous C-cups to somewhere probably in the DD range. Her belly jiggled whenever she moved, and was beginning to sag a bit. Her ass was even bigger and rounder than before, with only a tiny window between her thighs left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena gained the second most out of the three. Her breasts went from an A-cup to either a large B-cup or a small C-cup. Her belly swayed like a pendulum when she moved, and it covered her crotch when she stood up. If she were to check, her ass would actually be slightly larger than Bailey\u2019s now, and when she experimentally tried to walk, her thighs forced her to waddle, and quite severely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy gained the most weight. Her breasts, previously G-cups, were now in the L-cup range. Her stomach had the same pendulum and crotch-covering that Rena\u2019s did, and her ass was much bigger. However, due to how much taller Lucy was than Rena, she still had some room between her thighs and could still walk normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Bailey asked. \u201cWhat kind of world were we sent to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently one where getting healed too much makes you fat,\u201d Lucy said deadpan. \u201cRena, hurry up and take your turn! Once we kill this thing, we can figure this out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \u201cRight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena reached into her inventory and pulled out an object that looked somewhat like a crossbow. She aimed it at the monster and fired it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tool: Auto-Crossbow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-504 HP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster roared again, this time charging at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-35 HP! Current HP 190/150!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-17.5 lbs. from Rena!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rena\u2019s surprise, taking that hit made her lose weight. Instead of covering her crotch, Rena\u2019s belly now hung just above it. Speaking of her belly, it now shook constantly, even while breathing, which it had been too heavy to do before. Also, while the thickness of her thighs still forced her to waddle, it was much less prominent, to the point where she could have been walking normally if she so wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Rena said. \u201cSo if we take hits, it makes use lose weight, probably until we get back to our max HP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the trio all had the same speed stats, it was completely random as to who would go first each turn. <br>\r\nAnd, as it turned out, Lucy went first this time. She once again began to sway, the dark green aura flaring to life around her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nature\u2019s Harmony: Forest\u2019s Healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestored 75 HP to Bailey!

Her belly covered her crotch, but didn\u2019t go much further. Her ass was now shelf-like, and the thighs connected to it were constantly touching and chafing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s breasts had jumped up another cup size, now sitting at a C-cup. Her belly was back to hanging over her crotch, and it was starting to creep its way down towards her knees, but only just. Rena\u2019s ass was now roughly the same size as Bailey\u2019s, with the same amount of chafing as well in her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy\u2019s breasts had once again jumped up ludicrously, and they were now past conventional measurements. Her belly was at roughly the same position as Rena\u2019s, and despite their height difference, Lucy\u2019s butt still looked bigger than Rena\u2019s, and her thighs were larger and chafed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Bailey took her turn. She reared back and slugged the monster in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-336 HP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena once again aimed her crossbow and fired it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-504 HP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster roared again, this time charging at Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-35 HP from Lucy! Current HP 375/200!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-17.5 lbs. from Lucy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Rena, Lucy shrank down some from that hit. And, as it also turned out, it was Lucy\u2019s turn again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nature\u2019s Harmony: Forest\u2019s Healing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestored 75 HP to Bailey!

Bailey jumped up and kicked the monster in the teeth. The monster stumbled back a few steps before falling backwards and disintegrating. The trio did a flabby fist pump as the music stopped playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>EXP gained: 20!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey Leveled Up! +10 lbs.!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHP: +50!

Her belly was about an eighth of the way down her thighs, which chafed badly even while waddling. Rena\u2019s breasts had jumped up to a D-cup, and her belly was about a quarter of the way down her thighs, which forced her into a very pronounced waddle. Lucy\u2019s breasts had gone even further into the realm of unmeasurable absurdity, and her belly and thighs were in the same shape as Rena\u2019s. All three\u2019s asses were in the same boat: huge and flabby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey sat down heavily, sending a wave of blubber rippling around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is up with this world?\u201d She asked. \u201cJust a few minutes ago I was slender! Now I look like a fucking whale!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena hummed to herself. \u201cI can say the same, but I also noticed something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo either of you actually <i>feel</i> any heavier?\u201d Rena asked. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m looking at my stats right now, and it <i>says</i> that I weigh 175 pounds. I don\u2019t know about you two, but I certain don\u2019t <i>feel</i> eighty pounds heavier than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d Lucy said, \u201cyou\u2019re right. If anything, I feel <i>lighter</i> than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThis is probably just a weird quirk of this random world. And we\u2019re just going to go back to normal once we get back to the Crossroads, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about we just don\u2019t care and continue on?\u201d Bailey proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m cool with that,\u201d Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI think I saw that kid run that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was pointing directly behind them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright, girls,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you here for a special announcement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena Westfall was a personal trainer in the small town of Innston. She was one of the best personal trainers in town, and many, many girls of all shapes and sizes looked to her for help for both getting in shape and staying in shape. Rena\u2019s slimmer trainees reported amazing results, and they said it was because Rena really knew what to say. Rena was 5\u20197\u201d, weighing in at 140 pounds. Her chest was as flat as a wall, and the rest of her body was as straight as could be, with only some small bulges where her muscles were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s method of training really involved her getting inside the heads of the girls she was training. For the slimmer girls, she knew what to say because Rena herself had never weighed a pound over 150 in her life. This frustrated not only her fatter clients, but also Rena, as Rena had no idea what to say to motivate her fatter clients. And so, Rena made a decision. She called her three fattest girls, a wolfgirl named Emma, a foxgirl named Lucy, and a cowgirl named Bailey, all of which mystified Rena as to how they were even alive, much less walking, for a special announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your announcement?\u201d Emma asked. Emma had light gray fur coating her body, and she weighed the least of the three at 18,020 pounds. Her breasts were each almost three times longer than Rena was tall, and weighed eight times more than Rena\u2019s entire body weight!  Her hips were almost one and a third times wider than Rena was tall, and her waist was actually <i>more</i> than one and a third as wide as Rena was tall. Her butt was more than ten feet wide, and each cheek weighed ten times more than Rena. Each of Emma\u2019s thighs were five times wider than Rena\u2019s entire body. One time, with each of the three\u2019s permission, Rena had tried to see how far in she could push into their bellies before she hit their stomachs. With Emma, Rena, with her hands over her head, had been swallowed all the way up to just past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it better be important. The trip here took way too much energy from me,\u201d Lucy said. Lucy was the second heaviest of the three, with light red fur. Although she <i>was</i> the second heaviest, weighing in at 63,962 pounds, she looked slightly less massive due to being seven feet tall. Lucy\u2019s breasts were almost four times longer than Rena was tall, and each weighed 134 times more than Rena did, due to her allegedly having I-cup breasts before gaining her insane amount of weight. Her hips were ten feet wide, and her waist was almost a foot wider than that. Her butt was fifteen feet wide, and each cheek weighed almost twenty-seven times Rena. Each of her thighs were slightly more than seven times the width of Rena\u2019s body. When Rena had done the same as she did with Emma to Lucy, she was actually buried an inch deep into Lucy\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey didn\u2019t say anything, due to the fact that she was currently cramming hundreds of candy bars into her face. Bailey had pitch black fur, and was the largest of the three at an impossible 1,552,718 pounds. Each of Bailey\u2019s breasts were almost twenty four times longer than Rena was tall, and each weighed slightly more than 986 times Rena. Her hips were a little more than eleven and a half times as wide as Rena was tall, and her waist was twenty six and a half times wider than Rena\u2019s entire body. Her butt was almost ninety eight times wider than Rena\u2019s body, and each cheek weighed almost 945 times more than Rena. Her thighs were each almost 105 times wider than Rena\u2019s own. When Rena had done what she did to Emma and Lucy, she was literally buried six feet under in Bailey\u2019s flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Rena said. \u201cAnd I really want to get into your minds to help you lose all of this weight. I want to know <i>firsthand</i> how it feel to be even more massive than you three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded. \u201cRight. And I guess you want our help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Rena said, nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey let out an ear-splitting belch. \u201cI guess we could help you out,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I want to get to your weights in a year,\u201d Rena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fatties let out low whistles, the end of which Bailey punctuated by beginning to stuff her face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s gonna be significantly harder,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cI started gaining pretty much the instant my boobs stopped growing when I hit 18, and it still took me ten years of pigging out almost every day to get where I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s technically possible to do that in a year,\u201d Emma continued. \u201cBut you weigh 140 pounds, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted to get to where I\u2019m at,\u201d Emma continued, \u201cyou\u2019d have to put on an average of 49 pounds <i>a day</i>. But I\u2019m guessing being my weight\u2019s not where you wanna end up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded again. \u201cI want to weigh more than Bailey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze, Rena,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some lofty goals. Again, we can do that, but do you have any idea how much weight you\u2019d be putting on a day? At least 4,254 pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI did the math, and I know how much I\u2019ll have to gain per day to reach the goal I have in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey let out another ear-splitting belch. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said. \u201cNo time like the present, right? And the three of us live together, so just pack some things and come on over.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the evening, Rena walked up to the house the three others lived in. She had changed out of her workout clothes- a blue tank top and a pair of black shorts- and into something more comfortable- a white T-shirt and a pair of denim hot pants. She had a backpack slung over her shoulder, with a spare pair of clothes, a pair of pajamas, and some toiletries in it. She didn\u2019t bring much, figuring that she would soon outgrow them. Yet the other three always had perfectly fitting clothes, so maybe they had something to fix the issue of outgrowing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the house, it was easy to see that three hyper-massive women lived there. The house was more akin to a warehouse than anything else, with the main doorway being 100 feet wide to accommodate even Bailey\u2019s titanic mass. The house was extremely wide, and would have stretched into quite a few neighboring yards had it not been in the middle of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena rang the doorbell, which was on a post next to her. After a few minutes, she could hear thumping getting closer. The thumping soon arrived at the door, and the door swung up to reveal Emma, a huge burger in hand. She was wearing a green tank top and black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on in!\u201d She said, taking a bite out of the burger. She turned around and thumped off into the home, with Rena following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just in time for dinner!\u201d Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner?\u201d Rena asked. \u201cThen what\u2019s the burger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked at the burger in surprise, like she\u2019d forgotten she was eating it. \u201cA snack,\u201d Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a <i>snack?!</i>\u201d Rena asked, dumbfounded. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>I</i> weigh nine tons,\u201d Emma countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair point,\u201d Rena said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just used to a snack being a single granola bar, not something that would take me three days to finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma laughed. \u201cWelcome to the world of the hyper-massive, where your feasts are our light meals. Speaking of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Rena entered what was clearly the most important room in the house: the dining room. In the center of the room was a table stacked high with fatty food. Burgers, hot dogs, pizzas, and more, all at least as wide as Rena\u2019s entire body. Sitting at the table, patiently waiting, were Lucy and Bailey, who were wearing the same outfit Emma was, just in their own sizes, and in red and blue, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, you showed up,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anything to eat in twenty minutes, and I\u2019m starving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat down at the stop at the table that was set out for her, Emma having already rushed to her spot. Once Rena\u2019s ass made contact with her comically over-sized chair, the other three started shoveling food into their mouths. Rena, meanwhile, looked somewhat intimidated by the huge pile of food on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And to think I\u2019ll be eating this much every day, if not more!</i> Rena thought. Shrugging, she grabbed a hot-dog and began eating. Said hot-dog was as long as her leg, and it took both hands at different points along the bun to keep it together. And she felt disgusting wolfing the entire thing down, but she remembered that this was nothing compared to how much she would be eating in the future. Rena managed to get down two more gigantic hot-dogs before throwing in the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d Rena groaned. \u201cI\u2019m completely stuffed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma paused for a minute to look at Rena. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cYou ate three of our giant hot-dogs. If you can\u2019t move, then just stay there and sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded gratefully. She could already feel the sleeping inducing effects of her full belly, even if she was a bit overstuffed. Rena slumped down as far as she could into her chair and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to learn everything that she could, but her mentor barely taught her anything in magic. She knew that her mentor had a reason for not teaching her and she could accept that. Her master was her new family after she lost her parents when she was younger and her master was like her new mother waiting to teacher what she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen are you going to teach me how to do spells?\u201d Rena had asked her master after completing her daily work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I feel that you are ready to begin your magic lessons.

She turned the lights out with a wave of her wand and she went to her room for a good night sleep. Rena was laying in her bed thinking about learning magic and what she could do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know she wants me to trust her, but I feel that I\u2019m ready to learn.\u201d She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should learn a spell that would make her proud of me.\u201d She added encouraging herself before leaving her room for her master\u2019s library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plan in mind, rena opened the door of her room and looked around the hallway seeing if her master was waiting for her to try something. Seeing nothing or a trap waiting for her, she made her way to the library and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library is huge with large bookcases filled with books of spells her master have acquired over the number of years she was learning.

She has tiger striped fur all over and red hair that reaches down to her shoulders. Humming to herself she begins to brush her teeth. As she looks into the mirror she notices that they look sharper than usual, but just assumes she's seeing things because she's tired. However her eyes drift upward and widen at what she sees. There are two horns on her head. They aren't very long and curve slightly back. Rena lets out a scream and stumbles backward. \"What the hell?!\" she says aloud. Feeling the horns she confirms that they are real. She looks herself over and doesn't see anything else wrong with her body. Unknown to her though her teeth and claws are sharper than normal. After numerous attempts she realizes that she can't hide the horns. Trying to remain calm she racks her brain for a way to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of pacing Rena decides to call Beth, her best friend. She calls Beth and about twenty minutes later there is a knock on the door. \"Rena? Its me.\" Beth's voice says from the other side of the door. \"Okay, I'm letting you in but don't freak out okay?\" Rena tells her. \"Freak out? Um, okay.\" Beth says a little confused. The door opens and Beth is quickly yanked inside before Rena slams it shut. Beth is a tabby cat girl with orange fur. She doesn't freak out at her friend's appearance but she is shocked. \"Are those horns?\" she asks slowly as she gets closer. \"Yes! I just woke up and they were there! What do I do!?\" Rena says. As she says this she has to bat away Beth, who is in the process of poking and feeling her horns. \"You know, you look taller too.\" Beth says as she looks Rena over. Rena feels herself up and notices that her pajamas aren't as loose as they usually are. \"Oh god your right! Whats going on?!\" Beth just shrugs, which annoys her larger than normal friend. \"Why are you so calm!? I'm in a crisis here!\" Rena snaps. As she has this little outburst she feels herself getting larger, as well as her pajamas ripping.. Beth watches with her mouth open and circles her friend, checking her body. \"Now I'm bigger! What's going on?\" Rena exclaims while trying to calm down. \"I don't know, but check your tail.\" Beth says. Rena feels her furry tail and finds that it is thicker than normal, even in proportion to her new size. Her horns are also a little longer, curving back further. She sits there in a slump while Beth thinks things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Beth speaks. \"Okay, we don't know whats happening but I think we can agree that you need some new clothes. I'm gonna go get you something and then we can try and find out what's going on.\" Rena watches as her friend leaves and thanks the heavens that she is so reliable. While waiting for her to return she feels a sudden burst of anger at her situation. Why was this happening to her? What did she do to deserve this? Her thoughts are cast aside when Beth comes through the door. \"I found some clothes you can wear.\" she says as she hands them to Rena. Its a simple outfit, just a shirt and some pants, but it looks pretty nice. She even brought big enough undergarments. \"Where did you get these?\" Rena inquires. \"I bought them. You're lucky you didn't get too big, or you wouldn't even fit the plus sized women's clothes.\" Once she's dressed, Rena puts on a rather large hat that Beth brought to cover her horns. Now that she's ready to head out, where do they go?</span></div></div>",

Rena chuckles and gives her a playful shove. Unfortunately she doesn't know her new strength and ends up knocking Beth five feet away. \"Oh crap! I'm so sorry!\" Rena says as she picks Beth up with one hand. \"Its fine.\" Beth says as they walk down the street. While they head to a clinic Rena can feel the other people on the street staring at her. \"Look at the bright side. At least you're getting some attention.\" Beth says. Rena just rolls her eyes and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reach the clinic they are surprised by what they see. There are two other girls there who have symptoms similar to Rena. There is a girl with pure white fur and blond hair who seems to have grown horns as well. The difference is that her horns point off to the sides and curve downwards. The other girl is a calico with black hair. Although she doesn't appear to have horns, she is constantly looking at her teeth in a hand mirror. They look very sharp, like Rena's. \"Wow! Looks like this isn't just happening to you!\" Beth says amazed. \"Yeah...\" Rena says. She's a little relieved to know she's not alone, but at the same time she's worried that her symptoms appear to be worse than the other girls. The white girl's horns aren't as long as hers and Rena's teeth are sharper than the calico's. Not to mention the fact that they're both normal sized and Rena is about seven feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sits down and feels the chair straining to hold her. Again she feels a surge of frustration at her problem. Looking over she can see that the other two girls are pretty tense as well. When the doctor walks out all three of them converge on him. \"You've got to help me! Its an emergency!\" the white furred girl says. \"Me too!\" the calico chimes in. \"Well look at me! I've got way more issues than them!\" Rena says quite forcefully. The doctor's ears droop a little as the three girls ambush him and timidly ushers them into the examination room. He looks over the other two girls first before Rena. As he does so she folds her arms impatiently with a sour look on her face. When he gets to her she takes off her hat and lets her tail sway freely. \"Whoa!\" the calico exclaims. \"Is that gonna happen to me too?\" she says looking at Rena's thick tail. Meanwhile the other girl is staring at Rena's longer horns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor tells them to wait while he goes into another room. In the meantime the girls talk. The white girl's name is Abby and the other is Callie. \"This is crazy right?\" Abby sighs. \"I know!\" Callie agrees.  \"I wake up and see that my teeth are like razors! Although I guess I don't have it as bad as you guys. No offense.\" She adds the last part when Rena and Abby shoot her angry looks. \"But seriously, look at you. I feel for you.\" Abby tells Rena. Rena sighs. \"Thanks. I gotta say though this whole thing is just so frustrating.\" Callie nods. \"I know what you mean. I've been tense all morning.\" As the three get to know each other the doctor returns. \"Okay girls I'm sorry to say I can't really help you. However I've called some specialists who can. Just return to your homes and they'll call you when they arrive.\"  He explains. How does Rena take this?</span></div></div>",

I need help!\" she yells. The doctor attempts to calm her down but the other girls jump in too. \"Yeah! We don't know how long your specialists are gonna take! We're supposed to just ignore this until they show up?\" Abby says. \"In the time it takes, I could end up with horns too!\" Callie adds. In the confusion Rena feels her body changing again. The familiar growing sensation returns and she feels herself getting bigger. This growth spurt is much more intense than the last. She gets bigger and bigger until her clothes tear off and she breaks through the roof of the one story clinic. Now she stands at twenty feet tall, looking down at the others below her. In addition to her growth, the other parts of her body changed as well. Her horns are longer and now curved all the way to the back of her head. Her tail was not only thick like a lizard's, but also pointed as well. Finally, as her body size increased, her bust size did as well. She had a rather nice rack before, but her latest spurt caused them to grow even bigger. Abby and Callie experienced some changes as well, but not nearly as drastic. Abby's horns became longer and sharper while small spikes sprouted down Callie's back and tail. They also grew, but only to about eight feet tall. Either Rena just got a head start, or whatever is happening is affecting her worse than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon people begin to gather around and marvel at the giant lizard like cat. Rena feels a surge of embarrassment followed by a burst of anger. This combination of emotions causes her to simply take off. She runs in a random direction while trying to cover her naked form. With her giant size she manages to cover a lot of ground and manages to reach the edge of the town. She runs into the nearby woods and decides to hide there. While sitting in the forest she has nothing but her own thoughts to keep her occupied. Instead of feeling sad about her condition now she is just annoyed. Crying won't help her now that she's twenty feet tall. Leaning back she sighs and feels her horns. They're pretty hard and are longer than before. She looks over the rest of her body. From her huge boobs to her thick tail, she's becoming more like a lizard. Well, being this big she thinks she's more like a dragon. Rena crawls to a large cave nearby and enters. Curling up on the ground she falls asleep hoping she doesn't change any further. When she wakes up someone is there. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

Looking closer she sees that its the two girls from the clinic, Abby and Callie. They're curled up on the ground sleeping, just like she was. They begin to stir and eventually wake up. As they stand up Rena notices that they're both bigger than the last time she saw them. Now they both stand at about ten feet tall. They're still only half as tall as her though. Abby yawns and stretches before noticing that Rena is awake. When they lock eyes Rena breaks the silence. \"What are you two doing here?\" she asks. \"Well its like this..\" she begins as Callie yawns. \"After you ran off we tried to adjust like the doctor said. Unfortunately both of us got angry for one reason or another and got bigger. We found each other and then picked up on your scent. All we had to do was follow it here.\" Callie crawls closer and leans against Rena. \"You're something else though.\" she points out. \"You're bigger than us and look more like a dragon.\" Rena sighs as Callie points this out. \"Why did come here though?\" Rena asks. Callie and Abby look at each other and shrug. \"We don't know, it just felt right since the three of us are in the same boat.\" Abby says. Rena feels better knowing that she's not going through this alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do now?\" Callie asks. The three of them are sitting on the cave floor in a circle. Rena feels a bit awkward being the biggest one. \"I don't know.\" she answers. \"We all kind of just freaked out and ran off.\" Abby nods. \"Yeah, we should probably go and try to talk those experts the doctor mentioned.\" she suggests. \"Yeah, and I should let my friend Beth know that I'm okay.

We'll follow you.\" she says. \"Besides, it kind of feels like you're the leader. You are the biggest after all.\" Abby adds. \"Thanks for reminding me.\" Rena grumbles. They near the city and their rumbling footsteps draw the attention of some people. Some stare in awe while others retreat to safety. Either way it makes Rena feel like a freak, which also makes her a little angry. Lately a lot of things make her angry. \"Whats your problem?\" she says in annoyance. All the little people scramble away at her outburst. Callie and Abby aren't as vocal but they also look a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the small crowd of people retreating one actually is heading for them. Rena immediately sees that its Beth. She crouches down to get a better look. \"I guess the doctor couldn't help?\" Beth says jokingly. Rena rolls her eyes and offers a paw for her to climb on. \"How did you guess?\" she asks sarcastically as her friend climbs aboard. \"Call it a hunch.\" Beth says, then spots the other two dragoness cats. \"Who are they?\" Rena turns to her new friends and introduces them. \"This is Callie and Abby. They've got the same thing I do, whatever the hell it is.\" she explains. \"Nice to meet you.\" Abby tells Beth. \"Same here.\" says Callie. \"I see you're the biggest gal around.\" Beth notices as she compares the girls sizes. Rena again rolls her eyes. \"Yeah, well we're on our way back to the doctor. He said there are some experts who can help us.\" she says. \"Why did you leave the city?\" Beth wonders. The three dragons blush a little. \"We...kind of got mad and ran away.\" Callie admits. Beth smirks as they head to the doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrive they notice that the roof is broken. \"What happened?\" Beth ask. Rena gives her a look that says \"As if you don't know.\" Beth giggles as they near the building. The doctor appears to be outside talking to a man in a dark suit. When the girls footsteps shake the ground they look up. \"Sorry we took off like that.\" Abby apologizes. \"Yeah, but whats with all these guys? I thought you said the experts wouldn't be here until tomorrow.\" Rena asks, noticing the men surrounding the building. They appear to be some kind of military group. The man in the suit answers her question. \"Well, when we learned about your \"outburst\" we rushed over.\" he says. The three dragons are getting a little nervous about the men surrounding them. \"Whats with the army guys?\" Callie asks. \"Don't mind them, just come with us. Believe it or not this is happening to girls in a number of places. We've already responded to some reports so we know what we're doing.\" Beth and Rena share a worried look. \"This doesn't feel right.\" Callie whispers. Rena and Abby nod in agreement.

We want help and you just want to lock us up?\" Rena says angrily. Callie and Abby are also getting mad and it definitely starts to show. \"Back off!\" Callie shouts and hisses at them. Abby has started to growl, and soon enough all three of them each let out a dragon like roar. Rena then pauses and looks as if she's struggling. Then a pair of leathery wings begin to sprout out of her back. Callie and Abby have both sprouted white wings as well. The men surrounding them raise their weapons defensively as the dragon girls inspect their new wings. They look at each other and decide to try something in the heat of the moment. With some effort they manage to get their wings moving and take off into the sky. Everyone begins shooting but the bullets don't really hurt them that much. Rena makes sure to shield Beth as they fly away into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them rise higher and higher in an attempt to make distance. They wobble to and fro, still not used to flying, but manage to stay air born. \"Where are we going?\" Abby shouts to Rena. \"I don't know!\" she says. \"I just wanted to get away from there!\" They fly for what seems forever before lowering down toward the ground. They touch down in a forest and rest for a couple of hours. \"Well this has turned into a weird day.\" Beth says. \"I'm so sorry for getting you mixed up in this.\" Rena tells her. Beth pats Rena's big foot. \"Don't worry about it, friends stick together.\" she says. \"Yeah!\" Callie and Abby both say. Seems like they're fugitives now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey explore the woods to try and see where they are and come across something. \"Come here!\" Callie whispers. They all keep hidden and look to see a huge wall with turrets mounted on it. \"Whats going on here?\" Beth wonders when they see a big truck drive to the gate. Attached to it is a huge cage on wheels containing another dragon girl. She's a tabby with orange fur with black stripes. She's a little bigger than Callie and Abby with horns resembling a steer's. She's restrained and looks pretty sad.  Past the gate they also see another girl with gray fur with three horns, like a triceratops. She's about the same size and even has wings. She's in chains and her wings are tethered to the ground. Rena and her fellow fugitives feel a burst of anger once again. \"This is what they want to do to us!\" Rena says through clenched teeth. \"We have to help them!\" No one argues so the rescue is initiated.</span></div></div>",

She saw wildflowers growing high enough to reach past her head and sniffed one. She saw several birds fly up into the sky and exotic fish swimming in the water underneath her deck. Rena climbed up and reached up to pick a pineapple to eat it. \"Everything is wonderful,\" she said to herself. \"This island is paradise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Rena thought but what she didn't know, nor did anything else on the island know that the military was practicing with atomic weapons. There was a submarine nearby and inside the general was looking at the pilot. \"We have our heading General Bader,\" said the pilot. \"The island is in site.\" The general gave a glare and looks out to the island as another soldier comes forward. \"Sir,\" he said. \"I seriously think we should be reconsidering this. These bombs are still in the testing phase.\" \"What do you think we're doing here?\" asked General Bader. \"Fire the first bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot nodded his head but then he realized something as he zoomed in to see Rena feeding several birds. \"Wait a minute General,\" he said. \"I think there's somebody living on the island.\" The pilot showed an image of Rena and the general looked at the neko on screen. \"Who is that?\" he asked. \"An escapee from our genetic weapons division. Blast the island.\" \"But general,\" said the pilot. \"General, she's a living thing.\" \"She's a freak. Fire away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes sir,\" said the pilot. \"I understand.\" The pilot gulps and then pressed the button to launch a torpedo that went through the water at high speed and released atomic energy. The general watched as the torpedo's energy caused several sharks to go belly up and then the torpedo started to surface as it closed in. Rena got up and heard the sound as she let out a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl climbed up a tree and then looked out to see the missile closing in. Before she can react, the bomb struck the island and made it go up in a mushroom cloud. As the smoke and fire cleared up, what was once a tropical paradise has been transformed into a burnt up wasteland, all the birds and fish were dead and Rena was laying down motionless. She was holding her chest in pain as fallout came down from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena coughed and struggled to get up, she had no idea how she survived such a terrible fate and even coughed up what looked like green vomit. However as Rena felt her shoulder, she learned that she was bleeding the same green liquid. She opened her eyes and they flashed yellow as she let out a grunt. That's when her muscles begin to bulged out and she let out a frantic meow as her fangs grew sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Bader and his men homed in on the destroyed island and the pilot looked on in surprise. \"General,\" said the pilot. \"It's that cat girl. She somehow survived the bombing.\" \"So the bomb didn't quite work.\" Said the general in disappointment. \"And I'm afraid there's more bad news.\" Said a technician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was coming over Rena. First she started to grow spikes down her back and a large hump on her neck. Then she lost patches of her fur as she held out her hands and then her claws extended and she sprouted a second set from the knuckles on each of her hands. She sprouted a lizard like spin on her back and then she started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" yelled General Bader as he looked on. \"This isn't possible. This kind of anomaly shouldn't be happening in real life. However, the anomaly was happening and Rena kept on growing until she was 200ft tall. Rena let out a loud roar and then breathed out atomic fire. She then walked out into the water and saw the submarine. \"Destroy her!\" yelled the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sub shot all the torpedoes it could but they explosions didn't even dent Rena's new body. Rena instead dove into the water, grabbed the sub with her mouth and crushed it between her jaws. The sub blew up and the crew perished. But now Rena was mad at the world and out for destruction. Where does she start?</span></div></div>",

It was the shear ordinariness that made what happened next such a shock. While driving to work, she heard a text message. Grabbing her phone she looked down at it for only a second barley reading it... However it was enough. When she looked up, she was about to crash into someone. She swerved out of the way and crashed into a fire hydrant. Her seat belt broke off and she flew forward into her airbag. Somehow she managed to survive the impact... But the airbag malfunctioned and didn't retract properly. The same piece of equipment that had saved her life was now strangling her. As she gasped for breath and the world went dark she screamed in anger in her mind at the unfairness of it all. It was so unfair... However it seemed death agreed. It offered her the deal, that she would be able to return to the mortal world on the exception that she does so as a giantess and takes five lives in order to save her own. Not thinking of the lives she was agreeing to end, she took the deal instantly. However as she woke up she began to wonder, could she really kill five people to save herself?</span></div></div>",

She has sparkling green eyes, long red hair down to her shoulders, with a skinny figure with a flat chest and butt (but that's soon to change )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was hiking through a thick jungle Amazon like Forest. She couldn't believe she got duped by her college professor into venturing this trek without the group just because he was lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had wondered into a lush section but didn't seem to notice the lack of wild life as she approached a clearing with a lake. The clearing was obscured and given cover by both several of the biggest trees imaginable as well as a mysterious  Misty fog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena hadn't noticed a very old decaying sign covered in moss with some kind of ancient text on it.<br>\r\nShe also paid little noticed to the fact the lake was devoid of all life but also that the plant life nearest the lake as she approached was larger than it should be. In fact not just large huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed a few roses that were as tall or taller than her then some mushrooms 3 times her size. A virtual scene out of Alice In Wonderland. Finally she was at the lakes edge. She sat her stuff down exhausted and thirsty. Rena couldn't resist. The lake gave off a shiny mysterious glowing aura. She cupped her hands together and drank a few handfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn't believe the taste. Was this really water? It had a fruity minty crisp taste yet it was subtle and still had the consistency of water. As she sat on the shore staring at the lake she sampled. She was too mesmerized to notice her fatigue and hunger fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cuts and bruises started to heal yet she starred at the lake captivated. It seemed to be beckoning her the urge getting stronger and stronger. Her cat ears flicked. She realized she was dirty and sweaty. An idea popped into her head. She have a look around and a listen. Fully convinced no intelligent life was anywhere nearby she stripped all her clothing off. She looked at her surroundings and spotted the mushrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this jungle is strange! At least there's a food source too\" she said walking over to the giant shroom. She looked in awe. It had to be at least 16 feet tall the ones on either side slightly taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached forward dug in with both hands and broke off a size able piece to her at least at her size. She took a bite and walked back over to the lake. She didn't notice the spot she took from the mushroom grow back or the 3 mushrooms grow taller. As she walked back to the lake she felt odd but it soon passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her reflection. Something seemed off. She looked bigger?! Nah it couldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like Alice In Wonderland\" she said. Then she ate the baseball sized piece of mushroom till it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course even Alice wasn't this flat\" she lamented looking at her reflection then putting her fingers her bug bite size nipples. \"I swear without these I'd think I didn't have a chest area at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she decided to make her way into the lake. She stopped once the water was waist high and sat down again a cool rock. She splashed some water over herself. She didn't notice as her fur seemed to vanish off her chest or hair disappear of her legs arms and neither parts. She was looking slightly more human but retained her cat ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact she rubbed her orange tail with black stripes clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh that's weird my tail feels longer? Thicker? ... Heavier?! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she started to feel strange again. Her eyes widened as her chest tingle then 2 mounds started to form under her nipples which now hardened and were normal size. She watched before her eyes as a pair of breasts formed then became A Cup , B Cup and stopped at mid C cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had her dream come true but they were the perfect size to her. Luckily they weren't going to grow in cup size but had she not been preoccupied by her breasts she'd notice her body was growing the water from the lake seemingly being absorbed into her body. Her growth spurt left her at 10 feet tall as it stopped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like with any great superhero in fictional material, a good origin is key to the character. It is what defines them as a person and what makes them tick. And like those men and women of fiction, our heroine Rena Westfall must have a tale of her own. One where she will find her goal to push toward. But since there is more then one writer for Rena's adventures, it's only fair that there should be more then one tale to tell. So, I decided instead of one, we should have three different origin tales for three different Renas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One:<br>\r\nRena is your average nerd. Good grades in collage, knowledge like a dictionary, and can talk for hours about how Deathstroke will always beat Deadpool or how Hulk could crush Superman any day of the week. Rena is also an avid collector of comic books, both Marvel, DC and a few rare titles. She loves superhero fiction the most out of all her different collections, and she has a secret wish that she would love to become a superhero herself, more than anything. But this is easier then she would think because in her world, super heroes and villains are real things, fighting crime or stealing jewels around the city as we speak. So as what might start as a normal day for Rena will become extremely abnormal as fate conspires to turn the nerdy, glasses-wearing cat-girl into a ultra-sexy super hero force of justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two:<br>\r\nOne of the greatest parts of writing is creating something that isn't just similar to norm. So in this story, the year is 2634, and America is a very different place. In this timeline, America is a fascist state. Everything from education to religion to how many children that are born is controlled by the Countrymen, a group of lords that live in the tower of heaven, which rises far into the atmosphere. The cities are split into two parts, with the rich and powerful men and women living on sky islands in total luxury, with robot servants and massive homes. The workers however, live in far poorer homes on the land, often cramped and badly made, pushing themselves just to get the required money to live. Gangs are rife and law is rare. Rena is lucky, having found work in the more dangerous genetic factories, getting to live in one of the better areas. However one day when Rena is caught in an accident with a female enhancement product and military chemicals that mix up her DNA. Rather then try to have the incident covered up, she is given better living conditions for her and her family in exchange for her taking care of the other mutants that are common in the city. But Rena is a kind person at heart, and she will always try to help if she can. Can she change the city of America into a better place, or will she become another pawn of the state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Three:<br>\r\nThe furthest from the original, in the year 2240, the water city of Elysian is one of the most advanced cities in the world, fitting a population of the worlds best and brightest citizens in luxury as they work for the betterment of humanity. Often a target of bullying as a child, here Rena is a cynical scientist that specialises in genetic engineering in order to speed up the evolution of humans in one of the most advanced science areas on earth. This has allowed her to find a way to enhance the human form to superhuman abilities. However, after having her funding cut for lack of results, she uses a prototype superhuman injection on herself to get back at the bumbling baboons in the higher office that are destroying her hard work. However, a genetic impurity in the injection causes her breasts to swell to a massive size. Becoming the super villain \"Black Bosom\", she is determined to get what she thinks she deserves from this city. Will she continue her super villainous ways to get what she wants no matter what, or will she find that she doesn't have the heart of be a selfish villain for to long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for all of those who want to read the original Cleavage Cat by Faceless One and System_Crash,  use this link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n:http://www.furaffinity.net/view/4318103<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMembership is required for some of the chapters.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fairtropolis, California. What could you say about it? It was an expansive city, larger than NYC, split into multiple districts according to their primary businesses. There was the industrial district, which was mainly factories, steel mills, power plants, etc. The entertainment district, comprised of theaters, both movie and stage, restaurants, sporting arenas and the like. There was also the business district, made up mostly of banks, corporate offices, and other such things. Lastly, there was the residential district , where the majority of the city's population lived. It was made up of homes, apartments, some of which were in better neighbourhoods than others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly a nice place to visit, but not many would choose to live there. For you see, just like any other city, Fairtropolis had it's fair share of crime. There were gangs infesting the poorer neighbourhoods, the local mafia running prostitution and extortion rackets, and a number of other problems. But it wasn't all bad, thanks to the Union of Heroes, a global organization of superpowered beings dedicated to protecting the innocent and punishing evildoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quaint little home in this not so quaint city lived Rena Westfall, your typical average nerd. Graduated from the University of California at the top of her class, made the honor roll throughout grade school, and a master of anything electronic. You're probably thinking she must be a doctor, or some sort of scientist. But you would be wrong. For you see, Rena may have been a genius, and could easily have landed some high paying job in a lab or university, but instead, after she graduated, she choose to forsake all that in favor of working in a comic book store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would someone with Rena's intellect work in a comic shop? There were a few reasons, actually. You see, Rena had always been a bit of a tomboy. Ever since she learned to read, Rena loved comics of all kinds. Newspaper comics, horror, mystery, adventure, but by far her favorite was superheros. She even had an entire room in her home that was used solely to store her comic collection and various collectibles she had acquired. If you were to ask her which comic company she preferred, she wouldn't be able to choose. Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, it didn't matter to her, as long as they told a good story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother reason was that her boss, Dexter Reed, the owner of the shop, had been good friends with her in school. He was a tall, thin man with short, curly blonde hair and glasses. Rena had just graduated college, and they ran into each other for the first time in years at a coffee shop. After Dexter had told her he now owned a comic shop, and had an opening available, Rena leaped at the chance, and accepted the job. The third reason Rena choose to stay at the shop was because she was a friend, and a great employee, Dexter gave her quite a considerable discount off anything in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started out like any other for Rena. She woke up, ate breakfast, took a shower, and prepared for another day at the shop. She wore a plain green sweater, glasses, jeans and white sneakers. She didn't own a car, so she had to ride her bike to work everyday. After locking her bike to a streetlight in front of the shop, she stepped inside and took in a deep breath, inhaling the wonderful smell of new comics. The shelves of the store were lined with various comic books, posters, action figures, trading cards, basically a nerd's paradise. Behind the counter stood Dexter, a warm smile on his face. \"Hello Rena.\" Rena walked up to Dexter and gave him a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dex. Anything new today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, nothing today. Hey, did you see the news last night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Heinous tried to steal all the uranium from the power plant, but Valkyrie stopped him. They broadcast the entire battle on the news.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Damn it, I missed it! It must have been one hell of a battle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was, though one thing bothers me. These superheroes, why do they always just have the villains arrested, when they know they'll just break out, and they'll just have to fight them again? Why not just snap the bad guy's neck and be rid of them?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same reason why Batman doesn't just kill the Joker. If they killed them, then they would be no better than the criminals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you take the counter, I'm gonna do inventory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat in the chair behind the checkout counter, paging through a Wonder Woman story she had brought with her. As she read, Rena imagined herself as a superhero in the story in place of Wonder Woman. It had always been her secret desire to be a superhero herself, ever since she was little. But she knew that could never happen, because if comics had taught her anything, it was that in order for a woman to be a superhero, she had to have two things: super powers, and breasts that are at least the size of her head, and Rena had neither. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did she know that today, she would get her wish. Today was the day her life would change forever. The question is, how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena gains her powers in some sort of accident. Maybe, she gets exposed to radiation, falls into nuclear waste, or whatever means the author may decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena is selected by some sort of cosmic force/god to be the newest defender of justice on earth. Thus Cleavage Cat is born!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Rena is abducted by government agents to be a test subject for experiments that end up giving her superpowers.</span></div></div>",

Both of them lived in the residential district, although on opposite sides of it. Rena chose to walk through the shopping district, as her apartment was right next to said district. Little did she know, she was about to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was casually strolling through district, looking for a place to eat, when suddenly she felt something like a burning sledgehammer hit her in the gut. Before she could register what was happening, an uncomfortably warm hand was holding her by the scruff of the neck, dangling her hundreds of feet above the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out, come out, wherever you are, Overdrive,\" a voice called out in a singsong style. \"Burnout wants to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnout was the fire based arch-nemesis of Overdrive, who was a cheetah man given the ability to manipulate kinetic energy. Burnout, meanwhile, was a human man who was basically an evil Human Torch. Rena knew all of this because she followed the real-life superheroes as closely as the comic book ones. She didn't know everything about the heroes and villains, but she knew quite a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it, Burnout!\" A deep male voice called out. Floating a few feet below Rena was Overdrive. He wore a black bodysuit with red highlights, and a red mask covering the upper half of his face. \"Put the girl down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurnout cackled. \"Okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rena was falling. Overdrive made a strangled noise and tried to stop Rena, but he was trapped in a hard light dome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehehehe!\" Another voice cackled- the Trapper, a super-villainess who could trap anything. \"No so fast, Overdrive. You can't do a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Overdrive said. \"But my friend can! Valkyrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of strong arms caught Rena. This was Valkyrie, a, well, valkyrie from Asgard sent to help protect Earth. She had blue eyes, golden blonde hair, and wore gold armor reminiscent of Thor's. The friendship between her and Overdrive was legendary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValkyrie dropped Rena down near Rena's apartment. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded dumbly. Valkyrie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said. \"Now I must return to the fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared at where Valkyrie was for a few seconds before she clenched her fists in frustration. Valkyrie was one of the only superheroes she didn't have the autograph of! Rena stomped off into her apartment, her tail swishing angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7.........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later is when it began. Rena initially felt woozy, so she decided to take some medicine for it. However, when she got up to get the medicine, she immediately got so dizzy she fell onto her back. Instead of subsiding, Rena's dizziness go worse, until the world was spinning so much she felt like she was going to pass out. Which she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after she passed out, she started to grow- well, part of her did. Slowly, Rena's breasts began to swell, pushing her shirt up higher and higher, until eventually it burst apart. At this point her boobs were the size of basketballs and showed no signs of slowing down. Once again, slowly but surely, Rena's boobs grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a7.........\u00a7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up with her face in her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Weird,</i>' Rena thought. '<i>I didn't fall asleep like this.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat up, and her mind stopped for a second. Where just the tiniest nubs of flesh were before were a pair of breasts that were longer than Rena's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Rena said. \"I just got giant boobs overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena then jumped into the air, shouting for joy, before her boobs dragged her back down to the ground. The catgirl braced herself for impact, but never felt it. When she opened her eyes, Rena was floating above the ground, her giant boobs a fraction of an inch from the ground. Rena flipped into a sitting position and landed on her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got powers,\" Rena said, a bit in shock. \"I got giant boobs and the ability to fly. But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena remembered the previous day's events. \"Valkyrie!\" Rena deduced. \"She must've had some radiation on her still when she grabbed me. It must've reacted weirdly with her holy aura and did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena poked her left breast. \"I need to come up with an alias,\" Rena noted. \"How about... Cleavage Cat? It's simple, but my boobs have to have some power. They wouldn't be huge just to be huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stood up and found that she could tap into her flight power to make it feel like her boobs weighed nothing. She experimentally did a backflip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to figure out my powers!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena sighed, a glum look on her face as she flipped a page in the comic with a clawed hand. Rena was no reed but she was far from what she thought to be an hourglass. Her body probably had more burliness to it than most girls-human and demi-human-her age, muscle scattered evenly all over her body making her clothes feel tight against her fur. Rena's chest was like an iron board, strong durable and able to hold up a decent amount of weight if her chest wasn't just that, a board. Her butt, in comparison, was not big by any standard but it had far more jiggle to it, putting slight strain on her jeans and cat tail. At 5'10\", Rena could be promptly described as the poster girl for 'Tomboys inc. Masculine girls or your money back'. That, of course, didn\u2019t do her any favors in high school that\u2019s for sure.<br>\r\n\u201cNope, don\u2019t go there.\u201d Rena said bringing her hands up to slap her cheeks hard. She closed her comic book and did what any good counter attendant did; look idly around the shop to see if anybody is willing to buy anything. Rena stood behind the counter in the right corner, the register to her left, a display case underneath the counter and more comic books behind her alongside a door where her boss was taking inventory. Light shining from large windows spread over shelves filled with comic books from almost every known and unknown company. The shelves lined the blue walls around the shop; a few stand alone shelves in the back left corner of the room. That left a lot of open space for a purple fluffy carpet and several bean bag chairs of various colors. <br>\r\nMost of the chairs were occupied by \u201creaders\u201d, would-be customers that read books without buying them.  Rena snorted. \u2018Like I can talk.\u2019 she thought, smiling to herself. She herself spent a lot of time reading comic books between customers. On slow days like this one, she would sometimes she forget where she was and read some of the merchandise herself. Despite all the \u201creaders\u201d though, business was actually pretty steady; they made ends meet and even had a bit of surplus by the end of the month. So no she really couldn\u2019t complain. She heard the door bell ring, and turned idly to see a new potential customer\u2026and she felt time almost stop as she stared. <br>\r\nStanding halfway through entrance was probably the most attractive female Rena had ever seen. No, she is the most attractive female she had ever seen. Her olive skin was smooth and glamorous; her wavy black hair was thick and flowing down her back and over each shoulder. She wore a silky white blouse over her endowed chest which was not too voluminous to be slutty but not too small to not attract attention. Her pants held a similarly blessed butt in check along with a wide hip she would call \u2018child-worthy\u2019. Rena couldn\u2019t help but think she was witnessing the pure embodiment that was the female body. She was more than perfect, she was perfection itself. <br>\r\nTime began to flow again as she walked through door and wandered to a nearby shelf. Rena could have sworn she heard choirs of angels sing with each jiggle of her butt and each bounce of her boobs. She didn\u2019t question who this woman was or why she was in a comic book store of all places. She merely watched, helpless to this woman\u2019s beauty, as the woman picked up a comic book-Batman Origins: Issue 1-and skimmed through the first few pages. Deciding that she wanted it, she closed it and turned two cool gray eyes toward her. Rena\u2019s spine shivered under the woman\u2019s scrutiny and she had to look away. When she looked up again the woman was so close she could\u2019ve reached out and touched her. She almost did when heard the most unearthly sound she would ever hear.<br>\r\n\u201cHow much for this?\u201d the woman said. Her voice was no single sound but an entire symphony of voices singing acapella softly through her ears. It was so beautiful she felt her eyes water from just the sound of it. So enamored by the woman\u2019s voice she forgot she was asked a question.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026it\u2019s uh\u2026that\u2019s uh\u2026\u201d she stammered as she fiddled with the register trying to find how much the item cost. It was a few minutes before she remembered she could just scan comic book to find the price. Blushing heavily beneath her fur, she picked up the price reader and scanned the book for the price. <br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026That\u2019s $18.86\u201d she managed to say. The woman smiled a glorious smile with teeth so white they glowed. She pulled a wallet out of her right pocket and took out $20.00. <br>\r\nRena took it from her and was going give back her change when she asked, \u201cHave you read this before?\u201d Again the symphony of echoes hit her ears. So lovingly her voice caressed Rena\u2019s ears, she almost had a sound orgasm.<br>\r\nShe blushed again. \u201cYeah, I read it and next 10 issues as well.\u201d She said, more than a little pride sneaking into her voice.<br>\r\nThe woman giggled, a plethora of small baby animal sounds couldn\u2019t have been more adorable. \u201cYou must like superhero books a lot.\u201d<br>\r\nStill blushing, Rena nodded as she took the woman\u2019s change from the register. \u201cI wish I could become a superhero like Valkyrie. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Her eyes involuntarily glanced at her chest.<br>\r\nThe woman smiled again, shivers so intense went up her spine that she had to look away lest she faint. \u201cThere\u2019s more to being a hero than just having the right amount of cleavage. You might learn that someday.\u201d she said, holding out her hand for her change. Just as Rena was about to drop the change into the woman\u2019s hand, the woman grabbed her. Rena was not attracted to girls, but she knew that had she been a lesbian or bisexual, the second she touched the woman\u2019s milky soft hand she would have orgasmed and fainted. The woman\u2019s hand felt better than they looked; it felt like God put fluff from his own pillow into that woman\u2019s hands. She stood there for more than a few minutes before she noticed that the woman wasn\u2019t holding her hand anymore. She also noticed that there was something in her right hand. She looked down to see a strange metal, shaped into a infinity symbol but with two sharp hooks on both sides curved towards the middle and almost forming a circle. <br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026is this yours?\u201d Rena asked the beautiful women. <br>\r\nAgain the women smiled. \u201cThink of it as a gift.\u201d Rena was about to ask what she meant when the metal started to sear her skin. She screamed try to fling the object away but it unnaturally stuck to her skin only getting hotter and hotter. The smell of burnt fur and cooked meat reached her nose as her knees buckled underneath her and she fell to the floor squirming. Pain flooded her senses, her entire existence was pain and she could feel nothing else. She screamed and screamed and screamed until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The last thing she saw as her hand burned away to nothing was the woman\u2019s face absent of all emotion except sadness; and sadness was beautiful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elysian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pinnacle city the press called it. One of the greatest human creations of the 23rd century, it was a city the size of Wales that sailed across earths vast ocean and was teaming with incredible technological marvels, created for the purpose of the scientific advancement and the evolution of humanity. Elysian was the brain child of Multimillionaire and business owner Matthew Clay, a massive vessel with a population of 175,000 of the world\u2019s top scientific minds, their families and the massive 2,000,000 strong work force. Rather than being built on a colony world like so many other science outposts, Elysian was made as a massive floating artificial island in the Pacific ocean of earth, both to keep it close to home, and use it as the symbol of Earth\u2019s scientific developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile technically a state of America, Elysian is entirely self-ruled and self-reliant.  Shaped like a sword and being held inside a massive dome, the city itself consists of three circular layers going outwards on the surface and a single scarcely populated layer layer beneath the other three that remains below the water line. The central and smallest layer is Amoria, right in the middle, where the most powerful businessmen and women live in complete comfort with a constant supply of good foods, fine wines and other rich things. But it doesn't stop there. The buildings here are said to look like they were made for gods. Massive mansions and villas that have been specially made for the owners, colored white and gold to keep the land looking pure with the sky behind it. Along with the homes here are large rolling green plains and calm sunny beaches, all placed on one single disc, kept aloft from the land below by eight truly massive pillars that spring out from the centre, and with the dome stopping around the edge of the layer to give the rich access to the sky. The people here live in harmony, kept comfortable by thousands of robotic servants that cook and clean everything with the help of C.R.O.N.U.S, the master A.I, in charge of all the systems that would be too difficult and costly to be handled by normal people. It is also one of the most secure places on earth, partly because of the powerful guests, but mostly because of sheer amount of secret data, documents and technology that are kept within the walls. This is because along with C.R.O.N.U.S, the Amoria layer contains all of the information gathered in the different fields of Elysian, years of research condensed into a single mass server, located in the absolute heart of the city. The server is a lucrative goldmine for those of ill intent, with the data located in that drive being worth millions to the right people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second layer, Eronia, is the business layer, where the less wealthy or important people work for long hours in hundreds of difference scientific fields, each trying to master its own skills until they have complete control and understanding over it. Unlike the first layer, and due to Eronia\u2019s pure focus on work, this layer consists purely of grey factories on the outer circle and giant glass skyscrapers on the inner circle, many of which are actually tall enough to touch the fake sky from the roof. The area is not entirely dedicated to work however. Many building have their own lunch rooms in wide open garden areas with lush grass and trees, and the streets themselves hold many small shops for people to purchase items or order takeout. This is not all that the Eronia layer has in terms of comfort, but the other leisure\u2019s are not worthy of note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third layer, Belierin, also has little of note. This is the home sector, where the people of Elysian return to their families after long days of hard labor. This is where the majority of homes are located, kept away from the eyesores such as factories or skyscrapers. Even though this layer is not nearly as important as the others, it is obvious that much time and effort was invested into making it. Almost all the buildings here are the utmost in home life, with the building being spacious, warm and having access on call to any leisure such as film, games, exercise equipment etc. For those with a lower pay grade, Elysian still has millions of lower quality houses that are still well beyond the standard of modern living, and still include many luxuries. Outside of housing, this layer is also dotted with many public sector buildings, such as swimming baths or zoos, and contains many other fun activities such as amusement parks or theaters, places of enjoyment for the many residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from these 3 surface layers, there is only one more area worthy of note. Thalasia is the very last layer, underneath all of the fancy surface layers and always below the water line, it is what keeps the vast city afloat through stormy weather or frozen waters, and it suffers for it. Unlike the rest of the city above, Thalasia does not prosper from advanced scientific knowledge or a heavy technological influence. Rather, it is a mess of pipe works and rickety walkways, only meant for occasional visits and not an actual living space. There is no sunlight down there, only red lights that serve only illuminate the grime and not to help you feel at home. The people here are tough, alone, and often here illegally. This layer is the center of almost all crime in the city, and is impossible to purge without irreparable damage to the city above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though Elysian\u2019s crime is rampant, that is not what the city is known for. And even though the city has technological marvels that surpass even the most fertile imagination, that is not what the city is known for either. Despite attempts from the government to keep it out of spotlight, the Eronia layer does hold one more building that many living in the city would view as by far the most important. A single building known as Anora; Heroes Palace, as some call it. Anora is the most recent addition to the city, a massive Pyramid shaped glass building, placed near the tip of the sword like vessel, connected by vast monorails to all parts of the city. It is here that the Legion of Guardians reside, a publicly funded organisation dedicated to helping the people of Elysian survive against the criminals and villains that reside within the cities walls. But unlike a conventional police force (which they still have), the Legion does not consist of normal men and women. Rather, the people in the Legion are people who go above and beyond. They are the Super Heroes of the city, Champions of Justice and Defenders of the Weak. They are the best of the best, each with their own unique Super Powers and unique abilities, ready to be used whenever they are needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite what the press might say, they are very much needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, for all of Elysian\u2019s technological advancement and biological mastery, human nature still tries to erode the foundation of this so called perfect city. Just as a hammer can be used as a tool of creation, it does not take much to take that tool and turn it into a weapon. And this is all too common in Elysian. Since its creation 30 years ago, there have been those who have tried to take Elysian\u2019s hard work and turn it into a tool of profit or revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor every super hero in the city, there is a villain to counter them, someone who wants to turn the city on its head for personal gain. Some are former scientists of the city, angry at how they are treated despite their hard work. Others are crime bosses, dedicated to turning the city into their own personal playground. And some people are just rotten to begin with, hating perfection and wanting nothing more than to tear it all down and make sure it can never start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut overtime, this has now become all too common place, and the people no longer bat an eye as the next villain declares he will make Elysian his kingdom, nor when the next hero enters the fray promising to serve the city and protect the city. People have grown passive to the fighting, just as the heroes and villains have become passive to each other, leaving the city all but unprepared for what would happen when one woman decides she has just had enough.</span></div></div>",

I'm late for my flu shot!\" she shouted, grabbing her wallet and rushing out the door, barely taking enough time to lock up the house.After a thirty-minute bicycle trip, Rena managed to get to the hospital. The good news was that she arrived on time after all. The bad news was she could have arrived late if she wanted to because there was a long waiting list of people already ahead of her. Rena signed the waiting list, took a number, and sat down.\u00a0She probably would have been bored out of her mind had she not spied something out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn't want to look directly and be rude but she saw a mother breast feeding her baby. That alone probably wouldn't be too odd, but Rena noticed that the young mother was rather stacked of her age. Rena couldn't help but be a bit envious; while wasn't completely flat, she was only a A-cup and all of her friends were larger than her. Maybe if she wasn't so small, then people would notice her more often\u2026.Rena's little envy session was cut short when she heard her name being called. Rena sat down in the chair and listen to the technician as he explain the procedure as he was using the swab and where he was going to stick the needle; considering she been through this her whole life and already knew what to except, she couldn't help to think that maybe the explanation was more for the sake of the technician than for her. He was quite young and seemed kind of nervous, as if he hadn\u2019t done this very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shoot was over, the technician gave her a band-aid and instructed her not to take it off for at least three hours. She thanked the technician and went on her way. What she didn't know was that the technician goofed up and accidentally gave her an experimental hormone therapy shot. It was still in the testing phase to treat older women going through menopause, but in such a young girl like Rena, it would overdrive her breast development and cause her breasts to increase in size exponentially over several weeks, reaching massive sizes that's normally not possible in nature, as well as cause excessive (and possibly embarrassing) lactation. Unfortunately, the vial and the needle used were already disposed in the hazardous waste material, which was shortly emptied by the hospital staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rena went about her day as normal, completely unaware of what really happened. She put on her usual shorts and t-shirt in preparation for bed and fell asleep. While she was sleeping, the hormone therapy started to take affect and alter her body. In the morning, she woke up to discover...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rena's arm reached out and began to rapidly push buttons to stop the thing's obnoxious sounds.<br>\r\nShe threw away and sat up, yawning, thinking to herself: \"Just another ordinary day.\"<br>\r\nOr was it? Rena suddenly felt a slightly heavy weight dangling from her chest. When she looked down, she was greeted by a pair of larger bosoms, its erect nipples poking at her shirt, leaking strange substance that stained her shirt a darker colour.<br>\r\nThe cat girl was surprised. \"Now how did this happen?\" she asked herself. She pulled off her shirt to further examine this strange situation. Yup, they were definitely larger; her breasts, that were only about the size of A cups yesterday, had grown to the size the size of C cups.<br>\r\nThe cat girl wasn't sure to be glad or freaked out by her magically bigger, so she only remained with a nonchalant expression, squeezing her tender breasts, watching how the milk leaked out of her nips and soak her already wet fur. It felt heavy, and so dame full!<br>\r\nAfter her senses returned, she climbed out of bed and headed off to the bathroom, trying her best to come up with some rational conclusion how this all happened.<br>\r\n\"This could just be a dream.\" No, it felt just to real to be a dream. \"Maybe it's an allergic reaction.\" But what allergic reaction could possibly make THIS happen?<br>\r\nThe water was just right when Rena stepped into the shower, trying her best to ignore her boobs, which jiggled and bounced with each step. The water that ran down the drain was white as the cat girl washed herself with soap.<br>\r\n\"What if they get bigger during the day or leak more milk and stain my clothing,\" she thought to herself, rubbing her breasts in circles. It would be a pity if that happened, for she had to go to work today at. The embarrassment would be excruciating.<br>\r\nRena was caught between a rock and a hard place. Her first solution was to pretend that she was sick and stay at home, but she knew very well that she could not keep that excuse up forever. Her other solution was risk being seen and go to a doctor to get herself checked out.<br>\r\nBut what choice does she take</span></div></div>",

If she could have sat up suddenly she would have, but the new weight on her chest forced her to move a bit more slowly. Rena was momentarily stunned, totally confused by the extra baggage on her chest.Ripping the sheets away, Rena understood what it was, both physically and mentally. The rough movement of the cloth, combined with the softness of her fur, and the amazing sight before her, was enough to change her vocal from screaming to purring. A pair of new, huge, and unexplainably wet breasts greeted her. Her rational mind piped up just long enough for one comment, 'How did these get here?' It was just as quickly silenced by the slight swaying of her own breasts, and, more accurately, the depraved thoughts that followed. And was this moistness...milk? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose then picked up on the scent, activating an instinct ingrained deep into her DNA.She began to lick her breasts clean.

Her breasts, unconfined by the clothing, jiggled gently, and the air began to evaporate the thin sheen of milk covering them, causing them to cool, and her nipples to become rock hard. The sensation was greeted by furious, wet licking. Rena went about cleaning much the way any other cat did; all business. Even the pleasure was managed, and judged second in priority to removing the sweet nectar from her hardened nipples. She used her right paw to lift it's respective breast to her face, and cleaned it carefully, going from top to bottom, but saving the nipple for last.Even her natural knowledge couldn't stop the catgirl from spending longer than needed there. Her nipple had swelled to a good size, thanks to the milk. It was about as large as the first joint of her pinky, and she sucked it tenderly, kneading it with both hands, marching softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small trickle of sweetness rewarded her efforts, but it was hardly even one mouthful that she got, through ten solid minutes of nursing, during which the flow decreased to a minute discharge hardly more than dripping. Soon, however, the sensation of the drying milk on her left breast called her, slightly saddened, away from her right teat.She went about it much the same: Very calm and cool, until she found the nipple, which she spent several minutes suckling. It too ran dry quickly, and Rena could only think that her shirt had absorbed about as much as she drank. So satisfied, her feline instincts regressed, and her rational mind emerged again, still nearly as confused as she had been 20 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there in a slight daze for a few moments, her breasts, ever so slowly, dripping with milk, before she snapped out of it. In her usual spirit, a huge grin split her face, and she could hardly keep from whooping her satisfaction to the world. Her dream had finally been realized! Why it was happening, her mind had given up figuring out. However, Rena was going to enjoy this...Well, that's what she thought, until she realized...</span></div></div>",

Rena, no longer able to enjoy herself thanks to the need to hurry, quickly pressed her breasts together and then proceeded to gently squeeze her nipples, checking to see if she still had any milk left in her. Nothing came out and her nipples were starting to shrink down again, disappearing underneath her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that she was empty and dry enough, Rena quickly threw a shirt on, thankful that her shorts didn't get soaked. Of course, Rena couldn't help but blush as she took one last look at her night shirt, still soaked with milk.Rena ran to the door and opened it. A rather surprised package delivery woman was there to greet her, somewhat distracted by the catgirl's bust, which seemed to grown to an E cup overnight. Well, it could have been worse. At least it wasn't someone she knew.\"Erm...package for...a Miss Rena? No last name listed...\"\"Yes, I'm Rena.\"\"Right...if you could just sign this for me.\"Rena nodded as she signed for the package, unable to accidently brush against her breasts once with her arms while grabbing the pen and writing her name on the work order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now she looked like an idiot trying to get used to having implants; no doubt that was probably going to be this woman\u2019s assumption.\"Okay, thank you and have a nice day.\" the delivery woman said before walking away to her truck. Rena closed the door and locked it, still feeling embarrassed. She was thankful for the fact that she just started her paid vacation now but as she laid the package on her coffee table and sat down on the couch, she started to wonder about her breasts. How did this happen and why? At first she was overjoyed but seeing that delivery woman and her reaction shook her back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to face co-workers and no doubt deal with less than admirable guys hitting on her constantly...granted, she would like to be noticed more but not by everyone. And then there was what happened this morning. She wasn't going to leak more milk, would she? If that happened, she might as well start selling her breast milk as a part time job! She heard about women doing that but only for short periods of time. And then there was the fact about her size. How did that happen anyways? She wasn't going to get larger, was she? ...maybe a little larger wouldn't be too bad but....Rena's thoughts were interrupted when she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition originally by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena pushed her thoughts and concers aside, taking the package and walking into her living room where she set it down on the table. At first, she was curious and was going to open the package, but even as she turned to go and get something to cut the tape she began to notice something. Her breasts were starting to feel heavier. Rena paused, looking down at the large cleveage that now protrude from her chest.Rather stifly, she put her arms down at her side, puffing her chest a bit so her breasts protruded even more before quickly swaying side to side. As Rena did, she felt her breasts having more lag, and she defiantly heard a strange sloshing sound. Her hands moved from her sides to her breasts, holding one in each hand as she gently squeezed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definatly felt like her breasts were getting fuller, but how could that be. She had just emptied herself before the package woman arrived. She couldn't produce milk that fast, could she.Still, as if in response Rena began to feel a discomfort in her breasts, and she coiuld actually feel the skin of her mammaries pushing against her hands. They were filling up, and doing it quickly. Rena began to panic, she could actually feel them getting heavier, and as they filled her breassts began to protrude out further and turned from a pair of soft mounds to tightly stretched, round spheres of skin.Rena cringed a bit as she walked over to the kitchen, searching beneath her sink before quickly finding a bucket. Still, some part of her made her put the bucket back. Her milk, actually tasted pretty good She hadn't ever been a big fan of cow milk, though she still drank it the stuff wasn't on the top of her list of things to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her milk was different, it tasted better, and Rena found herself wantingn to taste it again.So, after putting the bucket away Rena went into one of the cupboards and pulled out a large mixing bowl. She then took the bowl, which was easily large enough to hold all the liquid, and went over to the table. She sat down, taking her shirt off and letting her breasts hanging over the bowl as one her hands began to search for her nipple. Her nipple, however, was flat and normal, and Rena couldn't get any milk from it, even as the pressure of liquid inside her began to reach a more painful level.Rena paused to think, trying to remember what she did that morning to get her nipple to harden. It was then she realized that she had been licking herself, the part of her that was cat wanting to clean herself of the milk. Mindlessly, Rena tried to lift the breast to her mouth again, but it had swollen to much She would have to encourage the nipple another way.Finally, after sitting thinking for a moment Rena got an idea. She lifted her fingers to her moth, licking them and getting the tips of her pointer and middle finger really wet before reaching back down and starting to massage her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shivered a little bit of this. Since she wasn't under the control of her cat natured cleaning she could actually enjoy some of the pleasure that came from massaging, or basically feeling herself up.Still, it began to work, the nipple starting to harden before releasing the sweet milky nectar into the bowl. Rena smile, bring her finger back and licking it again just to get a small taste of the milk before she continued massaging, encouraging every drop of milk out of her breasts. Thank god that she worked at home and only telecommuted to work. She also didn't have a lot to do that day, a couple reports to fill out and a presentation to make for her supervisor. She had to get together with her coworkers every Monday for staff meetings and project reports, but it was Wednesday, so she had a while before she would have to face them.\u00a0After a few minutes Rena's right breasts was oncec again empty, and she began to work on her left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk flowed slowly, her nipple giving it up in a slow, small constant stream that slipped down into the bowl. Her hand, simply getting wet by the milk it was around, continued to rub and gently pull on the tit, encouraging more and more of the milk to sneak out. Finally, twenty minutes after she had started, Rena was once agains dry and she sat back from her table, hands mindlessly rubbing her breasts together as she enjoyed the pleasure coming from them for a few more minutes.When she was done, Rena slowly opened an eye and looked at the breast milk. The bowl itself wasn't even that large, consider it was a very large bowl she used when baking anything. Still, she guessed there had to be at least a glass full in the bottom, and instead of letting it go to waste she picked the bowl up and began to drink.The milk really did taste wonderful, a little creamier then common milk, had a sweeter taste, and just something else about it. It was kind of personal, like a meal you cooked yourself. Even if you did something horribly wrong, and someone else might think it tastes disgusting, you can still say its all right because you made it, and something about that makes it better to you. Maybe the same was with her milk. Milk was all right by itself, but because it was HER own milk it tasted a little, heck a lot better.Rena down th bowl full, smiling as she licked her lips and caught any dripples that had slipped past the seems of her mouth. She then stretched and yawned, getting up from the table and glancing over at the package. She'd open it later, once she finished work.With that Rena walked into the small room she had turned into her home office, sitting down and looking out her window before getting to work. It was a little awkward typing with her breasts blocking the view of the keys and brushing against her arms. Still, she managed, having become such a good typist she really didn't need to look at the keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena always like working at home because she blew through the work quickly, didn't have to worry so much about people interrupting her, and there wasn't any commute.Still, an hour later Rena felt that her breasts were full again, and the front of her shirt was starting to show small wet points were her nipples were now struggling to hold back the pressure. Rena, starting to feel the pain from the pressure, got up and went back to the kitchen where she went through the same ritual as before, milking herself into the bowl and then, when it was all said and done, drinking the milk down. Still, as Rena finished she noticed that there seemed to be a small bit more milk then before. She then just dismissed it as a strange trick of the light before going back to work.The day went much like that, Rena able to get in an hour worth of work before she have to take twenty to thirty minutes to milk herself and then drink down the slowly increasing supply of milk. By three o clock, when her work was done, Rena found herself gettting full again, and went to the kitchen to once again milk herself. Since she had done it so many time that day Rena had gotten very good at getting all the milk out quickly, but even as she sat massaging her nipples, topless in her own home, she had to wonder what would happen if she didn't milk herself.Finally, with her breasts emptied and the milk from them drank Rena went into the living room, going about her usual Wednesday routine of doing some exercises, watching a bit of television, and doing her usual weekly round about the house with the vacuum. Still, each of these small tasks were inhanced, at least in Rena's opinion, by her breasts.During her work out, as she jumped, swayed, and bent her breasts followed if only a little delayed, sending waves of sensation along Rena's spine. They rubbed against each other in her now tight fitting work out shirt, rubbing and swaying and driving Rena wild. Still, as it had been all day, an hour after she had milked herself Rena felt hre breasts filling up again, in which she went back to the kitchen, emptied them, drank the milk, and then went to the living room to watch her favorite television shows before vacuuming the house.By the end of the day, Rena had probably dranken three galloons worth of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as she changed out of her clothes she could feel her breasts starting to fill again. Were they going to do this all night, wake her up every hour to be milked. Rena didn't think about it, and feeling to lazy to go get the bowl decided to try doing what she had done that morning.Lying naked in her own bed, which was all right since all the blinds were pulled shut, Rena lifted one of the breasts to her mouth and began suckling it, using one hand to hod up the soft, warm breasts as he rlips and tongue worked to remove every drop of milk. She sat there, purring sligtly as she felt her tongue playing with her hardened nipple. Still, after indulging herself on her left nipple for a while Rena went to the right, drinking and playing with it until both breasts were empty. Then, with a smile on her face and a little milk on her chin, Rena slipped under the covers, not bothering to put any pajamas on before slipping off into the land of dreams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter originally by Nameless One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up shivering a bit, feeling very....wet? Rena remembered what happened yesterday morning...did she?\u00a0Rena sat up in her bed and pulled the covers off of herself...and gasp slightly. Just as she feared, her breasts continued lactating as she sleep and when they reached their limit, leaked forcefully. Rena slept about...nine hours. She couldn't have produced that much unless....Rena looked down at herself. She swore she was larger...at least a solid FF cup. How did they....Rena's higher thought processes faded for just a bit as she could still smell the milk on her...covering every part of her except her face. Rena started panting with anticipation and before she knew it, she was licking her outstretch arm, starting with her shoulder and licking every part she could reach before doing the same with her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned her attention to her breasts and licked the sides and top of them, only to turn her attention to the rest of her body, having to use her paws to get whatever remained on her body. After about forty-five minutes of work, Rena's hidden feral nature subsided and Rena looked around herself, embarrassed and confused. Why did she....It didn't matter. Rena decided a quick shower would make her feel better. After an uneventful shower (in which she had to milk herself again...using her mouth after a little bit of pressure was released and she could move her still rather small nipples closer to her lowered mouth), Rena threw on a pair of shorts and a loose T-shirt, looking at her bed. What a waste. Rena wasn't sure what she was going to do about this in the immediate future but knew she had to deal with this right now. The thin comforter, bed sheets, and pillow cases were easy enough to deal with; they just had to be washed. However, her pillows and mattress was ruined. The pillows she just threw away but the mattress was far too heavy for her to lift, so she would just have to hope it wouldn't smell bad after drying out. Maybe if she cleaned it manually later...Rena decided she would get some breakfast, then try to sort this out. For breakfast, Rena simply got a bowl of cereal and some fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she sat down, she felt another surge in her breasts. Curious, Rena attempted to milk herself before she was completely full. After a minute or so of squeezing, she managed to drain a bit of herself into her own cereal bowl and the rest in the mixing bowl. Strange, she seemed to produce enough to fill her cereal AND to fill the mixing bowl at the same height as yesterday. Still, she had good food to eat, so she forgot about it for now.\u00a0Rena went about her day as normally as possible; though having to milk herself on hourly intervals was starting to get a little annoying. After finishing her own work, Rena decided it was time for a little research. Typing in \u201cLactation\u201d in Google engine produced quite a number of results; at least more than Rena thought it would. Not surprisingly, the very first link was to a Wikipedia article; figures. Still, Rena read it before checking out the other links. Nothing too useful was discovered on the next few search results, like how a non-pregnant woman could be lactating this much or how to stop or at least slow down the amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was about to give up until something very interesting caught her attention.Apparently, a bio-medical corporation was interested in buying breast milk from over-producing women. Rena was surprised that there was a market for that but according to the site, the purpose was to provide a more natural and beneficial substitute to baby formula for mothers who were unable to lactate themselves. The site also bragged about giving free milk to mothers in underdeveloped countries as part of a charity work. Looking around further, Rena saw the price listings for them buying milk and the slight deduction for renting out the containers that met FDA approval. Too bad it was all in liters; Rena was producing gallons. Still, they compared their prices to a few other companies and even showed actual links to prove they paid the best buck per liter. Rena made a few educated guesses and decided that even if she only kept a gallon for herself and sold the rest, she could easily make over $187 a day! Of course\u2026that was assuming that she didn\u2019t get any larger and, therefore, started producing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That thought bothered her; she was perfectly happy yesterday and her current size was still rather sexy but if she got any larger, she could actually begin turning off most men\u2026unless they had some sort of \u201cridiculously-large-breast-fetish\u201d or something along those lines. Still, even though it would give her a bit of a break and make some money, did she really want to sell her milk off like that?A familiar tingling in her breasts caused her to stop long enough to empty herself out first. Yeah, she definitely needed to do this before she got sick of her own milk, something which would be quick bad indeed considering she did liked it. Rena went ahead and registered and made sure to have next day delivery checked so she could start right away. Hopefully using the breasts pumps wouldn\u2019t be too painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena went about her day as normal as possible, watching a few choice shows and reading a little in a book she been meaning to keep up with. Of course, all of these activities were interrupted by her breasts, which seemed to never fail to produce enough milk to feed two babies one satisfying meal each time she got full. However, instead of drinking it all up, Rena started pouring a little bit into large bowls and putting them in the refrigerator. Considering how many containers Rena ordered, she could go ahead and start mailing them back in order to make some money right away. Of course, she would drink a little herself throughout the day; just enough to make her happy. After all, if Rena kept drinking everything she made, she could stand to get quite heavy and she didn\u2019t want to do that\u2026It was a good plan all things considered but one problem remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do about sleeping? She didn\u2019t want to ruin her bed\u2026again...but she couldn\u2019t just\u2026that\u2019s when Rena got an idea. Grabbing a small pool raft she bought years ago and a pillow and an old blanket, Rena decided to sleep in her tub. Not the most comfortable position but it would at least prevent her from getting anything wet that would really make her unhappy. Of course, with the blinds closed, Rena decided it might be best to sleep in the nude again; at least this way she would have dry clothes in the morning. Making sure that the drain was completely open, Rena eventually settled down into a light sleep. Tomorrow was Friday and Rena would have to think about how to deal with work on Monday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1. Rena wakes up, taking less time to clean herself as most of the milk drained sideways from her body and into the drain. After taking note that she got a bit larger\u2026.again\u2026Rena finally opens the mystery package and goes about her day normally\u2026until the bio-medical containers arrive and Rena can finally start filling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2. Same as option one, only this time her feet managed to close the drain by accident while she was asleep and she produced enough milk to where it reaches just a few inches short of her mouth. What will Rena do with a shallow pool of her own milk?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter originally by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Rena was able to fall asleep, the bathtub and the raft were a far cry from the comfortable feeling of sleeping in her bed. Naturally, as her body went about resting itself, it tried to find a more comfortable position. This was particularly difficult because Rena was just a little to long for her bathtub. In the end, either her head would have to be up against the top of the tub at a high angle or her knees would have to be bent.After groaning and adjusting herself for the first few minutes during the night, her subconscious mind making the small adjustments trying to find the maximum amount of comfort while the rest of her mind was lost in the soothing oceans of sleep. Still, in all the motion of getting comfortable, one of Rena's feet had brushed the drain of the tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that small brush the drain closed, sealing itself tight.The drain closure had happened not long after Rena had fell asleep, and in was done before her breasts could have started producing any milk.. Now, as an hour passed since their last milking Rena's breasts formed into two, tight spheres, the skin and fur straining to contain the ever increasing amount of milk. Finally, the nipples reached their flood point, opening up and letting milk spill to try and relieve the pressure in the body. This was slow, so it did not get rid of the pressure quickly, but it still left Rena with several riverlets of her own milk crisscrossing her breasts and pouring down into tub, which now began to fill with the white, motherly liquid.Even as the water level began to rise and touch Rena's skin, she did not awaken. THe rising level of milk was very slow, so even as the water level got higher the sensation of he liquid against her skin was not enough to force Rena from her dreams. That only came the next morning, when from the other room Rena's alarm clock began to blare with the usual morning alarm.For a moment Rena tried to ignore the alarm, groaning as she lifted a hand to touch her face. Still, to Rena suprise, when she put the hand to her face it was wet, and her nose began to pick up on the familiar scent of milk. Rena bolted awake at that point, sitting up quickly and taking in what surrounded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tub's drain must have closed during the night, and she was now sitting in large amount of her own milk.Rena could only stare for a moment in awe. She had made all of that!! The tub had to be nearly half full. It was a good thing she had tried sleeping on the inflatable raft, otherwise she might have drowned in her own milk. Still, as Rena sat there her nose began to properly register the scent of milk, and the soaking wet sensation around all of her body began to force Rena into her feral instincts. She tried to resist, but soon Rena couldn't help it. She began licking herself, trying to lean her fur of all the milk. Still, simply turning over in the tub redrenched some parts of her fur.Even with this realization Rena couldn't help but continue licking herself. She pushed the inflated pool raft away, setting just outside the tub. Even Without the pool toy lifting her up or taking up space in the tub, the milk still covered her leg entirely and reached halfway up her stomach, covering her belly button. Still, even though Rena knew licking herself clean was pointless, she just couldn't stop. It was a feral instinct, something buried deep in her subconscious.First Rena manged to clean her arms and breasts, liking them and even linger on her nipples for a time, sucking out a glass full of milk from each overly ladened breast. Rena then began trying to clean her legs. She would lift one of her legs up to her mouth and start licking, but even when it was clean she would set it back down in the tub to try and tend to the other one, thus re-drenching it in milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0This process cycled about five times, but as Rena felt herself getting full her will power began to overpower the feral instincts. First, as she held one leg up with one hand and liked she began distracting herself enough to reach forward with the other hand and pop the drain open, the gurgling sound signaling the milk spilling down into the pipes. Then, in the moment Rena was making a transition between the two legs she pulled herself away long enough to reach forward with both hands and turn the water one, setting it to her preferred temperature. Rena had to go back to liking herself at this, waiting for her mind to get done with one leg before she was ableto reach forward and finish the final step, popping the nob that sent the water from the faucet up to the shower head.The warm water seemed to end the vicious cycle of liking, drenching Rena and clearing away the last of the nights milk. Rena couldn't help but breath a sigh of relief, slowly getting to her feet and pulling the shower curtain shut before she began enjoying the shower. After about fifteen minutes of washing her fur, picking hairs off her tongue, and making sure all the milk was out off her body Rena finished in the shower, shutting off the water before pushing back the curtain and stepping out.First, Rena gently placed the pool raft back in the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still fairl wet with milk, and she would need ot rince it later. Her pillow and towel were now also drenched, but thanks to the shower water Rena was sure that at least half of the milk had been drained out of them. She'd have to think of something else to rest her head on, she was ruining to many pillows with all this.At that thought Rena turned, looking at the body length mirror that hung against the wall of the bathroom. She held her breasts in her hands, bouncing them a little. They had grown again, at least another couple cup sizes. This was getting ridiculous, just how big was she going to get. What was worse, the bigger she got the more milk she seemed to produce. She was already having to deal with needing to milk herself multiple times during the day, she didn't need to be producing more milk than a mature cow.Still, Rena couldn't help but sigh, she couldn't do anything about it right now. With that thought she turned, leaving the bathroom and stepping into her bedroom, quickly getting dressed. She also investigated her mattress a bit, giving it a little sniff. It still smelled like mlik, but the milk that had soaked it was starting to go sour. She'd need to clean it soon or the whole house would stink of her rotten milk.With that Rena went down to the kitchen, grabbing a banana for breakfast since she had already drank probably half a gallon of milk. It was then her eyes were drawn to the package she had gotten two days ago. She still hadn't opened it. Feeling a little guilty Rena went over to her coffee table, using her sharp fingernails to cut the tape before opening the box.Inside the small package were a few books, on top of which was a small note. Rena picked up the note, reading it quickly before looking back at the books. It was from her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would always see these strange how to books and decide that her daughter needed to know how to do these things. Rena could only start at the book a little coldly, she already had a large collection of these books, but she never had a heart to tell her mother she didn't want them anymore. Besides, her mother always hid a twenty somewhere in one of the books, giving Rena a reason to read them. Somehow, she always knew which book would the one Rena would read last.Feeling a little annoyed by her current situation Rena picked the book out of the box, flipping through them quickly. How to clean up your computer for better performance. How to repair any broken plate or dish in your kitchen. How to clean mattresses.... Rena paused at this, looking at the book. That one might actually be usefull. After setting the rest of the How-to guides on the table Rena propped open the matress cleaning one, quickly flipping through it and getting to a part where it talked about liquid spills.\u00a0It had taken about three hours, part of which Rena had to spend milking herself as her breasts filled up twice during the process, Rena's mattress was completely clean and now stood beside an open window in the sun, drying. it had taken an almost godlike will to get the entire thing clean. First, since the milk had settled, she had to use detergent and a wet rag to scrub the entire thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had to rinse with water, use towels and jumping up and down to draw the water out, and now it was time to let it dry. It was a lot of work, but Rena couldn't smell but a few traces of milk coming from the mattress when she was done.After putting all the now dirty towels in her washing machine Rena went back to the living room. She could tell she needed to be milked again, but she was really getting tired of milking herself so often. It was then a knock came at the door, and Rena quickly moved towards the door before cracking it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivary for a Miss Rena....\" A very perky delivery person said. Rena smiled slightly, thankful it wasn't the same person who had delivered the box of books from her mother. She had seen her rack back then, and would certainly be confused how the massive mammaries had grown much larger over the course of two days. Rena smiled as she opened the door wider, stepping out onto the porch. This delivery person happened to be a man, and Rena could only smirk as she saw his eyes widen.\"Um...uh....yes... could you please... uh.... sign here.\"Rena simply nodded her head, taking the clipboard. Over the two days she had gotten a little used to her breasts, acting a little more natural as she quickly sign the slip and passed it back to the driver. She then took the box, smiling a little as she gave the driver a little wink and then closed the door. That was a small blessing from all this, her new breasts really did make her sexier and they still hadn't gotten so big to put a normal guy off. Still, any bigger and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena shook her head at this, Rena taking the large box into the living room and setting it down. After cutting the tape and reading the \"Thank you for registering with us.\" Letter Rena began to rummage through the contents of the box. Inside were a number of things. First, Rena pulled out the several liter, FDA approved milk containers. They looked more like glorified soda bottles, but she just shrugged as she took the dozen or so bottles and set them off to the side.\u00a0Rena then pulled out a strange metal box, attached to it a set of instructions. From what Rena read, the box was what she used to send her milk in. It was like an industrial cooler. She could put four of the FDA milk bottles into the cooler, then fill it with ice and seal it tight. According to the instructions the milk would stay cold for several days in the high grade cooler, and that she could just use the companies website to arrange for Fed-ex or some other shipping company to pick up the crate from her home, the delivery free of charge. It kind of worked like Netflix. She sent them the milk in the containers and the containers would come back a few days later. Luckily for Rena, the company had sent her four of metal coolers.\u00a0It was then Rena got to the last item in the large box, lifting it up from the packaging fluff and holding it in front of her. The Mega Mama Twin Cup Breast Pump, for those mama's who just have to much. Rena could only stare at the box for a second. This was certainly not something she would have ever bought for herself. Still, as Rena felt her breasts and new they were really getting full she decided that there wasn't a better time to try out her new source of income.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure all the blinds were shut Rena sat at her kitchen table. The breast pump kind looked like a very sterile, hospital vacuum cleaner. It had a white base that was kind of shaped like an egg. In the center of it all was an indentation, a place to put the FDA milk bottles and lock them into place for filling. Above the bottle was then two places for hoses, each one attacked to a suction cup like thing that Rena could only assume went over each of her breasts.The instructions were simple. First, place an empty bottle into the pump. Then, taking each suction cup thing, put one over each nipple. The suction cups, unfortunatly, were designed for less furry skin. Still, a side instruction in the machiens manual was to turn it on at a very low pumping pressure, just enough that the suction cups would stay over the breasts.Luckily, the machine was simple in the essence it had only four buttoms. An one off switch,a small twisting nob to control how powerful the suction was, a switch for going between high and low power, and finally a button that would release the FDA milk bottle from the pump. After getting everything read and taking her shirt off, Rena turned the pump on and its lower power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She could hear the pump sucking a little air from the suction cups, and with that small bode of confidence Rena place the suction cups over her nipples. Though it took a moment the cups made a seal over top of Rena's fur, the pressure quickly dropping as the pump began to hum with a lower rumble.Rena watched a little anxiously, but smile as she saw the pump was actually starting to draw milk from her nipples. She also hated admit it, but it felt kind of good to have something like this sucking on her breasts. Still, the milk was coming out in dribbles and Rena didn't want to sit there forever. So, she reached out to the pump, turning up the power dial about half way.The pump began to hum with greater life, adn Rena couldn't help but moan slightly as she felt the suction power increase. The milk was coming out much faster now, and Rena could actually seeing the FDA bottle starting to fill with her milk. Still, the sensation of the pump sucking on her breasts was intoxicating, and Rena wanted more.With that the tiger-stripped cat girl turn the pump up to full power on low, leaning back as her hands began to mindlessly massage her breasts. She began to pur, smiling a little bit as she kept a single lazy eye on the pump. Halfway through Rena had to stop to change the bottles, and by the end of it all her two breasts had made enough milk to fill two of the FDA bottles completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went simply, Rena pausing ever hour to use the pump. In that single day she had filled all twelve of the bottles she had ordered, which would earn her about three hundred dollar. Rena could only smile as she packed up the dozen bottles into the four coolers, filled them with ice, sealed them, and used the website to call for a package pickup.Still, even with the twelve bottles filled that only took six rounds with the pump or six hours, and Rena still had a few hours to go before bed. She managed though, after cooking herself and eating dinner, to rig up one of the pump's spare houses to the place where the FDA bottle was inserted. Now, she could still use the breast pump, which went much faster than milking herself, and still be able to pour it either down the drain or into a bowl for her own enjoyment. The only downside to it all was that, to keep the machine clean, Rena would have to run hot soapy water through it daily, but it was still nicer having the pump around.At that it got time for bed, and as Rena started gathering her inflatable raft for another night of sleep she caught herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of Friday, that meant in two days she would have to show up at work on Monday for meeting and that such. How was she going to explain this all to her coworkers, how she went from flat to big and busty in the week they hadn't seen her. Rena debated calling in sick that day, giving it to weeks so she could say she had a late growth spurt or something like that, which could have been the actual truth.Rena also worried about what she would do about her milk at work. She could take the pump and go to the bathroom, but what if someone saw her. It would lead to a lot of uncomfortable questions. Maybe she could try sealing her breasts up somehow, keeping them from leaking during the day. Surely, if the milk can't get our her breasts will stop producing it. That or she'll burst, a thought that sent a small shiver down her spine.Still, Rena decided to worry about what she would say to her coworkers until the next morning, yawning slightly as she moved into the bathroom. It was then she got a small idea. Why not use the breast pump, just leave it on low all night. She could seep on the floor beside the tub, a little more comfortable position, and just let the pump feed the milk down the drain. It was a good idea, but then again the pump's instructinos warned that she shouldn't keep it on for to long. It was then Rena decided... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: She would use the breast pump. In the morning, Rena would be pleased to see that that she was both dry, but finds a rude awakening when she sees her breasts have almost doubled in size. They are also producing milk faster than ever, each breast producing enough milk to fill three of the liter bottles every half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note about Option 1: This idea comes from the fact that human, and thus cat-person breasts produce enough milk to meet demand. Since Rena used the breast pump, her breasts thought she was feeding a very hungry infant and such increase production to meet the demand, and thus also increased their size so they could hold more milk.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena decides to head the warning of the pump and just goes to sleep in the bathtub again. In the morning, she is happy to see the milk has drained away, but that her breasts have grown a little bigger again and filled to the brim. She goes to use the breast pump, but decides to turn the power level to maximum and flip the little switch on the front from low to high. Unfortunately for Rena, the pump malfunctions in a strange way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition originally by Nameless One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving that instruction manuels were invented for a reason, Rena deciding that for now, she better simply sleep in the tub like last night. Though in case her foot clog the tub again, she would need to do something about a pillow...The only thing she could think of was to use a towel. Not the most comfortable thing in the world but if she could sleep on a raft and use a towl as a blanket, all while producing milk throughout the whole night, this could probably work. After folding the towel in a vaugly comfortable position and plugging the alarm clock in her bathroom, Rena managed to fall asleep after a brief struggle to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Waking up, Rena looked around. Part of her towel soaked but otherwise okay while the only milk left was a few streaks around the bottom of the tub. That part made her smile but what didn't make her smile was seeing her breasts even larger than yesterday. What size was she now, an HH cup? Even worse was the fact that they were completely full, though due to last night's production, they were gently leaking instead of being painfully cogged. Just before she would milk herself, she decided to take a quite shower; afterall, it wasn't like she was in any pain at this point. Feeling slightly better after a quick rinse, Rena got out of her tub dried her self off quickly, taking the pump and placing them in position and turning the switch. However, the pump began to act strange....making a sour noise before turning on...and off...and...Rena started to struggle as the pump was starting to hurt her. Despite her efforts, she was having trouble getting the pump off until the hose forcefully popped open from the base and the pump started to spin out of control until the plug was ripped from the wall and the machine slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared at the mess around her. Milk on the floor, a broken pump letting out a bit of smoke. Any longer and she was sure she might have damaged something in her.\u00a0\"Ah DAMN IT!\" Rena shriked, throwing the now broken pump hose on the ground. This was the last thing she needed. Not wanting to get her feral insticts arosed by the aroma, Rena grabed some toliet paper and stuffed a little bit in her nostirals, effectively blocking her sense of smell. Washing her legs and drying them out, Rena manually milked herself the best she could and clean her breasts out, then grabbed a bucket and a mop to fix her bathroom. Thankfully, it was a small job and she managed to get done well before an hour. Having a few minutes before she would have to stand over the sink, Rena decided to check her mail box real quick. What surprised her the most was an email from the same company she registered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Notice to all registered members.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Well...that would be me, I guess...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[We regret to inform you that we have been receiving complaints that the Mega Mama Twin Cup Breast Pump send to our receipants have been malfunctioning.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;No duh.

Onace again, we are sorry for any inconvience this may have caused and we look forward to your continued business.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had to smirk. For a faceless company, they sure were generous. Let's see...that means the delivery guy should come about....12 o' clock or so..and it was about eight...All Rena had to do was hold out for about four or five hours and she'll have relieve. And of course, there was still the replacement she ordered yesterday afternoon. Rena's head spun as she tried to think about all the packages she would be getting today. For something that was supposed to make her life easier, this sure was getting more complicated. Rena read the rest of her email; spam, spam about breast enchancement pills (oh, the irony, it hurts!), and an email saying the weekly meeting this Monday was cancelled, Rena started to feel her breasts getting full again. Sighing, Rena got up and headed for the kitchen. Another hour, another milking....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating breakfast and a having a good work-out, Rena was happy to hear the doorbell ring. After dealing with another stunned delivery person, Rena dragged the packages inside and preceded to open them. Just like the company promised, here was everything she ordered plus the freebies they sent as an apolygy for the malufunctioning product. After taking the time to relieve her breasts (and fill up an bottle and half), Rena got the broken pump ready to go along with the company pick-up, which came about three hours later.\u00a0Rena went about her day as normally as possible but even with the new pumps, she was finding it to become tiresome. For one thing, the weight of her breasts was finally catching up to her, especially when they got full. And producing more and more was starting to affect Rena's self-image. I mean, was she a cat-girl or a cow-girl? Honestly, she didn't see much of a difference. Still, Rena struggle through it as best as she could. At the end of the day, she managed to fill up roughly a fourth of the containers she received. Getting ready for bed (and ordering more containers and a pick-up for Monday), Rena sighed as she tried to think this out. Unfortunately, anything she thought of was quickly dismissed as impossible. Maybe they was no explanation to this...or there was but she didn't know what it was. Either way, worrying about it wasn't going to help. The only thing she could do was go to sleep and hope she didn't grow any larger than she already was. Otherwise, she might have to start using the single breast pump...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1. Rena's breasts have gotten larger again and she is really starting to feel the weight of them. Maybe it's time to see a doctor tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2. Rena's breasts have gotten larger again and while she does feel the weight in them, Rena is strangly able to deal with it somewhat, as if her back muscles have gotten a bit stronger. Either way, she has a full day of milking herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Originally by System Crash<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena awoke the next morning in a empty bathtub, to her great relief, and of her own accord. Not only did it help with her current situation having the Monday meeting  canceled, it also usually led to a week of very little work. She had completed most of her work queue the previous day thanks to her system with the single breast pump, and other than reading and replying to a few e-mails she would have most of the week to herself.Well, to herself and the pair of mounds on her chest. At this Rena looked down at her chest, muttering a silent prayer that somehow, during the night, that her breasts might have gotten smaller. Still, that was not the case, the pair of orbs visibly larger and stretched into almost perfect spheres by the milk they contained, her nipples weeping with fairly steady streams. Rena could barely guess her breast size now, having never seen any one larger. Still, after making some rough guesses, Rena pegged herself as a midrange G cup, putting her roughly a cup size larger than the day before.Thus, Rena slowly tried to sit up, only to find it more difficult not only with larger breasts but ones that were filled to capacity with milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, it was just an inconvenience, at least for the moment. As Rena through out the rubber raft and towel, starting the shower, she knew that if things kept going the way they were going, not only would her breasts get terribly heavy they may even reach the point where she wouldn\u2019t be able to move.Thus, as she cleaned her hair and fur, Rena decided that it was time she spoke with her doctor. Once she was clean Rena went straight out into her living room, standing in her towel as she called her doctor. Thankfully, he was able to squeeze her in fairly early. Rena drained herself, ate breakfast, and then did her best to dress in a way that wouldn\u2019t be to revealing. Still, with double H breasts and a wardrobe designed for someone with nothing, everyone one Rena\u2019s shirts quickly became a halter top, the bottoms slipping up as the front of each shirt struggled to contain her very impressive bustline.Still, Rena put a light jacket over the top, which helped her show less skin before slipping on a pair of blue jeans, grabbing her purse, and heading out the door. Even though Rena was a telecommuter for work, she still owned a car for trips to the grocery store and the such. She slipped into the small, fuel efficient car, having to adjust the seat and wheel for her new breasts before pulling out of her driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s doctor, a Dr. Gem, worked in the outpatient\u2019s clinic at the local hospital. Basically, it the outpatient clinic was the part of the hospital where people could go if they had colds or physicals. It was the place for people who were sick or needed a simple check up, not anything that required a stay in a hospital bed.Rena had to stick her head out of the car, looking around for a time before quickly stepping out and heading to the door. Thankfully, Rena didn\u2019t see anybody she knew, and those she did see were doctors and nurses that were to wrapped up in their work to notice a very busty cat-woman walking towards the outpatient clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena never really liked the doctors office. She hated waiting in the waiting room, in the examination rooms, the whole place always a little to cold for her tastes. Still, Dr. Gem didn\u2019t keep Rena waiting long, the doctor coming through the door only to stop dead in his tracks, eyes falling on Rena\u2019s breasts before moving up to her face.\u201cRena, did you go to a plastic surgeon without consulting me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Rena countered, partialy offended but still knowing that was one way to explain her sudden growth. \u201cThey just started growing.\u201d At that Rena began explaining what had happened the past few days, everything from the morning when she had first woken up with a pair of grapefruit sized breasts, which was really the high point of everything. Dr. Gem listened to it all, and then politely asked Rena if he could examine her breasts.After doing a very careful examination, Dr. Gem not wanting to incure the wrath of a sexual harassment law suit, he took a seat in a chair, looking through Rena\u2019s chart as he gently rubbed his chin. Then, without saying much of anything, Dr. Gem left the room, leaving Rena alone for about ten minutes before coming back.\u201cFirst,\u201d Dr. Gem said, setting down Rena\u2019s medical chart, \u201cI wills say that after examining everything I have determined that\u2026 you are telling the truth. Those breasts are natural, so you had to have grown them. Still, what concerns me now is what in your body is causing this growth. I checked your chart, and saw that the day before you said all this started you were in for an immunization shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d Rena said, obviously not seeing the connection.\u201cWell, while I know that couldn\u2019t have caused this, I did talk with the staff at the office. They said that during that time they also had a stock of other immunizations and hormone treatments. Now, I don\u2019t know much about this, but after talking with the people at the clinic where you got your shot, there is a slim chance that you may have been given a hormone treatment by mistake.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 wait, I don\u2019t understand. How did a shot of hormones do this to me?\u201dDr. Gem slowly stood up, beginning to pace. It was his way of thinking, and also what he commonly did when explaining something to a patient. \u201cWell, let\u2019s begin with the shot itself. Of the hormones the clinic had, the only one that could have caused this are hormones usually meant for middle aged women. It\u2019s meant to rebalance the chemicals in their body and stave off or weaken the effects of menopause. Now, you, being a very young woman, have a strong supply of these hormones already, so the shot set your body off balance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, here is where I find things strange. You have of course heard of steroids and the effect they have on males. Usually, if they are using hormones and steroids, there bodies stop producing its own supply, coming to rely on the daily pill or shot. For you, however, you received a single shot of female hormones, that I admit may have lead to some initial growth in your breasts. These hormones, however, would have burned up within the first day. So, hearing about what been happening to you the past few days, I can\u2019t help but think that the hormones may have raised your bodies natural hormone level.\u201dDr. Gem paused at this, noticing Rena\u2019s confused face. \u201cIf I was to put it simply, your body is used to keeping a certain level of hormones in the body. It\u2019s like a glass of water, your body always trying to make sure the glass is about half full.\u201dRena nodded, seeing a glass half full water in her head. \u201cNow as we go through our lives, our bodies both take from that glass of water and add to it, thus keeping a balance and keeping the water level at the middle point. Now, usually, when you introduce excess of something into the body, it fills the glass of water up more, so the body eases off production. If this happens once in a while, the body returns to the normal, half full level fairly quickly. If the what ever is adding to the glass is constant, the body will start permanently shutting down the parts of it that make water, thus becoming reliant on that exterior source. Are you still with me.\u201dRena nodded, in her head picturing someone pour water into the glass with a pitcher, and once that was done the water lowering back down the half way point.\u00a0\u201cNow, for you Rena, I think that shot of hormones has done something that has been theorized about in the medical community, but has never happened before. If we talk about the glass of water again, that sudden increase of hormones filled the water close to the rim. Now, for some reason, your body now believes that point is where it has to keep the water level, in such your body is being constantly flooded with more hormones than it needs. This could be causing your breasts to swell and to produce milk and such an unheard of rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, is there anyway to stop this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are a few things we need to consider. The first is that at some point, your body will start taking in the hormones as fast as your body is producing them. In such, you will reach another state of balance and the growth and lactation will stop. I, unfortunately, don\u2019t know if or when your body will resume that balance, and how large your breasts will have become by that point.\u201d\u201cAnother thing we have to consider is that your body will eventually correct itself and stop producing so much hormones, but then again it\u2019s a question of if and when.\u201d\u201cStill, I have a friend who works at the university on hormone research. He may know of a way to either counteract the amount of hormones in your body or know how to force your body to reset its levels and in such stop its hormone overproduction. So, I will give him a call, but there is still no guarantee that he will know what to do.\u201dRena was starting to frown, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t know anyway to stop this. I mean, sooner or later they\u2019ll get to big. I won\u2019t even be able to stand up, let alone move around.\u201d\u201cI have thought of this, and I believe I have a solution. I am going to give you another injection. This one is another set of hormones but ones that are tied with muscle development and growth. It should give your muscles the boost they need to carry your breasts, and it may also cause your body to readjust that level of hormone production, thus keeping your muscle strength in line with the size of your bust.\u201dRena didn\u2019t like the thought of messing up her bodies chemistry any further, but didn\u2019t argue as the doctor brought out a needle and gave her a little prick in the arm. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though Rena would rather they didn\u2019t know, by telling them she could still work from home but they wouldn\u2019t force her to come into any meetings, at least until she had stopped growing.So, Rena left the office, Dr. Gem saying he would call his friend at the college as soon as he had a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Rena returned home, stepping through her door. The first thing Rena did was use her breast pumps to draw the milk out of her breasts, the pressure hitting a painful level as she had been driving home. The guy from the milk company came and left, dropping of more bottles of milk and picking up the ones Rena had managed to fill.Still, as Rena sat watching some television program, breasts gently being drained by her milk pump, a thought began to cross her mind. The TV show she was watching featured a night club, people jumping and jiving to the heavily pounding beats. Rena had been a real partier in college, but hadn\u2019t really done anything to exciting since she got her job as a typist.At this Rena couldn\u2019t help but look down at her breasts, memories of a few sour boyfriends going through her mind. They had been nice guys, but unfortunately for Rena there were other woman wanting to date them and they had bigger breasts and looser pants. A few of her better boyfriends had been stolen away because of women like that, and it had made Rena feel pretty bad about herself.But now\u2026 things were different. Now she had the breasts, bigger than most girls, and she had a great body to go with them. Maybe now it was her chance to be on the other end of it all, to have boys slipping away from their girlfriends to be with her. It was a thought that made Rena smile a little devilishly. She wasn\u2019t that kind of woman, but heck if, for the first time in her life, she wanted to flaunt what she had. And man, at this point, did she have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, a few hours later, Rena was downtown, pulling into a parking lot outside the biggest and most popular dance clubs in the city, the Black Hole. It was a two level complex that Rena had visited a few times before. There was a big main dance floor, with a DJ most nights but the occasional live band. The dance floor was sunk down into the floor, the area around it about a foot higher. In the boarder area were two bars and several tables and chairs, places for the dancers to rest. The second level of the dance club was basically a balcony area of tables like the bottom floor, allowing people to look down into the surge of dancing people.Rena stepped out of her car, shivering a little as she felt the cool night air against her fur. She had put on a nice skirt that went down to just above her knees, a nice wide thick belt, and a tank top. At least, it had been a tank top on her old, flat chest. Now, however, with her breasts taking up so much more space, the tank top had become more of a halter top, the fabric containing Rena\u2019s breasts and showing of a good portion of her belly.A few second thoughts tripped across Rena\u2019s mind as she stood in the parking lot, looking at the dance club. Still, after building up her courage a moment Rena strode forward, purse on one hand and breasts bouncing unrestricted since she had no bra to control them. She got into the line outside the club, getting past the bouncer outside without any trouble.The club was just as Rena remembered, lights flashing and twisting on the dance floor while the table area around it was kept low and dark, lit mostly by the light that managed to escape the dance floor. Rena first slipped over to the bar, getting just a glass of water before heading and taking a seat at an empty table, looking out on the dance floor.Still, it wasn\u2019t long before Rena could easily notice that she was drawing a lot of attention across the room. Not less than twenty feet away a table of guys, soldiers it looked like, were slipping glances at her and talking in hushed voices. The same was around the area, a guys and even a few girls noticing that she stood out from the crowd. Still, how couldn\u2019t she. With G cup breasts, she had to be the bustiest woman in the room.Finally, no less than ten minutes after she sat down, one of the soldiers at the table stood up, moving over towards her table. He smiled, doing his best to shout over the music as he said, \u201cHey, would you like to dance?\u201dRena smiled, setting down her water. \u201cSure\u201d. Thus, Rena followed the soldier out into the mosh-pit, finding a space on the edge where the pair began dancing. Rena was a little sloppy at first, having never danced with such huge bulges on her chest. Still, soon, she had adjusted and was dancing like she had in college. That, of course, meant both some common dancing but also some close, dirty dancing.Rena danced with about twenty guys that night, barely managing to sit down at her table and get a fresh drink of water before she was whisked away by someone else. The only times Rena stopped was when she could tell her breasts were really starting to get full. At that those times she slipped off into the surprisingly well maintained bathroom. She would quickly milk herself, taking a few sips of the liquid in her hand while letting the rest go into the toilet. She then flushed, re-adjusted her top, and was out on the dance floor again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn\u2019t get home till about half an hour passed minute, coming through the door with both a wide smile on her face but a very tired expression. It had been a long time since she had that much fun, and after the week she had been having boy did she need it. It also helped Rena enjoy her breasts again. Sure, she was producing a lot of milk, but she wasn\u2019t a cow. The other thing that made Rena happy was the fact that she hadn\u2019t quiet hit the point where guys would be put off by her breasts, at least not so many that she couldn\u2019t have a good time.So, after stripping of her clothing and taking a shower to cool herself off, Rena prepared her bed in the bath tub before shutting out the lights and laying down. Even with the lights out Rena\u2019s keen cat eyes could clearly see the edge of her breasts, the two orbs squished between her body and the edge of the tub. Maybe being a little bigger wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Rena could deal with the size, just not the fact that they produced so much milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Rena drifts off to the land of dreams, but when she awakes in the morning her breasts have put on another cup size. Still, thanks to Dr. Gem\u2019s injection they didn\u2019t feel heavy, and Rena is able to go about her business as usual (mostly). Things change, however, when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: After sending in so much milk a representative from the mother\u2019s milk company comes to investigate, believing Rena is pouring normal milk into the bottles. Still, when he sees Rena\u2019s breasts and is able to see how quickly her breasts are producing milk, ever question is blown from his mind.And, in truth, the company representative posses Rena with an interesting offer. Seeing that Rena is a very heavy milk producer, the company would be willing to install a more permanent and more powerful breast milk system. It would fed into a chilled tank that would be installed somewhere in Rena\u2019s house. Thus, not only would Rena be able to get paid more quickly for the milk she was selling, but she can have the company install the breast pumps in her bedroom. Thus, it would allow her to sleep in her own bed, the milk being drained from her breasts and keeping her nice and dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:There are actually two more options \u2013 since I wanted to give this chapter three choices.</span></div></div>",

He was dressed similarly, the<br>\r\ncompany requiring a business casual dress code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a report from our warehouse. They have noticed that one client in our mother\u2019s milk program is sending in an abnormally high amount of milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stout cat man groaned, grabbing the papers and flipping through it a few times. \u201cStupid punk kids, thinking they can make a quick buck by sending us normal grocery store milk. Who do we have as a supervisor in the area?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that is Kemnebi Khaldun\u2019s region sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen give him a call and tell him to bust this punk. Also have any milk sent in by her taken to the lab for analysis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, within an hour, a black truck pulled up outside Rena\u2019s house. Rena didn\u2019t notice the truck, having gone into her home office to finish a few bits of paperwork. Still, a resounding knock came at her front door. Rena quickly got up, heading to the door and opening it up, her head tilting up as her eyes met with the gaze of the figure that stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Rena Westfall?\u201d The man asked, his voice deep and kind of scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Kemnebi Khaldun, I work for GeneTech, the biomedical company that you have been sending milk to. It has come to our attention that you have been sending several large shipments of milk into our facility, and my superiors are concerned. Do you mind if I come in?\u201d Rena shook her head, stepping back and letting Kemnebi step in. Rena couldn\u2019t help but feel a little small compared to this guy. He was a panther man, with a very sleek and shiny coat, but was most noticeable about him was the fact that he was roughly seven feet tall. He had to bend over to get through Rena\u2019s door, and his ears were just short of gracing Rena\u2019s ceiling. If his size wasn\u2019t enough, Kemnebi had broad shoulders. This was the guy that could be really scary if he wanted to, and it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can probably understand, there are some people who hear about our little program and think they can outsmart us by sending in store bought milk. Still, they get greedy, and start sending in abnormally large amounts. So, Miss Westfall, if I might ask, when are you due?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not pregnant, but I assure you, all the milk I\u2019m sending in is my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally,\u201d Kemnebi asked, gently pushing down his sunglasses and revealing a very powerful pair of blue eyes. \u201cCan you prove it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, \u201cYes, in fact, I can.\u201d At this Rena led Kemnebi into her bathroom. First, Kemnebi searched everywhere to make sure Rena didn\u2019t have a gallon of milk stashed somewhere. Then, he stepped out, giving Rena her privacy to use the milk pumps. A few minutes later, Rena had milked herself, coming out with three of the medical bottles filled to the brim with a fourth part way filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can also contact my doctor, a Dr. Gem at the local hospital outpatient clinic. He can explain everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi nodded his head, pulling out a cell phone that was as black as his fur. He punched a few numbers, and stepped outside as he made a few calls. The first was to the hospital, where he was able to get a hold of Rena\u2019s doctor. After hearing a word from Rena that it was okay, Dr. Gem told Kemnebi what he believed caused Rena\u2019s current state. Kemnebi then called his company, getting someone in the testing offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, its Kemnebi, did you run the tests on the milk sent in by Rena Westfall, ID number 107408.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got the results right here. All the bottles in the last shipment show signs that they are from a cat-person, the chemical balance of the milk common for humans with partial cat genetics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, after confirming a few more things, Kemnebi gently shut his phone, looking back at Rena. She was leaning up against the side of her front door, arms crossed. For some reason, she was getting a lot of joy proving to this seven foot tall, mountain like panther that she was filling all those bottles of milk herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a little awkward.\u201d Kemnebi admitted, his hard-core exterior breaking in the face that he had been utterly wrong about what was happening. Rena just smiled, \u201cWell, I guess I can\u2019t really blame you. I mean, how many other women are in my position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, at least none that are sending their milk into GeneTech.\u201dRena couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for the guy. He had to really feel stupid at the moment. So, after the pair stood silent for a<br>\r\nmoment, Rena smiled a little, stepping back as she asked, \u201cWould you like to come in for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kemnebi replied, following Rena back into her house. The pair took a seat at Rena\u2019s table, the tiger-strippedwoman bringing out a few glasses of water. She passed one to Kemnebi, who thanked Rena and took a sip as she satdown. Eventually Rena broke the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Kemnebi\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard that name before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Egyptian. My parents were archeologists. Still, when my mother was pregnant they came back to the states, taking up some office jobs at a museum so that they could raise me here. Kemnebi actually means Black Panther.\u201d Rena couldn\u2019t help but smile at this. It was a cool name, but at the same time blatantly unoriginal. Still, Kemnebi picked up the conversation, taking a sip of the water before continuing. \u201cMiss Westfall\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena\u2026 please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u2026 Rena\u2026 How often do you have to milk yourself each day, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to do it about every hour. I don\u2019t mind that as much as when I\u2019m trying to sleep. My breasts get full the point that I actually start to leak. When it first happened I nearly ruined my mattress, and I\u2019ve been sleeping on a rubber raft in mybathtub the past few nights so that the milk doesn\u2019t ruin anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi couldn\u2019t help stare in disbelief. She was producing a full load of milk every hour, and it kept going well into the night. It was almost too hard to believe, but then again he had just seen Rena fill more milk jugs than any other woman in the GeneTech\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk program. Still, at the same time, this sparked a small idea in Kemnebi\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I may, Rena, I think I could be of some help. You see, GeneTech has been beta testing a new breast pump system. It\u2019s designed to go into hospitals so that mothers who are there and are lactating heavily can drain their milk. It\u2019s designed to put the milk in a special chilled tank that our technicians can change in and out like a battery. If you would be interested, I think I could convince my superiors to install one of those pumps in your bedroom. The pump could run during the night, keeping your breasts empty and your bed dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena took a drink from her water, setting down the glass as she rested her hands on the table. She really wanted to sleep in her own bed again. The raft worked, but it was far from being really comfortable. Still, Rena was cautious, meeting Kemnebi\u2019s blue eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know... I\u2019ve always heard that a person\u2019s body will try to meet any demands. If we start draining the milk that quickly it might make my breasts grow, or at least grow faster than they currently are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pressure on this pump would be perfectly controllable. You could set it at a low pressure so it just has enough suction to keep a hold of your breasts. It wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to draw any milk out, but the milk your breasts are already leaking could be taken away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought drew Rena much closer to taking Kemnebi\u2019s offer. Still, there was one more thing she was worried about.\u201cOkay, but what if something breaks? Will this pump be able to hurt me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the breast pump malfunction we have been experiencing. Still, that is not something you need to worry about. This pump is developed by our scientists and, since it\u2019s still in Beta, has numerous fail safes. If anything even looks like its going wrong, the pump will shut itself off and alert our technicians. You would be perfectly safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAll right,\u201d Rena said a few moments later. \u201cI guess it couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Kemnebi smiled, \u201cWonderful. I will make the call right now. Do you mind if I step outside for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\nRena shook her head, watching Kemnebi leave. The giant of a black panther ducked under the front door, putting cell phone to the side of his head as it rang. Eventually, the voice of his boss came over the line, his distending tone coming over the line. \u201cWho is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kemnebi sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you take care of that punk who\u2019s sending us fake milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Sir, I\u2019ve verified that Rena Westfall is legitimate. A medical accident has caused her breasts to both swell and overproduce milk, putting out more than three bottles of milk an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got to be (@*^%# me. How is that even possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir, but I\u2019m actually calling because I believe it would be beneficial for us to install one of the wall pumps here at Miss Westfall\u2019s home. She is producing more milk than ten woman combined. It\u2019s even happening at night, forcing Miss Westfall to sleep in her bathtub or risk ruining her mattress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the workers over at Rena\u2019s house in an hour. Still, she can\u2019t stay in the house while we\u2019re installing the pump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to put her up in a hotel sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, lets not be spending money where we don\u2019t need to. See if she has a friend she can stay with, and if not let her stay with you. You have that nice apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, it\u2019s decided. Now, take care of her Kemnebi. If she\u2019s producing as much milk as you say she is, we\u2019ve just found our first reliable source of product.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u201d Kemnebi said, hanging up the phone and slipping it back into his pocket. After standing out in Rena\u2019s yard for a moment, Kemnebi stepped back inside, ducking his head and looking to see Rena still sitting at the table. \u201cWell, the workers are going to come over tonight and should be done in the morning. Still, because of our workers\u2019 union, you can\u2019t be in the house when their installing the pump. Do you have a friend you can stay with, family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena frowned a little, \u201cThere are people I could stay with, but none of them have seen me since I was\u2026 well, flatter.\u201d Kemnebi sighed. He had feared this answer, considering he had heard everything from Rena\u2019s doctor how the tigress had gone from an A cup to well, big and busty in the san of a few days. \u201cThen, it is my superiors wish that you come and stay at my apartment in the city. That\u2019s if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, but I couldn\u2019t impose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi shook his head, \u201cOh no, trust me. My boss is always making me play host to different people in the name of GeneTech. It\u2019s part of my job description as a senior company representative. It\u2019s what I\u2019m paid to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Rena said, getting up from her seat. \u201cI guess it\u2019s better than staying at some hotel, especially with these things.\u201d At this Rena gently cupped and jiggled her breasts, making the pair of fleshy orbs bounce a little before settling back into place.<br>\r\n\u201cI can only imagine\u201d, Kemnebi joked lightly before shifting back to his serious, business mode. \u201cNow, the workers will be here in about an hour. So, if you wouldn\u2019t mind packing an overnight bag, I need to make a few calls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena gave a gentle nod in reply, watching as Kemnebi stepped out of her house, hand carrying his cell phone towards his ears. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little curious about Kemnebi. At first glance he was as scary person, and when he was working he acted the way he looked, serious, efficient, and not to be messed with. Still, amongst the strong worker Rena had seen a few glimpses of something she hadn\u2019t expected. He had been kind, and sounded a little shy. Thinking a big bruiser like him was shy made Rena laugh a little to herself, stepping into her bedroom as she pulled a small suitcase from her closet and began to pick out a few things to wear the next day.<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\nThe workers arrived an hour later as promised, and Kemnebi directed them to where to install the machine and to make sure there was a way to hide it, since there would be times that Rena did have company over and she wouldn\u2019t want them to see a wall mounted breast pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Rena followed Kemnebi out to his truck, the black panther opening the passenger side door for her and waiting for Rena to climb in and get comfortable before pushing it shut and circling around to his own side. The truck was fairly nice, not the newest model out but not more than a few yeas old. It wasn\u2019t long before the truck had found its way to a freeway, driving amongst the other cars for about only a few minutes before taking an exit down into the heart of downtown. Skyscrapers lined either side of the street, and after passing a few blocks Kemnebi turned hi struck into a parking garage, giving a gentle wave to the guard at the entrance, who lifted the gate so the truck could drive by and park in a spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elevator ride later, Rena and Kemnebi were standing in a fairly spacious hallway, well let and decorated with a few tables and vases of flowers. Kemnebi, who was carrying Rena\u2019s back in one hand, led the tigress a few door down before pulling out his keys and gently unlocking the third door down from the elevator. Rena could hardly believe herself as she followed Kemnebi into the apartment. It was less of an apartment, and more of a penthouse suit. The whole space had a common look and design, a sleek modern look that made Rena believe that Kemnebi had either hired a decorator or all the units in this apartment looked like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where Rena was standing, there was a very sleek looking kitchen in the far right hand corner and a dining table with chair just off to her right. Just to her left were a few book shelves and a reclining chair. In the far, left hand corner of the room was sunk down lowered than the rest. In the lowered area was a large, flat screen TV set on a well organized entertainment stand, a couch on the other side. The other small item in the room was set between the couch and the kitchen, one of those fireplaces that can stand in the very center of the room, partly burnt logs visible through the foursided glass chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, make yourself at home. My guest bedroom is the one on the left. I\u2019ll just put your bag in on the bed.\u201d At that Kemnebi moved over to a pair of doors on the left side of the room that was set fairly close together, stepping through the left one and disappearing. Rena took a few tentative steps, still at awe about the room. She made her way to the far wall. The whole space was dominated by windows, allowing a wide, panoramic view of the city, the nearby skyscrapers, and even the mountains that bordered the city to the north. Rena walked up towards the windows, looking down and marveling at how high up they were. It was at this Rena heard a door close, and looked back to see Kemnebi stepping out of the guest bedroom. He gave Rena a weak smile, which she returned before turning her gaze back to the amazing view out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wait until later, when it starting to get dark. The city is much prettier at night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you afford a place like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy uncle,\u201d Kemnebi replied, moving up beside Rena, \u201cHe used to own this apartment but then he met his new wife and he moved in with her. He\u2019s a big company C.E.O so has a lot of money to spare and was willing to let me rent this place<br>\r\nfrom him at about 400 a month. I still have to pay for utilities, but it\u2019s still a pretty good deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just nodded her head, to entranced by the view to say much else. As Rena looked out the window Kemnebi slowly stepped back, \u201cNow, I\u2019m afraid I have to a few more thing to do before I can be done with work for the day. So, if you get hungry you may help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure\u2026 I mean\u2026 leaving a stranger alone in your house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi chuckled, \u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t dig around in my underwear drawer, you should be fine.\u201d At that the black panther man opened his door, ducking below the frame before stepping out. Rena stood anxiously for a moment, not sure<br>\r\nwhat to do. Still, after a while Rena just took a seat on the couch, flipping through the TV channels until she found something to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the afternoon passed simply. Rena had to milk herself of course, but she had brought the double breast pump with her. When it was time, she just slipped into the guest bedroom and its connecting bathroom, drinking a little but letting most of her milk go down the drain. Rena was just watching the ending credits to something roll when she heard a set of keys in the door, Kemnebi stepping in a moment later. The Black Panther gave Rena a gentle, but admittedly tired looking smile before moving over to his<br>\r\nkitchen. Rena slowly stood up, moving over to the island counter and leaning on it as Kemnebi dug in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think he gets a kick of running me ragged, more so than any of the other company representatives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be a company representative anyway?\u201d Rena asked, taking a seat on one of the bar stools that lined one side of the kitchen\u2019s island counter. \u201cI am supposed to be the one meeting with other companies or interested investors, to be the one that first introduces others to my company and what it does. If they need to emat with someone specific in GeneTech, I make the introductions and arrange the meetings. At least, that\u2019s what I was doing until GeneTech started this Mother\u2019s Milk program. Then, I was put under the direction of Mr. Sanders, who is the manager of the MM program. Now, he has me running down anyone they think is trying to cheat the company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like you thought I was.\u201d Rena countered, drawing a mindless nod from Kemnebi as he was putting together a sandwich. \u201cExactly, and excluding you, usually I deal with teenage punks, alcoholics, and lord knows what else, and they are always very defensive when I try to confront them with what their doing. This week alone I\u2019ve had three shotguns pointed at my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I quit?\u201d Kemnebi answered, putting the top slice of bread on his sandwich. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a very good paying job, I can handle the work, and you don\u2019t know what I went through even to become a Senior Company Rep. It was either this, or get paid half as much to keep an eye on the crowd at a night club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be honest, you do look a lot like most club bouncers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d Kemnebi said, picking up his sandwich and taking a bite, chewing a little before swallowing, \u201cIs half the problem. So, what kind of sandwich would you like, or do you want me to run out and get you something in particular.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, a sandwich is fine, turkey if you have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I do have a few slices left. Besides the sandwich, do you want anything else. I got some chips, grapes\u2026 uh, I don\u2019t know about this cottage cheese but you can certainly give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe grapes please.\u201d Rena replied, watching a Kemnebi assembled her sandwich, setting a small pile of grapes on the side before sliding the plate across the counter towards her. Then, as Rena took her first bite, Kemnebi pulled out to glasses, holding up a jug as he said, \u201cWould you like some milk?\u201d Rena couldn\u2019t help but smile, swallowing the food in her mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I have enough already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi laughed a little, \u201cWell, that milk isn\u2019t going to be in your belly. So, yes or no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please.\u201d Rena replied, watching as Kemnebi poured two tall glasses, passing one to Rena and keeping one for himself. Rena would have preferred a bit of her own milk, but she didn\u2019t want to embarrass herself in front of someone by drinking her own lactations, so she just dealt with the dairy cow milk, she and Kemnebi eating in silence.<br>\r\nAfter the meal was over Kemnebi disappeared into his bedroom, leaving Rena to her own devices. The tiger striped woman watched a bit of TV for a while, but after a while she began to feel fairly tired. It had been an interesting day, for certain. Still, as Rena stood up, planning to go to bed, she realized that she would need to sleep in the guest bedroom bathtub. This would have been fine, but Rena didn\u2019t want to ruin Kemnebi\u2019s blankets or pillows with her late night leakage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena gently knocked on Kemnebi\u2019s bedroom door, hearing him shout to come in. Rena gently cracked the door, sticking her head inside and looking around. Kemnebi\u2019s room was fairly larger than the guest bedroom, and looked like the black panther used it for a bedroom, a home office, and a workout area. The room was decorated much like the main living room of the apartment, the furniture all fairly sleek and modern. The bed sat in the middle of the far wall, some dresser drawers and waredrobes on the right wall. In the far corner was a desk with a simple comuter, and in the open space in the center of the room was Kemnebi, sitting on one of those Bowflex Home Gyms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t help but stare as she watched Kemnebi flexing his arms on the home gym.. When he was wearing his suit, Kemnebi looked like a club bouncer. Still, a that moment, he was just in a tank top and some sport shorts, and Rena felt herself blushing. He looked good, really good. Without sleeves or long pants to hide them, it was easy to see that Kemnebi took really good care of himself. Usually, it was hard for Cat people to get any real muscle definition because of their fur, but Kemnebi was defying that rule. Even through his fur Rena could see his muscles were sturdy, thick, and strong. His tank top could do little to contain his very large chest, his pecks stretching the fabric. Kemnebi\u2019s legs also showed the same level tone, which was matched only<br>\r\nby his fairly large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need Rena?\u201d Kemnebi asked, pausing only a moment before squeezing his arms together against the resistance of the Bowflex. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d Rena said a moment, adverting her eyes to keep herself form staring, \u201cI\u2026 I need to sleep in the guest bathtub<br>\r\nand, I was wondering if you had some extra towels or something I could use to make a bed.\u201d<br>\r\nKemnebi gently brought back his arms, drawing them down from the exercise machine, panting a bit as he slowly stood up. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of spare towels that you can use. Just let me get them out of my closet.\u201d Thus, within a few minutes, Rena and Kemnebi were standing in the guest bathroom, a bed of towels set out in the bottom of the fairly large bathtub. Kemnebi was taking the time to fluff up the towel that would serve as Rena\u2019s pillow for the evening before standing up straight, giving Rena a gentle smile before moving towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Rena. I\u2019ll have breakfast ready in the morning and then we\u2019ll go by your house and I can show you how to operate your new pumps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Was all Rena could say as she watched Kemnebi step out of the bathroom, cross the guest bedroom, and head out the far door, shutting it beside him. Rena cursed herself a bit, feeling both stupid and embarrassed at the same time. It was no secret to her friends; Rena had a weakness for guys that were muscular. She had a crush on a football player during most of high school, and Kemnebi was hitting all the right keys. Still, Rena learned that the big strong guys were only interested in the women that were loose with their lips and pants, and while Kemnebi didn\u2019t seem like that kind of<br>\r\nperson he also didn\u2019t seem interested in her. She was business, that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after making sure the guest bedroom door was locked Rena stripped out of her clothing, shutting of the lights before climbing into the bathtub. Because the tub was larger, it was much easier for Rena to get comfortable. Still, as she felt sleep pulling at her eyes, Rena couldn\u2019t help but gently brush her breasts, two thoughts running across her mind. First, was she going to be even bigger in the morning or would her growth final stop. The second thought, which made Rena blush, was the image in her mind of Kemnebi working out on his bowflex. It sent a shiver down her spine just thinking of<br>\r\nhis flexing muscles. He really was in great shape, could have probably been a body builder if he wanted.<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\nBy another sweet grace, when Rena awoke the next morning, she was not swimming in a pool of her own milk. The drain had remain clear all night, so the worst she had the rivulets on her breasts and a few wet spots on her body where the towels had soaked up the water and begun to pass it to her body. After throwing out the towels Rena gently turned on the tub water, getting out long enough to fill before sinking back in. The water felt good, and as Rena sank in she couldn\u2019t help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena enjoyed the hot water, her hands came up to her breasts. They had grown larger, again, and since they were full laden with milk they were very firm and tight, almost painfully so. Still, as Rena sat enjoying the hot bath she found she didn\u2019t want to ruin it by getting out and getting her breasts pump. So, with little else she could do, Rena began to gently rub her breasts, particularly her nipples, coaxing the milk out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk began to come out in small but steady streams, and Rena\u2019s original plan had just been to let the milk disperse in the tub water. Still, as the sweet smell of her own milk reached Rena\u2019s nose, she couldn\u2019t deny the fact that she was thirsty. After looking over and seeing that the bedroom door was still closed and locked, Rena saw no harm in it. She first had to get a little milk out, letting the white liquid gently seep into the tub. Then, with her breasts no longer stretched tight by the liquid they contained, Rena lowered her head and used one hand to bring up her other breast. It was like when she first discovered herself lactating, well\u2026 almost. The first time, it had been feline instincts demanding Rena to lick herself clean. This time, Rena was thirsty. Her rough<br>\r\ntongue gently moved out, playing with her nipple and causing it to harden, eventually starting to give up the tender liquid it held back. Rena could barely control herself as she felt the milk hit her tongue. This was her milk at its freshest and<br>\r\nwarmest, and it tasted even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena\u2019s lips wrapped around the rim of her nipple, tongue still playing with the milk giving biological valve as she sucked, drawing out the milk with the power of her lungs and diaphragm. Rena really lost herself, able to enjoy the full sensation of her tongue playing with her breast. When her right breast was empty, Rena moved to her left and repeated, and by the end she had drank enough milk to fill her stomach, her gut slightly rounder because of the liquid it now contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her desires and thirst abated, Rena finished the bath, dried off, and got dressed in her fresh set of clothing. Then, after running through her usual morning routine, Rena packed all of her stuff back into her backpack and unlocked the guest bedroom door, heading out into the main space of the apartment. Kemnebi was dressed in his full suit, sitting at the table as he munched at a piece of toast and read the paper. Upon<br>\r\nhearing Rena walking across the floor, the black panther looked up, swallowing before offering Rena a good morning. She returned it, and after the tigress had a chance to eat some toast herself Kemnebi led her back to his truck, and soon the pair were back at Rena\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the least, Rena was impressed when she entered he bedroom. For the most part everything looked the way it should have, which Rena appreciated since she feared how much the workers would change. The only thing Rena really noticed was to the right of her bed, suspended on the wall, was a fairly large black box. Kemnebi moved over to the box, gently pulling open its lid and revealing what was contained within. The biggest part were to fairly long hoses, each having a fairly large suction cup on the end. Beside the tubes were a few buttons and switches which seemed to be duplicated.<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, this will work like most of the breast pumps you already have. You just place the suction cups in the appropriate areas, and then turn this switch from off to on. The pump will automatically apply a very weak suction to keep the cups in place. Then, you can use these arrows or this number pad to increase or decrease the suction level. The<br>\r\npumps power has been set on a scale from 1 to 100.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi gently pushed a black button in the box, and something snapped out of place. It was one set of the controls, Kemnebi holding it up. \u201cNow, the pump comes with both a hardwired control and this remote. My suggestion is, for the first time, that you use the arrows to increase the pump suction until it reaches your comfortable with. Then, later, you can use the number pad to quickly enter the level. Finally, if anything feels like its going wrong, the remote and the wall mount both have a pair of panic buttons. Pressing the two buttons at the same time will kill power to the system and alert our technicians.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where does the milk go?\u201d Rena asked, moving closer and looking at the tubes and suction cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other side of this wall, outside, a refrigerated unit has been installed. Inside that unit is a tank where the milk willbe stored. The technicians have sensors installed to monitor the tanks level, and when it\u2019s getting close to full someone will come out and exchange it for an empty one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s it\u2026\u201d Rena said, taking the remote from Kemnebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful not to turn up the suction to high. It can\u2019t do any real harm, but I imagine that it could start to hurt if the pump starts sucking to hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thank you Kemnebi. It will be so nice to sleep in a bed again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure Rena.\u201d The black panther said, gently bowing his head to Rena before heading towards the door. Still, as Kemnebi crossed the living room Rena jogged after him. Hearing Rena coming, the black panther turned, looking down at Rena as he asked, \u201cDid I forget something?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Rena replied, putting her hands behind her back and gently twisting her foot. \u201cI\u2026 I was just wondering if\u2026 I couldhave your phone number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kemnebi said way to easily, pulling out a business card, \u201cIf you need anything else or if the pump starts acting weird, feel free to call.\u201d<br>\r\nRena took the card, turning it over\u2026 \u201cYes, of course\u2026 but, um\u2026 would you mind if I called\u2026 for other reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi stared at Rena for a moment, a bit of a confused look on his face. \u201cUh\u2026 like?\u201d<br>\r\nRena cursed, why was she having such trouble with this? She had dated before; She didn\u2019t have trouble with other guys. Then again, she usually dated accountants and other desk workers, who were thin and admittedly gangly. Kemnebi was far from that, and darn it if Rena was finding it hard to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe if you wanted to grab coffee sometime\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi\u2019s mind finally clicked, and he quickly shifted, coughing into his hand as he turned to look at the floor. \u201cUh, sure\u2026 when\u2026 when are you off work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI telecommute, and I usually get my work done fairly quickly. So, whenever you have a spare minute and\u2026 and you want to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kemnebi nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d After that, and a pair of awkward goodbyes, the black panther left, Rena watching him through a window until his truck had pulled out of sight. At the moment, Rena didn\u2019t know how to read what<br>\r\nhappened. He didn\u2019t seem enthusiastic, nor did he seem offended. He actually seemed a bit embarrassed, though Rena couldn\u2019t imagine why. A guy with muscles like his could probably get ten dates in ten minutes without even trying. Still, that familiar sensation was beginning to slip into Rena\u2019s breasts. Pausing a moment to look out the window a little<br>\r\nlonger, Rena turned back and went into her bedroom. Her breasts weren\u2019t full, but it wouldn\u2019t take much longer. Besides, she had to experiment with the pump for a bit, figure out the level of suction that would drain her without being<br>\r\nuncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after shutting her window blinds and turning on the light, Rena pulled off her tightly stretched shirt, walking over and pulling the suction cups out of the wall mount. At first, Rena assumed that she would have to stand beside the wall mount because the tubes were so short, but upon pulling Rena found that the tubes retracted into the wall. She began pulling, and found that the tubes could actually reach all the way into her living room, thus allowing her to use the pump practically anywhere in the house.<br>\r\nAfter letting the tubes retract a bit, Rena took a seat on her bed. She picked up the remote control to the pump, gently pressing the on button. The subtle sound of air being pulled through the tubes began to reach Rena\u2019s ears, and after holding the suction cups for a moment and testing the suction with her finger, she gently set them atop her nipples. The vacuum of air was enough to hold the cups on Rena\u2019s breasts, but as Kemnebi said it definitely wasn\u2019t enough to draw any milk out. So, Rena gently tapped the up arrow a few times, watching the number read out on the screen increase from one to five, zero being the systems off number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the increase pressure, Rena could now feel the suction cups pulling on her breasts. It was still weaker than the normal breast pumps, and so Rena tapped the button a few more times, getting it to ten. That was when the suction felt right, and Rena could see milk coming out of her breasts through the transparent suction cups. It was steady flow,and Rena laid back and just let the pump do its job. In a short time Rena was dry, and she shut the pump of and removed the suction cups. She then put everything away in the wall mounted case, and in such was able to go about her day. The big wall mounted pump really wasn\u2019t much different than the common breasts pumps she had been using. It, however, would allow Rena to sleep in her own bed and there was no chance she could outgrow the tubes, considering how far each tube could reach. <br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\nIn such, Rena\u2019s day passes and the night comes, and as Kemnebi suggested Rena kept the pump on a very low setting during the night, just enough suction that it would carry away any milk her breasts would leak. Still, what else is to come is a mystery that must be solved by choosing an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The pumps do their job perfectly and Rena is able to sleep in her own bed, finding herself dry in the morning. Thus, after turning up the pump and draining herself a little, she is able to go about her day like normal. Rena can tell her breasts have gotten a little bigger, but it\u2019s a growth that she has gotten used to. Still, the tigress can only hope that the growth soon stops. Besides that the day is simple until later, when Kemnebi stops by. He says that he justed wanted to check and make sure everything is working, but after making small talk for a while Kemnebi, awkwardly, asks Rena if she wants to head<br>\r\nout a grab a bite to eat. Rena, after being a little twitterpated from being asked out by Kemnebi, accepts and the pair head out. What the even will hold is out in the open, but with Kemnebi\u2019s size and Rena\u2019s bustline it\u2019s bound to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Not used to sleeping with suction cups on her breasts, Rena toss and turns a bit in her sleep. In the process, her hand hits the remote control, turning the pwer up so the pump is actively drawing milk from her breasts. That is fine for the first few minutes, since the pump is drawing milk out of Rena\u2019s breasts. Still, when that milk is gone the pump continues to suck, and in such Rena\u2019s body must adjust to the constant demand.<br>\r\n(This option could lead to a few things. A much greater increase in breast size, a much faster production of milk, or any combination of the two. Either way, Rena\u2019s gotten into a worse situation thanks to the pumps, and Kemnebi is bound tofeel guilty.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rena really knew it, it was time to go to bed. The tigress was a little anxious, worried about what could happen during the night. If the pumps didn\u2019t work or if the suction cups came off, then she would probably not only drench and ruin her sheets and mattress, but probably part of her carpet too. Still, Rena slowly laid down, slipping carefully beneath the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the covers up to just below her breasts, and then slowly set the suction cups overtop her nipples. She used the remote to gently click the suction up to the number two, and after testing a little bit decided to go with a level 3 power before setting down the remote. The gentle humming of the pump in the wall broke the silence that usually covered Rena\u2019s room, but slowly the comfort of sleeping in her own bed again gently coaxed Rena off to sleep.<br>\r\nWhen Rena awoke in the morning, the pumps gentle humming reached her ears again. It was a little peculiar to wake up with a pair of hoses stuck on your chest with suction, but once Rena got over the strangeness a smile cracked onto her face. Her bed and sheets were all perfectly dry, the only wet spot on Rena\u2019s entire body was beneath the suction cups, where some milk was trapped on her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the pumps suction was only enough to take away the leakage from the night before, Rena\u2019s breasts were still full. So, she quickly set the pumps to their level 10 suction, and laid back, snoozing a little as her breasts were emptied. When the milk stopped, Rena shut the pump off and got out of bed, heading to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Rena did was stand in front of the mirror, looking at herself. Again, her breasts had seemed to have grown, the pair of orbs standing just that much father out from her chest. Rena gently set her hands on either side of her breasts, her fingers sinking a little ways into the soft flesh as she gently bounced the two. They still weren\u2019t too bad. They were defenantly the biggest breasts Rena had ever seen, but they could be still accepted by most people. As Rena held them she had to guess at the cup size, eventually coming up with a something between an I and J cup. Defenantly the biggest Rena had ever heard of, but not so far out there that someone would be suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, as Rena turned on the water and started the shower, she couldn\u2019t help but deny that even they had practically doubled in size, she still really like having them. Memories of the night club began to dance in Rena\u2019s mind, how all those boys had wanted to dance with her. If she had tried to go out like that when flat chested, the bouncer may not have even let her in thinking she was underage. With her breasts, there was no way anyone would mistake her for a tall teenager again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing Rena knew, however, is she had to start considering updating her wardrobe. All her shirts, if she tried to wear them with her new breasts, would be practically halter tops. A bra would be nice as well, but until she had stopped growing Rena knew it wasn\u2019t the best idea to invest in something so size specific. Besides that, either because of the hormones, her natural youth, or the milk being produced inside, her breasts had a natural support to them. It was fantastic, and they still jiggled quiet a bit if she tried to move to quickly, but as long as she avoided running or entering a wet t-shirt contest, her breasts would be fine without a bra until they had stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with plans set for a shopping trip in the afternoon, Rena went about her usual morning routine. She slipped on one of the last t-shirts that still fit her, the fabric stretching and sliding up to contain her breast, revealing a large part of her back and stomach. Still, when you telecommuted to work, the work attire didn\u2019t even matter. Rena knew some of her coworkers did all their work in pajamas because of the company\u2019s telecommuting system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the morning Rena was able to work, putting in a few necessary hours even though most of her work was done for the day. She paused only to milk herself, so by 11:00 she had finished her work for the day. That left only to eat a quick lunch and then head to the mall for a shopping trip. Still, as Rena was bent over, pecking around her refrigerator for a few moments, she heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Rena answered a few moments later, poking her head out before smiling and opening the door wide. It was Kemnebi, the towering black panther smiling as he gently took of and folded his sunglasses, slipping them into his jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came by to check up on things. How is the pump working?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Rena replied, \u201cIt was so nice to sleep in a real bed again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is good to hear. I guess I had better get going than.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you in are a rush?\u201d Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi stopped mid turn, looking back at Rena, Not really. Today\u2019s actually been pretty slow, which is a rare thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was just starting to get lunch out. If you want, you can come in a grab a bite. It\u2019s the least I can do after you fed me dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi glanced away a moment, as if unsure of himself, but then smiled, \u201cSure\u2026 what are you having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to grill some salmon. I need to get rid of it before it goes bad. Come on in and take a seat, it will only be a few minutes.\u201d At that Rena stepped back, letting Kemnebi come into the house before shutting the door. As she walked back to the kitchen, Rena couldn\u2019t help but look back and see Kemnebi standing by the door. If she didn\u2019t know better, she would think he was some high school freshman that was waiting for his prom date to come down, not wanting to disturb anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so tense Kemnebi. Go ahead and sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black panther nodded, taking a seat at the table. The pair made some light talk as Rena cooked, Kemnebi asking about Rena\u2019s recipe as the sweet smells of the cooking salmon started to reach his nose. In ten minutes, Rena had two plates set out with grilled salmon in a garlic sauce with a side of salad on each plate. Rena then asked Kemnebi what he wanted to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilk\u2026 if you have it?\u201d Kemnebi said, making Rena flinch a little. She looked back into the refrigerator. She had milk, but it was all her milk. Still, after reaching in and checking the date on her old gallon of dairy cow milk, Rena was relieved to see that it hadn\u2019t expired. It was a day short, but after sniffing at it Rena determined that it was still good. Thus, Rena set out two glasses, bringing out the dairy cow milk and pouring one glass full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, since Rena wanted to drink her own milk, she set out some silverware on the counter and asked if Kemnebi would set them out on the table. The black panther readily agreed, picking up the silver ware and then focusing on setting them out. Rena took the opportunity to quickly pour part of a bowl of her own milk into her own glass before slipping it back, all before Kemnebi could notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis smells wonderful Rena.\u201d Kemnebi said as Rena brought the plates to the table.<br>\r\n\u201cJust consider this a thank you for letting me stay with you while the pump was being installed.\u201d Rena replied, turning and grabbing the glasses of milk, setting one down in front of Kemnebi before taking a seat with her own. Thus, the pair began eating, Kemnebi complimenting Rena on the salmon. The tiger-stripped cat-woman had started with her salad, but after taking a few bites Rena picked up her glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she almost coughed it up right in front of Kemnebi. This wasn\u2019t her milk, it was normal dairy cow milk. Rena was first confused, wondering how she had mixed up the glasses before she began to panic. She had mixed up the glasses, meaning that instead of having the dairy cow milk Kemnebi\u2019s glass was filled with\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned abruptly, just to see Kemnebi trying to take his first drink from the glass. Without even thinking, Rena reached out, grabbing the glass and trying to pull it away from Kemnebi. The sudden motion of course caused the milk to splash out of the glass, and douse Kemnebi\u2019s head. The black panther sputtered, the shock of getting splashed making him let go the glass before he looked at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Kemnebi asked, trying to wipe away some of the milk from his eyes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, you can\u2019t drink this milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you drank some of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, this was supposed to be your glass, and it\u2019s only when I drank some of mine that I realized it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so, what\u2026 did you pour yourself some skim milk and mixed up the glasses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked down at the glass, her hands gently shifting on the smooth glass, \u201cI did mix up the glass, but this isn\u2019t skim milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c1%\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi sat back, using his napkin to wipe some of the milk off his face. \u201cVitamin D milk then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d Rena replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 what kind of milk is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t even look at Kemnebi, being overly embarrassed. Still, Rena knew she could avoid the question for ever. So, as Kemnebi looked at Rena expectantly, the tigress just looked down at her plate, muttering something under her breath that was to quiet for Kemnebi to hear clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026 mine.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was good, really good, and this was before I even signed up to send my milk off to your company, so I was trying not to be wasteful, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi held up his hand at this point, causing Rena to fall silent. He then gently stretched out his hand, taking his glass back from Rena. With the tigress watching in shock, horror, and deep embarrassment, Kemnebi gently tipped the glass up to his lips. He took only the smallest sip, just enough to get a taste. He then set the glass down, swallowing his sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re right, it is good.\u201d Kemnebi said, smiling at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, you\u2019re not grossed out, even thought\u2026\u2026. it came from\u2026\u201d Rena couldn\u2019t help but glance down at her breast.<br>\r\n\u201cRena, when the Mother Milk program was started by, I had the unfortunate task of helping the researchers with preliminary taste tests. Originally, they didn\u2019t want to pay mothers for their milk, so they tried developing milk from different sources that could be close enough to natural mother\u2019s milk. I have had to drink milk from machines and beasts of every kind. Besides that, if you think about it, a cow\u2019s udder isn\u2019t that appealing in its own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you don\u2019t mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate getting milk in the face.\u201d Kemnebi admitted, \u201cbut, I can understand why you would try to stop me. So, how about we just forget this happened and we enjoy the meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, reaching out to trade her glass for Kemnebi\u2019s only to watch the black panther pick it up and take a big gulp, as if it was normal store bought milk. When he set it down he saw Rena looked in at him with a bit of confusion on her face. He just smiled, \u201cWhat\u2026. I told you it tasted good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little at this, Rena standing up and taking her own glass to the sink, pouring the last of the cow milk down the sink before refilling her glass with her own milk. It was defenantly a strange set of circumstances, but Rena couldn\u2019t help but think the lunch with Kemnebi had gone well. After the pair had finished Kemnebi began walking to the door, needing to get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Rena was seeing him out, Kemnebi stopped just before heading out the door, looking back at Rena. \u201cThanks for lunch again. It was\u2026 interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust promise you won\u2019t tell anyone. I doubt most people would be so\u2026 understanding about what I was doing with my own milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo tell them I would have to admit to what I did, so I doubt I\u2019m going to be saying much. Still, uh\u2026\u201d Kemnebi paused at this, glancing away from Rena, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m going to get off fairly early tonight, I don\u2019t have many cases I need to check into. Would you\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 uh, want to catch a movie or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 want to take me to a movie?\u201d Rena asked, brushing a bit of hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind sitting in the back. If I sit anywhere else, I usually get hit with popcorn most of the movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Rena replied, \u201cI don\u2019t mind sitting in the back, but I\u2019ll have to get up during the movie. You know\u2026 to\u2026 uh\u2026 empty the tanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe we should just rent a movie then. That way, we can pause the movie when you need a few minutes and I don\u2019t have to worry about getting hit with popcorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sound nice.\u201d Rena half laughed, \u201cWhere do you want to watch the movie, here or at your apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the nicer TV, and there\u2019s a movie theater on the way. We can stop there and get some real popcorn, bring a little of the theater back to the apartment with us..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. I\u2019m planning to head out later, do you want me to grab the movies?\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there is a movie place a block away from my apartment. I can pick out a few things and then I can just stop on my morning run to return them.\u201d Kemnebi replied, ducking as he turned to head out the door. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll pick you up here about seven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Rena replied, the pair saying a quick but admittedly awkward good bye. Rena then tried to play it cool, shutting the door as Kemnebi left. Still, the second the latch clicked Rena bolted, quiver a little to feel her breasts bouncing as she ran but reaching the window all the same, watching Kemnebi walk around his truck and climb in. Rena could barely contain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so spontaneous, so spur of the moment, both for her to invite Kemnebi in for lunch and him to ask her out to the movies. They were going to just rent a movie, but it was still heading out to see a movie with the admittedly handsome panther man. Rena didn\u2019t know what it was about him, but she just could deny that she liked him. That, and she could still remember catching him working out, those muscles flexing. He was the tall, dark, mysterious stranger that so many fortune tellers loved to predict a woman had in her future, and she had a movie date with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nFor the first time in a while, Kemnebi actually didn\u2019t mind heading back to the office. Mr. Sanders wanted him to come back for a meeting. Usually, this would be the last thing Kemnebi would want to do. Still, because he had a date to look forward to, he could handle seeing Mr. Sanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kemnebi parked his truck and began to stride through the company parking complex to get inside the factor/laboratory/business office building, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Rena. In truth, he was so surprised when Rena agreed to date him. He couldn\u2019t deny the fact that to most women, he looked like a bouncer, gangster, or government agent. Basicaly, he looked like trouble and that put most women off. Then, those that did take interest in him were never the kind of person he would want to spend time with. Girls looking for a one night stands or who are only interested in using him to make an ex-boyfriend jealous. Rena was the first decent girl that had taken an interest in him in a long time, and that fact alone made Kemnebi\u2019s smile broaden ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the panther-man gently knocked on the door to Mr. Sanders office, the division manager who was in charge of the Mother\u2019s Milk program and his direct superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in?\u201d Mr. Sanders said, his voice carrying a strange tone to it that Kemnebi had never quiet pinned down, even after working for the man for so long. It was smooth, but at the same time rough in nature. The tone soft, but the words and the power behind them hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see me Sir?\u201d Kemnebi said, stepping in through the door. The office was spacious, with the back wall made entirely of windows. It was a nice office, something you would expect for a division manager. Mr. Anthony Sanders was seated at his desk, spinning around to look at Kemnebi as he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Sanders was a bit of a mix bread. He was a cat person, but his mother had been panther like in nature while he father was very lion like. This mix left Sanders to be a lion-man with fur as black and shiny as a pure panthers. His mane, which should have been a bit of natural poof to it, also laid flat most of the time, giving Mr. Sanders the appearance of having long hair though, like mot cat-men, he didn\u2019t have a head of human hair, just his fur.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Kemnebi, just the man I wanted to see. Please, sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Kemnebi replied, not used to being treated so nicely by Sanders. The dark furred lion offered him a bit of scotch, which Kemnebi turned down since he wasn\u2019t really a drinker. Mr. Sanders poured himself a small glass, but didn\u2019t take a drink as he walked around to the front of his desk, leaning his back against the finely polished oak.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing things Kemnebi, and I want you to verify some facts for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about one of our milk providers, a Miss Rena Westfall. Reports here says she sending in a large surplus of milk. This usually wouldn\u2019t draw my attention, considering how many punks try to play us for fouls. Still, at the bottom, I found this interesting note that I had never seen before. Production Verified. Care to explain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sir. I spoke with Rena and her doctor. She accidentally got a hormone treatment at a clinic instead of the immunization she had planned. Her body has reacted a bit weirdly to the hormones, and it has caused her\u2026 well, her breasts to grow and produce milk at an amazing rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow amazing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, when she showed me, she was able to almost fill three of our milk bottles with one milking from her breasts, and they fill up about every hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, and that explains why we installed a powerful pump at her residence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, I called in the request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Sanders smiled, \u201cAnd good call on that. Still, is Miss Westfall still growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard of question Kemnebi. You stopped by to check in on the pump, did she look bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026 but I can\u2019t really say. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep up with me here Kemnebi, because I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d Mr. Sanders said, taking his weight of the desk before he began to pace slowly back and forth. \u201cNow, what has been the problem with the Mother\u2019s Milk program?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we don\u2019t have enough supply to meet demand, and have to always be looking for new contracts since all of ours, except Rena, are only lactating when pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, we don\u2019t have a reliable resource. Now, what has let Rena become so dependable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026 an accidentally hormone shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo such thing as accidents, just new opportunities.\u201d Mr. Sanders corrected, taking a sip of his scotch. \u201cStill, our opportunity is the fact that this woman has become a veritable milk cow because of one shot. I\u2019ve already talked with her doctor, and retasked some of our researchers to figure out what happened and if it can be recreated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple Kemnebi. If we can recreate what\u2019s happened to Rena Westfall, we can undoubtedly find some women willing to be put through a procedure. We could charge for it, call it a natural breast enhancement, and then they can earn back the investment they put into the procedure by selling us the milk they produce. Get enough, and we could finally go high scale production with our Mother\u2019s Milk line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, why are you telling me this?\u201d Kemnebi asked, not quiet liking where Mr. Sanders was taking the conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the one that discovered the golden goose Kemnebi, you deserved to be rewarded, that and I need to chew someone\u2019s ear, to here myself talk about this little plan I have without talking to myself. So, thanks for listen, why don\u2019t you take the rest of the week off and have a big bonus, on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!?\u201d Kemnebi said, a smile spreading onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ve been running you ragged chasing down the frauds. You deserve a chance to relax. Enjoy yourself; take your girlfriend on a long vacation. I hear the beach is wonderful this time of year.\u201d At this Mr. Sanders stretched out his hand, Kemnebi shaking it as the black panther got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a girlfriend sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, a nice guy like you, I\u2019d think the girls would be clamoring. So, no special someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 there is someone, but were having our first date tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, then you head right out that door, and I don\u2019t want to see you around this office until Monday. You got that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mr. Sandres, thank you.\u201d Kemnebi replied, heading out the office door and pulling it shut behind him. Mr. Sanders continued to smile well after Kemnebi left, slowly walking back to his desk where he took a seat in his big cushy and leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a nice guy Kemnebi,\u201d Mr. Sanders muttered to himself, the gears in his mind turning, \u201cand, maybe you won\u2019t finish last\u2026\u2026 if you can help me get what I want.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It had been a while since she had been on a date, and Kemnebi really seemed nice. I mean, he hadn\u2019t gotten mad when he drank her milk. He just rolled with it. Rena wasn\u2019t even sure if his story about testing milk was true, but if it wasn\u2019t that just made it even more astounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rena was finding herself at a road block with time running out before Kemnebi would arrive. She had gone shopping, so she had some shirts that would fit and, thanks to a little poking around, she had gotten a bra for her current size, which was at the very bottom of a J cup. The bra wasn\u2019t the problem, and neither was the underwear, she had both on. No, the problem was spread across her bed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirts, a few pairs of pants, and a dress, that was all spread out across Rena\u2019s bed as she tried to decide what to wear. It was just a movie, so Rena didn\u2019t want to be too formal. So the dress was really an extreme option, but one Rena had to consider. She would probably wear pants, but she still had two options there. A dark blue pair and other that were pale blue, faded, and head that heavily warn look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the pants would come into place depending what shirt Rena choose, and she had three options for that. One was a simple black long sleeve shirt, perfect for having a nice movie night between friends. The second shirt was a red blouse with short sleeves and a few buttons on top. It was a style of shirt Rena had used before on first dates, saying that she was interested in a guy but not in a one night stand. The final shirt was a white tank top with a low cut front. It was the kind of thing Rena would have worn to show herself off at a night club, kind of trashy\u2026 but\u2026<br>\r\nRena groaned, scratching her head furiously. This was worse then shopping for dresses before her senior prom. Did she want to look more calm and conservative, or did she want to show off for Kemnebi. I mean, she actually had something to show of now, so why not use it. To make everything worse, as she was trying to concentrate, Rena could tell her breasts were getting full. Still, she wanted to wait until it was almost Seven before draining herself, that way she wouldn\u2019t have to do it until almost an hour after Kemnebi picked her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena picked up the shirts, holding them in front of herself as she looked in the mirror. After going back and forth between the three shirts about five times, Rena glanced at the clock. 6:50; she had ten minutes before Kemnebi was supposed to arrive, and there was always a chance he would come early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Rena, you need to pick something.\u201d She pepped talked herself, setting out the shirt again and looking them over. Still, after two minutes she still couldn\u2019t decide on one, so Rena began attacking it differently. She picked up the white tank top, hanging it back in her closet. That was to revealing, and if she started to leak the white would show through too easily. That at least eliminated one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, however, that Rena heard a knock at the door. She stuck her head out her bedroom door, looking through the living room window and seeing Kemnebi\u2019s truck sitting on the street. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time.\u201d Kemnebi shouted back. Still, Rena quickly went into a panic. She pulled off her new bra, putting on the suction cups and clicking on the pump. As she was drained, Rena looked down at the bed, eyes clicking back and forth between the two shirts. Long sleeve black or short sleeved red, black or red, short or long\u2026\u2026. Uh, why was it so hard?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as Rena felt her breasts nearing empty, she grabbed a quarter from some spare change on her bed end table, flipping it up and calling it. As the coin came down, Rena quickly took in the answer before putting the quarter back and shutting of the pump off. She stepped into the bathroom a moment to use a towel to pad herself dry before putting her bra back on, getting dressed, and heading to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi, who was looking mindlessly around Rena\u2019s neighborhood, quickly turned as he heard the door opening. Rena smiled, gently stepping out with a backpack in one hand. In the end, the coin had chosen the black, long sleeve shirt, which Rena paired with the dark toned blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to make you wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You\u2026 look great. Is that a new shirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Rena said, a bit surprised, \u201chow could you tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi gently reached out at this, his hand grabbing on something on Rena\u2019s shoulder before quickly pulling. With a small snap Kemnebi drew back a white tag, which made Rena blush furiously. In all her rush, Rena had forgotten to pull of the tags. Still, Kemnebi was just smiling, crumpling up the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to go out and buy new shirts, not when were just watching a movie at my apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve kind of out grown all my old shirts, but if it\u2019s too much, I can go change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2026 you look nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt her blush deepen, thankful that her fur was hiding the redness. It was defenantly time for a change of subject. \u201cSo, what movies did you grab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI picked out a few from the new releases. An action, a crime mystery, and a romantic comedy, but if you don\u2019t like any of them we can stop by the rental place on our way back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d Rena said, pulling her front door shut and making sure it was locked. She then flashed a smile, Kemnebi returning it as the pair began walking towards the street. A few moments later, Rena climbed into the truck, Kemnebi holding the door. He then got in on the other side, pulling it shut before glancing over, seeing Rena setting her backpack at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that your purse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rena replied, \u201cit\u2019s my pump. After all, the movie is going to last longer than an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi just nodded his head, starting the truck. Within half an hour the pair stepped into Kemnebi\u2019s apartment, Rena setting down her backpack by the door while Kemnebi carried in the popcorn they had just picked up from the movie theater in one arm and the three rented movies in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair got comfortable on the couch, Kemnebi lowering the blinds on his windows to cut out the remaining light from outside, turning the room almost perfectly dark. Both were on the couch, the popcorn bag resting between them as the movie started. Rena had picked the action movie first, it being a highly reviewed movie that she hadn\u2019t seen. The movie was pretty good, and Rena found good points in the movie to ask Kemnebi to pause the DVD so she could go pump herself. The first time she came back after draining herself, Rena surprised to see Kemnebi had brought out a couple glasses of water, just the thing to wash down the salty popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time, since the popcorn back was practically empty. Kemnebi took the chance to clean up a little. When Rena came back, the pair sat as if the bag of popcorn was still there, staying apart until the end of the movie. At that point, Kemnebi stood up, expecting Rena to want to go home. Still, Rena surprised herself and Kemnebi by asking if she could stay a little longer and they could watch another movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one do you want to watch though?\u201d Kemnebi asked, which put Rena a little at edge. She had heard of both movies, the romantic comedy was so-so while the crime mystery had been given top ratings. The problem was that the crime mystery also had a reputation for being on the scary side, and she didn\u2019t do well with scary movies. One of her high school boyfriends had taken her to a horror flick, his plan to get close to her because of the scariness of the movie. It had worked like a charm, but Rena was afraid of hockey sticks for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, memories of that date also tempted Rena a little. The movie wouldn\u2019t be as scary, but maybe enough that she could sneak getting closer to Kemnebi, to get a chance to feel those firm arms she had seen working out the other day. So, after making her choice, Kemnebi put the mystery movie in, sitting down in his seat as it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the movie began to go just as Rena feared\u2026\u2026 or hoped. While it wasn\u2019t as bad as a pure horror movie, there were still some parts that made Rena squirm. She slipped over beside Kemnebi, and though he felt a little tense at first the panther-man eventually relaxed. Rena could only smile, resting her head on his shoulder and gently holding onto his arm. Even though he was still in his work shirt, Rena could feel the muscles underneath. They felt firm, well worked, strong\u2026\u2026 just touching them sent a shiver run down Rena\u2019s fine. She didn\u2019t know why she liked the more muscular guys, but right now Kemnebi was hitting all the right keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After being a gentleman and opening Rena\u2019s door for her, the pair walked up to Rena\u2019s front door, standing on the step for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for inviting me over Kemnebi, I really had fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime Rena\u201d Kemnebi replied. It was weird. While Rena knew she was feeling a little awkward, not sure how their first date should end, it looked like Kemnebi was feeling the same way. It was kind of weird to see such a big guy acting like he didn\u2019t know what to say or do, but at the same time it helped bring Kemnebi into focus. Changing him from a big bruiser that could work night clubs to an average guy\u2026 that just happened to be seven feet tall. Still, after a pause in the conversation where both of them glanced around, trying to find something to talk about, Rena broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 will you give me a call tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 would you prefer in the morning or later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever you get a chance.\u201d Rena replied, brushing back a bit of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, my boss gave me the rest of the week off. I don\u2019t want to get into the details\u2026 but if you wanted to do something tomorrow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Rena was giggling like a school girl. On the outside, she tried to play it cool, smiling as she asked, \u201cWell, what did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know myself.\u201d Kemnebi replied, rubbing the back of his head before remember what his Mr. Sanders suggest. \u201cThe beach is nice this time of year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA day at the beach\u2026 that does sound nice, but what about\u2026 you know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour milk problem\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded her head, glancing away. \u201cI imagine your getting a little annoyed of it by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I understand and it doesn\u2019t take you very long to drain yourself, so its no problem. As for the beach, we can bring one of your pumps. I\u2019ve got a power converter in my truck and some window covers. I put those up and plug the pump into my alternator you could easily slip in there real quick and drain yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re\u2026 um\u2026 overproducing. Besides, as long as you\u2019re careful not to spill anything, I don\u2019t see the harm in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, sure, I\u2019d love to go to the beach with you. When do you want to pick me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen would you want to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena laughed a little, gently pushing Kemnebi, \u201cAre you always such a gentleman Kemnebi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, I\u2019m no gentleman..\u201d He defended, laughing lightly through the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only shake her head, deciding to let Kemnebi\u2019s self-insult slide, \u201cHow about 9:00, but we\u2019ll need to stop somewhere on the way down. I don\u2019t really fit in my old swimsuit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you at nine then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, and after a few good nights Kemnebi walked back towards the street, climbing into his truck. He started the engine, but before pulling out he lowered the window and gave Rena a final wave. Rena returned it, and then watched as Kemnebi pulled away. Once Kemnebi was out of sight, Rena couldn\u2019t help but smile, a bit of a skip in her step as she went back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn\u2019t really talked much, just sat and watched movies, but Rena still couldn\u2019t deny that for a first date, it wasn\u2019t that bad. If anything, it had done the necessary job of any first date, securing the second date. And what a date it would be, a day at the beach. Rena\u2019s mind was already traipsing into her imagination, trying to picture Kemnebi in a pair of swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena wasn\u2019t the only one swimming from what happened. As Kemnebi drove back to his apartment, he couldn\u2019t deny the broad smile on his face. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him, or right for that matter. He usually wasn\u2019t so quick to propose a second date with someone, commonly following the unwritten date rules to wait a few days. Still, it was hard for Kemnebi to believe that Rena had agreed to so readily, heck it had been a while since he had been able to enjoy a simple evening with a woman. It was nice, really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\nSo, with a day at the beach planned for the next day, both Kemnebi and Rena decided to get to sleep early. Still, in such a public place, there are so many things that can go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: This is the more likely of the two options. Rena and Kemnebi get to the beach, both a little stunned at how good the other looks in a bathing suit (especially considering the only thing Rena could find that fits her new shape was a bikini top). Still, they put that aside and start enjoying the day. That is, until, the vultures start to swarm.<br>\r\nFirst comes the guys, who see Rena and her now very impressive assets. They see her when she is away from Kemnebi, so they think she\u2019s alone at the beach. This prompts a small group of college guys to swarm around Rena, thinking that because she\u2019s flaunting it so much she\u2019d be interested in a little fun in the back of a car. Rena shoots them down, but when the college guys don\u2019t take no for the answer Kemnebi steps in and scares them silly.<br>\r\nThen, comes the girls, who are impressed at how muscular Kemnebi is. Upon seeing Rena, however, most of them back off. That is all except one, who just had an argument with her own boyfriend. As he\u2019s following her, the woman just plops right down in Kemnebi\u2019s lap and starts talking to him like they were an item. Kemnebi is stunned and Rena can see through the charade, but it still manages to get the woman\u2019s fairly angry boyfriend even more bent out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, either a contest or fist fight will resume, that Kemnebi will win but, quickly afterward, will chew the woman out for trying to pull something like that with him. Rena will find the entire situation pretty funny, and tease Kemnebi about how he\u2019s such a chick magnet. After that, who knows what could happened with the big chested tigress and the muscular panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:<br>\r\nThere can still be some problem with people scouting the beach, but the big issue comes while Rena is swimming. For some reason, the salt water is encouraging her breasts to grow, and before she realizes what\u2019s happening her top snaps off. Feeling her breasts growing, Rena has to figure out a way to get out of the water, but in the end has to ask Kemnebi to help, bring her a towel and then helping her get back to the truck.<br>\r\n(The growth shouldn\u2019t be severe, but enough that while Rena is intensely embarrassed Kemnebi says or does something that makes feel a whole lot better, maybe even gets the panther man a little thank you kiss on the cheek.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition written by System_Crash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother lovely night sleeping in her own bed, and Rena was able to wake up very easily the next morning. She removed the suction cups, heading into the bathroom and checking herself. Her breasts had grown again, and were now well past being attractive and starting to hit ridiculous. Standing up perfectly straight, Rena wasn\u2019t even able to see her feet anymore, her breasts taking up so much of her bottom view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Rena did real quick, before jumping in the shower, was to try and put on the bra she had bought the day before. After struggling for a few minutes she got it clasped, only to have to undo it. She must have put on another cup size if not a little more, because the J cup bra was certainly way to tight to be comfortable. Still, youth and hormones gave Rena\u2019s breasts natural support, so as long as she didn\u2019t run they would be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena then stepped into the shower, unceremoniously tossing her now too small bra into the bathroom garbage before turning on the water. Rena couldn\u2019t help but purr a little beneath the warm water, gently beginning the process of cleaning her body. The other thing Rena had noticed as her breasts had gotten bigger was that the showers warm water had felt better on them than when she was flat chested. She could feel the water splashing against her fur, the warm sinking in. Rena couldn\u2019t help but gently trace a single finger across her breasts, quivering a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was clean, Rena stepped out of the shower and went into her bedroom. Thankfully, she kept the windows covered, giving her perpetual privacy at least in that part of the house. She began searching her collection of new shirts, trying to find something that said beach. In the end, Rena decided to use the white tank top she had skipped the day before, slipping it on with a pair of shorts. Perfect thing to wear when you\u2019re heading for a day on the beach.<br>\r\nAnd, as arranged, Kemnebi arrived at Rena\u2019s at 9:00. The tiger-stripped woman smiled as she opened the door, happy to see that Kemnebi was wearing something other than his business suit. It was a casual look, black t-shirt and pair of shorts. They weren\u2019t swimming trunks, Rena assuming that Kemnebi was going to change when they got to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat timing Kemnebi.\u201d Rena said, stepping out her door. She had a beach bag slung over one arm, it containing the essentials for the day. Towel, sunglasses, hat, and most importantly for Rena, the double breast pump and a large jug that she could fill then dump somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it your ready to go.\u201d He said, watching as Rena closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. So, where are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about the Westmand Beach. It\u2019s close and a pretty nice beach that usually isn\u2019t to crowded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds perfect\u201d, Rena replied, smiling gently as she walked with Kemnebi to the truck. \u201cJust remember, we need to stop at a swim shop or something on a way so I can at least try to get a swimsuit; that or a darker tank top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufeff\u201cThere is a place just off the beach. They should have something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kemnebi and Rena were off, the pair talking lightly while listening to the radio. Thirty minutes after leaving Rena\u2019s house the ocean came into view, and another fifteen minutes later Kemnebi pulled into the parking lot of a surf shop that was right on the beach, stepping out of the truck for a moment so Rena could drain herself before the pair went inside the surf shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place defenantly had a tiki hut feeling to it. The walls decorate with surfboards, pictures, fake flowers, and even a few tiki idols. It didn\u2019t take long for Rena to find the swimsuits, picking out a few with extremely large tops before heading into the dressing room. Kemnebi passed the time poking around a few other things in the shop, finding particular interest in a strange tiki that had its mouth wide and tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while Kemnebi was looking at the idol that Rena came out, blushing furiously as she asked, \u201cUm\u2026 what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi turned, his gaze meeting Rena\u2019s before his eyes shifted to the rest of her body. She was wearing a two piece swimsuit. The bottom was simple, fairly wide and designed to show off leg but not to reveal much else. The sight of Rena\u2019s top, however, made Kemnebi\u2019s mouth dry out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had quickly found that most of the suits couldn\u2019t accommodate her bodacious breasts. Still, she had finally found a top large enough, though it wasn\u2019t the kind of suit Rena had ever pictures herself wearing. The swimsuit top was dominated by two triangles that on normal sized breasts would have covered most of the skin. On Rena\u2019s however, they barely managed to cover the front, their size dwarfed by Rena\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that would fit.\u201d Rena said, her blush deepening as she stood in front o Kemnebi. Still, he smiled gently, turning to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the first bikini you\u2019ve ever warn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of\u2026 yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame, you look good in one. Now, come on, let\u2019s get that suit paid for and get to what we really came here for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only nod her, head following Kemnebi to the register. Though Rena was more than willing to, Kemnebi insisted that he would pay for the suit. Thus, the pair left the store and crossed the street, stepping onto the soft, sun warmed sand, quickly finding a spot to spread out their towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWestmand Beach was one of those places that was beautiful, but known mostly to locals. There were some tourists, but otherwise the beach was dominated by local people. Surfers, sunbathers, college students, people just wanting to get a day to relax in the sun. It was a more mature group then mom, dad, and the kids splashing around in the shore, though there were still a few toddlers toddling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few minutes Rena and Kemnebi focused on getting their own little patch of the beach set up. With their towels spread out Kemnebi went back to his truck for his beach umbrella while Rena tried to smooth out the towels. With very little trouble Kemnebi was able to get the umbrella deep into the sand, clicking it open, Rena smiling as shade fell on her face, keeping the sun out of her eyes but still letting most of her body basic in the warm glow.<br>\r\nThat was one of the true defining characteristics between pure humans and demi-humans. Pure humans had to put on sun screen if they wanted to be outside, or they were very careful so that their time spent sunbathing would result in a attractive tan. For cat-people, sun bathing was really must more like taking a hot bubble bath in the sun. The fur protected their skin from burns and from tanning as well. Still, demi-humans still sunbathed for the simple fact that, like any normal house cat, it was always very warm and comfortable taking a nap in the summer sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Putting his hands behind his head and sunglasses over his eyes, Kemnebi yawned and stretched, lying on his back. He was wearing a pair of blue trunks, a good color for his black, and strangely shiny fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was sitting up a little, having brought a book to read and enjoy with her body under the shade of the umbrella and her legs stretched out in the sun. It was a little awkward trying to find a comfortable position to read at with her new assets, but Rena eventually found a nice position, holding the book up and resting it partly on her breasts.<br>\r\nStill, even as the tigress was reading, she couldn\u2019t help but glace over at Kemnebi and find herself blushing. His strong, well toned body was even more impressive in the sun, and now Rena was able to get a proper look at his legs, which looked just as strong and sturdy as the rest of his body. Kemnebi was really just uncommonly large on all parts of his body, and looked great. Rena glanced back at her book, trying to hide her smile and blush. She had to be careful because it would be hard to explain herself if Kemnebi caught her staring.<br>\r\nAfter an hour, and once Rena had skipped back to the truck to make her drain of the day at the beach, it was time to go find something fun to do. Kemnebi was a little paranoid, and put everything in the bed of his truck before walking along side Rena down the beach. Eventually, the pair came across a boardwalk where several people had set up tables and tents, selling small beach themed bobbles and jewelry, trying to make a living through their art or make a mint on stupid tourists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while the pair were looking at a stand with necklaces that Kemnebi told Rena he had to step away for a moment, and then head of in the direction of the bathrooms. Rena watched Kemnebi leave for a moment before turning back to the stand, the man behind it smiling as she picked through the different necklaces. Though, his smile wasn\u2019t because Rena might buy something, but he was a getting a choice look at the top of Rena\u2019s impressive bustline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the shop keeper, there were others admiring Rena, most with passing glances, but a few guys with much more interest. There were three of them, all with sport star bodies that were impressive by common standards. Two of them were pure humans, one having a slightly darker tone to his skin, his physical features showing that his families roots were in Mexico and other countries to the south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second guy, the other wing man, was a Caucasian boy that wasn\u2019t quiet as strong, but had that look and stance about him that made everyone believe he was the son of a millionaire, which was the truth. These two humans, both juniors at a college near the beach, were tagging along with a senior from their fraternity, a tiger guy that was looked stronger than both of his buddies and could also be called the most handsome of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latino student whistled, nudging the wealthy son in the arm, \u201cLook at that tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTail nothing, look at those hooters. Wouldn\u2019t mind getting her back to the frat house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way dude, its all about the butt. To much up front, and it makes it harder to make love. No guy ever had trouble from a girl that had a little junk in the trunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll, she doesn\u2019t have much of anything except those hooters. Didn\u2019t think they made plastics that big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way bro, them melons are real. My brother taught me how to tell, you just have to look at how they move. Silicon is heavier than normal flesh, so it causes the breasts to be heavier than they should and in such they move differently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you got to be #($ me. There is no way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you two shut up?\u201d The tiger senior said, gently taking the toothpick out of his mouth and flicking it over the edge of the boardwalk, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just find out.\u201d At this the tiger senior began to slowly stroll across the boardwalk, the two juniors falling in line behind them as they approached the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you around this beach before. Are you new in town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena glanced back, brushing some hair out of her face as she looked at the three guys that had come up behind her. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve been in town for a few years now. I just don\u2019t get to the beach often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Fred, these two are Patrick and Alberto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena Westfall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever heard that name before, its nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rena said, turning around so she could talk more comfortable to the guys, an in such showing off her currently impressive cleavage that was being held back only by the thin strings of a oversized bikini top.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, listen\u2026 my fraternity is having a party later. It\u2019s supposed to be a lot of fun. Maybe you and I could hook up later, maybe get to know each other a little better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her head, she had been wondering. These looked like the kind of guys, frat boys that loved to pull women into their parties and try to get a one night stand out of the deal. So, after taking a moment Rena forced a smile, waving her hand as she turned back to the sand, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger senior, Fred, seemed almost stunned, and the two juniors were snickering behind his back. It was the first time they had ever seen Fred strike out with a girl, at least this quickly. Usually, he could keep their attention for a good hour, and by then he was already lined up to hit a home run or someone came, a friend usually, swooped in and pulled the woman he had been seducing off to some other part of the party. Still, Fred wasn\u2019t about to give up so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on now, it will be a blast. Our fraternity has a very nice house, has a pool, some arcade machines, and plenty of food and beer to go around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Rena replied again, this time a little more sternly. Still, the college senior wasn\u2019t about to quiet, reaching out and gently taking hold of Rena\u2019s wrists, turning her around as he smiled, his grin showing his true intentions. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t you feel like playing with the biggest stag on this beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet away from me you creep.\u201d Rena said, trying to pull herself away only to find the student\u2019s hand had become like a vice grip on her wrist. Still, before things could get out of hand, a shadow loomed over the three students, a low growl. The three boys turned to see Kemnebi, standing over them like a wrathful monster, arms crossed and a angry glare in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys mind telling me what you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing nothing.\u201d The Latino Junior quickly defended, stepping back as he tried to hide behind the tiger senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, because it looked to me like you were being very rude to my friend Rena.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, we were just asking for directions to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi shifted, pointing over his shoulder, \u201cWell, the bathroom\u2019s over there. Better get going before you have an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys just nodded, scampering away. Kemnebi huffed, shifting back to his usual mood as he looked down at Rena. \u201cYou all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\u201dYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Rena replied, \u201cThanks for scaring them off though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, considering I like trying to scare knuckle heads like that straight. Waiting the best years of their lives drowning themselves in alcohol and god knows what else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled a little, poking Kemnebi in the chest, \u201cSounds like someone is talking from experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we all make mistakes. For me, it was Pledging to a fraternity my freshman year of college. After that semester, uh\u2026\u2026. let\u2019s just say I chugged enough alcohol during those three months to last me a lifetime. I quit my fraternity after that, started lifting weights at a local gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, weight lifting, is that like your hobby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my way of relieving stress. When I get into my workout, it lets my mind rest, to concentrate on the simple motion of my body and my breathing. It really does help. What do you do to relax?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been draining myself, but other than that I like to read. Escape the real world in someone\u2019s fiction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, what kind of books do you read?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thus, as Kemnebi and Rena made their way back to their spot on the beach, they talked about their interests in movies, books, and anything else in that general realm. While Kemnebi was just enjoying the conversation, Rena was taking some mental notes. She and Kemnebi shared a some common interests in books and movies, which kind of surprised Rena. Usually, the muscular guys were all jocks, enjoying explosions and gun fights. Still, while Kemnebi did say he liked action, he also liked some more emotional things. It was defenantly interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for Rena, her ever producing breasts ruined that conversation, forcing her to leave Kemnebi for a moment to go drain herself in the car. Though she tried to hurry, the conversation was long dead when she finally got back, and knowing that resuscitating it would be a little awkward, Rena just sat down on her towel beside Kemnebi. Still, it wasn\u2019t long before something conversation worry began happening just in front of them, several eyes on the beach turning as they heard the resounding slap of a hand against skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a young woman and man having a very bad argument. The girl was pretty beautiful, curved nicely. She was demi-human, and she was extremely lean, the kind of person you have to wonder how they can even survive being so skinny. Still, she seemed healthy as she stomped down the beach, her boyfriend, a kind of rare quarter cat guy with black ears and tail who was running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Francine, you know that you\u2019re my girl. I only have eyes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned, obviously tired of being badgered since the boyfriend had been calling after her since a good distance down the beach. \u201cOnly have eyes for me\u2026 then why are you always looking up every other girl you see in public. I swear, your eying everyone like they\u2019re a piece of meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that\u2026 it\u2019s, like animal instincts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl huffed, turning away. At this the boyfriend groaned, his own eyes glancing away until he caught sight of Rena, his vision lingering. Of course, the girlfriend turned back just in time to see him doing this, a aggravated scream coming out of her lips as she shoved her soon to be ex-boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour doing it now\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, do you see her. Sometimes, you just have to look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen lets see how you like it.\u201d The girlfriend said, her own head turning, eyes searching the beach until they landed on Kemnebi. The girl smiled, glancing back at her boyfriend before strolling over to Kemnebi, smiling sweetly. \u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi just stared blankly, glancing at Rena who was just as befuddled as he was. Neither new what this woman was doing, but the situation obviously got worse as the woman sank down, actually sitting in Kemnebi\u2019s lap as her fingers gently traced his chest. \u201cDidn\u2019t think guys could get this chiseled, could have muscles so hard and strong. Maybe you and I could have a little fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi just opened and shut his mouth a few times, at a utter lose of words. The quarter-cat man was watching this, his own mouth hanging open in shock. Then, the woman did something that made Rena\u2019s, Kemnebi\u2019s, and the boyfriends all widen at the same time. Without a single hint or warning the woman leaned forward, wrapping her arms around Kemnebi\u2019s neck and planting her lips against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, this was to much, the boyfriend moving forward and pulling the woman off Kemnebi. Still, instead of being mad at her he glared at Kemnebi, pointing an accusing fingure. \u201cYou, keep your hands of my girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rena said, since Kemnebi was still reeling from the very strange thing that had just happened, \u201cHow is any of this Kemnebi\u2019s fault? He didn\u2019t even do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care. Just keep away from my girl.\u201d The boy said, and somehow that was exactly what his girlfriend wanted to hear. She smiled, taking hold of his arm as the pair walked off. Rena watched them leave, just shaking her head before looking back at Kemnebi. A shiver ran up the panther man\u2019s, his fur shifting a little as the strange sensation flowed up his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that happen often?\u201d Rena played, chuckling a little to see Kemnebi so\u2026 flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, that was the first time.\u201d He replied, finally starting to recover. \u201cAnd personally, that woman is a horrible kisser.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was trying to chew on my top lip.\u201d Kemnebi replied, in such a frank tone that Rena began to laugh. She tried to contain it at first, the giggles coming out her nose. Still, before long she couldn\u2019t hold it in, and began to laugh openly .This in turn made Kemnebi start to chuckle. Soon, the pair was laughing together, finding some strange humor in the fact that they had played a role in some random couple\u2019s argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the awkward moment passed the sun nearing the center of the sky and, in such, the day getting to its hottest, it was time to enjoy one of the two things that made a beach a beach, the water. With Rena leading the pair splashed out into the water, Rena closing her eyes and dunking her head. It was of course salty, but when you go to the beach it\u2019s what you expect and in all truth want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves were coming in pretty strong at the time, a few surfers riding the swells in the distance but no one really around where Kemnebi and Rena were. Kemnebi demonstrated his strange ability to body surf, riding the waves until they crashed on the shore, Rena watching and laughing a few times as Kemnebi read the wave wrong and ended up getting a face full of either sand or salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few goes Kemnebi came back out to where Rena had been gently floating, her feet able to touch the bottom when a wave wasn\u2019t rolling by. Rena was still smirking from his last miss, where the wave making him face plant up on the beach, a few grains still managing to cling to his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you should really try getting of the wave before it reaches shore.\u201d Rena said, drawing a slightly aggravated, but still admittedly playful look from Kemnebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, well, maybe I should see a demonstration by the master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena pointed at herself, Kemnebi nodding. \u201cOh no\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you seem to know exactly what your doing. You just start swimming with the wave just before it break, and ride it to shore. It isn\u2019t that hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena glanced back, seeing what to her look like an optimal wave come up on the shore. Feeling like showing up Kemnebi, Rena glanced back, smiling as she said, \u201cThen sit back and watch how its done, big boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Rena pushed off the bottom, swimming out a ways, to about the place where Kemnebi had been catching his waves. She tread water there for a time, waiting for a wave to come that was just right before starting to swim. Unfortunately, inexperience and poor timing got the better of Rena, and instead of riding the wave Rena got caught in it, the wave crashing over her and throwing her around like a rag doll beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling for a few moments Rena got back up to the surface, spitting water. She could hear Kemnebi laughing, and she really couldn\u2019t blame him. She smiled, turning back and shouting, \u201cThat was only a\u2026 test run. I\u2019ll get it this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time, however, ended like the first, this time the wave really throwing Rena around. She came up sputtering again, looking back at Kemnebi who was standing in water waist deep on him, arms crossed with a smug look on his face. \u201cFine,\u201d Rena said, laughing at little at her self, \u201cIt\u2019s harder then it looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Rena started walking back towards the shore, wanting Kemnebi to show her how to do it right. Still, it was then Rena noticed something, her breasts were sloshing back and for a little more than before. She glanced down, and in a heart beat quickly sank bank, moving into deeper water as she crossed her arms. Her bikini top had come off. Rena felt her face turning a beat red, eyes flashing around as she tried to find her bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena could only imagine that it had come off in the wave, which made it worse for Rena because that mean that the water undoubtedly carried her bikini towards the beach. Kemnebi, not knowing anything was wrong, started swimming out towards Rena, laughing a little as he shouted, \u201cCome on, between the two of us we can figure this out and be body surfing experts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Kemnebi\u2026\u201d Rena said, trying to cover herself with one hand while she held out the other. \u201cUh\u2026 stay right there.\u201d<br>\r\nKemnebi stopped, shifting his head, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt her face growing warmer, blush deepening. She didn\u2019t want to tell him, but what other choice did she have. She couldn\u2019t stay in the water forever, and sooner or later she\u2019d have to get out a leave with Kemnebi. Groaning, trying to muster up her courage, Rena brought her other hand across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026 my top came off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi seemed to get a little taller, his head arching as his eyes moved to Rena\u2019s shoulders, where he was able to see that the bikini strap that had been there earlier was now gone. \u201cWhen did you loose it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must have come off when I was trying to ride that last wave. Please, help me find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi nodded, turning as he began moving back towards the shore, \u201cI\u2019ll look closer to the beach. Just, stay her and try not to flash some little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Kemnebi, that makes me feel so better.\u201d Rena replied, lowering herself down so only her head was above the water. The worst part in all of this, after spending so much time watching Kemnebi, she was starting to get full again. Rena doubted it would make much difference if she leaked a little in the ocean, but it was still making the situation that much more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi jogged up and down the beach a time, checking first to see if the bikini top had washed up on shore before looking out into the water, seeing if he could see the bikini floating somewhere. Still, either because it had sunk or someone had already picked it up, Rena\u2019s bikini top was no where to be seen. By the end of the searching, Rena was both getting cold and her breasts were full to the brim, a few gentle white trails of milk seeping out into the ocean water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi splashed back out to her, staying a good distance away so he wouldn\u2019t invade Rena\u2019s privacy but a the same time close enough he was able to talk to her without shouting. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena pouted a little, \u201cThen I\u2019m going to have to wait until everyone leaves before I can sneak back to the truck.\u201d That unfortunately, would take all day, and the water got really cold at night. That, and it was getting close to lunch and she was getting hungry. Loosing a bikini top while swimming, best way to ruin a otherwise nice day at the beach.<br>\r\nStill, Kemnebi wasn\u2019t giving up hope so easily, holding his chin as he thought a moment. He then glanced at Rena, obviously having an idea but not sure what Rena would think of it. \u201cHow about I carry you back to the truck<br>\r\n?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow would that keep people from seeing me without my top?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep your chest against mine, and my arm across your back, then no one will be able to tell. I promise I won\u2019t look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena glanced down a moment, batting the idea around in her head a moment before giving a gentle nod, \u201cOkay, but promise you won\u2019t look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Kemnebi said. \u201cNow, come on, we need to get into shallower water.\u201d At that Kemnebi Rena led Rena into water that was about shoulder deep for him. After a little coaxing Kemnebi got Rena up into his arms, carrying her much like a bride. Rena then turned a little, wrapping her arms around Kemnebi\u2019s neck so that she could keep her breasts pressed into his fur and, in such, keep her self at least somewhat decent. Even if cat people had fur and weren\u2019t truly naked without clothing, it was still frowned upon for furred demi-humans to be seen without something on, be it clothing or a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, true to his word, Kemnebi never looked, keeping his vision straight ahead as he began to walk out out of the water. They got a few looks, but mostly from people who were just curious why Kemnebi was carrying Rena, none of them looking or noticing that Rena didn\u2019t have a top. Across to the beach and to the parking lot Kemnebi carried Rena, opening the truck door with one hand. He hand. He then gently set Rena inside, and before pulling himself away shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door shut and Rena was secluded in the cab of Kemnebi\u2019s truck, the window shades on the front and side windows, plus the very dark tinted back windows, ensuring no one would see inside the truck. First and foremost, Rena had to drain herself, quickly turning on the pump and letting it empty her breasts, the milk pouring into an old plastic jug that Rena would then dump out in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pump gently hummed and the pressure in Rena\u2019s chest subsided, she couldn\u2019t help but squirm a little, stewing in her own embarrassment. Loosing her top was bad enough, but after that Kemnebi had actually carried her to the truck. She usually didn\u2019t like being fussed over so much, but\u2026\u2026 the worst part of it all, Rena couldn\u2019t deny that she enjoyed the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of decency she had to press her chest against Kemnebi, to squish these big breasts of hers into his amazingly strong and sturdy pecs. It had been embarrassing, but it had also given her a chance to actually feel how strong Kemnebi was, how toned and well taken care of his body was. On top of that, since she had to basically hug his neck and put her face close to his shoulders, Rena had gotten a chance to take in the way Kemnebi smelled. At that moment his fur was still heavily laden with salt water and sand, but still a fairly keen cat nose. It was faint, but she could still smell him. It had a typical male odor, a darker, richer odor, but it also had a sweetness to it Rena had never smelled before. She liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Rena began scratching her head furiously, cursing at her herself. Firstly, she needed to keep a hold of herself. Sure, Kemnebi was strong, but that didn\u2019t matter in the long run. He had been nice up to this point, but she really didn\u2019t have enough time to see what kind of person he really was. That, and he probably was sick of her and this milk making mountains. That, and she had lost the suit HE had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s thoughts were broken by a gentle tapping on the glass, Kemnebi\u2019s distinct shadow falling on the other side of the window cover. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Rena replied, and in sense she was physically fine. Her face was still burning from embarrassment, but she was fine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, but it does make me wonder what were going to do for the rest of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned, a bit dumb struck. After all this trouble, where most guys would just call it quits or try to pull her into bed, he just wanted to continue enjoying the day like nothing happened. Rena couldn\u2019t imagine why someone hadn\u2019t already scooped up Kemnebi as a boyfriend or even husband. He was just\u2026 way too nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t want to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi paused, his shadow shifting before he spoke, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re ready to leave I can certainly drive you home, but just because you lost your top doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do something else. You still have your street clothes, so we can still enjoy the beach, we just can\u2019t get wet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t help but smile. After all the trouble she had been\u2026\u2026 it was just unbelievable. Still, as Rena felt her breasts reaching empty she unhooked the pump, and pulled her clothing out of Kemnebi\u2019s back seat. (He had such a nice truck to). A few moments later, Rena opened the door, stepping back out in her white tank top and somewhat short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThus, the pair began search out and enjoying the other things that were near the beach. After asking a few locals, Rena and Kemnebi walked down the beach to a local aquarium, enjoying the huge collection of colorful fish, sharks, and the indoors dolphin show. Once they left the aquarium the pair began perusing another collection of local merchants that had set up near the beach, hoping to entice tourist and a few locals to buy their trinkets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, with the inclusion of a lunch break after the aquarium, the day was practically spent. The sun was beginning to set, and while people packed up their swimming gear Rena and Kemnebi just strolled slowly in the sand, carrying their shoes and socks, feeling the sands between their toes. It was a great scene, and Rena could only be thankful that she was no where needing to drain herself, so there was no chance of interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinus also flashing half the people on the beach, today was nice.\u201d Rena said, less of a comment and more of a test, trying to see what Kemnebi thought of their day at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, minus that, it was a good day. Though, I was thinking about something earlier\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena faltered a little as she and Kemnebi were walking, but recovered quickly enough he didn\u2019t notice. Was this a good thing or bad thing\u2026 Rena could only listen and hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking about when we were trying to get you back to the truck\u2026 why didn\u2019t we think to grab a towel just have you use that to cover yourself up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared blankly at Kemnebi, that was a very good question. It would have been a simple answer to the situation, have Kemnebi grab a towel and bring it out to her, then just wrap it around her frame and walk back to the truck. It would have garnished a few stares, but no more than when Kemnebi carried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026 it just didn\u2019t cross her minds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi laughed a little, \u201cBesides, our way was so much more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt herself blush, and it was obvious that the words didn\u2019t quiet come out as Kemnebi had expected, the black panther rubbing his neck as he looked away. The pair walked in silence for a time after that, neither sure just how or where to take the conversation. Finally, Rena decided to take a risk, glancing over at Kemnebi\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was kind of fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement seemed to drive away some of the awkwardness in the air, allowing Rena and Kemnebi to talk about other things as they continued to walk along the beach. Finally, they stopped just long enough to watch the end of the sunset, the last bits of that golden orb descending below the distant horizon. They stood side by side, Kemnebi with his hands in his pockets and Rena holding hers behind her back, though the tigress kind of wished she could have been holding Kemnebi\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, after the sun had set the pair turned, walking back toward Kemnebi\u2019s truck as night settled in on the beach. As the Kemnebi guided the truck along its route home, Rena sat in the other seat, sneaking glanced at Kemnebi. Finally, she had gathered the last of her courage, turning and asking, \u201cHey, are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\nKemnebi just nodded his head in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you want to stop on the way and grab something to eat? Nothing fancy, maybe a pizza place or Chinese buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKemnebi glanced over at Rena, taking his eyes off the road for only a moment before smiling, \u201cSure, why not?\u201d<br>\r\n===============================================================<br>\r\nThis is where things can change, where the path splits, where you must make a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The pair stop off at a pizza place just a little ways from Kemnebi\u2019s apartment. In Rena\u2019s opinion, things are going great, that is until Kemnebi gets strangely tense. From all around the pizza place figures start to come out of the crowd, pulling out guns and swords. Rena is in a panic, but Kemnebi is glaring coldly at every one of them.<br>\r\nThus, just as the figures are about to attack, Kemnebi grabs the table and throws it out into the crowd, he then picks up Rena, and darts through the pizza kitchen and into the alley way. That is where he sets Rena down, telling her to run and find a taxi. Rena does run, but instead of grabbing a cab home she hides in an old box, watching as the figures come out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures call themselves the Phoenix Knights, and as Rena watches the strange men start talking about the fact they are planning to kill Kemnebi, that he had cursed the world for to long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena doesn\u2019t get it until she sees something happening to Kemnebi. He begins to change, shifting from a panther man into something more beastly. He grows larger, scales, and in the end Rena is no longer looking at the nice panther man she had spent the day with but instead a full fledge dragon, with teeth, wings, claws\u2026 everything.<br>\r\nThus, once Kemnebi has dealt with the knights, Rena comes out of hiding. Will Rena run in fear of Kemnebi, or linger long enough to get his side of the story. Only the next author knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The dinner goes fine, enjoyable but nothing as extrodinary as the first option. Instead, the next morning, Rena is visited by Mr. Sanders, Kemnebi\u2019s boss. He says that he would like have Rena come to the company headquarters, so that they can discuss her unique situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying a lovely tour Rena is led into a room, and offered some free cookies. Still, upon eating a cookie, Rena feels dizzy and quickly passes out. When she awakens, she finds herself strapped to a medical table, a few men in white coats buzzing around her. Mr. Sanders eventually arrives, telling Rena that they are very interested in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Rena becomes a temporary captive of the GeneTech, who have people in the police department to ensure that if she is reported missing, that no one will find her. The reason behind all this, Mr. Sanders wants to research Rena\u2019s interesting hormonal condition but, also, because he wants to make her into the ultimate milk machine for the Mother\u2019s Milk program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is during the night however that Rena is approached by a woman. The pair get to talking, and Rena tells this strange woman about what\u2019s happening with her breasts. It is then the woman reveals she owns a very special night club up town, and would like to invite Rena there.Rena sees no harm, but when she arrives at the club she finds that its less of a night club and more of stripper club. She sees woman, all very beautiful, flaunting there stuff on the suspended stages and poles. Rena tried to leave, but is caught by the woman that talked to her the night before.The woman admits that she\u2019s the clubs talent scout, and finds that Rena is a very interesting prospect. She wants Rena to become a dancer, both because she has such large natural breasts but also because of the fact she produces so much milk. There would be several guys in the audience with certain fetishes that would be willing to pay a lot to drink her milk, and even more to see Rena dance. That, the woman could tell that when Rena\u2019s breasts swell up that she could easily flaunt her stuff without a top on, getting even more tips from the guys and galls below since, when they were fully engorged, Rena\u2019s breasts had a very attractive bounce and support to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3:\u00a0 No guy from the breast milk company, no talent scout. Rena, however, does feel the need next day to lounge about and decides to do it outside. As she is reading, enjoying the sun, one of her neighbors comes running by. It\u2019s a nice guy Rena has meet before and is fairly good friends with. Still, Rena can\u2019t help but notice that this guy passes her house three times in fifteen minutes, each time his head turning as he looked at her. Rena can\u2019t help but feel a little flattered.That is until on his fourth time running by her neighbor manages to trip on something and falls flat on his face. Rena helps him up, getting him into her house where she gets him a bag of ice. This can go where it wants, but eventually it would interesting to see if this guy\u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter originally by Nameless One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena woke up and groaned, mentally celebrating the fact it was Saturday. Two more days of not having to do work, and, because of her doctor, she wouldn't have to go into the Monday meeting either. Rena also found a bit of joy seeing that she didn't fill the tub in her sleep though her towel was soaked and she could clearly see where her milk flowed like a river during the night; if only there was some way to be milked during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, her breasts grew even larger, a double J size, though as she sat up and cupped herself as best as she could, Rena was surprised to feel that they actually felt light, probably that injection she got from the doctor. She was thankful she wouldn't have to be worried about being pinned to the ground by her breasts, but again Rena had to wonder just how big she was going to get. Rena stood up in the shower and tossed out her rubber raft bed. Truthfully, it wasn't getting big she was worried about, it was how others would react to her bigness, though given that dance club...<br>\r\nFor now, Rena turned the shower on, letting the water stream down on her jugs and the rest of her body while she fiddled around with her nipples until they began to leak with milk, the white streams swirling and mixing with the shower water as it circled the drain. After cleaning herself up and milking out what was left in her breasts, Rena got a pair of jeans on, not even bothering with a shirt seeing how often she had to milk herself at home and simply went back to her normal routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting some breakfast, including breast milk cereal (after which Rena couldn't help but drink two<br>\r\nglasses of her own white gold), Rena got some minor cleaning done around the house, having to stop<br>\r\nevery hour to milk herself. It was the kind of Saturday Rena was used to, having to get the house cleaned from a week of living in it, which was made a bit worse by how quickly she was soaking towels by using them as pillows.<br>\r\nAs Rena ate her TV dinner on her couch, she couldn't help but look down at her breasts. Truthfully...she didn't mind them being big. Sure, it got her a lot of attention but so far it seemed to be positive attention. She had large, natural breasts, all without surgery, and she couldn't help but make every guy's head turn in her direction. What was that one theory? That men liked big breasts because it subconsciously made women seem more fertile or something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Rena couldn't help but shiver with pleasure at the thought of all those hot guys looking at her like she was the sexiest thing on two feet, enjoying the sight of her massive mounds on her otherwise thin, healthy body. Clubbing the night before was probably the most fun she had in quite awhile and the attention she got made it all the more fun. Before she knew it, she was already getting ready, placing a milk pump in her purse, emptying herself out one more time and placing the largest shirt on she had, which still showed off a bit of belly from the sheer size of her bosom stretching out the shirt. It was time for some more fun, clubbing style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Rena got there a little early, the place had yet to really get into the swing of things, people just<br>\r\nbarely coming in, making Rena go the to bar and getting herself something to drink, a simple strawberry daiquiri to get herself in the mood. Still, she was a bit surprised when a dark-haired human woman in her early thirties took the seat right next to her.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, do you mind if I take the seat next to you?\" \"Huh? Oh, no, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jennifer Aston.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Rena Westfall. Have I met you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly but I saw you dancing last night. I have to say, you're quite good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you know, I really can't 'dance' per say, I was just out there having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be so modest. I know a good dancer when I see one. Mind if I buy you a refill?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Excuse me, two strawberry daiquiris here, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing their drinks, Rena and Jennifer began to talk a bit, just chit-chatting. Still, Rena was having such fun that she forgot her hour was up until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to interrupt, but you're leaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Rena asked, not sure what Jennifer meant; that is until she raised a finger to Rena's chest, where two wet spots where forming on her shirt. \"Oh my god! Excuse me, Jennifer, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena quickly made her way to the restroom to drain herself, Jennifer just took another sip and smiled; she loved it when she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rena was debating just leaving right then and there as soon as she emptied herself out, she was surprised to see Jennifer waiting for her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, I was just...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to talk about it?\" Jennifer asked, motioning to an empty corner in the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\t\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you'll feel better if you tell someone. Besides, I'm curious as to why you're also a few cup sizes larger than last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit of defeat, Rena followed Jennifer as she ordered some new drinks. \"Well, as you probably guessed by now, I'm...lactating \t\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...still, that doesn't explain why your breasts are even larger than yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" promise not to tell anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He\u2019s not sure, but my doctor thinks that when I went in for a routine flu-shot that I was mistakenly injected with some hormone replacement drug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My breasts just keep getting bigger every day and I'm lactating every hour on the hour; I even have to sleep in the bath tub in order to keep my bed from getting soaked every morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they're still growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The doctor's sure they'll stop eventually but even he's not sure when and they can't just keep injecting me with stuff until they get a better idea what's happening to me. They've given me some drug to keep my muscles strong enough to lift myself and I have to admit they felt light again but I still don't know how big I'm going to get and they can't just cut me up because of the hormones my body keeps producing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the important thing is that you still have your health, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for now, anyways. I can deal with the breasts but I honestly wish I wasn't producing so much milk. I've been trying to sell it to a company for some extra cash and for the most part it is working but I still have trouble keeping up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I actually own a night club downtown. I took the night off but I would love it if you could visit for a few hours, maybe let you have a few drinks on the house. Interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure, why not. Is it far from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit but I'll call a cab for us.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still,<br>\r\nsomething didn't seem quite...normal about this. The club itself was in great condition but the other buildings in the area seemed rather...seedy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"There she is; she's not much to look at on the outside but we keep the interior on the up and up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just nodded as she followed Jennifer. The odd thing was that they didn't end up right inside the club right away; they actually had to walk through a small hallway before they entered the club proper through the double doors. Still, once Rena actually got in and took a few steps inside, she couldn't help but open her mouth wide in a slack-jaw gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud (though not deafening loud) techno music pumped into the large space through speakers in the ceiling. Disco ball sparkles and multi-color lights streamed in from all directions, constantly moving and shifting. Men (and a few women) hollered and hooted while guzzling mixed drinks and taking shots. The most obvious thing, however, where the dozen or so young woman and cat girls (including one quarter cat person) dancing, twirling, prancing, and generally shaking their bodies around on raised platforms and poles, most of them dressed in as little as thongs and high heels, the rest of them getting to that point by slowly stripping. There was no denying it; Rena had just walked into a strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring for just a few moments, Rena quickly tried to bolt for the exit, only for Jennifer to block her way as she wore a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going already? You just got here, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...I mean \tI appreciate you inviting me but honestly, I don't know why I'm-\" \"I brought you here because I thought you could be a dancer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, why don't we sit down and talk this out, alright? I'll even give you anything you want to drink on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rena could really protest, Jennifer was already leading her by the arm, taking her to a more secluded, quiet place, where she quickly got Rena a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now, I'm sure you probably have a few questions for me.\"<br>\r\n\"A few?!? I'm beginning to wonder why I even agreed to come here in the first place!\" \"Well, we got all night; what would you like to know first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do...do you really own a place like this?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, technically, I own half of it; I manage this place with my darling husband.\" \"You own a strip club with your husband?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that such a strange thing to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's not something that...that I would expect a woman to \t\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my husband does most of the accounting supervision and paperwork; I'm the one who does most of the hands-on managing and talent searching.\" \"Talent searching?\" \"For all intents and purposes, I'm the club's talent scout. Almost all of our dancers are here because I asked them to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what makes you think I belong here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, you really are a good dancer and you're not afraid to get down and dirty; that's a necessity here. Second, I can tell that while you might deny it, you love the attention you get from men. And thirdly, you have a very hot body and the whole constant lactation thing could be a great asset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very\u2026hot body \tare you-?\"<br>\r\n\"Gay? No, just bisexual. I haven't played the other field since college and I love my husband too much to do that again nowadays but let's just say I still have a good eye for the same team.\" Jennifer said with a wink that made Rena shudder for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what does my lactating have to do with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simply, I know quite a few guys and gals that would love to see a young thing like you full of milk, breasts leaking and spilling on the pole, not to mention they would love to have some fresh milk while they watch you perform. And I have to admit you have a great bounce and fullness when you're just barely leaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't believe what I'm hearing. You want me to dance on stage naked with breasts full of milk and sell it to strangers?\"<br>\r\n\"Honey, everyone here wears at least a thong and you wear a fur coat 24/7. You're no more naked than a woman in spandex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go; this is...this is completely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, why judge something before you even try it? I brought you here for a reason; it's amateur night. Just get on stage, strut your stuff, and if you like it, we can hire you on as a full time dancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I keep getting bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, bigger is always better, and besides, you said it yourself; you don't mind the large breasts and I think you would look marvelous with bigger jugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I\tthis is\tI have a respectable job, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\tdata entry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how much do you get paid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well\ton a good week, I can earn at least eight hundred dollars.\"<br>\r\n\"*snort!* Rena, you could earn that much here in just one night. Look, I'm going to lead you to the stage; you can keep your clothes on if you want, and just dance around and shake your sexy body around. I think you might find out this thing to be right up your alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Rena was practically dragged by her arm, this time gently pushed on stage where an eager audience watched as an unseen announcer began talking through the speaker system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, for tonight's first amateur dancer, we got a lovely, busty young lady! Give it up for Rena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena carefully stepped on stage, obviously feeling a bit of stage fright and it didn't help that everyone was staring at her with eager hungry eyes. Smiling nervously, Rena began to dance like she would in a normal club, hoping to maybe get booed off the stage early and give her an excuse to leave right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, while Rena never considered herself a person with loose morals, something strange happened. Just like the night before, Rena began to enjoy the cat calls and cheers from the audience and quickly began to dance a little more seductively, rubbing against the pole and began using it to dance. Something strange happened, something deep in her psyche as she began to start having fun, rubbing her hands around her body to emphasis her breasts and trim body. She even lifted her shirt up a little, not enough to be topless but enough to show off half of her large breasts, much to the delight of the patrons. By the time she was done, Rena danced for a full thirty minutes and still felt like she had energy for another show as she quickly sat down with Jennifer to take a short break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm \tnot bad; the audience seems to like you enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah...I was just...acting like I was dancing in a club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acting? Honey, you have talent. I think you would fit right in here just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...I just got caught up in the moment. I couldn't really be a stripper...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're showing off to people whether you want to or not just by existing; you might as well earn some money for it. Tell you what; I'll give you your earnings today and you think about it. When you're ready to start a much more lucrative career, you give me a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Rena was given a clip of money with a business card inside it. Rena couldn't help but gasp as her eyes went wide; there had to at least be three hundred dollars and that was just for appearing at amateur night; she apparently could earn twice that much in tips by performing daily. Downing the rest of her drink, Rena hailed a taxi cab back to her house to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================<br>\r\nEven after getting the tub ready and lying down for the night, Rena was having trouble sleeping. Going to that strip club was strange but...actually kind of fun. There was something she liked about performing and the compliments she was getting, even if it was in such a seedy setting. It certainly was a lot more fun than typing on a computer all day and her growing breasts would actually be an asset. Still, could she really be an exotic dancer? The money would be great and it was like being paid to party all day, just with a little less clothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena groaned as she covered herself with a towel. She'd sleep on it; if it really was such the great opportunity that Jennifer claimed it would be, she would give her a call in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter originally by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Rena tried, she wasn\u201ft able to get much sleep that night. A war was brewing in her mind, one that continued whether Rena was awake or dreaming. Jennifer Aston\u201fs offer was easily the strangest one she had ever been given in her life, one that was truly challenging her morals.<br>\r\nRena had been raised with fairly strict views between what\u201fs right and wrong. It was good to have an honest, if boring, job that paid enough to have a house and a certain standard of living. Data entry was monotonous, but it was a job Rena could openly discuss with anyone without offending them.<br>\r\nExotic dancing, on the other hand, was something Rena had always been taught wasn\u201ft a real career. It was something for people with loose pants and looser morals. But\u2026Rena couldn\u201ft deny that\u2026it had been fun. Dancing to music was fun in general for Rena, but those \u201ccat calls\", the whistles\u2026it was invigorating. She had felt so sexy, so good\u2026and yet, Rena couldn\u201ft deny that it should have felt wrong.<br>\r\nShe shouldn\u201ft have enjoyed that. She shouldn\u201ft have even gotten up on that stage or even gone with that woman inside. Come on, \u201cThe Dancing Cats,\u201d what kind of place did Rena expect with a name like that? She should have never even\u2026but, she had and now she couldn\u201ft get it out of her mind. The music, the thumping bass, her body swaying in tone with the beat, the crowd of men and a few women shouting, calling out for more\u2026it was all just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of all that, there was the money. Jennifer had said she could earn a week\u201fs worth of her current salary in a day, and doing something that she could actually enjoy, having a job that was more than just hitting keys on a keyboard, being stuck in a chair for hours doing a job that anyone with half a brain could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe money, the attention, the fun, and the cherry on top of it all, Jennifer said that her breasts would<br>\r\nactually be a major asset. \u201cBigger is always better,\u201d\u2026if Jennifer was right then\u2026then she really didn\u201ft<br>\r\nhave to worry about ever getting too big. She could just enjoy the fact that she had huge, natural breasts that were only getting bigger. Sure, there would be a point where they would be just too ridiculously large, but\u2026hopefully she would stop before she got that big.<br>\r\nEventually, everything pooled together, inducing a few dreams that Rena could at best describe as erotic. Everything was black except for a single cone of light, shining down from an unseen light source onto a pole and a chair. Rena, not really in control of herself, slowly strode towards it, still dressed in her pajamas. She touched the pole gingerly, the metal feeling cool and amazingly smooth under her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u201fs eyes then turned to one direction, and from the darkness that surrounded her more shapes began to slowly arise. Weak, flickering lights began to slowly come to life, illuminating tables. There were at least three figures seated at each table, though their bodies were so heavily lost in the shadows that Rena only knew there were people and nothing more; a faceless audience with every head turned in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time Rena just stood there, her eyes slowly shifting back to the pole as she ran her hand up and down it, finger\u201fs gently caressing the metal. Then, from the darkness, music began to play. It started out only a bass, a deep thumping that Rena began to slowly sway back and forth to. She moved around the pole a little, directing her butt at the audience as it and her tail swung back and forth in time with the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few whistles and shouts began to emanate from the faceless, shadow audience. It was mostly male voices, but Rena could still hear a few females calling out from the crowd. The music began to get more elaborate, the deep thumping of the bass getting joined in by an array of other sounds and tones, and the intensity of Rena\u201fs dancing began to intensify along with the music.<br>\r\nWith the crowd growing louder, Rena began gently playing with the pole, hooking her legs around it and pressing herself up against the cool metal, the only things separating her from the steel being her pajamas. She spun around once, slowly, and then to the pleasure of the crowd Rena gently rubbed up against the pole a few times, going up and down seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena then moved over to the chair, turning it to one side before taking a seat, the side of her body facing the audience. Smiling playfully, Rena gently placed a hand on the side of her breast, gently massaging it before letting her fingers slip seductively down her stomach before falling off on her thigh. Then, from the darkness, a small handle came into view. Without even thinking, driven by the nature of the dream, Rena took the handle in one hand and pulled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the darkness above a cascade of water began to pour onto Rena, the crowd giving a rousing cheer as Rena leaned back and let the water dance across her, matting her pajamas up against her fur and accenting every curve of her body. She slowly stood up, the water still coming down as Rena put her back to the crowd and gently lifted up her hair, acting as if she was taking a shower as she gently played with her hair, turning over her shoulder and smiling at the shadow audience, who were almost as loud as the music with their cat calls, whistles, and other such noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flow of water slowly stopped as the pole and chair faded away from beside Rena. Now, another pole had appeared in the center of the crowd, a pathway light on either side by small light bulbs leading Rena onward. She strode to the new pole, sopping wet as she placed a hand in the new pole, circling it once as she looked down at the shadowed figures in the crowd, who still were faceless even now that Rena stood so close to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling seductively, Rena put her back to the audience, facing the pole. Her hands began to slowly sneak towards her waist, grabbing her pajama top and slowly lifting it up to reveal her back. The audience went crazy, and Rena continued slowly pulling off the shirt, revealing her impressive assets which were only contained by a small, black bra. It was also apparent that Rena was leaking, the front of her bra starting to drip milk down onto the stage at a fairly steady rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face the audience, Rena leaned over, flashing her cleavage as her hands gently played with her breasts, the fleshy orbs feeling full and round from the milk they contained. After pleasing the crowd for a time with this, Rena went back to the pole and, holding onto it with one hand for support, she removed her pajama bottoms revealing a matching black thong to go with her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was intensely loud, clamoring for more as Rena began to dance much as she had on the<br>\r\nstage back at the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d bar. She teased and flaunted herself for the audience, moving with the music, flashing seductive smiles as she played games with the pole and the hearts of the people watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, strangely knowing that it was time for the climax of her show, Rena carefully and slowly reached behind her back, releasing the clasp on her bra and carefully taking it off. It wasn\u201ft much different, at least for cat-people, since fur kept most parts of their bodies fairly covered. Still, the simple act drove the audience crazy, dozens of whistles and shouts reaching Rena\u201fs ears, each wanting more.<br>\r\nBut what more was there? That was a single small comment that came from Rena\u201fs sensible mind, but her dream self knew exactly what came next. Gently cupping a breast in each hand, Rena began to gently rub her fleshy orbs as she had before. This time, however, the breasts were actually growing in Rena\u201fs touch; like bread rising in the oven, each playful rub made dream Rena\u201fs breasts swell out larger.<br>\r\nBigger and bigger her breasts swelled, Rena soon unable to reach around the massive orbs and yet she continued to rub them. Inside them, Rena could tell that her breasts were still full of milk, the strangely cool sensation coming from her skin sending a shiver down Rena's spine. She continued, the tigress not stopping until her breasts were so large that they were resting on the floor and, at the same time, the top of each breast was just below Rena\u201fs chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her breasts at such a huge size, Rena gave the audience one final smile and then used all her<br>\r\nstrength to press against the side of her breasts. Milk began to squirt out of the front of her mammaries, flooding out quickly. Before long the milk began to fill the darkness, Rena and the rest of the patrons began to be submerged in the white liquid.<br>\r\nThis was when Rena woke up, sputtering a little as she looked around. Like the other time before, her foot had closed the bathtubs drain while she was sleeping and the tub had begun to fill up. It filled up enough, in fact, that it had reach Rena\u201fs mouth, thus why her dream suddenly became flooded and why she woke up so suddenly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since being jarred from sleep like that isn\u201ft easy, Rena sat for a moment in the tub of her own milk as she held her head. The dream was already fading from her memory, as dreams usually do, but Rena caught enough of it to remember what she was dreaming about and the simple fact that she had been enjoying herself the entire time. She had been enjoying it\u2026and while the end of the dream was a little too fantastic for reality, the rest\u2026the rest were things Rena knew or could expect a normal exotic dancer to do.<br>\r\nRena was thankful for the fact she had filled her bathtub again because it was proving a good distraction from the moral conflict in her head. For once, Rena\u201fs feline instincts didn\u201ft overpower her to the point she would start licking herself clean, the erotic dream from the night still dominating Rena\u201fs thoughts. She opened the drain, letting the milk empty as she started the shower and began rinsing the white liquid from her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\nAfter getting herself clean and getting dressed Rena went out to her bedroom, sitting down on the bed before looking down on her chest. A small part of Rena hoped her breasts would have been the same size, but after the dream she had last night Rena wasn\u201ft surprised to see her breasts had gotten a lot larger, jumping two cup sizes to a double K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were starting to get to the point where they were too big for normal women, and yet\u2026what<br>\r\nabout for an exotic dancer? Rena cursed a little, closing her eyes and flopping back on the bed. Her mind had definitely come to a decision during the night; the money, the attention, and everything else\u2026it was all too good to pass up. It wasn\u201ft a question about whether if she would enjoy being an exotic dancer or if she wanted to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the question that kept Rena from picking up the phone and calling Jennifer is that could she really<br>\r\nstand being a part of such a culture, where women took their clothing off and let guys stick money under the straps of their underwear? Exposing herself to men and women who could be married, have kids, or be something even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rattling her brain for an hour, Rena just couldn\u201ft make a decision one way or the other. So, to just<br>\r\nsolve the issue, Rena found a quarter; best two out of three. Heads, she would call Jennifer and see what it was like to be an exotic dancer; tails, she would kindly decline Jennifer\u201fs offer and never speak of her or the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d club ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the quarter on the edge of her thumb, Rena flipped it up into the air, caught it, and quickly<br>\r\nslapped the quarter down onto her wrist. Slowly pulling back her hands, Rena saw that the first quarter<br>\r\nhad come up heads. Flipping the coin again, it came up tails. Holding her breath, Rena flipped the coin up a third and final time. It landed in her palm and without looking Rena slapped it over onto the back of her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the decision maker and whatever it was, Rena made a promise to herself that she would go<br>\r\nthrough with it. And, to try and put her mind to ease, Rena thought and acknowledged that this wasn\u201ft an end all decision. She could change her mind later, but to change her mind first she had to know what decision fate had made for her. So, Rena slowly lifted away her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the lights were turned on and the place was empty you\u201fd be surprised how nice the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d club was on the inside. The floors were covered in soft, squishy, rubber-like substance. It was the easiest thing in the world to clean; squirt it with water and then let the place dry. It also looked pretty nice and felt good under the foot, the solid black color going well with the deep red color that dominated the club\u201fs walls.<br>\r\nThe tables, chairs, and the stage area all had a similar color scheme, the simple solid black with deep red on every seat in the patron area situated in such a way that everyone could have a clear view of at least 75% of the stage, even if there were tall guys or girls right up front.<br>\r\nIt was simple, but simple was good when you wanted your patrons focusing on the dancing girls rather than the room's d\u00e9cor. That and simple was cheap to buy in the first place and cheap to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the club was closed, most of the light came from black covered lamps along the walls and ceiling lights, making usually the dark room very bright and surprisingly welcoming. The only other major feature to the club, besides the stage and the patron area, was the bar. Set off to onside of the room near the door, a nice long, polished metal counter with the same design as the rest of the club sat, having just been cleaned from the previous night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping through a door to the side of the one of the stages, guarded during operation hours for obvious reasons, took you back into the inner workings of the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d. In the back there were two major sections, the dressing room where the girls got ready for their performance for the evening and the wardrobe room, a large selection of costumes and clothing to fit any scenario. Nurse outfits, fake police uniforms, farm girl outfits, all of them very revealing, sexy, and perfect for getting the attention of certain patrons that come into the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d for a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two rooms were both on the left side of the building, connected by the same hallway to three other doors. Across from the doorway into the dressing room was a nice bathroom which was for employees only. The final two doors were business offices, the door at the end of the hall clearly labeled with a nice, gold lettered sign that read, \u201cJennifer Aston, Talent Manager\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at her desk, the raven haired Jennifer was leaning back with the office phone to her ear. A garbled, screaming voice could easily be heard by anyone that happened to be in the room. Jennifer did her best to keep her office very professional looking, even though some would consider her business to be very low brow. It was Jennifer\u201fs code to follow, that, if she wanted her business to be treated legitimately, she had to keep it looking well maintained, cleaned, and organized.<br>\r\nThe desk dominated the center of the room, a sleek black computer sitting off to one side. The center of the desk was cluttered with a few papers, but along the front edge of the desk were a few little trinkets Jennifer had picked up over the years, both from when she had been an exotic dancer herself and things given to her by some of the girls. It was mostly pictures, kept in sleek polished black pictures frames. None of them too revealing, but some naughty enough to make most people blush, if only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u2026no, please\u2026Candy\u2026LISTEN!\u201d Jennifer snapped, having been attempting to get the woman\u201fs attention for the past few minutes. \u201cIt was in your contract when you came to work for me. My club stays completely within the bounds of the law and you were caught with illegal drugs in our public bathrooms. You know I have a no tolerance policy against stuff like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer held the headset away from her ear for a moment, wincing as a renewed storm of screams came from the other end of the phone line. Finally, Jennifer had enough and did her best to blare over top of her former employee\u201fs voice. \u201cI\u201fm sorry, but my decision is final, Candy. Your contract is terminated and you will not work in my night club again. You may stop by to be a patron and to pick up your last check, and, if you get yourself into rehab and dump that filth, I might consider rehiring you. Until then, stay away from my club.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Jennifer slammed down the phone, lowering her head as she rubbed her forehead. She hated having arguments with her dancers like that, but sometimes it couldn\u201ft be helped. Candy knew full well what Jennifer expected. She didn\u201ft care what people did in their personal lives, but once you were in the club you were a dancer for the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d. That meant that while you were able to flaunt and take your top off, you weren\u201ft breaking any laws. Because a single incident would give the police enough leverage to do some pretty nasty things, like closing down her business for a few days if not revoking her business license. On top of that, she was trying to run a fairly high class business. Sure, the entertainment could be considered low brow, but the quality of that entertainment and the club itself easily put the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d several steps above most of the other exotic dancing locations in the city. Jennifer loved her girls, but she would not put her business and the lively hoods of her staff at danger because one person wanted to be stupid on company time and premises.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cExcuse me, Miss Aston?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gerald?\u201d Jennifer replied, looking up from her seat at one of her club\u201fs security personnel, the door bouncer Gerald Nestman. Seven feet tall, built like a tank, very dark skinned with short black hair, and able to bench press 300 pounds of weight, it was a rare person who thought they could stand up to Gerald. And of that small handful of guys, none of them had walked away without at least a bloody nose and a pair of black eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI just came to let you know the delivery for the bar has arrived; should I let the truck driver in?\u201d \u201cYes, thank you Gerald; and if you would be a dear and get things put away for me?\u201d \u201cHaving a rough morning?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHad to fire Candy after last night's little escapade.\u201d \u201cIt\u201fs a shame; Candy was one of our better dancers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I will not risk losing my business just so she can have a high. Still, Jasmine and Britney should be able to keep the crowd coming in just fine. That and I have a new prospect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u201ft happen to be that tiger woman you practically dragged onto the stage last night?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes these girls need to be forced into their first experience so they can see just what it's like.\u201d \u201cAnd you are always ready to give them a push. So, when should we know about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRena,\u201d Jennifer finished for Gerald just as her phone began to ring, \u201cher name is Rena Westfall and, who knows, we may just be able to find out right now.\u201d With that Jennifer pressed a finger to her lips, telling Gerald to be quiet as she gently reached over to her phone and pushed the speaker button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026\u201d Rena\u201fs voice came out of the speaker, obviously a little nervous about making the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Rena, it\u201fs so good to hear from you.\u201d Jennifer said, turning her chair towards the phone as she<br>\r\nleaned back a little, smiling. \u201cI trust those jugs have yours have gotten even larger since the last time we chatted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, they\u2026they have.\u201d Rena replied, Gerald and Jennifer smiling at each other. They had heard this tone of voice before in probably half the dancers at the club, girls who had the talent but just never considered themselves to be dancers. That was the kind of girl Jennifer liked the most, because usually they had better morals and while they could be encouraged and might enjoy being exotic dancers they were far less likely to go too far and become prostitutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what can I do for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I, I gave your offer a lot of thought\u2026and\u2026I guess\u2026I\u201fd like to take you up\u2026on the offer that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh, that\u201fs so wonderful to hear.\u201d Jennifer said, smiling and winking at Gerald who just stood there,<br>\r\nshaking his head. The bouncer didn\u201ft know how Jennifer managed to pick out the girls at normal dance<br>\r\nclubs, but in the entire time she and her husband had owned the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d, there had only been one girl who turned down her offer, and that one was mainly because she had a husband who didn\u201ft like the thought of having an exotic dancer as a wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026um, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, my dear, first you should give that data entry job of yours a two week notice. Doubt they\u201fd care if<br>\r\nyou up and quit without warning, but I\u201fm one that believes in giving people some common courtesy. Next, I need you to come down here and fill out some forms so that we can have you squared away to get paid and so you can have all the necessary paperwork when tax time comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026yea\u2026okay\u2026 I\u201fll be there soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u201ft wait to see you, Rena.\u201d Jennifer offered, letting Rena hang up the phone before she shut of the speak function on hers. Gerald was still standing there, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never fail to impress me, Mrs. Aston.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because, to be honest, I wasn\u201ft entirely sure I had gotten her. Still, my instincts were proven right again and we\u201fre going to have a new dancer with some very special assets. Speaking of, when you finish getting the bar restocked could you run an errand for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald nodded, moving towards the desk as Jennifer scribbled something out on a piece of paper. He glanced at the paper for a moment, giving Jennifer a questioning look before gently shrugging. As the bouncer turned to leave, Jennifer quickly finished off a few pieces of paperwork that were resting on her desk before heading out to the front of the club, waiting patiently on the sidewalk until she saw Rena driving up in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer directed the tigresses to the employee parking area, a gated and locked parking lot with a high fence and barbed wire. After slipping her car into a space, Rena shut it off and stepped out, obviously not feeling entirely certain about her decision as she glanced over at the back entrance to the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena!\u201d Jennifer said, moving forward and sharing a welcoming handshake. \u201cI\u201fm so glad to hear you\u201fre taking me up on my offer. I promise, you won\u201ft find a club in town that treats its girls as well as the \u201eDancing Cats\u201f.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026maybe I should think about this\u2026\u201d Rena, however, wasn\u201ft able to finish as Jennifer put her arm around Rena\u201fs shoulder and guided her towards the employee entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, we make sure to have tight security. The parking lot can only be accessed using very<br>\r\nspecific and secure remotes, ensuring no one can duplicate them. For front door security we have Gerald, one of the best bouncers that I\u201fve ever employed. He\u201fs out on an errand right now, but I introduce you two later.\u201d<br>\r\nJennifer and Rena stepped in through the club's back door, which opened into a small hallway that had no doors, a few lights, and made a left turn at the end. Jennifer continued to speak, leading Rena down towards the end of the hall, \u201cNow, the entire club is under video surveillance, mostly so I can have evidence against anyone that decides to cause problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair turned, coming into another hallway with three doors, two on the right and one on the left. \u201cNow, the first door on the right leads backstage, as you\u201fll notice its straight across from a door that leads into the dressing room where all my girls get ready for their shows. You\u201fll have your own vanity with mirror and drawers to put anything you want or need, but you have to buy it yourself. The far door on the left leads out into the main part of the club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother left turn and facing down another hall, Jennifer didn\u201ft miss a step on her whirlwind tour of the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first door on the left is another way into the dressing area. The door on the left after that is our very own wardrobe department. I don\u201ft know how many things will fit you, but if you\u201fre ever interested you have free reign to pick something out. My office is at the end of the hall. My husband\u201fs office is last door on the right. He\u201fs away visiting his parents and continuing to convince them that we own a respectable but very profitable coffee shop. Finally, this first door on the right, across from the dressing room, is our employee bathrooms. It\u201fs shared between the guys and gals, but there are separate, very private stalls so you should be all right.\u201d<br>\r\nWith a smile, Jennifer pushed open the door to her office, guiding Rena down into a seat before grabbing a few papers off the top of her desk. \u201cNow, I went ahead and drew you up a contract. You can take as long as you want reading it, though the sooner you sign the sooner I can get you ready for tonight. I just lost one of my better dancers and I\u201fd love to make tonight your premier evening as a 'Dancing Cats' girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena mindlessly took the contract, looking down at the page. Jennifer was going way too fast, but with paper in hand Rena was able to slow down her thoughts. Wanting to make sure she knew what she was getting into, Rena began reading through the contract line by line. It was very professional, and a bit hard to understand at times as legal documents tend to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in the end, Rena found nothing to object to. The rules were simple, straight forward, and well explained. She would get a paycheck every two weeks, the amount of which would be based on how many nights she worked and how much time she spent on stage. It was a really high rate, Jennifer able to afford it by charging admission to her lovely club along with garnishing a high profit from the drinks. Of course, Rena would also be getting money from \u201ctips\u201d which Rena had to report to Jennifer each night so that she could mark it on some government paper work. Apparently, even tips were taxed, but Jennifer made it easy for the girls by having the business\u201fs accountant take care of everything.<br>\r\nThe only thing Rena wasn\u201ft really sure about was the fact that once she was under contract, she would have a legal obligation to perform. It wasn\u201ft like her data entry job. If she wanted, she could quit that job whenever she wanted. This was a bit more complicated. Rena would be legally obligated to perform for one month; Jennifer couldn\u201ft even fire her during that time. After that, the only way she could leave is if Jennifer agreed to let her go or she displayed the desire to leave for another month and then, at the end of that time period, Jennifer would be legally obligated to let her out of the contract.<br>\r\nRena then came to the end of the contract, an attached page that listed special additions and conditions to Rena\u201fs personal contract. Because of her growing breasts and the kind of attraction they would bring, Jennifer was going to give Rena a monthly clothing budget to be spent on anything she needed or even wanted until two months after her growth had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other condition was in relation to Rena\u201fs milk. Jennifer knew that men (and some women) would be willing to pay big bucks to drink Rena\u201fs milk, and in such, Rena had a special schedule for her evenings. When she wasn\u201ft on the stage performing, she was to find a comfortable place to sit in the bar with some empty glasses. She would charge for the tall glasses of her fresh milk, and maybe even charge a little extra to let the guys watch her get the milk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the milk sales, Rena would turn over everything she earned to Jennifer, who would keep records for tax purposes and also split the earnings, Rena receiving 60% of the sales while Jennifer received 40%. The profit from this unique enterprise would be delivered every two weeks on a separate check that would arrive at the same time as Rena\u201fs pay check, and it was nice since for the milk it would be all profit. No supply costs, no nothing. All of it turning into money in the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Jennifer asked as she saw Rena\u201fs eyes reach the bottom of the last page. \u201cIt\u201fs very professional.\u201d Rena replied. \u201cOur lawyer is one of the best in the city with this kind of thing; that and making sure we aren\u201ft hassled by the police. You can imagine some of them would like nothing more than to see this place shut down, but we\u201fre legal so they can\u201ft do a thing. It just takes our lawyer to remind them of that sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled a little, nodding her head as she looked at the contract. A small knot began to form in her throat. This was it, the point of no return. If she signed this contract, she would be legally obligated to dance for Jennifer for at least a month. A month wasn\u201ft usually that much time to work at a job, but right now, Rena was afraid just how long it would last. She had enjoyed herself on amateur night, but\u2026could she really do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena closed her eyes, thinking of the third coin she had flipped. She had made a promise to herself;<br>\r\nhowever the coin flips turned out, that was what she was going to do. This was the result, so she was<br>\r\ngoing to do it. Turning over to Jennifer\u201fs desk, Rena set the contract out. Jennifer smiled, handing Rena a pen as she pointed to every place Rena had to put her name, initial, or signature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final swoop of the pen, Rena had put her name down on the final line of the contract. Jennifer smiled, turning the page and signing the contract in a few places herself. After that, it was done. Jennifer smiled brightly, picking up the contract and walking over to the other side of the desk where she opened a drawer. \u201cI really think you\u201fve made a good decision, Rena. My instincts about girls are usually right, and I think you\u201fll find exotic dancing is a far better career than mindlessly putting information into a computer.\u201d<br>\r\nRena smiled, honestly this time. She was feeling a bit better now that she finally had made a decision, gone with it, and there was no way for her to get out of it for at least a month. It made it so her mind was able to put down her strong indecisiveness and leave it alone for a while. She was going to dance now; there was no way out of it, so there was no point in worrying about if she made the right decision until she actually had to option of leaving Jennifer and the \u201cDancing Cats\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Jennifer said as she closed the drawer of her desk, \u201cYou and I need to go shopping.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jennifer at the wheel and Rena sitting in the passenger seat, the pair drove away from the Dancing Cats and soon found themselves in one of the city\u201fs shopping districts. There were a lot of stores on the street, all of them fairly nice and most of them clothing stores. Jennifer found a parking spot on the street, putting money in the parking meter for a good few hours before whisking Rena down to street to one store in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer!\u201d a chipper voice called from inside the store as the pair of women stepped in. \u201cMargaret.\u201d Jennifer replied, moving forward and giving a hug to the woman that had been standing in the store before she came in. It was another woman in her thirties and amazingly beautiful. Well tanned, tall, thin, with D cup assets and a nice curve to her hips. Long red hair and brilliant hazel eyes, she was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two old friends caught up quickly, Rena looked around the store, taking in the types of<br>\r\nmerchandise. It was practically all lingerie with some pajamas and night gowns taking up one of the<br>\r\nstore's three walls. Bras, panties, thongs, men\u201fs garments, everything you could possibly wear under your clothing, all available in this one store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena, I\u201fd like to introduce you to Margaret Sanchez, a friend of mine who is a proud business partner to the Dancing Cats.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMargaret,\u201d Jennifer quickly turned the conversation, \u201cThis is Rena Westfall, a new dancer I just signed on. She needs some work clothes, and they need to be big.\u201d<br>\r\nMargaret laughed. \u201cI can tell; you have a very good plastic surgeon, Miss Westfall.\u201d \u201cOh no, Margaret, those are all natural,\u201d Jennifer corrected, getting an amazed stare. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJennifer nodded. \u201cHonest, but you and I can talk about that later. Right now, my girl here needs some things to wear to work and at home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen you came to the right place, as always.\u201d Margaret said before turning her attention to Rena. \u201cI have the biggest selection of lingerie in the state and, if we just can\u201ft happen to find something big enough for you, I have the talent, expertise, and materials to custom make you anything in just a few minutes. Tell me, what is your size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena forced a smile. \u201cI really don\u201ft know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo, all the more fun when we find out.\u201d Jennifer said, motioning as the trio moved towards the back of the store. Jennifer disappeared through a door at the back of the shop, reemerging with a tape measure. After getting a few measurements and doing some math in her head, Margaret smiled and hung the tape measure over the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, Rena, you have the biggest set of natural knockers I have ever seen: Double K.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDOUBLE K!!!\u201d Rena half shouted. I mean, that would have been her guess but still, now that someone else had told her that had actually measured the mountains that were growing out of her chest, it was hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and luckily for you I do carry bras in that size, though I\u201fve only ever managed to sell a few in that size and that\u201fs the biggest thing I\u201fve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u201fd better start ordering in some larger cups,\u201d Jennifer said, putting her arm around Rena\u201fs shoulder. \u201cThis girl here has breasts most women would die for; they\u201fre growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cup size or two every night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOooooo\u2026\u201d Margaret smiled, looking at Jennifer, \u201cYou\u201fve really got a star here, don\u201ft you?\u201d \u201cYep, but I can\u201ft send her strutting out onto that stage without some good underwear.\u201d \u201cFollow me, I\u201fve got my largest sizes along the back wall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, Jennifer finished taking her newest dancer on their latest shopping spree. Rena\u201fs head was swimming, thinking of all the things they had purchased. Some of them were all right, but the underwear they had gotten from Jennifer\u201fs friend could hardly be considered that. All thong underwear that just managed to keep its wearer decent and some bras, a few fairly covering while others would barely keep her nipples covered with their small fabric triangles and spaghetti straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, you got the contract, the clothing, and you, of course, have the assets. Once we get one more thing I think you\u201fll be ready for your first night of work.\u201d<br>\r\nRena could barely believe it; after all this there was something else. What else could there possibly be? Still, even as Rena tried to get Jennifer to talk the club owner kept quiet as they arrived back at the Dancing Cats. Carrying the clothing inside, Jennifer helped Rena sort the clothing out between work and home. The skimpiest, sexiest things were work clothing that Rena would keep in a small wardrobe beside her vanity station in the dressing room, along with the mirror, the table, the chair, and the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other things, the clothing that were at least halfway decent enough for Rena to leave the house in, Jennifer had Rena put in her car. Margaret was set on the task of finding Rena a good bra that would at least stretch a few cup sizes as she continued to blossom out, but for the time being she just had two KK cup bras and Margaret was custom making a bra that would be a few sizes larger for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the few shirts they had bought were stretchy enough to keep Rena covered for a few days, and she wasn\u201ft getting any bigger below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the clothing put in its place, Rena sat in the main patron area of the club while Jennifer<br>\r\ndisappeared to go get something. Rena groaned a little, rubbing the side of her breasts. For some<br>\r\nreason, Jennifer had practically ordered her to not milk herself. Jennifer let Rena take enough out to keep herself from leaking as they moved from store to store, but otherwise she was supposed to leave them nice and full so that all her clothing could fit when she was at her biggest capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just as Rena began to feel a few small wet stops forming at the front of her current shirt, indicating she needed to empty herself, Jennifer returned carrying a brown box under one arm. She took a seat at the table, smiling as she pushed the box towards Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen it.\u201d<br>\r\nGiving a gentle nod, Rena gently opened the box and removed its contents. At first glance, it was a milk pump but not like any she had at home. This bad boy looked more powerful and had large suction cups. The plastic cups practically covered the entire front of her breasts, and the tube coming off of it was a little thicker than Rena saw on any of her models at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nice, Jennifer, but I already have breast pumps at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your work pump and I bet it is better than anything you have. This is a custom built model,<br>\r\nspecifically designed to empty you quickly so that you fill some nice tall glasses of milk for my patrons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u201fs eyes narrowed a little, looking down at the pump. That did explain one part of the design:<br>\r\nbendable tubing right near the edge of the cup. When Rena looked back up at Jennifer she had taken the pump's plug and slipped it into an outlet in the floor just below the table. She then grabbed something off the ground, setting it on the table. It was a glass, and after positioning the output tube of the pump over the glass, Jennifer looked expectantly at Rena, a finger resting on a small blue button built onto the base of the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at the large suction cups for a second, Rena sighed a little, pulling up her shirt and<br>\r\nslipping them into place. A smile slowly crept onto Jennifer\u201fs face, her head nodding slightly until she saw Rena was ready. Then, giving her finger a dramatic twirl before hand, Jennifer pushed the power button on the pump. It quickly hummed to life, Rena gasping a little as she felt a powerful suction force on her breasts.<br>\r\nThis pump was a lot stronger than the ones she had at home, and Rena quickly felt herself emptying and could see a stream of her milk pouring out into Jennifer\u201fs glass. The club owner stopped the pump when her glass was full, smiling as she reached over beneath the table and grabbed several others she had Gerald put there before she and Rena had come back. Keeping the pump going, Jennifer filled each glass in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Rena had enough milk for ten tall glasses of warm, sweet smelling milk. Jennifer nodded with an impressed look on her face, looking over the glasses. \u201cIt\u201fs impressive how much milk those jugs of yours can hold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only nod her head in agreement. \u201cYeah\u2026I didn\u201ft realize there was so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd our patrons will pay top dollar for it. Still, right now, I must have a taste of it for myself.\u201d With that Jennifer grabbed the nearest glass, starting to drink it slowly but quickly downing the entire glass in a single gulp. She then put the empty glass down on the table, smacking her lips with a satisfied sigh before nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea, that\u201fs good stuff; you and I are going to make a nice profit off of that.\u201d<br>\r\nThe tigress smiled, trying to hold back her own desire to enjoy one of the glasses. Still, as Jennifer began the slow process of carrying all the glasses over and putting them in a fridge behind the bar, Rena couldn\u201ft help herself and enjoyed one of the other nine glasses. She didn\u201ft drink it as fast as Jennifer, but it wasn\u201ft long before the glass stood empty and Rena was brushing a little milk of her top lip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, after what to Rena seemed like a pretty long day, it was time. At Jennifer\u201fs request Rena had<br>\r\nspent what remained of the afternoon preparing several more glasses of her milk for the bar. They were about half the size of the original glasses, meant to be more like taste samples than actual full servings of her milk. Jennifer was going to give the whole house a free round of Rena\u201fs milk just before she went on, a way to get them hooked on her milk and to give Rena a bit of an introduction.<br>\r\nSitting at her vanity station, Rena just stared at herself in the mirror. Since she didn\u201ft really have good balance in high heels, Rena had decided to go with just some comfortable, sandal like shoes that revealed a great deal of her foot. As for the rest of her costume, Jennifer had insisted she go with something that would give her a lot to work with when she started to strip down.<br>\r\nSome jeans that were nice and form fitting, following what small curve her butt and legs had. They were a little tighter than Rena liked, but Jennifer promised it would drive the audience wild. Rena then had a jacket which hung open, revealing a tight white shirt underneath that left her stomach exposed and clung tightly to her breasts. Under all that was a set of black, skimpy lingerie that had a somewhat covering bra, since she was supposed to take it off anyway, and a very revealing thong bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Rena looked at some of the other girls. Jennifer told her that the Dancing Cats had a fairly large staff of girls and she was right. There were easily two dozen vanity stations. For the girls that were full timers, like Rena, they had a private assigned station. That was about half of the stations. The other half was shared by girls who worked one, two, or three times a week; woman who didn\u201ft have the time or the desire to make exotic dancing a full time career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had taken the time to introduce Rena to women that had vanities on either side of her own.<br>\r\nThere was Jasmine, a cat-woman like Rena with black, shimmering fur and a head of long hair which was dyed a deep blood red, and amber eyes. She practically matched the club's color scheme. She was currently dressed in a tight fitting, dark red leather outfit and Rena could only imagine that beneath it all she was wearing red underwear too, if she kept to the theme she seemed to have going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Brittany, a Caucasian human with blond hair and deep, sapphire blue eyes. She was tall, standing a good six feet with a lot of curves, D cup breasts, a bit of a bubble butt, and a nice tan that Rena overheard her saying it was a real, all over tan. She was going to be heading out onto the stage in one of the wardrobe room\u201fs costumes, a nurse\u201fs outfit that, underneath, had a revealing, see through jacket with medical crosses where her nipples would be. Since Brittany didn\u201ft have fur, Jennifer let her choose how close to naked she got, at least that was what Rena had been told about the completely human dancers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, two stations away on the right was Tina, a quarter cat woman. Jennifer said that she had a<br>\r\ncheetah print mother and an African father, thus leading to her unique appearance. She was mostly<br>\r\nhuman, as you would expect from a quarter cat, but she had a long tail as well as feline ears and eyes. Still, her most unique trait was the fact that though she was mostly human she inherited her mother\u201fs fur pattern. All across her lightly brown skin were deep, dark brown cheetah spots. It gave her a surprisingly wild look, the entire appearance being topped off by a head of short, wildly cut hair.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTina was turning, heading out onto stage in a safari costume, obviously playing up on her very wild appearance for the guys and few girls outside. Rena could hear the crowd start to whistle and the music play, obviously signaling that Tina had gone onto the stage. Some of the other girls began to head towards the door, crossing the hall and going into the back stage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was nervous, wound tighter than a clock spring. When she danced on amateur night she didn\u201ft<br>\r\nhave time to sit and think about what she was about to do. Now, she had that time, and Rena could feel herself starting to get sick from nerves. She was so wrapped up in her tension that Rena couldn\u201ft help but yelp and jump a little bit in her seat when she felt someone set a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa girl, relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned, placing a hand on her heart to try and calm it down. It was just Jasmine, and after catching her breath, Rena managed to force out a fairly weak, \u201cI\u201fm sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u201ft worry girl, I was nervous my first night too. Jennifer hooked me about the same way she got you, getting me to go up for amateur night. Trust me, you\u201fll feel a whole lot better when you actually get up on stage, especially with that chest of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena forced a smile, \u201cYea\u2026thanks\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded, turning as she too went to the stage area. Rena was now alone in the dressing room, looking at herself in the mirror. Maybe she could just hide in back, wait until the night was over\u2026.no, she couldn\u201ft. She had a contract with Jennifer and if she didn\u201ft perform, she\u201fd have to pay Jennifer a pretty penny, something she could afford maybe once or twice but couldn't make a habit of, not after Jennifer had her quit her data entry position. Taking a big breath and trying to force down the knot in her throat, Rena slowly got to her feet and turned, taking slow steps as she went towards the door.</span></div></div>",

Now, some of you must be wondering, why milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight murmur of agreement and nodding of heads from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, some of you may be happy\u2026and maybe even a little excited...to know that this milk came straight from our new star. A case of where medical malpractice has lead to something good, I\u201fd like you all to meet a woman whose breasts not only put out enough milk to feed several families but are also growing, yes, growing cup sizes a day. The bountiful beauty with the emerald gaze, let\u201fs welcome to the stage Rena Westfall.\u201d<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered, some of the men chugging down the milk now that they knew where it had come from while others pushed the glasses away in disgust. The stage lights were focused on the center curtain, and slowly the club fell silent as everyone waited. The wait began to stretch onward, and yet no one appeared. A cough gently cut the silence once, but otherwise nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after the tension was about to hit a breaking point the curtain moved a little. Stretching out slowly<br>\r\nfrom the seam between the curtains, a slender leg slowly came into view, striking a seductive pose. Some men whistled, but others were still waiting with baited breath. The leg slowly contracted itself, the audience not realizing that Rena was getting some specific instructions from Jennifer, who knew that there was a good chance Rena would freeze up on her first night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, you\u201fve got some of them interested; now to get the rest hooked. I\u201fm going to turn on some flood lights we have back here. Turn and face the curtain, the lights will cast your shadow against the curtain, and it will be visible from the other size. Your shadow will show up against the curtain to the audience. I want you to give me your most seductive silhouette you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u201ft I have more practice?\u201d Rena whispered as she watched Jennifer place her hand on a light switch.<br>\r\n\u201cThe best dancers are those who do what comes naturally. We can work on your form later; right now I want to see what you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Jennifer hit the light switch, the lights flooding against Rena\u201fs back. She could clearly see her<br>\r\nsilhouette, and even though she really was just standing there, a few voices came clearly through the<br>\r\ncurtain. Rena was tense for a moment, but then began to slowly raise her hands, putting them above her head. Jennifer smiled, nodding her head as the crowd responded well. Rena felt her confidence building a little, lifting her hands had drawn a small cheer. Giving her hips a gentle saunter off to one side, another set of cat calls and whistles began to echo in the backstage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u201fs it girl, tease them a little, taunt them, and when you\u201fve got them hooked head up onto the stage. After that, just give them a good show. When you\u201fre down to your thong, make sure to get nice and close to the guys near the stage. They\u201fll slip some nice big bills under your strap if you give them the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, glancing back just in time to see Jennifer flashed her a smile before placing a hand on the door.<br>\r\n\u201cKnock \u201eem dead.\u201d With that Jennifer left, and Rena was left to perform. Turning her attention back to the curtain, Rena sauntered her hips back to the other side, lowering her arms. She kept moving her hips slowly as she ran her hands down her body, following each and every curve. Music began to play, Rena\u201fs hips quickly falling into time with the slow, seductive melody.<br>\r\nWith every move, every pose of her shadow, Rena felt her confidence grow, the crowd outside eating up her shadow dance. A few poses after she had started, Rena took a deep breath and decided it was time to take the plunge. Using her hand to find the opening in the curtain, she put one leg through and then sauntered through, putting on a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd\u201fs interest in the new girl probably doubled when they saw Rena standing on stage. A few of<br>\r\nthe guys probably recognized her from the night before, but this time Rena was wearing something much tighter, more revealing, and much sexier. That, and this time Rena was going to do more than just play with the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the pole, Rena decided it was good of place as any to start her show. Reaching over and<br>\r\ngently placing her hand on it, Rena stepped smoothly up beside the pole, placing it against her back. She looked at the crowd, closing her eyes as she gently rubbed her back up and down against the metal. Rena opened her eyes as she came back up, glancing out across the crowd. Oh yea, she had their attention, nearly half the club had her eyes glued on her show and the other girls had also slowed down their performances. It seemed everyone was interested to see just what the new girl would do.<br>\r\nAnd Rena\u201fs nerves were all but gone, driven away by the thought that she was drawing the attention of so many men, that to them she was looking like the sexiest thing on two legs. Rena quivered a little, the simple pleasure of the attention sending a shiver up her spine. Jennifer, who was watching from the bar as she sipped on a fruity drink couldn\u201ft help but smile. The look on Rena\u201fs face made it clear; Jennifer had just gotten herself a new headliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the swing of the performance, Rena played and teased with the pole for a good fifteen<br>\r\nminutes, and just as Rena sensed she was starting to lose the crowd\u201fs interest she began to do what any good exotic dancer would; she began to get undressed. The jacket first, slipping it off slowly and letting it fall unceremoniously to the floor, she then turned, bending over and giving the guys in the front center a perfect view of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to focus on her very special assets, Rena played and teased with her breasts, rubbing them<br>\r\ntogether and putting on faces of semi-faked pleasure, throwing in a few purrs and groans. Rena could<br>\r\nonly smile to herself on the inside. She had to be careful; if she kept making noises like this she might just enjoy rubbing her breasts together like this. Then again\u2026maybe that wouldn\u201ft be a bad thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rena danced she got her first really good look at how the club was laid out from her higher up<br>\r\nperspective. It was a fairly large room, defiantly proving that the Dancing Cats was one of the city\u201fs more successful strip clubs. She could even see the front entrance, or at least the door that connected to small hallway that acted as a buffer between the club and the outside world; probably a city ordinance so that no one outside would get accidentally flashed.<br>\r\nIf you had come from the front door, the first thing you\u201fd see on your right was the bar, which was nestled in the right hand corner beside the front door. To your left was most of the club\u201fs stages. Built up against the wall, a long stretch of stage started just to the left of the door, moving along the near wall, taking up the entire left hand wall of the patron area, and then taking up half the back wall with the backstage hidden behind tall, deep red curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the stage that was built against the room's back wall, connected to the back stage and thus the employee's area of the club, another bit of stage went straight out into the open floor space, curving gently to make a small enclosed area that took up the far left hand quarter of the room. Inside that quarter, another stage branched out from the main stage, forming a small peninsula in the center of the enclosed space. Being placed in the very heart of the patrons, the small stage peninsula had aptly earned the name \u201cCenter Stage\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cCenter Stage\u201d featured two nicely spaced poles, allowing for the experienced girl\u201fs to pull of some fairly impressive moves and plenty of open space to flaunt. Rena didn\u201ft quite know those kind of maneuvers, but she wasn\u201ft having any trouble drawing the audience as she strode up onto Center Stage, touching the two poles gently with her finger tips as she slipped into a sexy pose, tossing her hair back and giving the guys in the center of the club a playful wink, which made a number of them holler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned around slowly, giving a little attention to each side of the center stage before turning things up a notch. As Jennifer put it back when they were picking out the lingerie \u201cThis is the kind of underwear that was never meant to be kept under wraps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing the button of her pants and loosing the zipper, Rena gently turn her tush to the guys, being<br>\r\nplayful with her hands as she inched her pants down, slowly revealing her tight, black lace thong. She<br>\r\nthen gave a treat to the guys on the left and right side, pulling her pants off and in turn giving them a flash of her thin, smooth, athletic form. Her shirt soon meet the same fate as her pants, Rena throwing it over her shoulder as she gave everyone a good look at her double K\u201fs before turning to face the back of the stage, giving her butt a little wiggle in the front row\u201fs direction.<br>\r\nOn the stage against the club\u201fs left wall, the black cat woman Jasmine could only smile. She was keeping the attention of her own part of the crowd well enough, but she couldn\u201ft help but give Rena some passing glances; the girl had some real raw talent. It took her a week before she was able to pull the guys in like Rena was. Of all dancers, there were those who were born to dance and those who choose and became dancers. Jasmine was a self made dancer, not having the natural talent but choosing to make herself one of the Dancing Cats club\u201fs headliners. Rena, however\u2026hmmm mmmm\u2026she just had it going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena got down low, giving playful looks to all the guys and the few girls in the audience. Like Jennifer told her, she got close to the front row with her hips and breasts, and to no surprise some of the gentleman began to slip bills into Rena\u201fs cleavage and under her thong strap. Jennifer had told her the usual economics of the situation. When a guy slipped you money, you needed to check it. Depending on the size of the bill was how much special attention you needed to give them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena played that game for nearly half an hour, picking up the tips and giving the guys, and one time a<br>\r\ngal, a special, close up look at her breasts, butt, and she even getting her tail into the mix, using it to<br>\r\ngently bat the audience members playfully in the nose. After an hour of performing, Rena glanced over at Jennifer at the bar, the woman giving her the go ahead.<br>\r\nIt was her plan from the beginning, at least for Rena\u201fs first show. The tigress emptied her breasts a few minutes before the beginning of the show, letting them fill up as she entranced the audience. Now, she was full and could feel herself just starting to leak. This was when Jennifer told Rena would be the time to have her big finale.<br>\r\nMaking sure she was in a good position Rena turned, hands reaching behind her back as she played with her bra strap, unhooking it slowly before pealing it off and letting it drop onto the stage. The men cat called, howled, and soon the fives and tens that had been held up to get Rena\u201fs attention began to change into tens and twenties. Rena rubbed her breasts, making sure they were really full. Jennifer hadn\u201ft really said what Rena should have done for her finale, but in the flow of the moment Rena knew what to do almost instinctually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently reaching forward to the front of her breasts, Rena found her nipple beneath her short, thick fur.<br>\r\nShe then began to play with them, the situation and the attention she was getting from the audience<br>\r\nquickly getting them excited. When her nipples really began to leak, Rena cupped her hands beneath one breast, getting a small pool of milk in her hand before holding it up to her face and drinking it.<br>\r\nRena then went through the last of her performance, letting guys stick twenties into the crevasse between her KK knockers. Rena than gently worked her breasts, letting the graciously tipping patron get a few handfuls of her milk, which they drank more than readily. Still, after doing this for a while Rena decided to sit down and take a break, gathering up her things as she gave the audience a few parting shots before sauntering off stage.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u201fs have some cheers for Rena Westfall, a new full time dancer here at the Dancing Cats club. And don\u201ft think you\u201fve see the last of Rena for this evening. She\u201fll be back on the stage before you know it, but in the mean time you can find Rena sitting at the corner of the bar, serving up tall glasses of her all natural breast milk. It doesn\u201ft get any fresher, and you can even get the milk chilled to a nice, ice cold temperature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena slouched down in a seat back stage, smiling as she relaxed a little. Still, before Rena could have even recovered, Jennifer was in the door, a wide, toothy grin of satisfaction on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cRena, I knew you\u201fd be good but you\u201fre more of a natural than I could have ever imagined.\u201d \u201cI don\u201ft know about that; I mean, I was just getting into it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRena, that\u201fs about all there is to this job. You just have to get into and enjoy the performance, and I have to admit giving those guys sips of your milk right off stage was genius. How much money did they give you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked down, rather surprised when she realized the significant large collection of cash that was<br>\r\nstuck nice and deep down her cleavage. Rena pulled it all out, and then removed any money that had<br>\r\nbeen put under her thong strap. Most of it was crumpled and a little sweaty, but being the expert business owner Jennifer quickly took the stack, thumbing through it as she counted quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cRena, you do this well with your next couple performances and you\u201fll more than double your paycheck for tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble?\u201d Rena asked, eyes a little wide.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea, but that\u201fs easy. On a real good night Jasmine can pull down two grand.\u201d \u201cTwo grand!?!\u201d<br>\r\nJennifer nodded, \u201cOh yea. You see, Rena, the way this business works is guys always have a favorite girl, and it\u201fs usually a certain type. Jasmine is a black cat, mysterious, very seductive, even a little supernatural in the eyes of some guys, especially with that hair of hers. She\u201fs almost like a black furred siren. She gets the attention of the men who enjoy and want to fantasize about the most mysterious of ladies, the ones that taunt and tease them to no end but always make them feel that a happy ending is just around the bend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer continued, leaning against the door jam. \u201cThus, because Jasmine plays into her chosen type so well, she starts to get fans. Guys come from all over the city just to see her and they bring friends. When you start to get guys who are coming back over and over again just to see you, that\u201fs repeat business on top of whoever happens to be in the club that evening. That\u201fs how you make the big tips.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d Rena said, slowly getting to her feet as she started to put her bra back on. \u201cBut, what kind of guys would I attract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else? The guys that like girls with big breasts, and you're only going to get more popular the bigger you get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger is always better?\u201d Rena echoed, giving Jennifer a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALWAYS.\u201d Jennifer replied with a slight chuckle in her voice, \u201cNow get your pants and bra back on but leave the jacket and top off. I\u201fll meet you at the bar; there\u201fs probably five guys waiting there for a proper glass of that milk of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, pulling on her pants and dropping her shirt and jacket off in the dressing room before<br>\r\nslipping out into the main patron area. Jennifer was right, there seemed to be a line of guys already at the bar. Jennifer was smart; she gave every person in the bar a free round of her milk before her show started, so they all had gotten to taste it. The taste alone made it desirable, since her milk was way better than anything that came out of a cow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer lead Rena to a reserved seat at the end of the bar, beside which was her pump. Unlike early in the day, the tube went into a small, black metal box with two faucets on it, one marked with a red handle and the other marked with a blue. Jennifer quietly explained to Rena that the red faucet just delivered her milk straight from the tube. The blue faucet, however, ran the milk through a flash chilling system so that while her milk was fresh, it could also be served ice cold.<br>\r\n\u201cAll right boys, ready to have some milk?\u201d Jennifer asked, getting a resounding reply from the guys who were circled around the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled at Rena, getting close and whispering in her ear, \u201cDon\u201ft forget, even though you're<br>\r\ntechnically on break, you can still give these guys a little show. After all, the more you build your fan base, the better your tips will get.\u201d<br>\r\nRena nodded, and after smiling at the boys she took the pump's suction cups, carefully affixing them over her breasts, letting them be held in place by her bra. Once both were in place she gave the bar tender a little signal, and he turned on the pump. Getting drained always felt good, but Rena played it up a little as she rubbed her breasts a little, letting out weak, pleasure like moans. Several of the guys were watching her, a couple of them slacked jaw. Rena could only smile, those gazes making her feel oh so sexy. She was starting to understand why some people enjoyed this kind of work so much. You just felt so\u2026special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Rena sat and over the next hour let several of the club patrons enjoy some nice tall glasses of her breast milk. Then, it was back up onto the stage for another performance. Another break and after a third, and final performance Rena\u201fs shift ended. The tigress, while she had enjoyed almost every minute of her first night on the job, was exhausted and for good reason. Still, after changing into her personal undergarments and street clothing in the bathroom, Rena stopped by Jennifer\u201fs office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I\u201fm heading home, is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Rena,\u201d Jennifer said, looking up from her desk where she was carefully counting and<br>\r\nrecording the tips all the girl\u201fs had earned so that it could be properly recorded for tax and legal purposes. \u201cAnd let me congratulate you on an amazing first night on the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but man am I\u201fm tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u201fm not surprised; this is probably a lot more energetic than typing keys on a keyboard. Still, get a good night's sleep and I want to see you back here about six hours before we open. You have great natural form, but I\u201fd still like Jasmine to help you perfect a few things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u201fll make sure to be here, though getting a good night\u201fs sleep is easier said than done,\u201d Rena commented as she started to leave, \u201cyou don\u201ft have to try and sleep on a rubber raft in the bath tub.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Rena left, Jennifer eyeing the door with a contemplative look. Now this wouldn\u201ft do, one of her headliners having to sleep in a bath tub. Rena had already told her way back when they were talking at the normal night club, but it had slipped Jennifer\u201fs mind. Making a mental note to do some research the next morning, Jennifer went back to counting the take for the evening.<br>\r\nThe next day, back at the Dancing Cats club, Rena had just stepped in the employee entrance. She had arrived six hours early, as instructed, and went to go see Jennifer. As to be expected, her breasts had swelled out as she had slept, going from KK to LL cups, a two cup size increase, and the quickly becoming massive orbs were already starting to struggle against the extra large garments she and Jennifer had purchased the day before.<br>\r\nAfter knocking a few times and getting a polite come in, Rena gently poked her head in the door. Jennifer was seated at her desk and, surprisingly, the black cat woman Jasmine was sitting in one of the other chairs, the pair obviously in the middle of a conversation. It had probably been about Rena, since, after all, the reason she came to work so early was so that Jasmine could give her some training. \u201cAh, Rena, right on time, and looking even bustier I must say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled. \u201cYea, if I had to guess I\u201fd have to say they grew two cup sizes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble L knockers; now that will bring the customers in. Now, if you haven\u201ft beaten me to the punch, I\u201fd like to properly introduce you to Jasmine Sanders, the mysterious, black mistress of the Dancing Cats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine gently out stretched her hand, the pair shaking gently as Rena took a seat in the other chair in front of Jennifer\u201fs desk. \u201cThank you so much for that little pep talk last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u201ft worry about that hon; you just looked like you needed a little something to distract your nerves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled. \u201cIt\u201fs good to hear you two have already had a chance to get acquainted. Still, Jasmine<br>\r\nand I have targeted a few parts of your performance last night that needed to be adjusted, but you should be able to hammer them all out before tonight. Listen well, Rena, because while you got body, Jasmine is by far my most experienced dancer here at the club and gets the best tips because of it.<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Jennifer said before reaching under hear desk and throwing a black wad of fabric at Rena, \u201cThis just came over from Margaret, something to tie you over for a few days at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena unfolded the fabric, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cA bikini top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider it your bra for the time being. Margaret is searching her suppliers for someone who has a solution for supporting your growing assets that doesn\u201ft involve getting a new bra every day until you stop. Still, until she can find something, that bikini top should do just find. If you\u201fll look, you\u201fll see it has nice long strings. Just tie them tight enough and if you keep yourself fairly full of milk you should have plenty of support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, just one more thing,\u201d Jennifer said before grabbing a few pamphlets out of her desk and passing<br>\r\nthem to Rena. \u201cThese are things you might consider since I don\u201ft like the idea of one of my girls sleeping in a bathtub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked at the pamphlets, looking though a few of them as she saw what they were about. They all seemed to be involve helping woman who were lactating at night, Rena\u201fs very problem if hers was only on a much larger scale. One pamphlet featured a product that kind of acted like a cork. You placed it over your nipple, and it just stopped the milk from coming out. That probably was fine for most women, but then again most women weren\u201ft producing a full breast's worth of milk every hour.<br>\r\nThe next pamphlet featured something was much more elaborate, but a very viable fix. It was something Rena would never guessed there was a market for. It was a mixture of products: a special waterproof mattresses, special blankets, covers, and pillows that won\u201ft get damaged by liquids and dry quickly, and finally a very unique mattress frame. The frame was like a big bathtub, with a drain in the center. Any liquids spilled on the mattress or the sheets would be directed down to the frame and then emptied out through the drain. It was basically making a bathtub bed, a much more comfortable version of what Rena was already using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final pamphlet was for a solution Rena had already considered, though she had looked at it through the lens of her breast pump. It was basically a special kind of bra with adjustable and extendable straps. It had plastic cups that you could fit over your breasts and then secure in place with these straps, just like you would a bra. From the plastic a pair of tubes joined together and then just fell off to an open ending. It was a surprisingly simple solution though it might be uncomfortable. Still, by getting enough tubing and having it lead into her sink or bathtub, Rena could easily just let her milk drain away naturally during the night while still enjoying her old bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Jennifer,\u201d Rena said, looking up from the pamphlets, \u201cI\u201fll be able to get good night\u201fs sleep with one of these things I\u201fm sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u201fs good to hear. Hate to have any of my girls being tired. Yawning during a performance is a sure<br>\r\nway to lose the attention of our patrons. Now, you two head off and get to work; I want to see some grade A dancing in about five hours when we need to start getting ready for tonight.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After heading out into the main, patron area, Jennifer had Rena take a seat as she climbed up onto the center stage. \u201cAll right, the first thing you need to learn isn\u201ft a dance move or pose, but how to read your audience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was a little surprised by this, expecting to get a very different lecture. \u201cHow do you read the audience?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u201fs what I\u201fm about to tell you if you\u201fll be patient. Now, let\u201fs say its nighttime, the bar is packed and I just happen to be the only girl out here. That means I\u201fve probably got the attention of most of the crowd.\u201d At this Jasmine sauntered over to one of the poles, striking a few very simple and quick poses.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u201fs say I\u201fm going through my routine and I start out with a few poses, and each time the crowd seems to like it, the guys making noise. What should I be worried about right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena titled her head a little, trying to think. \u201cUm\u2026what to do next?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u201fre getting just a little bit too far ahead, girl. The first thing I need to do is listen and look. What guys are making noise, where are they sitting, and just what about the pose is getting their blood pumping. For example, if I do something like this,\u201d At that Jasmine bent over low, her body turned sideways to Rena, \u201cAnd I hear noise coming from the left and right side of the stage, what does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\nRena laughed a little to herself, the question sounding like something you\u201fd hear out a high school math textbook, though its subject was a little too edgy for such a place. Still, Rena looked over Jasmine, and after staring for a few minutes she could only shrug her shoulders in defeat.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u201ft get discouraged, it takes a little thought to get the hang of it. Here, this might help. Get up and walk over to the right side of center stage, and tell me what\u201fs the part of my body you can see the best.\u201d<br>\r\nDoing as she was told, Rena quickly stood up and moved over, smiling a little as she commented, \u201cYour butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo, girl, and what do you think the boys over there are hollering about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour butt again.\u201d Rena played, making Jasmine laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u201fre getting it. And, without walking over to the other side, what do you think the boys on the left side of the stage like so much about me.\u201d<br>\r\nRena looked at Jasmine\u201fs position for a second, thinking about the situation before smiling, \u201cThey\u201fre cheering because they\u201fve got a great view of your cleavage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat or they\u201fre into girls with amber eyes, but most of the time it will be the breasts. Still, that\u201fs the idea of reading the audience. At the beginning of your performance you need to basically survey the room, start your performance by giving everyone a good look at everything. Judge the crowd's reactions, and then make some mental notes where you want to focus your attention and for what body part. It will rarely be as simple as left and right side of the stage, but people tend to cluster. Still, before we get too far you must remember you can\u201ft rely on sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, the boys and girls who cheer are the ones that usually pay out fives and tens in tips. The quiet guys up front are the ones that pay bigger, but to figure out what they want you can\u201ft listen but watch. Here, take a seat and watch me dance for a few seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs instructed, Rena took a seat and Jasmine began to dance. Rena had to admit, she really was good. Rena was straight and yet she couldn\u201ft help but have some rather surprisingly sexual thoughts. Some of the noises Jasmine was making, the actions along with their perfect speed, she was a pro. Still, after only about half a minute Jasmine stopped leaning leisurely against the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u201fre a girl that likes breasts and butts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rena asked, caught off guard by such an out of the blue comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was dancing, if you weren\u201ft looking at my body entirely, you were focusing in on two places, my breasts or my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked up at the ceiling, and she hated to admit that Jasmine was right. Her mind seemed to focus on those areas, if only noting how Jasmine\u201fs body compared to her own.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is how you figure out what the quiet guys want. If you find someone watching you perform that doesn\u201ft make a lot of noise, but is watching you intensely, try to figure out just what he seems to be looking at. That\u201fs what he\u201fll be interested in and what he\u201fll pay big tips to get a good look at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that simple?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe idea is simple, using it in practice is much harder. The crowd is always changing, people get up and leave and new customers sit down. You always have to be changing your performance, adapting\u2026\u201d At this Jasmine, with little warning, quickly turned her back to Rena and then bent over backwards, using her arms to support herself on stage as she looked at Rena upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to be able to bend over backwards if that\u201fs what will get you the tips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d was all Rena could say as Jasmine stood back up straight with very little effort. The black cat woman smiled, turning to glance at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and several of the other girls go to yoga every afternoon. In this job, it pays to be flexible, and our<br>\r\nyoga couch knows how to make most people as limber as a contortionist. You\u201fre welcome to come along, if you pay the membership fee. Now, enough lecturing, let\u201fs get you up here and get some practice in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u201fs it,\u201d Jasmine said, smiling as she watched Rena moving and dancing on stage. \u201cA little more shake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like you two are having fun,\u201d Jennifer commented as she came out of the door that separated the employee only areas from the patron area of the club. \u201cHow is she doing, Jasmine?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u201ft really say without putting her in front of a real audience, but I think with some proper, on the job practice she\u201fll really be good enough to be called a Dancing Cats headliner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u201fs good to hear, but we open in an hour and I want you two rested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rena said, jumping down from the stage, her breasts bobbing up and down a few times and almost off setting her balance. Still, the tigress managed to keep herself from falling down, \u201cbut do you mind if I get something to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, just stay away from the alcohol; I don\u201ft like my girls being tipsy when they perform.\u201d<br>\r\nRena nodded, watching Jennifer and Jasmine head back towards the \u201cemployee\u201fs only\u201d door before she moved over to the bar. Jasmine had gotten them some sodas earlier, but Rena quickly discovered that everything behind the bar was kept in refrigerators with keypad locks. Probably to make sure no one raided the bar in case the bartender had to step away.<br>\r\nStill, that left Rena with a bit of a pickle. She was parched, but couldn\u201ft find anything. It was then Rena spied the milk pump Jennifer had installed on the end of the bar. It was completely exposed, the set of tubes properly cleaned from the night before. Rena shrugged, deciding that it was better than nothing as she quickly began to slip the suction cups beneath her shirt and bra.<br>\r\nFinding an empty glass and turning on the pump, Rena decided to use the cooling feature on the milk faucet, filling up a glass and swigging it down. Rena smiled, licking her lips and quickly down the rest of the glass. She thought her milk was good, but this stuff was ice cold and fresh at the same time, and it was even better. Sure, she had put her milk in the fridge before, but it took it a while to get cold and then it just didn\u201ft taste quite the same. This\u2026this was just too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rena knew it, she had downed about three glasses. Her thirst satisfied Rena disconnected herself from the pump and went back stage, mostly to get ready but also to ask Jennifer where she found the instant chilling thing. With the money she would have coming in, Rena didn\u201ft see any harm in buying herself one for the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wednesday night ended (pretty sure it was Wednesday), and before Rena knew it Monday had come again, a week after she had visited the doctor about her growing breasts problem that was no longer a problem. It was kind of surprising how fast the time had gone, but then again, when you are doing the enjoyable work of exotic dancing compared to the monotony of data entry, it\u201fs understandable that time would seem to go by faster.<br>\r\nRena had already started to garner a small following at the Dancing Cats club, and Jennifer was enjoying the increase in business. The sales from Rena\u201fs milk were really boosting the club's bottom line with almost no actual supply cost. It was like selling beer you had gotten for free, at twice the price.<br>\r\nOn top of turning into quite the rising star at the Dancing Cats, Rena couldn\u201ft deny that she had found and quickly made a surprising amount of friends in her fellow dancers. Rena could probably say she was well acquainted with most of the other girls, minus those who were a bit too jealous of the attention Rena was getting and her natural, ever increasing bust line.<br>\r\nTaking Jasmine up on her invitation, Rena joined a number of girls for their daily yoga. Rena could really see Jasmine becoming one of her best friends, the best from the club at the very least. Jasmine, being the older and more experienced dancer, always had a thing or two to teach Rena and help her improve. She was kind of like a big sister really, and, in the end, the better Rena got the better it was for everyone else. After all, the more people they brought into the club, the more tips for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Jasmine, as the tigress stepped into the dressing room to start getting ready for the night's show, she saw the black fur cat-woman getting ready at her own station. Jasmine took Fridays and Saturdays off, while Rena had just been given the weekend for the time being, so the pair hadn\u201ft seen each other for a few days. Hugging and giving each other a warm welcome, Jasmine couldn\u201ft help but shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl, are you ever going to stop growing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSooner or later, but not today.\u201d Rena explained, smiling as she took a seat at her vanity station. \u201cHow big are they now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAccording to Margaret at the lingerie store, RR cups.\u201d Rena smiled, \u201cI got the special bra with tubes, from the pamphlet Jennifer gave me, and I tried it out over the weekend. I was able to get a great night\u201fs sleep and keep my bed dry. I don\u201ft know if it was the fact I was lying flat or getting a good night\u201fs sleep, but these two went up four cup sizes yesterday and this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand up here and let me feel your girls.\u201d Jasmine said, her strange tendency to call women and breasts \u201egirls\u201f something Rena had already gotten used to. Rena stood back up, holding back her arms and letting Jasmine get her hands on the bottom side of Rena\u201fs breasts, giving them a bit of a bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, they\u201fre getting heavy; how is your back keeping up with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast week my doctor gave me an injection so that my muscles would be able to support my chest. I guess the injection is keeping up with my cup sizes, otherwise, you're right, I\u201fd probably be stuck face down on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u201fs not jinx that. You\u201fre a good dancer, but I never heard of a dancer that can keep the crowd interested when she\u201fs pinned to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Rena had a good laugh at this, and before long it was time to head on stage. The club was already filled, and as Rena joined the other girls back stage, Jennifer caught her in the hall, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think of life as an exotic dancer, Rena?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u201fs something else.\u201d Rena replied.<br>\r\n\u201cGood to hear, now get that cute butt of yours up there and give those customers what they came for.\u201d At that Jennifer gave Rena a playful pinch, which not only surprised Rena but Jennifer as well. She had given Rena a playful pinch at the end of Friday because she had done such a good job, kind of like football players smacking each others' butts. Still, something was different.<br>\r\n\u201cRena, did you eat anything out of the ordinary over the weekend?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just had a lot of my own milk. At the rate I\u201fm producing it, even if I send a lot of it off to that mother\u201fs<br>\r\nmilk company there\u201fs a bunch left over. I probably\u2026yea, I probably had a couple dozen glasses over the weekend. Thanks to that instant cooling thing I bought, like the one you have on the bar, I just can\u201ft get enough of it and, thankfully, I have my own natural, never ending supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you may want to slow it down a little. That butt of yours is starting to round out.\u201d<br>\r\nRena turned, looking down her back as she placed a hand on her butt. Her cheeks did feel a little fuller, and, come to think of it, getting her pants on had been a little more difficult this morning. Rena had a few old pairs of pants she could still get into, so she just thought she had grabbed one of those by mistake. Still, now that Jennifer had mentioned it...<br>\r\n\u201cThen again,\u201d Jennifer said, giving Rena a sly smile, \u201cif being in this industry has taught me anything, the general mentality is that bigger is better, and that includes a big round butt.\u201d<br>\r\nRena crossed her arms, eyeing Jennifer, \u201cWhat, now you want me to have big breasts and a big butt?\u201d \u201cRena, I never make my girls do anything they don\u201ft want to; just something to think about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just shook her head, heading through the door to the back stage and heading out to start her<br>\r\nperformance. Rena smiled, noticing a few familiar faces in the crowd from last week. Guys who had been more than eager to give her nice big tips; it was going to be a good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena yawned, smiling as she slowly woke up the next day. It had been a change getting her sleep<br>\r\nschedule to fit the club\u201fs late nights, but after getting some curtains that really cut out the light for her<br>\r\nbedroom, Rena was able to get home and take some time to have a very early breakfast before slinking<br>\r\noff to bed. It was about noon when Rena woke up, meaning she had several hours before she had to be at work, plenty of time to enjoy the nice, warm afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the bathroom, Rena flipped on the light and looked at herself in the mirror. Yep, sleeping in her real bed really seemed to be letting her breasts grow even more quickly. They easily looked four cup sizes larger, meaning that she\u201fd need to stop and visit Margaret at the lingerie shop before she went to work. Margaret was being nice about it, letting Rena keep the bikini she had been using and just extending the strings even further. She did it as long as Rena promised that when she\u201fd finally stopped growing she would go through Margaret to order herself a set of actual bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after Rena had given her larger assets the good once over, squishing them and bouncing them in<br>\r\nher hands among other things, she couldn\u201ft help but take a step back from the mirror. Turning to one side and hopping up onto the edge of her counter, Rena took a look at her butt. It really did look bigger and it felt softer too. Was the fact she was drinking so much of her own milk really doing this?<br>\r\nLogically, it made sense. After all, it wasn\u201ft like her breast milk was ever processed. At best, it was chilled, and otherwise it was all natural and that meant it was also \u201ewhole\u201f milk. That meant that it was pretty rich in fat and stuff like that, and besides the excess in drinking milk her diet hadn\u201ft really changed. It made sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Rena gently gave her now rounder butt a squeeze she was just having a little trouble believing<br>\r\nthat it was true. And, of course, Jennifer\u201fs little comment from the night before worked its way into Rena\u201fs mind. Bigger is always better, and that includes a big round butt. Rena gently patted her tush, the gears in her mind turning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition written by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rena began to grin. Why not have a big, round butt? She was making a name for herself as a<br>\r\ndancer with a pair of huge hooters that just kept getting bigger and now she was able to localize growth to another place. She really didn't want to cut back on the milk drinking either, not when it was even better tasting when chilled nice and cold. No, she loved her own brand and was going to keep drinking it and ride the changes out.<br>\r\nBesides, a bigger bottom might give her some benefits. More sway in her walk and dance, softer sit-<br>\r\ndowns, a nice counter weight to her breasts, and of course, giving something for butt lovers to gaze at.<br>\r\nWith big breasts and a big butt, she would have something for everyone; a real hourglass figure. Though, given her body's extreme proportions, she might even up looking more like a day-glass than an hourglass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding her head once, as a bit of a self-confirmation, Rena had decided. She was going to do it; bigger is always better. After emptying herself out and getting some breakfast, Rena guzzled down as much milk as she could stand. Her butt had some ground to make up if they were going to be anything like her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================<br>\r\nBy and by, Rena drank her breast milk throughout the day and visited Margaret, who could only smile and shake her head at Rena's growing breasts. If this kept up, Rena just might be able to sport the largest all natural breasts in the world. Once that was done, Rena went to the Dancing Cats. It wasn't open but that gave Rena a chance to empty herself out and get a small supply ready for tonight. Even if Rena was being milked every hour there was nothing wrong with making a small supply for first come first serve customers. If anything, it would give some people a reason to stick around for the next batch.<br>\r\nAs Rena was almost done being milked, she couldn't help but ask a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer?\" Rena asked, the club owner working behind the bar as she made a list of stuff to order. \"I have a quick question for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening, hon.\" Jennifer smiled, looking up from her clipboard.<br>\r\n\"I know your policy on drinking on the job is to stay away from alcohol and I agree that it\u2019s a very good policy but what's your policy on drinking my own breast milk?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't mind if you drink some, it is your breast milk after all. So, if anything, you should have first dibs.<br>\r\nWho knows, maybe you could really help sell it by letting our patrons know just how good it really is. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I think since I'm producing so much of it, I might as well drink as much as I can when I'm not on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer couldn't help but grin. \"Why Rena, if I didn't know any better, I'll say that you've must have really thought about what I said last night. Does this mean-\"<br>\r\n\"It does.\" Rena said as she smiled. \"I'm not slowing down the milk guzzling. Besides, I might as well see what it's like to have a big butt. I mean, I'm enjoying my big breasts, so maybe having another extra big asset might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer just shook her head, smiling broadly. \"I wasn't kidding when I said you were a natural. Still, I just have to know out of curiosity, how big are you aiming for?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Rena smiled. \"I'm just letting nature take its course with my breasts and now I'm doing the same for my butt; I think it's more exciting that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena went through her week, the changes to her body were growing even more outrageous. By the time Friday rolled around, Rena was already a ZZ cup, if not a bit bigger depending on what standard of measurement you were using. Each of Rena's breasts were an entire foot and a half in diameter, the pair of orbs stretching a full three feet across from one side to another.<br>\r\nThankfully, Rena's breasts stopped growing by Saturday, though nothing was quite as simple as it used to be. She couldn't drive anymore and cooking anything that involved heat was risking singed fur or scalded nipples. Still, despite the minor inconveniences that came with her jumbo jugs, Rena had fallen in love with her massively large chest. And though there were inconveniences, they were easily overcome. If she needed to get somewhere she'd carpool with a friend or just get a taxi. In the realm of cooking, she was eating out a bit more and, when she did stay at home, she could call up the services of company that rented out chefs to cook in at your home. Kind of like catering but where the company only supplied the cook, you had to provide everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her breasts weren't the only things changing. With all the milk she was drinking (including at the club, where moaning and purring in pleasure every time she took chug seemed to increase sales), Rena was now adding a little meat to her bottom every day. There was minor growth in her hips but surprisingly enough, it actually wasn't enough to keep up with her butt. By the time Saturday rolled around, not only was her rear sticking out almost completely in a bubble butt fashion but it each cheek was a good five inches wide. Margaret could only smile and shake her head. She was still working on the bras and now Rena was giving her more work; not that she minded, as she was developing a rather profitable repeat customer in Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as good as things were for the most part, life did threw one curveball at her. During the week she<br>\r\nwas growing faster than ever, she noticed that some of the neighbors, who previously ignored her as if<br>\r\nshe didn't exist, were starting to glare at her as she left for and came back from work or yoga classes and whenever she happened to be outside.<br>\r\nThey were the glares that highly judgmental people tend to give, the kind of people that thought they knew what was best for everyone because they were just so good and holy and that everyone should follow their example. Those that didn't were heathen sinners and the kind of attitude that was starting to get on Rena's nerves. She had her own life and they could just butt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Rena didn't know was that she was getting on their nerves a thousand times worse and that by<br>\r\nSunday, they had had enough. It had been a beautiful day, warm but not hot with a clear blue sky and<br>\r\nRena just wanted to enjoy the sun. Stepping out of the house in a pair of wide legged, denim shorts and a T-shirt large enough to cover most of her chest, Rena picked a nice spot on her lawn, laid out a towel, and then just laid back to enjoy the warm raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the more diplomatic thing would been to have lain out in the backyard but it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference; they would have just rung the door bell anyways. Eight neighbors came forward, standing in such a way that Rena soon felt an unwelcomed shade upon her. Looking up and raising her sunglasses Rena just looked at the mostly elderly and middle-aged crowd.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but could you take a step to the left; you\u2019re blocking the sun.\" \"Who do you think you are, giving us orders, you harlot?\"<br>\r\nOkay, that was way out of bounds; she was just sunning herself and nicely asked if they could get out of the way and they were the ones picking a fight with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Rena asked as she stood up, feeling her tail starting to twitch. \"What's your problem? I'm just minding my own business. Who do you think you are to talk to me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your business is our business. We're the home owners' association and we want you to leave the neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n\"Leave?!? What for? Sun-bathing?\"<br>\r\n\"You're a bad example for the rest of the neighborhood!\" a short, crotchety old woman said, pointing a shriveled finger. \"Getting...things so big you can't even see past them! I don't know who's more insane, you or the plastic surgeon or made them.\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't have plastic surgery, they're real; I just \tgot bigger is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. What right do you have prancing around with things like that in a neighborhood with children; don\u2019t you understand the harm you could do to them?\"<br>\r\nUp until this point, Rena mostly kept to herself but really, this was the final straw. First they wanted to leave and now they were insulting her curvy body and somehow blaming it on their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" Rena sneered sarcastically. \"Because it would be so bad to have a neighbor with big breasts around. Oh my god, beware the giant boobies! Don't let the kiddies see them!\" And, just to spite them, she grabbed the bottom of her shirt and lifted it up a bit. She barely exposed the bottom of her breasts, and even if she had raised it up further she was wearing her temporary bikini-bra. Still, it was more than enough to shock the crowd, one of them looking like she would have a heart attack any minute at seeing the giant, bouncing orbs.<br>\r\n\"How disgusting! She's like a stripper!\" \"And what if I am?\"<br>\r\nAnd that was the final straw for the crowd. They were briefly stunned by the partial flash but regained their vigor when they heard that little revelation about her personal life.<br>\r\n\"A stripper living in our wholesome neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n\"Should have known; why else would she be going around with a whore's body.\"<br>\r\n\"You have two days; call a moving company and leave or we'll call the cops on you.\" \"On what charges? Being too hot for your taste?\"<br>\r\n\"We'll think of something!\" one of the men shouted before the group left off in a steam, Rena, also in a<br>\r\nbad mood, gathered her towel and stormed into her house, throwing her towel on the couch in frustration.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, with those neighbors of hers it may have only been a matter of time before they changed the home owner agreement to specifically exclude strippers and women with breasts that were too big. People like that in homeowner's associations tended to be a bit crazy in general. They'd force people to get rid of \"offensive lawn decorations\" and other whacky things due to the power of groupthink, and that was just stupid. This... this could be a bit worse. They'd probably come after her with much more vigor than a guy that puts up an ugly, plastic flamingo in his lawn.<br>\r\nFeeling a bit uneasy, Rena dialed a number.<br>\r\n\"Yello, Jasmine Sanders speaking.\"<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Jasmine? It's Rena, I need some help.\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Are you growing again or something?\" \"N-no, my body's fine but...I need some help.\" \"With what? You sound scared.\"<br>\r\n\"I...I am. Some of my neighbors \tthey usually leave me alone but...well, a bunch of them showed up<br>\r\nwhen I was sunbathing and demanded I leave the neighborhood. They told me to move out in two days or they'll call the cops on me. I don't know if they can really force me to leave but...they found out I'm a stripper and... I just a bit worried. I don't know what to do and I know a few of them are gun-owners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I was afraid something like this would happen. Rena, if you had to move away, how hard would it be to leave your house?\"<br>\r\n\"Not hard. I wasn't paid a whole lot at my previous job, so I'm just renting this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...if you were to have all your stuff packed up and have some help unpacking, you could move into a new place right away?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess so. What are you getting at?\" \"You have any plans for today?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll be over in about two hours. Be ready to go and I'd bring your pumps along to.\"<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" Rena said, not sure what Jasmine had planned. The answer came less than two hours later<br>\r\nwhen Jasmine came over, along with several men dressed in uniforms. Predictably, they were stunned by the sight of Rena and her gigantic milk jugs but Jasmine snapped her fingers to get their attention back.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're being paid to work, not ogle the customer. You want to stare, go to the Dancing Cats and pay the admission.\"<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, what's going on? Who are they?\" Rena asked as the crew of men walked into her home.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The packers; we're going to move you out today.\" \"Move!?\"<br>\r\n\"Rena, trust me, sometimes it\u2019s for the best. I used to live in a nice neighborhood just like this once but when my neighbors found out that I was an exotic dancer, they started to give me a lot of grief and it's probably would be worse with your extra-curvy body. I know they can't force you out legally, but they can make your home life a living hell. Sometimes the best thing to do is just leave if that's what they really want.\"<br>\r\n\"But where will I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'd have brought a moving crew with me if I didn't have a place in mind? Now get those pumps of yours in your car and I'll drive you to your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Rena didn't like the idea of moving, she trusted Jasmine's judgment enough to at least see this new place. After all, Jasmine was in the business longer than she was and it seemed like she was footing the bill. Speaking of...<br>\r\n\"Do you need some help paying them or-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Rena. When I was in your situation, Jennifer was kind enough to help me out by paying moving expenses. I'm just passing that kindness to another person in need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than three hours, everything Rena owned was packed up and loaded to a moving van. Jasmine took the keys to Rena's car, the tigress getting into the back as they drove off, with the moving truck following behind.  After a rather short drive a large apartment building came into view. Jasmine pulled Rena's car into a neighboring parking structure while the movers parked on the curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked into the building, Jasmine poking her head into an office on the ground floor before leading Rena upstairs and putting the newly obtained key into the lock of a door. Jasmine opened the door, letting Rena walk in and take a look around.<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of your new apartment?<br>\r\n\"An apartment? Not to sound ungrateful but it sounds like a step down from a house \t\" \"You lose the lawn, but you've got way better neighbors now.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Because, I am your neighbor; I live right next door. Besides, I'd bet this place is about the same size as your house. Now, come over to my place and we'll get your address changed with the post office.\"<br>\r\nSighing just a little bit, Rena followed Jasmine, though walking through the place, Rena could see that it was actually rather classy and well-maintained. In fact, when Rena got to Jasmine's apartment, she was surprised at how big and nice it was.<br>\r\n\"You live in a nice place like this?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you do now too. See, as you can imagine, a lot of us get some grief for being in<br>\r\nour...unconventional occupation. Thankfully, we've found a happy and affordable home right here. In fact, most of us full-timers live right here on this very floor. I live to the right of your apartment, Tina lives to your left, and you could practically knock on any door on this floor and get greeted by a dancer.\"<br>\r\n\"And no one bothers you?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. The owner is a big fan of the Dancing Cats, so he's agreed to rent to us and I think you'll like it<br>\r\nhere. Reliable utilities, sound-proof walls to block out the city noise, house-cleaning included with the rent, and there's a nice garden park on the roof. I sunbathe there myself and you're more than welcome to join me since no one will complain about you up there.\"<br>\r\n\"...this is happening so fast, I mean...I liked my house and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, that place wouldn't be worth the trouble. My old neighbors, when they were trying to get me to leave, did all sorts of stuff. They would call the police on fake charges and even once had them search my entire house claiming I had drugs. They got fined for a bogus call but that didn't keep them from trying anyways. Besides, you'll like it here. We're closer to the Dancing Cats from here, not to mention the yoga place and other stuff and I think having your full-time fellow dancers around will make better neighbors than a bunch of old fogies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll have to admit, I'm not going to miss the glares I got whenever I left the house.\" \"You see? Now come on, you still have addresses and things to update.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena hated to admit it but once she updated her records and let both Jennifer and her chef know about her new pad, Rena couldn't help but feel in better spirits. She, Jasmine, and the other girls who were off that day helped her unpacked and got the place looking comfy and cozy in just a few hours. After going out to something nice to eat at, Jasmine and the other girls took Rena to another of their favorite hang-outs, a nice spa where they had hot tubs, mud baths, steam rooms, and massages. It was just so wonderful and the kind of thing to get her mind off of how bad the morning was. After dinner and saying good night to her \"new\" neighbors, Rena collapsed into her bed. Yeah, it was a very quick and drastic change but she could live like this if she had to. Who knows, maybe it was better this way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days helped prove to Rena that the move was a good decision. With the sound-proof walls, she<br>\r\nwas sleeping even better than before. She actually enjoyed seeing her friends, fellow-dancers, and<br>\r\nneighbors around the apartment complex. She joined in the carpools to work, the others more than happy to give their growing dancer a ride to work, especially since she insisted on giving a few bucks for gas. She'd even joined Jasmine up on the roof, the crimson red head and her sun bathing in total piece, though Rena did think she saw someone watching them through a telescope from the neighboring building.<br>\r\nIn all, it left Rena feeling better not only about her living situation but also her decision to let her body just max itself out in size. Still, before she could step onto the stage that night Jennifer grabbed her shoulder, holding Rena as the others went onto stage.<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, just wanted the bartender to give a special announcement.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay gentlemen...and ladies. It's the moment you've all waited for; Rena and her marvelous milky jugs will be here soon but a brief little announcement. As many of you know and even witnessed, Rena's massive mammary mountains have increased by several cup sizes within a short amount of time.\"<br>\r\nAt this many of the patrons cheered, Rena's fan boys (and girls) being the loudest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, that's apparently not enough for our big, bad, busty dancer. Some of you might have noticed it already but in case you haven't, I'll spell it out for you; Rena's butt is getting larger by the day and she's not going to quit. So give it up, booty lovers, because Rena's looking out for you and just like with her jugs, she's not quitting until her body says enough. She's just crazy like that and she's doing it for you.\"<br>\r\nRena just grinned before Jennifer gave her an encouraging pat on the butt (which really was noticeably larger by now) and she pranced about, being sure to notice who was interested in her bigger bottom and making sure those clusters got the best looks. The crowd was eating it up and many of them were anxious to see how much bigger she could get. After all, she was unbelievably stacked as it was.<br>\r\nIt ended up taking longer to grow her butt than her chest, since it was simply tied to overindulging in her break milk, but finally Rena had a rear to mach her chest. Each butt cheek being an entire foot and a half in diameter and sticking out completely from her thighs in a true bubble butt fashion, Rena couldn't help but be happy to find out that bigger really is always better. Margaret got both her work and casual clothing needs covered and all those yoga classes help keep her flexible. Sure, there were some poses that were just physically impossible with her chest and butt, but what yoga she could do was helping the tigress stay limber, which was really helping her when it came to moving around, getting dressed, and of course stripping down from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for clothing, Rena never really liked anything too feminine, like anything in pastel colors, high heels, or skirts but that was okay because jeans and shorts showed off her butt better anyways and she got shirts that really showed off the contour of her breasts, not to mention she got into the habit of wearing just thongs all the time because they fitted her better and, hey, they were a lot more fun to wear and a whole lot sexier. And then of course there was the club.<br>\r\nRena was really bringing in the business. Club attendance was up significantly when Rena was<br>\r\nappearing. She was the Dancing Cat's hook, the one thing the club had that no other in the world shared. People were coming in to just see this woman with such an unbelievably large body, and those that didn't quite enjoy what they saw were quickly drawn to the other dancers. Rena was bringing fresh blood into the club, and then everyone was enjoying the new increase in patronage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer began to start making sure everyone had a chance to work on a night when Rena was<br>\r\nperforming so they could get a slice of the increased tips being handed out. After all, even if every person in the room was there to see Rena they couldn't all be around Rena's part of the stage at the same time. That and raging hormones meant they would go and enjoy the other dancers, usually being fairly loose with their money. Most everyone liked have Rena \"The Hourglass\" Westfall around, not only because she brought in so much business but also because they became close friends with the voluptuous beauty.<br>\r\nBut even with the club's increased patronage for everyone to enjoy, there were those that weren't<br>\r\ncompletely happy having Rena headlining the club. One night, about three months since she became a stripper, Rena was just sitting in front of her vanity mirror, a chair supporting each of her massive butt cheeks. She had just come in from the club, where she'd been serving her chilled, straight from the tit milk and brushing her hair for her next appearance on stage.  Rena noticed the door to the changing room open, a few other dancers coming in before the door was shut. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary until the four girls crowded around her.<br>\r\n\"So, you're getting to be pretty popular, huh, fat ass?\"<br>\r\nRena stopped brushing her hair and set the brush down. That...didn't sound nice. Sure, the other girls<br>\r\ngave her nicknames like \"Hourglass Rena\" or \"Double Duty\" or \"Curvy Cutie\" and Jennifer still gave Rena little pinches or smacks on her big bottom but they were done in friendship, love, and celebration of her strange sexiness. Fat ass was just plain mean.<br>\r\n\"Is...is there a problem?\" Rena asked, not sure the appropriate way to respond. \"Yeah, who the hell are you stealing our thunder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"We're getting sick of you taking away the business.\"<br>\r\n\"But Jennifer keeps telling me that attendance has increased 217% since I...\"<br>\r\n\"Get up, you slut!\" One girl yelled, two of the four jealous dancers grabbing Rena by the arms and hauling her out of her chair, which was a bit harder for someone with such a massive body. Then, without warning, one of the girls socked Rena right in the gut, making the tigress flop over onto the ground as she held her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while Rena was in little position to defend herself, the four girls began to wail on her. They were kicking at her breasts and butt, probably the best place for them to be kicking but it still hurt. Rena, knowing she couldn't get up fast enough to fight back, just covered her face and head and prayed that it would get over quickly.<br>\r\nTina, the African American quarter cat with leopard spots on her normal, human skin, had come into the Dancing Cats about that same time, needing to get changed and start her shift. The four attackers didn't notice the door open, nor did they notice Tina bolt away towards backstage, running up in the middle of the current performance and grabbing Jasmine by the arm.<br>\r\n\"Rena's getting attacked.\" She said, quietly so the patrons wouldn't hear. Still, Jasmine's eyes flashed as she and Tina ran for the changing rooms. The other girls saw their sudden departure, most running after them and leaving the audience wondering just what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the dancers went to get Jennifer, but Jasmine and Tina went straight for the dressing room. They bolted through the door, Tina plowing into and knocking a few of the other dancers off Rena while Jasmine shoved the remaining two. The pair then put themselves in front of Rena, glaring daggers as they got ready to defend their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, that bitch needs to learn her place.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN HERE!?!\" Jennifer bellowed from the changing room door, making most if not all the dancers in the room jump and probably startling a few of the patrons out front. She then rushed over to Rena, who was just starting to pull herself off the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You four are fired.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't just fire us, we've got contracts and I've been a full-timer for three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I can't. Read your contracts; I can immediately dismiss you if, at any time while you are on<br>\r\ncompany property, you engage in any illegal act. You just assaulted Rena, and while I'll let her decided whether or not to press charges I, for one, do not want to see any one of you in my club again.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem in here?\" A male voiced asked, the club's bouncer Gerald poking his head in from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Gerald, get Harvey back here and escort these whores out of my club.\"<br>\r\n\"What about our stuff?\" One girl asked as Gerald slipped back into the hall, calling up the other bouncer Harvey.<br>\r\n\"If you don't want me to throw it away, get it now. And, while you're at it, get out of MY costumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, a bit scared of Jennifer at the moment, did as they were told. They got undressed and then quickly grabbed all their things out of the vanity stations. A few had even started to put on their street clothes when Gerald and Harvey came back. The pair were easily able to grab hold of all four girls, dragging them towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait.\" One struggled, \"We're not even decent!\"<br>\r\n\"That's a hell of an understatement.\" Jasmine snapped.<br>\r\n\"You can get dressed in the parking lot, but you aren't spending one more minute in my club.\" Jennifer said, following her bouncers to the back door and watching as all four women were pushed out. They all looked back, most in nothing but some underwear as Jennifer glared them down one final time and then slammed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want them black listed. They don't even get in the front door.\" Jennifer said, walking back towards the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Gerald offered, he and Harvey heading back out to their posts in the front of the club. Back in the dressing room the rest of the dancers had helped Rena up, sitting the tigress in her two chairs while Jasmine looked over Rena, making sure she wasn't bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Rena? Did you get hurt?\" Jennifer asked as she came back into the changing room.<br>\r\n\"Just a few bruises and scratches; I'll be fine, my clothes and the jacket I borrowed from the costume room was hurt more than me. Anyways, I need to get out to the stage and-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not after that. Profits and performances are nowhere near as important as the safety and health of my girls. Tina, can you drive Rena back to the apartments, since you're the only one still in your street clothes?\"<br>\r\nThe quarter cat woman nodded, \"I'll go pull my car up to the back door.\" \"But...the show-\"<br>\r\n\"Can wait until tomorrow. Don't worry, our patrons are more understanding than you think and if<br>\r\nexperience has taught me anything, they\u2019ll give you more than double the tips when you do come back. Come on, hon, let's get you and your lovingly large assets home to rest.\"<br>\r\nRena couldn't help but smile a bit; that was one reason she loved working for the Dancing Cats, Jennifer really had a relationship style of management and really cared about her dancers. Getting dressed in something slightly more concealing, Rena followed Jennifer outside to Tina's car. Jennifer, in the end, even decided to ride along with the pair back to the apartment, walking with Rena up to her unit while Tina ran ahead to unlock the door.<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm really sorry about the girls. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have to fire them and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want to employ anyone that would do what they did, I'm just sorry you had to get hurt before I could give them the boot. Those four have always been a little bit on the demanding side and the only reason I didn't get rid of them sooner was because I lacked a good excuse to. Now take it easy and I'll see you tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jennifer; it's been wonderful working for you.\"<br>\r\n\"And it's been a blast to have such a talented, voluptuous dancer on my staff. And really, don't worry about the other girls. Exotic dancing has its turnovers like any other job and just give me a few days or weeks at most and I'll find four or five more girls who won't be the least intimated by you or your lovely, hyper-sexualized body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helps to still have an eye for the same team, huh?\" Rena smirked. Jennifer just laughed and nodded her head with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always.\"<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your husband doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it just gives us more things to talk about. In fact, I don\u2019t even get mad if he stares at other women, because, chances are, I\u2019m gawking myself.\u201d<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t help but laugh; Jennifer was by far her most interesting boss she ever had. \u201cGood night, Rena.\" Jennifer said, offering Rena a hug.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Jennie, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gave Rena a hug as well before the pair left to get back to the club. Rena, after poking at a few of her sore spots, decided that she just wanted to go to bed. So, after chugging some of her own milk Rena peeled out of her clothes, put on her night bra with the tubes for her milk, and the curled up in her bed for a good night's sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more months, a half year after she had started dancing, Rena was in high spirits as usual. She had a job she absolutely loved and Jennifer managed to find five new dancers that were eager to perform alongside Rena \"The Hourglass\" Westfall.  Rena was in such a good mood in fact, she decided to leave for work a little bit early, deciding to walk down to the dancing cats instead of catching a ride like she usually did.<br>\r\nThe streets were a bit empty at this time of the day. Still, as she was walking, she noticed two ladies and Rena couldn't help but sigh. She knew the type, women that didn't just talk but talked ALL the time and therefore usually didn't watch where they were going. Rena might be an excellent dancer but sidewalks are a bit narrow and she didn't have the kind of body made for dodging anymore. Rena stood still and braced herself for the impact.<br>\r\nJust as she thought, the two ladies didn't even know Rena was there until they both ran into one of her breasts, which to say the least was rather shocking for the two and they couldn't help but stare at her as they walked on by. Rena didn't say or do anything or even showed any sign of emotion and simply tried to read the two ladies. They barely walked eight feet away when they were talking loudly without any attempt to keep Rena from hearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, did you see the size of her ass?!?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was just as big as those breasts of hers. Have plastic surgeons gone insane?\" \"She looks like a porn star!\"<br>\r\nAs Rena continued walking she couldn't help but laugh out loud; a porn star? Her? Well, maybe she did have the body for it but she still couldn't picture herself like that...though it was an amusing concept.<br>\r\nAmusing thoughts aside, Rena reached the club and did her usual routine of pre-filling glasses of milk before getting dressed for her night on the stage. The club was busy as usual, mostly guys but even a few girls. It had been a little strange at first, but Rena couldn't deny she was starting to enjoy the few female voices in the audience. After all, it just meant she was sexy enough for both men and women. Rena soon got down to just her thong, which since a few weeks ago was a bit different than your standard thong. Margaret overheard Rena making a complaint in her store that while she was getting more tips than ever in her giant cleavage, she wasn't getting the tips she used to in her thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret thought about it and, after taking Rena to a dressing room explained that her big butt made it<br>\r\ndifficult to reach up there where the strap was, especially when she was up on stage. Now that Rena had a stable butt size, she made a special thong for her. It was mostly normal but right in the middle of the back side running side to side to the front and back was an extra string, very small but strong enough to follow the curve of her rear without squeezing or pinching it. All in all, it fitted Rena's big bubble butt like a glove and it gave patrons an easier place to give her tips and soon Rena was making more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, tonight was when one patron got a little too close and personal. Rena was doing double duty near the edge of the stage. On one side she was rubbing, squeezing, and holding her breasts out for a bunch of milk junkies while making sexy noises, the patrons eagerly placed tips deep between her cleavage. In the back, she shook her butt to some big booty lovers where generous tipper slipped dollar bills in the more accessible money string. However, one guy got a little too excited and proceeded to lean on the stage and placed two palms on her rear, squeezing as much as he could hold on to with just two hands. Rena, a bit shocked by the sudden touch, bolted up, and yelped a little and looked back. It had all but killed the mood, the other patron backing off. The music stopped, as did the other dancers, and stared in either shock or pity. Rena herself froze and wore a small frown on her face.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't Gerald, this guy was actually a bit shorter and had a little bit of belly fat but when you saw his arms and chest, you knew that underneath he was pure muscle everywhere and was almost just as strong.<br>\r\n\"Don't touch the ladies unless you're tipping.\" he said as he dragged the guy away before giving him to Gerald to take care of. Rena got up and walked away a bit, not bothering to pick up her stripped clothes and crossed her arms beneath her breasts. Many people were sad, afraid their favorite dancer was going to leave early when she suddenly placed her hands on the sides of her rear, tilted her hips to one side, and grinned at the direction of the bar where the music system was at in addition to the other equipment.<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop the music, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted as the music and light show came back on, the other girls resumed their dancing, and Rena began to play with the pole a bit before she went back to showing off and collecting tips, which actually increased greatly compared to before the grope, as if they were trying to apologize for the unexpected incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the shift, Rena popped in to Jennifer's office, when she was surprised to see her in the arms of a cat man. His fur was mostly black, with green eyes and a white lower jaw, white hands, and, if she could see beneath his clothes, a white strip on his flat belly and white feet, not to mention a tail that was strangely striped with white and black. The two were French kissing and giving each other heavy petting as Jennifer occasionally stroked his ghostly white hair.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, am I interrupting something?\u201d<br>\r\nNot the least bit ashamed or stunned, the two looked at Rena with smiles. \u201cHello, Rena, I would like to introduce you to Isaac Aston, my husband.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice to meet you, Rena, and I must say, I\u2019m very impressed. I thought my Pepper was exaggerating about your figure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPepper?\u201d Rena asked. Jennifer and Isaac placed their heads together, Jennifer pointing to their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSalt and Pepper.\u201d She smiled, making Rena chuckle a bit, not to mention being relieved to see that Jennifer wasn\u2019t cheating on her husband, which, until now, Rena didn\u2019t have the pleasure of meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be taking off, if that's okay with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, but are you okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine. The guy just got a little too personal, that\u2019s all. Besides, I went back to dancing, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I have to admit teasing the audience was a nice touch. Even I thought you wanted to take a break after that little incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly thought you were.\u201d Isaac commented. \"Speaking of which, could I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Jennifer said, quickly pulling up another chair next to the other one so Rena could sit down comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering about the club's policy when it comes to touching between patrons and dancers. I mean, they kind of have to in order to slip a bill in my thong or place a few between my breasts.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, the short answer is that it\u2019s all about context. For example, a man's-\u201d \u201cOr lady's.\u201d Isaac offered, making Jennifer smirk a little bit all too knowingly.<br>\r\n\u201cHand will eventually brush against you when they slip a bill in your thong or secure a tip in your jugs<br>\r\nwithout it slipping out. This is considered natural and necessary when tipping. The problem is when they try other kinds of touching, mainly a grope that has nothing to do with tipping. Finally, there is dancer-educed touching. For example, some clubs encourage their dancers to perform lap dances. For the sake of safety, we generally don't have that since its greater encouragement for a patron to touch a dancer inappropriately  That and since our stages are higher than other clubs a dancer would have to get down into the patron area to give a lap dance, and I prefer my girls staying up on stage where it's safer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\tif it was possible on an individual level, it would be okay here, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\tare you trying to suggest something?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I had an idea that might increase the bottom line with very little cost and might increase traffic, that is, if you think it\u2019s okay.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" Jennifer said as Isaac rubbed a shoulder and listened just as eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena decides to hold a sort of lottery for the audience of the Dancing Cats. The winner gets to come up on stage with Rena, and gets five minutes to grope Rena's breasts and butt to their heart's content. If they're lucky, Rena might even let them drink her milk straight from the tap, if you get my drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Same as above, except the winner get a lapdance from Rena, dressed in a police outfit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition written by Nameless One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later there was a special event going on at the Dancing Cats. All patrons were promised was that by purchasing a twenty-dollar envelope, something special would happened that involved Rena. Needless to say, the club actually managed to sell out each envelope and the patrons were told not to open them until instructed to. That's when Rena stepped on the stage dressed in a fake police officer uniform. It was pretty good and custom tailored to fit her, though it covered her entire body. Of course, there was a good reason. Not only was it very tight and revealed every one of her curves, but it made the end result all the more exciting when she stripped everything off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Officer Rena Westfall and you're all under suspicion of being the winner in a contest. Open your envelopes and raise your hand if you have the black card, everyone else, hold on to your cards and envelopes for recollection, please.\"<br>\r\nEveryone opened their card but only one person could win this contest. A shy, thin man held up his card while other people looked at him with either minor envy or anticipation at what the lucky bastard won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now come up here on the stage.\" Rena ordered as she pointed with her night stick to some temporally steps placed next to the stage. He obeyed, letting Rena set up her next order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down in the chair.\" She demanded, the chair in question being without arm rests and the back facing the pole. He obeyed without question and Rena moved to place some handcuffs on him, his arms painlessly pinned behind the chair and pole. They were fake handcuffs, of course, and could be unlocked simply by pressing a button on the side. Still, they were both for fun, went with the theme, and were for her safety as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the right to remain\u2026horny. Anything you see can and will arouse you and could possibly give you a raging hard-on. You have the right to enjoy my giant breasts and butt. If you want a close-up of either of them, they will be appointed for you free of charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a saucy tune started playing and everyone began to cheer as they grinned and realized what was happening. The lucky guy was getting a lap dance and they got a great view of the show. And of course, Rena made sure to put a lot more swing into her sways, to make sure both the lucky winner and the audience got great views of her breasts and butt. This being a spectator lap dance, Rena started to strip down a bit faster, if only so that she didn't bore the audience or make the guy sit in the hard metal chair for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the man still got the best views. Rena took off her jacket and top in front of him, then raised her butt quite close to his face as she slowly inched her pants off. That's when she kicked it up a notch, both for the bashful pleasure of the guy and the joyous cheers of the audience, and for the very reason she asked about the touching policy in the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena got her butt quite close to the guy's lap, not enough to sit on him, but enough that her butt was<br>\r\nresting on and brushing against his lap while her tail played with his face and chin. Then she got up close and personal as she grabbed the sides of her breasts and gently rubbed them against the side of the man's head, him being stuck in part of her cleavage for a bit. The big finale, however, came when Rena whispered into his ears to open up his hands and keep his palms flat. Rena then sauntered around the to his back, and got her butt right against his hands and rubbed it up and down, allowing him to feel the contours of her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience grew wild at this point and soon Rena took the cuffs off. The man, blushing and obviously a little turned on, offered a forty dollar tip, but after all of that he wasn't sure where to place it. Rena again drove the audience wild when she gently grabbed his hand and placed it deep between her two breasts, squeezing gently to signal him to let go while he just blushed ever more as she gave him a friendly wink. After the man walked back down to the main floor, Rena began collecting tips for what was otherwise a very entertaining show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't fret if you didn't win, because I have a bit of an announcement; Officer Rena will be arresting three more people tonight, and since we're shuffling the deck again, you best get in line for the next show. And if you think it's not worth the gamble, think again. Officer Rena will be appearing once a week from now on, so tell your friends, let them know...that sometimes being arrested isn't always a bad thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Officer Rena stunt was a big hit, every patron eager and hopeful they would be the next lucky one to be arrested and be read their lap dance rights. Rena was a bit stunned one time when a woman actually won but while she would have rather performed for a man, she still gave the lucky lady a good show and touching session and was rewarded with a very generous tip for her trouble. People began asking, sending e-mails, even some paper letters if any other \"officers\" would show up. That, of course, was up to the discretion of the girls but Jennifer would let them know, something to think about since it would undoubtedly make their fans very, very happy.<br>\r\nWith practice and time the Officer routine became a corner stone of Rena's performance at the Dancing Cats. She was drawing people in specifically for that opportunity, and the increased attendance was pushing the club to its capacity. All the girls were happily reporting an increase in their tips and Jennifer couldn't help smile wider and wider as the club's end of the week profits grew larger and larger. In all, Rena didn't know how she had been able to stay at her old, data entry job as long as she did. It was boring and monotonous. Being a dancer, however, just struck some chords with Rena. The attention, the cat calls. Admittedly, there were only so many ways you could be sexy on stage but even as she began to use some common poses and positions during her performance Rena didn't feel like she was actually working. It was never quite the same because the audience was never quite the same. You had to cater to the people watching you, which kept Rena on her toes as she learned to constantly watch and read the audience.<br>\r\nSitting in the back of a cab, Rena couldn't help but smile. She didn't know why she was so reminiscent today, thinking about everything that had happened. Maybe it was that thing Jasmine said earlier, about how far she had come. It was actually weird, Jasmine was the only one she saw around the apartments that morning, and she only saw her long enough to really get a message that Jennifer wanted her at the club early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena wasn't against going into work early, but despite the fact the employee parking area was full she couldn't find anyone in the club's back areas. Jennifer and Isaac weren't in their offices and none of the girls were in the changing room, bathroom, or costume room. Wondering where everyone was at, Rena mindlessly opened the door to the patron area, wondering if Jennifer was restocking the bar or something. It was really dark, but before Rena could feel for a light switch the lights clicked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Everyone shouted, making Rena jump about half a foot in the air, her breasts bouncing from the sudden jolt and almost making Rena loose her balance. Still, she recovered and then smiled, both happy and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's going on?\" Rena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do this for all the girls at the right times.\" Jennifer explained as she strolled up closer to Rena. \"Congratulations, Rena, it's been exactly one year since you joined the Dancing Cats family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena could only laugh and shake her head. One year? Already? Yeah, that sounded about right, it being January 27, 2009, a full year at the Dancing Cats to the date, but it still surprised her; she guessed time really does fly when you're having fun, especially at your job, no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have cake and snacks, \"Jennifer said, motioning to the tables filled with food, \"but we seemed to run out of milk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just rolled her eyes and she swayed her way to the bar; no wonder Jennifer asked her to come in \"full\". It was no secret among the staff, most of the girls dared each other to try Rena's breast milk and, surprisingly, all of them actually liked the taste. They didn't drink it nearly as much as Rena; she was the big butt beauty around here. Still, it was a nice treat to have on occasion, and at a big discount no less. Today, however, the drinks were free as Rena, Jennifer, and Isaac served up several cold glasses of the taboo drink and congratulations and cheers were passed around.<br>\r\nAfter some chit-chatting, munching on the food, and lots of laughs, Jennifer tapped her glass, signaling she had something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'm glad you are enjoying yourselves but I have a few announcements to make. Now, as you know, in the short time Rena has been here, attendance at the Dancing Cats has more than doubled and is steadily increasing all the time. It seems we stumbled into the perfect market strategy. We have our big, beautiful tigress who is so out there and unique that she draws in customers like a magnet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls clapped, Rena blushing a bit from being brought up in such a company speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't think it's all Rena. She's our hook, but its all of you working together that turns those new<br>\r\ncustomers into repeat business. We have a girl for every kind of guy, from the modest petit to the beyond belief hourglass, and as most of you know we've had a line outside the club every night the past few weeks.\"<br>\r\n\"In all, the Dancing Cats is on the rise and, after going over the figures with my dear husband, I am now happy to announce that the Dancing Cats is trading up.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Trading up?\" a girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, to a new building, a better building.\u201d Isaac explained, moving over beside his wife and hooking his arm around her waist. \u201cThis place has been good to us but with all the business Rena has been bringing in, we're starting to get a little too crowded. Don't worry, ladies, I think you'll like the new place. It's much bigger all around with, newer facilities, in a nicer part of town, and of course, it's actually within walking distance of that apartment complex many of you live in. Construction is almost complete, so we'll soon be in a bigger, better Dancing Cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some applause and cheers from the girls but Jennifer tapped her glass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have another announcement to make. I'm sure many of you remember Candy.\" Jennifer said, and most of the girls grew solemn hearing that name. \"For those who don't know, she was a full timer that was here before Rena showed up and was one of our best dancers; unfortunately, she did something stupid and was caught with some crack in the public bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I fired her with a clean conscience but she recently contacted me and was asking for work again. I was a little wary but I did promise to consider rehiring her if she cleaned up her act, and, well, she really did in fact. She checked into rehab shortly after I fired her and has been clean for several months now; she even sent me a copy of the doctor's report saying so. She's a bit desperate for work now after a year and I guess I'm just a softie, so I have hired her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe will begin performing for us full time again at the new club when it's finished but she and I have an understanding that if she does drugs again that wasn\u2019t prescribed to her by a doctor, she won't have a third chance with us. So when the new club is open, I want you to be nice to her and don't bring up the past unless you want to wish her congratulations. It's not easy to overcome drug addictions and saying something to upset her might only push her back to the edge. So, forget the past and lets all look forward to a fun, profitable future at the new Dancing Cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded their head and Jennifer smiled as Isaac began to speak again. \"Great; now then, ladies, I believe we're still celebrating Rena's one year anniversary with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: After the move to the new club, Rena is approached with an offer by a pharmaceutical scientist. He offers her an experimental procedure, which will make her skin stretchy and rubber like, as well as attaching valves to certain parts of her body. This will allow Rena to fill herself with gases, such a helium, to increasee her curves even further, or deflate them when she wishes. Remembering Jennifer's advice that bigger is better, Rena accepts the offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Same as above, except it's one of the other dancers at the club who accepts the surgery, jealous of Rena's success, sparking a rivalry between the two.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She springs up, and grabs the phone, desperate for anything to break her bland day.\"Hello?\" Rena asks, trying to control her desperation.It's Rena's friend Mia. \"Hi, Rena! You'l never guess what I found! It'll make your boobs HUGE! I was just playing around in my lab, and some formula splashed on me. I can remix it for you, and we can have a boobie party!\"This was perfect! Exactly what Rena wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sounds like fun! 'll be over in a minute!\"\"Sure, I'll see you soon!\" Mia said, just as cheerful as Rena, and hung up. Rena, dressed in bored clothes like sweatpants and a somewhat loose T-shirt, was dressed perfectly for the occassion. She didn't grab anything on the way out, and rushed to her friends house. It was only a couple blocks away, but Rena couldn't get there fast enough.Within minutes she was to Mia's house. She knocked rapidly on the door, and almost immediatly, the door opened. For a moment, Rena didn't recognise the person who had answered the door. But, their boobs were huge! Then, the person spoke, and Rena imediatly hugged the walking pair of boobs.It was her friend Mia, of course! Her thick blue-black hair flows down to her mid back, and her large librarian glasses hung down her nose, accenting her blue-green eyes and small, black puma ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing her usual tan cargo pants, but her white tank top had been discarded for a baggy sweatshirt. Rena had seen her wear it before, but it fit much better then. Now, it was stretched taut over a pair of grapefruit-size breasts.Rena squealed, seeing her friend. \"So, how are they?\"This wasn't a first. Mia had found other chemicals that had similar effects, but this was easily the most effective and dramatic.\"They're great! They're very firm, but they don't ache, and they're very light for their size! But if this lasts too much longer, I'm going to have a sore back.\" Mia explained.Rena pushed her way into Mia's house. Mia was used to this, and generally just let Rena run around. She closed the door and followed Rena into her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's living room was very clean, mainly because she barely spent any time there. On the table, though, was a tray, with two tiny glasses and a large jug of a mysterious looking, cloudy, blue liquid floating in the clear plastic.Rena sat down on a couch facing the table, and Mia sat down next to her.\"Anything I should know? some of your other experiments had unusual side effects, and I don't want caught off gaurd like that time with the tomatoe...\"Mia shivered. \"Don't worry, this isn't anything like that. This is purely what I said. It makes your boobs huge. I got about as much as one of these glasses on me, so I thought we'd start off with that.\"Rena nodded, and poured them both drinks. Rena raised her glass and called, \"Cheers!\" Mia raised her glass, cheered, and they chugged their drinks.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't much, but considering she was flat as a board before, it was a start! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't all. Her chest continued to expand, growing into C cup, CC cup, D cup... By this point, she could actually hold each breast in one hand. They kept on growing until they also reached grapefruit size, stretching her shirt out a little.\"Oh...oh, wow! This is awesome, Mia!\" Rena exclaimed with joy as she gently ran her hands under her breasts, feeling their slight weight. \"...Mia?\"When Rena looked up, she saw Mia struggling to keep herself decent with her own basketball-sized breasts. Rena was so captivated by her own growth that she didn't notice that Mia burst though her sweatshirt and the bra underneath.\"I-if you just excuse me for a second.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia stuttered, blushing. She excused herself from the wrong, probably to find something that could cover her now massive breasts.Rena watched her leave and got to thinking herself. Mia was already busty when she opened the door and now she was huge! Yet Rena was still small by comparison. She didn't like that thought much, so she poured herself another glass and waited the results.And they came. Rena cupped her hands on her chest as they started to grow. She could feel her chest pressing against her shirt, getting larger, making the shirt tighter and tighter, until a tear formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts continued to expand until the tear was a large hole with two basketballs of breasts hanging out. Rena couldn't help blushing herself but at the same time, filled with excitement.After rubbing them to make sure they were real, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

But, some situations were too much for her...Including leaving a breast crazed catgirl alone with a gallon of breast enhancing chemicals.Rena waited serenely for the first ten minutes Mia was gone. It was understandable; with basketball sized breasts, one may need some new clothes, maybe even some 'alone time'. Rika was even beginning to feel that need, her new nipples hardening with every slight movement of Rena's soft fur. She easily restrained herself, and focussed instead on the bottle on the table. Amazing, that only two shots could take Rena from zero to this. She would have to find out exactly what Mia was doing when she had discovered this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next 20 minutes were not as easy. Rena sat there, her massive breasts beginning to grow cold, her nipples just starting to get sore from being hard too long, and Rena was not easily staying a happy camper. The bottle on the table had begun to taunt her. 'Only two shots? Pft, weak. Think of just one more..or maybe two...or three... I see you are thinking about it, your nipples are hard again.' it seemed to mock, in her head.Finally, almost exactly 25 minutes after Mia had left, Rena broke. She hefted the jug, feeling it's weight, gauging it's contents. About...half should make up for the wait. Taking a deep breath, and one last grope of her basketball breasts, she bid goodbye to the land of inches equipment and hello to the world of feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe upended the bottle, and chugged for what seemed like a parched eternity, and was only a few seconds.The effects were quicker this time, her body now familiar with the chemical, and they were intense. Rena had hardly let out a very satisfied sigh and slammed the now half-empty container on the table, before her breasts blossomed out of her shirt, which fell almost immediately to tatters on the floor. They grew past 2 feet rapidly, and Rena considered getting off the couch before it broke. She decided not to, and instead laid down on her side, her head resting on her hand, gazing in rapt attention to her swelling bosom.Her terrific tits swelled, still almost seeming to gain speed, past 3 feet, the flesh seeming to simply increase in size, with all the proper additions. Her nipples grew proportionately, about an inch longer, and half an inch wider, for each horizontal foot of boobflesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quite firm, though, and were almost as tall as they were wide.Rena assessed all this through a somewhat clear mind. Her anger at Mia had subsided, and the growing breasts were pleasing, but not overpowering. She watched as dispassionately as possible, inside almost bouncing with glee, as her breasts slowly climbed onto the floor. when her nipples touched down, she shuddered with sudden sensation. The cold wood floor shocked her system, and her nipples came to full, textured attention, pushing against the floor valiantly for a moment, before the wave of soft, newly-enhanced Rena overwhelmed them.However, there was a new observer now. Mia watched, hidden behind the doorway, as Rika's new assets began to make her couch creak with strain. Her own, sizeable breasts grew tense with envy at the sight, and it upset her almost as much as what she had been away finding as this happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would break the news to Rena as soon as the stolen elixir's effects had come to as much of a halt as they ever would...This didn't take far to long. Rena's tits lost momentum as quickly as they had gained it, coming to a 5 point stop at 5 feet in width, 4 in height, with nipples to make a cucumber jealous. By now, Rena was content to play with them in her imagination, hardly noticing Mia enter the room, her cheeks puffed slightly in childish fury.\"Well, I hope you're satisfied. I'm sure you'll be just as happy in a second...\" Mia huffed. Rena jumped slightly, the actions mellowing into a shiver of pleasure as her breasts jiggled with her, sending tiny prickles of pleasure over her massive, orange breasts. \"Oh, just try to bring me down now...\" Rena replied, drunk on the pleasing sensations of her furry pillows.\"\"Fine, I will try you. Since you drank half the jug, now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition originally by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Rena asked, having trouble processing what Mia had just said.\"You heard me. Your breasts may never stop growing. This compound is experimental and , according to all of our scientists, it gets more powerful the more is taken into the body. The chemical kicks your body's hormones and cell growth into overdrive, and in our animal tests the more of the substance they drank the more likely their breasts would get stuck in a cycle. Some stopped, but some of our test animals' breasts didn't stop growing. We had to put them down because they were just getting to big to contain.Rena stared at Mia for a few moments, her mind lost. Her higher mind was in shock, wondering if what Mai had said was true. Still, deep in Rena's subconsciouses, something else was billowing. It was a wish, a hope that Mia was right, that her breasts would continue to grow forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as her higher mind continued to think through the situation Rena shook her head and said, \"But they've stopped.\"\"I can explain that,\" Mai countered, her basketball size breasts bouncing as she got closer to Rena. For a moment the two hugely endowed girls just stood beside each other, Mia looking over Rena before she reached out and gently flicked Rena's breasts. Rena quivered at Mai's touch, the vibration in her breasts sending pleasure coursing through her blood. Still, as Rena took a few deep breaths to counter the wave of pleasure she looked down and saw her breasts were starting to grow again, gaining another foot in width and half a foot in height.\"If your body becomes still, the compound becomes inactive. Still, even the slightest motion sets the compound back in motion and its only a matter of time before you have to move to go to eat, drink or go to the bathroom.\"Rena began panicking, but even her quickening breathing was making her breasts swell slightly. Even with her subconscious begging her to move, to rub her breasts until they were the size huge beach volleyballs, Rena forced down the desires and asked. \"Please, Mia, help me...\"Mia grumbled, mindlessly scratching her basketball breasts and tauting Rena further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There is a counter-compound at the office, but I can't get to it until tomorrow. So, we need to get you home without agitating your breasts. I can bring you the compound tomorrow after work.\"\"Oh thank you Mai...\"\"I'm not done Rena,\" Mia interrupted, moving over to the table where the bottle of breast growth solution was sitting. \"I asked you to wait for me. We could have gone on safely but you got impatient. So, if you want my help your going to have to pay the consequences. Drink the rest of the bottle.\"Rena swallowed hard, her mouth becoming dry, \"What...\"\"Drink the rest of the bottle, or I won't bring you the compound for a week. That's a week where every single motion, be it eating or taking a shower, your breasts will grow bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weeks a long time Rena, and I'm sure your breasts will grow bigger in a week with this dosage than a few hours with the whole bottle. Besides, you don't have to do it all at once. If you drink the rest while I'm taking you home then the only growth you'll have to worry about is the compounds immediate effects. The effects of growth by motion, which you would have to endure walking or riding home, would be much worse than the rest of this bottle.\"Rena swallowed the knot in her throat, but it just didn't seem to stay down. Even if she was ready to try and test herself for a week, the thoughts in the back of her mind had become to great. With a few words to Mia, agreeing to her difficult terms, Rena took the bottle, her breasts swelling even from the movement of her arm. She held the bottle, looking down at its addictive liquid as she said, \"All right, here we go.\"With that Rena took a gulp of the liquid, she began to feel the effects, but before she could see how much her breasts had swollen Mia had helped her off the couch, quickly whisking Rena away to her car. Rena sat in the back, taking a gulp of the breast enlarging liquid whenever she saw its effects were coming to a stop.At the start Rena had sat in the back of Mia's car, her breasts supported on her thighs and jiggling as the car bounced. Still, with each gulp her breasts swelled, growing larger and larger as they began to fill the back of Mia's car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts began to spill over Rena's thighs, becoming like a pair of inflating beach balls that continued to grow in her lap.Finally, after a long drive and reaching the end of the bottle, Mia got Rena into her house and to her bedroom. Rena lay sprawled in the middle of her large, queen sized bed. A breast laid on each side of her, each one almost six feet across and seven feet high, a huge bust line that was bigger than most people. Rena looked over her huge breasts then up to Mia pitifully.\"Just stay perfectly still and try to go to sleep. At the very worst you'll get a little bigger during the night, but not enough to put you in danger. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.\" With that Mia turned and left, still fuming over the fact that she hadn't had a chance to enjoy the breast growth serum properly. Still, basketball sized breasts would be fun, especially considering her boyfriend would be coming over a little later. He would have a nice surprise waiting, and that was enough to bring a smile to Mia's face.\u00a0Rena listened, hearing Mia close the front door before she looked back at her massive breasts. They were huge, the size of a person, and yet in the back of her mind Rena felt something building. it was an urge, a desire to make her breasts bigger. She wanted to rub them, do jumping jacks, anything to make them jiggle and move until they were so large she wouldn't be able to move. Still, Rena remembered what Mia said. She would have to last till tomorrow afternoon.</span></div></div>",

However, it seemed to be as enraptured with Rena's breasts as much as she herself. Rena listened, perfectly still, for Mia's car to drive off, then immediately began to explore them. the slight movement of her arms on her soft flesh caused them to begin to grow again. The slow feeling was beginning to turn her on, yet it also made her want more. She could make it faster...She began to massage harder and faster, amplifying the effect. They grew before her eyes, the flesh billowing over her legs soon as her assets suddenly gained volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she would have a hard enough time fitting through her door tomorrow, but couldn't resist the strange, new sensation. Just as she said that, however, she decided to sit cross-legged, to keep her from going numb. This sudden shift caused her entire breasts to move, and the feeling of her breasts, which must have weighed more than 100 pounds each, moving that much sent her over her edge.With a sudden inspiration, she stood up on the bed, her breasts moving to accommodate her, then she laid on top of them, her arms and legs extended as far as they could go. With some adjustment, made slower by the pleasure now sweeping through her entire chest and body, she was able to get her entire body on top of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she moved her arms and legs in a fashion similar to making snow angels as a child. Now, however, the actions made her feel divine, as her arms and legs, and even her slightly wiggling torso caused her massive mammaries to grow larger and larger, and she would even feel herself rising ever so slowly off her bed.She stopped after about 5 solid minutes of squirming, catching her breath and repositioning herself. However, she still didn't feel like she was doing all she could for her feline fun pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood on her bed again, and heard it creak slightly as she moved. She climbed off it, and observed the effects her work had provided so far...If nothing else, they were impressive. They stood a full 9 feet in the air now, and nearly that wide. she was thankful that her bedroom had an extra high ceiling in that moment, because she knew she would need as much space as possible in the coming time...\"Now, what can I do to make them even bigger...\" she said under her breath An idea hit her with the force of her breasts. She could take them out back for more room, through the sliding doors, and...</span></div></div>",

Since you drank half the jug, now I'm going to have to top you, with interest!\" Mia said, sitting in the chair opposite of Mia, while grabbing the jug and proceeded to guzzle the contents. Mia sat back and unhooked her make-shift top and sat there while her breasts started expanding and continued to grow until they covered the whole of her lap and threatened to touch the floor. Rena waited until she was sure Mia's growth stopped before asking the obvious.\"You said you were going to top me with interest, yet you're no bigger than I am.\" Rena said, lowering one ear down in confusion and tilting her head.Mia let out a good laugh, causing her breasts to wiggle ever so slightly before speaking.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rena, Rena, Rena, you're very smart but not quite as smart as I am; you should know better than to doubt the words of a genius. When I said I was going to 'top you with interest', I meant I was going to beat you, and there is more than one way to win.\" she said, holding two strange injection needles and proceeded to stick both breasts with them. Rena stared with anticipation.\"Are those...\"\"Not quite.\" Mia said smugly while returning to a more relaxed position.While Rena expected another explosion of growth, she was quite surprised to see quite the opposite! Right before her eyes, Mia's breasts began to shrink down until they were once again the size of basketballs while Rena just stared in confusion.\"What's the point of all of that? I still win!\" Rena shouted, sticking her arms in the air in triumph while her breasts jiggled.\"If you really won,\" Mia began, standing up. \"Get up and say that to me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena proceeded to lend forward to get up....only to be pinned down by her own massive breasts. She tried several more times, even by holding on to the arms of the chair, until she finally gave up.\"H-hey! I can't get up!\" Rena said, her voice starting to quiver a bit.\"See, even though the chemical doesn't quite produce weight normally, enough of anything starts to become heavy after awhile. You got too ambitious and instead of waiting so we could test this further, you decided to get greedy on me. Now you can't even get out of your own seat! And I'm sorry to say but you really look quite ridiculous. You look like a fertility statue!\"\"This isn't funny! You have to fix this!\" Rena demanded. \"And how could chemicals make things smaller, anyways?\"\"Oh, they don't. Like I said, you ARE quite smart; I\u2019m very glad you noticed that. See, I'm not just gifted in making chemicals. See, that was really a solution that contained a very special brand of Nanobots that I made myself. I manufactured several of them, of course, but the ones I just injected myself with were programmed to remove excessive flesh on a microscopic level, and, having reached a desired size, stop and then expel themselves. Right now, I'm sure they have already leaving through the pores of my skin. Of course, I didn't need to use BOTH needles; it was just faster that way. I was going to give you one and let you walk out of here with some a nice rack but I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Rena said, starting to feel a little more sad than angry.\"Think of this as a punishment. We were supposed to take turns and record the results. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to leave you like that forever but I do think you need a time out. I know you get itchy feet from time to time and I can't think of a better punishment than to have you be unable to move, and from having an excess amount of something you secretly desired in the first place. Ironic, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how long are you going to make me sit here?!\"\"Now, now, temper temper. That depends on...\"*brrrriiiing. Brrrrriiiing* Mia's phone interrupted her just when she was fixing to get to the good part of her little lecture.\u00a0\"Hang on one second, I gotta take this.\" Mia said while Rena huffed once in annoyance.\"Uh huh.....really?......you don't say.....well, I was in the middle of something....yes, I was....well, you know how I feel about self-experimentation.....hey, don't you worry, if anything DID happened to me, it would be in the name of science!......yeah.....yeah, I knew you wouldn't tell anyone!.....That so...sure, I suppose I could come down if it's an emergency......think you hold off for an hour? ........oh,thank you so much..........no, no, I\u2019m just fine, just tying up some loose ends here.....no, actually, this is going to work out even better now....okay.....see you soon. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia hanged up and turned to address Rena.\"That was the lab; they need me to come in for a bit.\" Mia reported\"What about me?!?\" Rena demanded.\"Just hold on a sec, I'll be right back.\"Mia left while Rena crossed her arms over her breasts, already starting to get sick of them. What's the point of being stacked if you can't go out and flaunt them? After about twenty minutes, Mia returned, wearing what seemed to be a shirt that stretched ungracefully and drew draw attention to the large breasts that stuck out of her lab coat. She was pushing a short cart filled with random objects.\"You're going out like that?\" Rena asked.\"Oh, the lab boys are used to seeing me look different every so often. I once came in to work for a whole week after I accidentally dyed my own fur and hair purple! Besides, I don't think they're going to mind this one bit...\"\"You always were a strange one. So, aren't you going to help me?\"\"Only after you help me first.\" Mia replied, while pushing the cart within arms\u2019 reach of Rena's left hand. \"I got to go and I won't be back until nine o\u2019clock tonight.\"You're just going to leave me here?!?\"\"You got it. If you look on the cart, you'll see everything you'll need for the next several hours. I made you a few of your favorite sandwich, tuna on rye, and there's milk and water in the thermoses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They should stay cold all day. There's a remote so you can watch TV if you get bored, and of course, the note book and some automatic pencils.\"\"The remote and food I get but what's with those other things?\"\"Well, Rena, if I'm going to punish you, I might as well put you to good use. It's simple, really. While I know the compound I just made expands the breasts, I know nothing else about it only that it's perfectly safe and you won't get any larger without any more in your system. And what do you know, I already drank the last of it; good thing I wrote down the compound and stored it safely where no one can get to it. Anyways, all I want you to do is write down any side effects that might occur, though I doubt that anything will happen. There's a working cell phone and my number written down on a sheet of paper; if you think your life is in danger, don't be afraid to call me and I'll get over as soon as possible. In the mean time, just write down anything that comes to mind. You know, like extra sensitivity in the breasts, possible lactation from the chemicals, increased libido. Speaking of which, I know you're going to be here for awhile and could get bored quite easily, so if you want to have yourself some good 'alone time', don\u2019t be afraid to go for it. The blinds are shut and the house will be locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just asked that you keep your sweat pants on when you do it; you're not going anywhere for awhile and you can always change and wash up when this is all over.\"\"Hey, I would never do that in someone else's house!....I-I mean, I wouldn\u2019t do that period!\" Rena said, while blushing.\"Right, and you just want everyone else to think that you really need 45 minutes to take a shower. So like I said, write down anything that comes to mind, even if it seems minor, and when I come home, I'll fix you up with some nice, manageable breasts so you can have your cake and eat it too. I'll even let you be as big as me.\"\"You promise?\"\"I promise; a good scientist never goes back on her word, even if she\u2019s labeled \u2018crazy\u2019 or \u2018mad\u2019. Besides, I think you're being punished enough right now, no need for you to develop some sort of inferiority complex. Now, I got to go, so sit tight and don't go anywhere...oh, wait, you can't!\" Mia laughed up-roarishly while exiting and locking the door behind her.\"That's not funny, you know!\" Rena shouted. \".......and not just in the context of the situation, I mean it's not funny even as a joke!\"Of course, Mia was already out of Rena's voice range and within seconds she could hear Mia's car pulling out of the drive-way. Rena listened for a minute until she could no longer hear Mia's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sighed and looked down at herself, or at least as much as she could see of herself. She hated to admit it, but she really did look silly. Even if she did wanted to play with herself, there wasn't much she could do with her breasts; she couldn't even see her nipples, let alone touch them. And of course, those were always the most sensitive and, therefore, the most fun to massage. Rena sighed deeply again and wonder how she was going to spend the rest of her day by herself. Never had she been more grateful for already having used the bathroom before meeting a friend. Then she....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Started to lactate...first a little, then slowly more over time...this must be a side effect of drinking too much of that stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Got bored and started to rub and massage her breasts as far as she could reach...maybe she could still find a way to enjoy them for now\u2026</span></div></div>",

W-who's there?!? Show yourself!\" Rena demanded, while rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I'm afraid that's not possible, considering I don't have a physical body.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena thought for a moment.\"Are...are you God?\"Rena could hear a slight chuckle that seemed to come from her own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[No, no, not at all. But you could say that I often work for Him. But that's beside the point; I'm here to offer an opportunity.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of opportunity? You're not asking me to do something illegal, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Of course not; we don't do things that way. In fact, I'm asking quite the opposite. I'm offering the chance to do some real good...in exchange for continuous rewards?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rewards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Yes. See, there are hundreds...maybe thousands... of people like you around the world chosen to follow orders from a higher place. And the effects can have great value on society and prevent awful misfortunes from happening. While I'm sure you're a good egg, and would probably accept to help out anyway, we can only give you this opportunity in return for a favor; it's our way to compensate for you trouble.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess that's awfully nice of you....assuming I haven't gone insane just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena heard another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Oh, no, I assure you that you are quite right in the mind, otherwise I wouldn't have been allowed to choose you.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...so if I perform some tasks for you, you'll reward me each time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Yes, at least until you think you've been rewarded enough. Of course, if you still want to continue to help us, that's fine too but expect at least one reward first.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep talking about some kind of reward; what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That depends on what you desire the most...I'm now searching your heart....oh my. Well, I suppose I can't blame you; you mortals do tend to place a lot of value on physical appearances\u2026.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blame me for what?\" Rena said, starting to get a little irritated. It wasn't every day that someone started hearing random voices in their head\u2026and wait a sec, did the voice called her ugly!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Apparently, if you agree to help us, you will be rewarded with a larger cup size each time.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...oh, you're perverse!\" Rena said, crossing her arms and blushing.[Am I? Or are you tired of your own body type? I've search your heart and you desire to be noticed a bit more....and it seems you envy your friends\u2026.and certain strangers\u2026 in fact, this seems to be a hidden desire of yours for quite some time.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn't help but blush even more....it is true; she always wished she was a bit larger there but this whole thing was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...let's say I believe you...which I don't...what is it you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That depends on multiple factors; whatever is needed at the moment. Will you agree to help us?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena wasn't sure what to do. It would be nice to be...busty for once...but strange voices claiming to serve a higher power and offering free breast enhancements don't just appear out of thin air....or do they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more question. Let's say I believe you and you keep making my chest bigger and bigger. Won't I have problems walking around later or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[We can stop enlarging at any time, although I will probably ask that you still help out; I'm sure once you have your fun, you'll discover that helping others is its own reward, whether or not they are aware of your actions. However, this is all done by supernatural means. No matter how large you become, your chest will always be light as a feather to you. You will always be able to move freely without difficulty or pain in your back or neck. You'll even be able to lift them yourself using only your hands. However, you should be aware that to everyone and everything else, they will be rather heavy, so try to keep that in mind. In any case, you will have no need to fear becoming too large to move and whenever you think you are large enough all up to you. Now that I have answered your question, you can answer mine; will you help us?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Rena shrugged. \"If nothing happens, then I'll know I need psychological help.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I assure you, something WILL happen. Do you have a mode of transportation?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have a bike right now. And I can run fast too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That'll do. Given the odd nature of your desire, I plan to give you enough time to react even if you must be on foot. I want you to go to the following address.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious voice led Rena until she was in front of a retirement home.\"What, you want me to visit old people?\" Rena asked, not sure what she was getting herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[While that would be an admirable act of charity, you are here with a far more important task. Go around the side of the building until you see a door facing opposite of a trash bin.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena did as she asked and noticed that she was lead to a service door.\"I'm not sure about this. It says employees only. And I'm sure it's locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[It's unlocked and no one is around. Open it and turn right.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena did as she was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[See that closet? Open it and you'll see a little knob in the wall. Turn it counter clock-wise until it's tight.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena did as she was told and wrinkled her nose at a very unpleasant stench.\u00a0\"Oh, gawd, something smells awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[That's because it's leaking cooking gas.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Keep your voice down! Now, go back to the doorway and be sure to pull the fire alarm.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[No time to argue, do it or you might get caught!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena raced for the door, being sure to pull the alarm as she headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Find your bike quickly and head back home. Don't worry, if you hurry no one will notice you.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one panicked bike ride, Rena was exhausted. Sitting on her couch, Rena was wondering if she did anything of value at all or if she was just going insane afterall.\"So, was there a point to all this or are you just some figment of my imagination?\" Rena asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If I was just a figment of your imagination, how was I able to tell you there was a gas leak at that retirement home? Did you even KNOW it was there before I met you?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...some people are...psychic...or something...I seen weird stuff like this on TV once before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Can psychics do this to themselves?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the voice stopped speaking, Rena felt a warm sensation coming from her chest. She gasped and was afraid she might be having a heart attack but...she didn't felt any pain at all. Instead, she could feel something pressing against the skin of her chest...from the inside! She groan with pleasure as she grabbed her chest and began to instinctively rub at it, feeling it starting to swell in her hands and pulling on her almost skin tight shirt. By the time it was over, Rena was starting down at two healthy CC cups, raising the front of her shirt just over her belly button and forming two solid round lumps on her chest.\"W-what is this?!? Is this for real?!\" she exclaimed, still a gasped at what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Did I not tell you it was? And yes, you did accomplish some good back there. One of the staff members tends to smoke when no one is looking and he has long lost his sense of smell. That gas has been slowly building up since last night and had he lit up, there would have been an explosion that would have not only turn him into a charred skeleton, but start a fire that would have eventually engulf the entire complex. The loss of life would have been devastating. Can you imagine all the people who would have lost their parents or grandparents? I'll have you know that aside from that little safety hazard back there, that happens to be one of the nicer retirement homes around here; people who are placed there aren't forgotten by their loved ones. I already know the outcome of this situation, as I\u2019m able to see different possibilities and determine which is more likely. There will be an investigation. Safety rules will be outline better and followed more strictly. The man who would have smoke will lose his job but he will examine his life and find better, and I should also say, more competent employment down the road. Instead of death, you have, in the shadows, help bring this to a better conclusion. And I'll say that the growth on your chest is proof of that. Now, I know I promised only one cup per task but considering you were so small before, I wanted to make sure you noticed. Do you want to continue your growth and help us?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Yes! Oh, I\u2019m going to be HUGE! No one will ever call me flat again!....eh heh heh, and I can do some good too, right?\" Rena nervously laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[No need to be ashamed; there was a reason we offer rewards. Your next task will bring you to a D cup. I want you to go to a...]</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition originally by Nameless One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This chapter was so long, I had to split it into multiple parts.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavato; an interesting planet in an otherwise unknown and unexplored universe where the local population has yet to develop their technology to the point of even understanding such things as planets, solar systems, and galaxies. A planet still in a medieval era, with some successful experiments in steam-powered machines and Roman-esque use of indoor plumbing (which led to more sanitized culture compared to the Middle Ages in our world), it is also notable for many advances in the art of magic, which compensated for and at times even encouraged it's technological progress. However, only people living near kingdom and castle towns, particularly the wealthy, the intellectual, or the royal have any real access to it on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps even more fascinating than its technological phrase combined with its use of magic is the fact that Navato appears to be a planet with only one gigantic land mass on one side of its surface (or so it is believed; there very well could be one or more continents on the other side but sailing has yet to developed to the point where the truth could be discovered without the voyage becoming a suicide mission...), an almost diamond-shaped land mass ranging from a world of deserts near the southern tip to a land of ice and snow at the northern tip. Known commonly as Onlon to the populace, it is the home of four sentient races.Living at the western tip is a large and vast kingdom of humans. Intentionally responsible for most of the technological and magical progress up to this point in time, they live more or less how humans are expected to act; a race sometimes cruel and sometimes merciful that is kept in check by a system of rule and law, with a few truly good souls if one looks hard enough. Their territory is mostly comprised of fields and meadows, along with a few mountains and streams here and there for abundant natural resources, and since they had the proper knowledge of crop rotation and farming techniques, it has become a successful agriculture force. Steam has been discovered for a still continuing exploration of its practical applications, though it will be a few years before the next technological leap can be made, at least one that could benefit the populace at large.Living at the Northern tip are the half-humans known as the Cranis; while the animal does not exist in this world, they are comparable to what we know in ours as dogs, in that their own kind has many races based on our breeds, short-haired varieties living in the warmer climates of their territories while thicker, longer-haired breeds are able to live in the cold mountains and tundra in the far north. While only a small area of the land is suitable for growing crops, and the land is covered with a strange grass that, while harmless for humans and half-humans alike, is actually poisonous to many farm animals and thankfully cannot grow in the other three regions. However, the Cranis have enjoyed a long and very successful alliance with the humans since before recorded history; as such, the Cranis often trade their even more abundant raw materials in exchange for additional crops and technological advances.The temperance of the Cranis is varied among their breeds and, while having exceptions, can usually be categorized by using having set characteristics depending on the breed of Cranis, the hybrids being the most unpredictable. As one might expect, pit bulls, Dobermans, and other fighting dogs are the more aggressive, usually either working in the kingdom military or simply becoming barbarians in their own right while more docile breeds like poodles, basset hounds, and golden retrievers are more concentrated in towns and cities. Due to the harsh weather at the eastern tip, their kingdom castle is actually in the center of their territory, though there is at least one lord castle in the eastern mountains offering safe refuge to the cold and lost...as long as they are either humans or Cranis, that is.In the eastern tip are the Falin, half-humans that again, while the animal does not exist on this world, could be comparable to cats in ours; the usual shorter \"house cats\" or domesticated breeds usually (but not always) being the members of the ruling and nobility classes while the taller and stronger \"big cats\" races tend to form the military and lower classes, though the merchant middle class is mostly mixed evenly of the two. Like the Cranis, both main races have many breeds, though because of the complex nature of the feline psyche, there are no cut and dry characteristics that can be attributed to their kind, though the big cats are known to be slightly more aggressive at times.The Falin live in a world of mostly forests, the northern parts mostly of redwood and evergreens while the southern and middle have the kind of trees one would expect in the North American and European continents in our world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They do have farming techniques, mostly taken from observing the humans and Cranis, which, when combined with their fruit tree harvesting and their vast fish resources out at sea, make for a balanced diet among most of their kind. Their technological progress, however, is stunned due to the fact that the Cranis and Falin have been at odds with each other since ancient times. Wars have been fought and many more countless battles and while the two try to stay away from each other in recent times, it is not unlikely for Cranis thieves and barbarians to raid any of the Falin settlements bordering their territory. Due to their alliance with the Cranis, the humans are also very distrustful of the Falin, which is unfortunate since the Falin are a peace-loving race and probably would have gotten along with the humans otherwise.To the south are the Restros, the only half-human race that actually have animals based on their own kind; reptiles. The Restros themselves are a mixture of many different reptile species bundled into one sentient package: the jaws and teeth of alligators and crocodiles, long tails like snakes with a prehensile ability to strike against foes from behind them and even squeeze the life out of them if needed, and many characteristics of various lizards, including soft, smooth scales of various colors depending on heritage. Due to their slit snake eyes and scales, they have been persecuted by the humans for centauries and the Cranis are not very fond of them either. While it was at first an alliance of necessity at the beginning, the Restros and Falin have forged deep and friendly ties with each other in order to counteract the threat of human/Cranis dominance. And if nothing else, they can be united by their mutual love of sunbathing.While the Restros are actually warm-blooded, they do feel more energetic and active in warmer climates, which is why they have chosen to live in the southern tip of the world continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The northern reaches of their territory are filled with tropical rainforests while the rest of the area are deserts that, thankfully, are filled with many streams that provide live-preserving water; the Restros have such respect for their streams that they do not allow any boats to travel on them save for their royalty, though they do build roads to border them for the sake of travelers. Their towns are, predictably, built near springs, larger rivers, and the occasional oasis, their kingdom castle town built near the largest and most spectacular oasis of all. Their most treasured resource are heat stones, crystals that can actually absorb the sun's rays and store them until nightfall, where the temperature drops due to the nature of sand. With the heat stones, they can keep their houses warm at night and even use them to keep a steady fire going when traveling in the dessert; as long as they are in the presence of constant heat, they can be used for warmth later. Humans and Cranis have attempted to steal them but with little luck, as so far they are only willing to trade or sell heat stones to their Falin allies, who are quite fond of them as well.Thus, our story begins in one of the northern-west most Falin settlements, a small town that does not have a population more than a hundred and the nearest city is at least five miles away. Founded in a small clearing that is suitable for growing crops, raising animals, and harvesting fruits and mushrooms in the surrounding forests, it is a small community that, due to its lack of economic growth, is actually not taxed by the kingdom; instead, all the kingdom demands from them is that in times of war they send their men to fight while their women and older children would help tend to the sick and wounded; in exchange, the kingdom promises the safety of their younger children and offspring during trying times.\u00a0It's not an exceptional life but it is an honest one, everyone having at least the basics of education such as reading and writing, simple mathematics and what is common knowledge about the world at large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even have a large heat stone in the center of their town and a small church where they can freely worship the beloved patron deity of the Falin, the great Gatoros. It is here that we find a young peasant woman, Rena Yaben, who works with her family in whatever way she can to help. Fairly young and still a bit underdeveloped, Rena helps by tending to the chickens, watering and gathering crops from the fields and plants from the forest, and looking after her younger brother and sister. Most would consider this a rather dull existence but Rena loved it, her parents kind and gentle and neighbors friendly, being able to live near the outdoors with the fresh air and the tress all around her.</span></div></div>",

Take Karen with you; she's getting older now and should know how to fetch water. Karen, would you like to go with your sister and learn where to fetch the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mommy.\" a younger tiger child said, dressed in a simple brown dress as she followed her older sister who usually wore leather pants mostly because it was warmer and more suited for working out in the fields. While she would have to use two hands to handle the twin buckets on the way back to the village, Rena was able to hold her sister's hand as they began their short trip to the river just outside of town, Karen carrying a smaller bucket in her other hand.\"Do you think we'll see any mushrooms out in the forest?\" Karen asked; being only eight years old, this would be her first trip outside the village.\"That's what I'm hoping; you know which ones are okay to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only touch the ones that have a white, creamy color; if it's red, green, or spotted, leave it alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I pick some flowers too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need both hands to carry your bucket when it\u2019s full but I'll gather a few that you can wear in your hair, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess that'll be good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waving good bye to the local blacksmith at the edge of town, the two walked a bit to the west to another clearing where a small river flowed from one part of the forest to another, smooth pebbles and stones at the bottom for anyone who desires them.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get the water ready and you let me know if you see any mushrooms.\u201d Rena said as she placed her buckets on the ground. \u201cDo you know what we have to do after filling the buckets and bringing them home but before drinking or using the water for cooking or cleaning?\u201d\u201cWe hafta boil it first for a few minutes; that\u2019s why we do it at night, when the heat stone stops charging and gets hotter than normal. Why are you asking me easy questions?\u201d\u201cI just want to make sure you remember what I told you; sometimes the easy questions are the most important ones. Did you find any mushrooms?\u201d\u201cNone here; maybe they\u2019re deeper in the forest.\u201d\u201cWe can search for the later; we still have other chores back home first.\u201d Rena replied as she attached the shoulder mount to her buckets.\u201cWait, I want my flowers first.\u201d\u201cI did promised you, didn\u2019t I? Let\u2019s see\u2026.\u201dSpying some blue flowers with five petals in a star pattern and three still enclosed in a tube-like manner, Rena plucked a single stalk with the largest flower in the bunch and gently placed it between her sister\u2019s hair and ear, making sure it wouldn\u2019t fall out by moving her sister\u2019s ear around a few times.\u201cThere you go; I\u2019m sure the other villagers will tell you how cute you look now.\u201dKaren started to giggle but was cut off when both she and Rena heard shouting in the distance, then some sparks flying into the air and explode in a painful wail; someone was striking the heat stone with a hammer, which always sent streams of fire into the sky like a Roman candle, which could only mean the village was under attack and Rena could feel her heart sank. While raids happened every so often due to the fact that their village was close to the Cranis territory, it was still in a rather obscure location where horses would find the thick forest nearly impassible and the only way to attack was on foot; normally she, Karen, and her little brother Jacob were already home and her mother would have Rena hide with her brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Rena-\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d Rena whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk slowly and carefully and sneak around the back way; if we hurry, we can walk behind the houses and get home without anyone knowing.\u201dUnfortunately, the two barely took a few steps until some menacing figures came out into the clearing, knives and clubs drawn out and snarls on their faces, making Rena pale; there were Cranis, and not just any Cranis, but Pit Bull Cranis, one of the most feared and war-like of their kind. Rena heard many horrible stories of Falin who were captured by them, taken advantage of, then left for dead.\u201cRena!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay; I\u2019m going to distract them and I want you to run away as fast as you can.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d a gruff voice snarled. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us.\u201dRena growled and brandished a handful of claws with one hand and pushed Karen to run into the forest with the other. Unfortunately, one snuck up just enough to the side to suddenly rush at her and before she could scratch him back, he took out a rag soaked with a liquid that had a strong, nasty odor and shoved it on her muzzle. Feeling the world starting to go black, the last thing she saw was Karen running off to the side and then back towards the village, hearing one Cranis asking about the kid while another told him to let the \u201ckitten\u201d alone; at least Karen would be safe\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Rena came to, she gasped, half expecting to either wake up dead in the afterlife paradise of Hoben or at least by some campfire, being defiled by her Cranis attackers. Instead, she felt herself on polished wood, the floor rocking and creaking from side to side. After sitting up and taking note of the chains on her arms and legs, Rena could only guess she must have been taken outside of the forest clearing and into a horse-driven carriage.\u00a0Scooting over to one side where a small hole leaked sunlight, Rena listened carefully, hearing some Cranis talking. While the other Cranis were riding on their horses, one of her attackers were riding next to a Chihuahua Cranis the driving carriage who was bundled up since his short fur meant he easily got cold in the north lands of Cranis territory.\u201cCome on, tell me what happened; you know I love hearing about raids; you guys never take me on raids; how come you never let me go on raids again?\u201d he spoke, his speech fast and nervous.\u201cCus\u2019, you idiot, you\u2019re the driver and a scrawny one at that; you take care of the horses and carriage and let us take care of raids.\u201d\u201cWell at least tell me what happened, you only brought one of them cats with you; why only brought one?\u201c*sigh* If it will shut you up, fine. Okay, half of us approached the village all quiet like while the others went after a cat we saw near the river. The cat and her kitten didn\u2019t see us but someone spotted the raiding party at the village first and the next thing we knew, we heard them shouting \u2018Raiders! Raiders!\u2019 and one of the cats struck one of those heat stones they love so much to warn everyone. I went after the cat and let her kitten go since David doesn\u2019t accept kittens. Jonny over there says the blacksmith and his apprentice started shooting arrows while some other townsfolk did the same and they had to leave before it got worse.\u201d\u201cAnyone get shot?\u201d\u201cNo, but Jonny says he hit a tiger with an eye patch over his left eye.\u201dRena felt herself go numb\u2026.father. He used to work over in the kingdom as a sniper bowman and was said to have terrific aim. However, while on an assignment, his group was attacked and while the rest of his party was simply slaughtered, he was just wounded and the Cranis, seeing his bow and arrow, decided to get \u201ccreative\u201d and stabbed one of his eyes out. They probably would have gotten the other one but thankfully another war party came around and rescued him. He had to drop out of the village and wandered penniless and homeless for awhile until he one day came to Rena\u2019s village and met her mother. He found a job helping someone with their crops and eventually he and his mother were married. With some help from the other villagers, he built a house and he and his wife had Rena and her siblings. But hearing he got shot\u2026\u201cDid he die, did you get him?\u201d\u201cNo, Jonny said his aim was a bit off in the panic and he only gazed him on the arm; he\u2019ll probably live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scary thing was even though he was half blind, he almost shot Jonny in the head and just barely missed his ear. Said something about a kid running to the village; must have been that kitten I chased off.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get anymore cats?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening?!? We got spotted, all the cats ran away except the ones that fought us.\u201dRena took a deep breath and released it in relief; so her sister made it back to the village and her father was going to be okay. She felt better to hear that they would be okay but\u2026what was going to happen to her? Her clothes were intact and didn\u2019t seem undone, so they didn\u2019t touch her...and they said something about a \u201cDavid\u201d not accepting kittens\u2026was she going to be sold into slavery? She didn\u2019t hear many stories about Falin being slaves in Cranis territory but she wouldn\u2019t put it past them.\u00a0After a few more mundane conversations, Rena grew tired and hungry and soon fell asleep, dreaming of her peaceful days back at her beloved village. Would she ever get back home? Or was she doomed to live the rest of her life deep in Cranis territory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was woken up from her slumber when the carriage suddenly jolted and the door was flung open. A pit bull came in and forced her on her feet.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to cause trouble with yourself.\u201d He warned. \u201cThen keep quiet and come with us.\u201dAs much as Rena would have loved to rebelled, she wasn\u2019t home anymore and she would have to obey to survive, if only for now. She sheepishly nodded her head and the pit bull smiled.\u201cGood; maybe you cats aren\u2019t so stupid after all.\u201d He grinned smugly before dragging her with him. After a few steps, Rena saw herself in a strange place. The air, while not freezing, was cooler than back in the warm forest, and the ground had the strangest grass she ever saw, long, almost completely blue with black spots on them. She was next to some gated building complex and within viewing distance she saw a magnificent castle surrounded by a town proper; judging by the mark on the banners, Rena could only correctly guess she was so deep in Cranis territory, that she was actually in the very center where the capital city was located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn\u2019t have time for sightseeing as she was lead by the pit bull where a Doberman and some of his cronies were waiting.\u201cGreetings, Steven; I see you have a new calf for me. I\u2019m surprised you only brought one this time, though.\u201d\u201cCalf\u201d? Rena thought to herself. As in\u2026a cow? What did they meant by that?\u201cHullo, David. We got spotted but one is one more than zero, ain\u2019t it?\u201dThe Doberman chuckled a bit after replying with an \u201cIndeed it is\u201d and got closer to Rena; he first pressed the sides of her mouth, forcing her jaw to open and kept her head still with the other. For the sake of not getting hit, Rena didn\u2019t resist; there wasn\u2019t much one could do when you have chains on your arms and legs.\u201cHmmm\u2026.judging by her hair color and her teeth, she does look to be young and while healthy\u2026but not as young as the last time you tried brining me a kitten. You. How old are you?\u201d\u201cT-twenty one\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot a bad age. I usually prefer a cow to be just a little bit younger, but she\u2019ll do. You didn\u2019t\u2026take advantage of her, did you?\u201d\u201cCome on, David, you know I would never try to sell you a spoiled cat; I\u2019ve got more pride than that, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cHmmm, yes, quite, and she is a rather good calf; I\u2019ll pay her 200 Ulmins for her.\u201d\u201cCome on, David; this little trip was more costly than usual, at least give me 400.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c250.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c350.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c300 and not a min more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*sigh* A hard bargain but fair enough; she\u2019s yours now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Robert, give the gentleman his money. You, calf, you will come with me now.\u201dRena was stunned, barely noticed as she was being dragged to the complex. Sold for a mere 300 units of some currency, as if she was a mere object. Being lead past an incredibly tall gate activated by many hidden gears, Rena was first taken into a small fenced in area where the gate behind her shut tight and a much smaller gate, one barely big enough for one person, was opened. Being lead into a large enclosed courtyard, Rena\u2019s eyes widen and her jaw dropped.\u00a0She saw some middle-aged Falin and Restros women being lead by some female Cranis on a mild jog, but that wasn\u2019t what was so strange; what was shocking was that their breasts were *huge*. Not huge as in rather sizeable, no, they were abnormally large, unnaturally so, almost all of them three feet in diameter per breasts, easily covering most of their front body up to their knees. While they were at least moving, some of them had a look on their face like they were genuinely getting exhausted from carrying such heavy loads. As Rena walked past several buildings, one of them glanced at her with an expression of pity and turned away. What\u2026what on earth was going on here and\u2026would that happened to her too?Being lead to the largest building, past wide double doors and spacious hallways, Rena was lead up a staircase and lead to a huge room where there were at least fifty or so Falin and Restros, all of them with breasts equally as large as the older Falin and Restros women Rena just saw outside a few moments ago. All of them were lying down on their stomach on strange beds tilted at an angle between short stalls, their breasts facing the floor as strange, clear cups were mounted on the front of their breasts and some white liquid was being drawn out of them. All of them were eating off of tables that were attached to their beds and came on top of their breasts so that they could easily reach with their forks, knives, and spoons, only a thin, wide hole between the rest of the bed and the table where their breasts were interlocked.\u00a0Starting to come up some theories but hoping for an official explanation, Rena was lead to an empty stall, or at least it looked like it was empty until one of David\u2019s cronies pressed a button inside the stall and with a hiss of steam and some grinding of unseen gears, a small hole opened up in the floor and a tiny, miniature version of those strange tilted beds came up on a platform that perfectly fitted with the rest of the floor. Just before she was about to open her mouth and ask a question, another Cranis came forward and a strange stream of energy came out of his hands and the bed quickly grew many times its size until it was roughly the same size as the rest of the beds in the other stalls.\u201cSo, do you have a name, calf?\u201d\u201cRena Yaben.\u201d She replied, as a Cranis began writing on some cheap paper; if she remembered correctly, he also wrote down her age and some other notes.\u201cVery well, Rena. Welcome to your new home. Prepare the solution and give her a shot of liquid strength.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Rena could say anything else, she felt a violent stab in her arm, yowling a bit but unable to move as some stronger Cranis held her still and she felt something being pushed into her body from a strange device with a needle at one end and the wound quickly covered up.\u201cWhat was that?!?\u201d Rena shouted, too much in pain to really care if she was a slave or not and whether she was speaking out of turn.\u201cJust something that will help you in your new life.\u201d David said just before a tube was shoved in her mouth and guided into her stomach. Loudly breathing through her nose, she felt something thick and heavy being pumped into her stomach and just as she thought she was going to burst, the same Cranis wizard began casting a spell on her.Rena could feel, it, even if her head was tilted up. The pain in her stomach was going away even as more stuff was being pumped into her but she first felt something pressing against her chest\u2026no, something was coming *out* from her chest and she felt a strange weight on the front of her body; she was growing breasts and she could feel them getting bigger and heavier by the second. She could feel them against her ribs, her stomach, her hips, and then\u2026her knees. The tube was taken out of her and by this time, Rena was grounded, her body lying top of gigantic breasts and Rena could only stare in fear and shock at the sight of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she looked like all the others, just another Falin with freakishly large breasts. Trying not to cry, Rena could feel her body being lifted off the ground by another spell and then gently placed lying belly forward in the same bed, joining the other Falin and Restros victims.\u201cKeep in mind that all of the cows are due for another milking cycle spell this week, so be sure to only give her one to last until Sunday; we need to keep a normal schedule to be efficient.\u201dThe wizard nodded before casting another spell on Rena, one that didn\u2019t seem to have any effect before he and the rest of the Cranis walked away while one stayed behind and placed a padded collar around her stomach, locking her in place on the bed, as if she wasn\u2019t already pinned down by the weight of her breasts alone. One of them placed a plate full of food in front of her before walking away. Struggling to not cry and show any more weakness in front of her captors than she already did, Rena ate but only because she didn\u2019t have anything else eat for a day prior to coming here. What was going on and what did she do to deserve this? Was she being punished or was there some reason she couldn\u2019t understand that Gatoros would allow something so cruel like this to happen to her and others of her kind?After cleaning her plate, another one was brought by a Cranis that was dropping off meals with a cart and gathering empty dishes in another section of it. She ate the second plate, filling full, but was surprised when not a few minutes later, yet another plate was placed in front of her. Rena ignored it, no longer having any desire to eat and starting to let loose some silent tears when a harsh voice grabbed her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll keep eating. Don\u2019t make this any harder on yourself than you have to.\u201dRena looked to her left to see a cheetah woman. She was probably older than her, though not that much older, and she had beautiful black hair and a healthy fur coat, but it was spoiled by just one little flaw; she had a scar that ran from her forehead down to her cheek over her left eye, which was completely shut. As curious as Rena was, she decided not to ask and instead simply express her disgust about her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not hungry anymore\u2026\u201d\u201cIdiot! You will be soon enough and you better be eating when he gets back. They don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re not done with your plate yet.\u201d She said as she shoved food in her mouth and began chewing. \u201cBut you got to at least be eating.\u201dThis lady had a very gruff demeanor about her, one that frighten Rena almost as much as the Cranis themselves. Rena obeyed, surprised to find she actually wasn\u2019t quiet as full as she thought, then turned to the cheetah.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Why was I brought here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you but only if you keep eating.\u201d The cheetah replied, after shoving another bite-full in her mouth and taking a drink of water. \u201cTo put it simply, you\u2019re a cow now.\u201d\u201cA cow?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand; this is a very well-kept secret of the Cranis; even the humans have no idea that this is going on and I doubt even they would ever support such a thing. I\u2019ve been here since I was fifteen and I\u2019ve heard enough here and there to put the pieces together. You saw the grass outside?\u201dRena nodded as she continued eating, surprised to find out she was able to eat after all\u2026.\u201cWell, apparently that stuff is poisonous for real cows and they can\u2019t grow normal grass out here because they get choked by the plants that are already here. They used to just get their milk from the cows of humans but\u2026.well, somewhere the line they developed a taste for our breast milk; don\u2019t ask me how, that much I *don\u2019t* know. But apparently they like it and even claim it can actually be used for baking, just like a real cow\u2019s milk. So they use they use magic and grow our breasts out like this so we can store and produce more milk. That spell that wizard casted on you earlier; it puts your body into an over-productive milk cycle. Aside from the occasional calf such as yourself, they keep casting that on us once every month; that\u2019s why we never get completely full and we just keep on eating and keep on making milk. You wouldn\u2019t think so but we make so much milk, that just the two hundred or so of us in this entire facility is enough to produce milk for their entire kingdom and it\u2019s gotten to the point that even the men prefer our milk to beer. And of course, they can ship that stuff around with ice magic, so this is thankfully the only milking facility here.\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if they didn\u2019t cast that milking spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s how they can afford to feed us so much; they get their investment back in milk and then some. I\u2019ve lost track of how many meals I have to eat in one day.\u201d\u201cBut so much food\u2026and wouldn\u2019t our mouths hurt or teeth rot?\u201d\u201cThey use some strange magic on us every day to keep our mouths and teeth strong and they keep brushing our teeth for us. And the humans always produce too much food, so they sell most of it to those Cranis bastards. That\u2019s how they can keep feeding us so \u2018generously\u2019. They go through all this \u2018trouble\u2019 to fix us nice, warm meals and give us \u2018comfy\u2019 seats and beds and warm blankets at night and even feed us gourmet meals during their holidays. They treat their cows humanely, they say, as if that makes it all better; all I want is my freedom but they do all this other crap to ease their conscience, assuming they even have any in the first place.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s was going on outside? I saw some old women running around\u2026.or trying to anyways\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, the older cows. I\u2019ll give you a short verbal tour, because I had to learn it the hard way and I\u2019m feeling generous today. This building is divided up into four sections. This is the highest floor, where they keep everyone aged 15-30. That Restros to your right is only 15 but she\u2019s been here a few weeks longer than you. The floor below us is where everyone 30-45 is kept. I\u2019ll get back to why they were outside in a minute. Below that is where everyone 45-60 is at. And the very first floor is where everyone 60 or older is kept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-they milk us that long?!? How is that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that damn magic they use to screw with nature. It doesn\u2019t work once someone reaches around 80 though; after that, they\u2019re taken to an enclosed area and sleep in a smaller building where they still get feed and such but they aren\u2019t milked anymore; think of it as being put out to pasture. But most women die from grief long before that, so it\u2019s not very full\u2026\u201cNow then, there is a strict schedule they keep to daily; you\u2019re lucky you got here on a Monday, makes the transition go smoother. At eight o\u2019clock sharp, they wake you up so they can get the milk you made during the night and empty you out. Then they will lead you and everyone else outside to a building where you can use the bathroom; they got that indoor plumbing that\u2019s all the rage in the cities. Then they bring you back here and it\u2019s back to work. We eat and eat and eat until twelve; we get a short bathroom break and then they make us walk or jog around, depending on their mood. They exercise to keep us healthy and live longer so they can keep milking us. Then we go back and continue eating until four where we are generously given another bathroom break and another one at eight.\u00a0\u201cOn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, they bathe us at eight after using the bathroom; make us walk to another building and have us stand in line naked like cattle where two spell casters use their magic to lift up our breasts while some female Cranis wash us. We\u2019re given some clean pants and then shipped back to our stalls. I suppose the only good thing about it is that at least all the bathers are female; men aren\u2019t allowed inside ever. Then we eat until ten o\u2019 clock, where we get magic to sooth our sore mouths and they brush our teeth; then they get these beds out, though it\u2019s really more like falling asleep in a chair, and they tuck us in with blankets. On Sundays, they do keep milking us but they don\u2019t exercise us; they just let us wander around the courtyard as we please for an hour; some of us visit others and mingle a bit; if they noticed some ladies becoming friends, they\u2019ll try to move them together, keep them happy\u2026well, happier I should say, really, we\u2019re all miserable here as if that wasn\u2019t apparent enough. Don\u2019t ask me how the schedule works for the other floors, I have no idea but it\u2019s probably similar; you just caught the next group below us on their exercise routine. Get used to it, because that\u2019s what your new life is like; you\u2019re just another faceless cow in a milking farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that stuff they pumped in my stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that? Some sort of mixture of meat and lard; helps speed up the breast growth. You should be grateful; in the old days, they had to force-feed it to the cows and back then, the food-to-milk ratio wasn\u2019t as high as it used to be. I heard the first few generations of cows got so fat they couldn\u2019t stand anymore and most of them died from disease in a few short years. Not that being here healthy for so long is really that much better\u2026\u201d\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\u201cI told you I was here since I was fifteen; I\u2019ve been here for ten years since\u2026\u201d\u201cT-ten years?!? Has anyone ever tried escaping?\u201d\u201cEscape?!? You\u2019re out of your mind. There\u2019s no escape. We can barely job anymore, let alone run. The only reason we can even move under our own power is because they inject us with something that makes our muscles stronger. Even if someone were to escape to the courtyard, they don\u2019t allow us to go too near the gate, and if you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s barely big enough for a normal person to squeeze through. We could never fit through and the only times I ever heard of cows being outside here was when some were shipped to the castle to serve his royal highness, the king bastard of all Cranis. The only thing we can do is pray to Gatoros to smite all of them from the face of the earth, or at least the ones that work here and are responsible for our enslavement.\u201cYeah, now shut up and eat your damn food; I don\u2019t feel like talking anymore\u2026.\u201d With that, the cheetah began to ready bite and chew through her food, as if she was taking out her aggression on her meals. She obviously was upset and didn\u2019t want to talk anymore and Rena was starting to get hungry herself, the milking spell taking full effect on her body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day pretty much went exactly as the cheetah said it would. Throughout the day, she felt her breast slowly get heavier and she could swore they will slightly larger, as if they were being filled up with something. When they came to give her a bathroom break, Rena was surprised she could actually stand up and walk, though like most of the women, she walked at a spirit-broken slow pace and put into one of the lines waiting to use the restroom. It was a simple procedure; after someone left, they went in, a female Cranis pulled a curtain on them so they could do their business in private and wipe themselves clean, then they would pull the curtain back and wash the hands of the Falin or Restros and call the next person in line. Even though it was a bit uncomfortable, Rena could easily see what the cheetah meant about at least all the workers at the restroom stalls being female, especially since they had to pull her pants for her since Rena couldn\u2019t reach down there anymore\u2026Just like the cheetah said, after using the bathroom at eight they made everyone walk over to the bathing facilities. Standing in one of a few long lines, Rena was forced to walk inside where some female dogs would strip her of her peasant pants (which they promptly threw away, much to her dismay; after all, they were her last possession prior to being sold into slavery), and two spell casters were there to levitate her breasts and keep them pushed apart as one aquamancer first doused her with water, then two female Cranis began to scrub her down, one focusing on her oversized breasts while the other one cleaned the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This, of course, was beyond undignifiying; having someone else to bath her, seeing her naked along with everyone else in the building, and it certainly felt uncomfortable to have someone else scrub her private areas for her.\u00a0After a good scrubbing, she was made to walk a little further where another aquamancer doused her with more water, then magically drew the moisture off of her fur and the floor, somehow having the power to filter the dirty bathwater to create more clean water for the next slave. After that was done and over with, she was dressed again by another Cranis, a sort of \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d pair of pants and some slippers, though they were a big baggy on her, which they fixed with a simple leather belt.\u00a0After that little loss of dignity, she was lead back to her stall where she was served yet another meal, and truthfully, she was hungry again as the milk cycle spell had taken its full effect and Rena could tell her breasts were heavy with milk, so much so that she could swore they were getting bigger simply from the milk stored in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt ten o\u2019clock, Rena was given a very strange meal; a simple white pillar of some kind of spongy material. It didn\u2019t have any real taste to it, had it existed it her world it could be compared to eating a giant marshmallow, but this time she actually felt stuffed and no longer felt like she could eat any more. Thankfully, she wasn\u2019t given any more food as some Cranis began walking through the rows, one forcing her mouth open and brushing her teeth while the other cast some sort of spell on her mouth, which made it felt less sore after spending an entire half-day doing nothing but eating. It was then that the wizard levitated Rena out of her milking seat, shrunk it down again before it was lowered back into the floor, and another small, different chair was taken out and grown, a normal-sized seat that Rena was lowered into. After being locked in the seat by another padded chain at her waist, Rena had a blanket thrown over her and was tucked in, her legs wrapped up with the blanket while a pillow was placed behind her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the very last Cranis left in the room pulled some switches down, which turned off those strange glowing orbs that was lighting the room up earlier and flooded it with darkness as some curtains were drawn, so as to cut out the harsh glow of the moonlight sky.\u00a0As Rena sat in the darkness, she could hear some of the Falin and Restros whisper to one another; others were crying themselves to sleep. Rena herself felt like crying and while she didn\u2019t out-right sob, she couldn\u2019t help but make the upper part of her blanket wet with tears. Why was she here? Would she ever escape? It sounded as if it was impossible, a place such as this being around for many long decades. Rena thought back to her simple but enjoyable life at the village, surrounding by family and friends in a close-knit community, thinking about her days of fetching crops and plants, taking care of farm animals and helping her mother cook meals for her siblings and her beloved, hard-working father.\u00a0Of course, escape seemed impossible now and even if it wasn\u2019t she, like the rest of her fellow slaves, were freaks now. The milk cycle spells might have only lasted a month but she would still be stuck with these ridiculously large breasts. She could only hope there was a way to reverse the affect, and if not, then at least a way to temporary cut them down to size. A form-alternating amulet, a weekly spell, anything to make her look normal again ; she had trouble walking without losing her balance, at this size she would be nothing but a burden to her family and friends and that was the last thing she wanted to be.\u00a0Thinking about her village gave her another horrible idea. Those raiders\u2026they were there specifically to look for more Falins to become milk slaves and they knew where her village was. What if they tried to come back? Sure, they probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered the older women, so her mother was probably safe but they could easily take someone else. She was especially fearful for her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She might have been only eight but in just seven years she would be old enough to entice the Cranis; Rena would be heart-broken if they ever captured her and brought her here.Exhaustion and worry took their toll on Rena and she eventually drifted off to sleep as the room grew quiet, falling asleep to the sound of someone crying herself to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena was abruptly awoken as the curtains were drawn and the room was filled with sunlight. While Cranis worked to take away the blankets of their milk slaves and reattached the milk suctions so they could draw out the milk they produced last night from their last, filling meal, the one if front of Rena abruptly stopped and called for one of his fellow workers.\u201cHey, Rob, come over \u2018ere a sec.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, you know David will get mad if we slack off on the jo-geeze\u2026\u201dThe two couldn\u2019t help but stare at Rena, who after a few seconds could feel what they were talking about. During the night, her stomach worked off her meal at a much slower pace. Still, while she was producing milk just like everyone else, who were having their breasts drained again just before being marched off to the bathrooms, Rena\u2019s body must have been over producing, because a large part of her blanket was wet with milk, and worse, she was still leaking all over the floor with a small trickle.\u201cGet David, he needs to see this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what all the fuss is about.\u201d David said as the blanket was taken off of Rena. \u201cShe is simply a cow that produced more milk than expected. If I had known this would have happened, I would have had her drained last night.\u201d\u201cBut we always wait a day with new cows, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but apparently that was a mistake. No matter. Have her drained out and sent her to the bathers. We\u2019ll simply bring her back and I\u2019ll make a note that this one needs the suction cups placed on her at night, without the pressure of course.\u201dRena watched as the workers opened up a hatch in the floor and attached the same kind of suction cups that she saw on everyone else when she first arrived. After a button was pressed, Rena felt a force gently pulling on her breasts, especially on her fur-covered nipples, and she could feel something warm and wet being pulled out of her breasts. She\u2026she was being milked. It didn\u2019t hurt but it didn\u2019t feel comfortable either, though she did felt better as her breast became lighter\u2026well, lighter considering that even drained they were still three feet wide all around each breast.\u00a0After being completely milked, the suction cups were removed and she was forced to stand back up as her chair was shrunk down again so the floor could be mopped and her stall ready for when she got back.\u201cYou should be proud of yourself.\u201d David said with a creepy smile. \u201cYou are already proving to be a very productive cow; if you are lucky, you just might have the honor of becoming one of his highness\u2019 royal cows. Be sure to feed her as much as possible and remember to reattach the suction cups at night. Also, the spotted cow next to her is also another good producer; be sure to keep an eye on her, because I see her plate empty too often; she might not be getting enough to eat.\u201d\u201cYes sir. Come with us.\u201d The worker said as he left for the doors and a shove from behind her told her to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a quick bath, Rena was brought back to her stall, clean and ready for Rena to be lifted back into that strange forward lying bed as the counter slab was once again placed in front of her and her breasts were reattached to the suction cups. Once again having to constantly eat, Rena noticed that after a mere thirty minutes, the machines were turned back on and she could feel herself being milked again. Only this time, she was still producing milk and a great amount at that. There was something disturbing about her breasts swelling up an extra fourth of her new size and being milked at the same time; it was bad enough she was treated no more than a cow and talked to like one, but now she was over-producing, or rather, creating more milk than normal slave, which would explain why she kept getting her meals recharged as often as possible.With little else to do, Rena took a closer look around her surroundings. The cheetah was to her left, eating just as much and as fast as Rena and quite bitterly at that. It was a shame, really. Even with the scar on her face, she was still quite beautiful and with a little fixing, she could easily have it covered it up with her hair, which would have given her a bit of an air of alluring mystery. Unlike the other slaves Rena saw so far, she didn\u2019t respond to her slavery with sorrow but with a hidden seething anger, an anger that desperately wanted the Cranis punished for what they had done to her and everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0To her right was the Restros the cheetah mentioned last night. Even if the cheetah hadn\u2019t told her that Restros was only 15, she probably would have guess she was still young as she was still shedding. Over the course of their life, Restros shed their skin once a month during their youth until they reach adulthood, at which they merely shed once a year. She was sad and had a look on her face that looked as if she would burst into tears at any moment; in fact, Rena thought that maybe she was the one she heard cry herself to sleep last night. Rena couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her; after all, she might have been in the same situation as the Restros but at least Rena was able to live all of her childhood in the village before being captured; this one was brought here at such a young age.In front of her was a panther Falin flanked on both sides by two \u201chousecats\u201d Falins, though Rena was a bit too far away to really say anything to her. The stalls were built with their backs right against the other but there was no way Rena could really turn around to see what was behind her, so she had no idea if she had a Falin or a Restros behind her and in the end, it didn\u2019t really matter.And so here she was, just another Falin victim in the cruelest of situations. Oh, sure, all things considered, she could have been a slave in hard labor or some other form of forced work but slavery is still slavery and no matter how \u201cwell\u201d she was treated by her captors, she was still a slave no matter how you sliced it and the only thing she wanted along with everyone else was a chance to be normal again and free in their homelands.Boredom and curiosity settled in and Rena decided that maybe she should try talking to at least pass the time away, since there was nothing else to do. Glancing to her left, the cheetah seemed to know a lot about this place from eavesdropping on her captors; maybe she could find out a little more about what was going on or just make conversation; Rena didn\u2019t even get her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe she wouldn\u2019t enjoy talking; she was certainly in a foul mood. Perhaps she should try talking to the Restros instead; she was young and scared and maybe she needed someone like Rena to look up to, even if they were no better off from each other. Maybe Rena could make her feel a little bit better about herself, if only a little bit.Rena decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(The following storyline was originally written by Pennyworth. All credit goes to him. WARNING:This storyline contains foul language.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know a lot of cat-girls out there who don't fit into A-cup bras - at least that's what Brigitte, the gal of the clothing store said when I bought some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'm about to pay when I realize: I got no money. I was seriously broke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Cause I ate that smoking hot chicken last night at the china restaurant. Man, it smelled good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo being the fine lady I am, I grabbed my bras and made a run for it before she could call the police. Anyway, I decided to get a job. The gig: Assassinate the drifter - or rather, the driftress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I went where I was supposed to and waited for the gal to show up. And there she was: This cat-<br>\r\nwoman, tightly dressed, sexy, a big bra-breaker -couldn't tell if she was an F-cup or just havin' a fake-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, so she's big, busty, smokin' hot, made men pack up heat - Bada Bing! Or at least it was supposed to be, till he showed up. His name: Mark Christmas, an agent from a whatsoever called association.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations! Your bra-size is certified as a B-cup now. How about getting rid of those women bustier than you, and aim for the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanna have bust Number One. How's that, short and simple enough for ya? It's gonna be a long, hard road. But who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould kick ass.<br>\r\nCould be dangerous. Could totally suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say, bro? Join me. Let's see how big we can get me - and for you there sitting in front of the monitor right now, just click on the line below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet the breast growth begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\nThat was a rewritten version of the intro monologue from the game \"No more heroes\". In the game, the (anti)-hero, Travis Touchdown, gets the 11th ranked assassin of the \"United Assasassin Association\", short UAA, after killing the prior number 11. He then goes on to kill the other ten killers above him because an agent from the association, Sylvia Christel, said if he became number one, she may spend a night with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deal here now is pretty simple: After killing this other cat-girl, Mark(don't ask me how I got from Sylvia to Mark) grows Rena's breasts into B-cups, and she takes on his offer to defeat every member of the UBB(Union of Busty Babes) who were more developed than her - so everyone - , earning bigger breasts after each kill until she is the number one ranked beauty in the UBB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that, head to the next chapter and let the story begin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cloudless night during summer. The moon was shining, the stars however were only barely visible due to the lights from the city. It was a big one, with colossal buildings reaching for the sky, containing hotels, company headquarters, apartments and so forth. Between the gray giants, small parks had been planted throughout the city so people could escape the smoke of the streets. Before anyone could get to the inner city though he had first to pass the out-skirts of the town, mostly residential areas. Just like the skyscrapers in the city, the small one-family houses had been built in a strict structure, the street net of the town almost looking like a chessboard from above. The rest of the town was industrial region. Immense amounts of smoke were coming from the factories all day and night, the wind however always blew it off the town. Half a mile to the east, a baseball stadium was located, crowded on weekends, now empty. On the west side, the city was limited by the Pacific ocean, a small harbor being built at the northern end to import materials for the city's factories and export finished goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the majority of the coast was taken by a large beach, going beyond the city limits until it united with<br>\r\nthe desert in the south. In the daylight, the sand was sparkling golden in the sun, creating a tropic scenery alongside the aquamarine water. Many people never noticed this natural beauty though, as they were distracted by another beauty - a beauty which visited the beach every day, considered by many to be the city's true treasure. It was this beauty, not the sky-scrapers, parks, factories, baseball stadium or the beautiful coast that had shaped the name of the relatively young town:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanta Bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this night, however, the beach was empty except for a few couples, holding hands under the moonlight. The beach was located lower than the rest of the town, only reachable through staircases. Above the beach was the promenade, palms and grass planted along it. Behind the parking-lots was a large street, four lines on every side to gain a bit distance from the sky-scrapers. Between the large buildings, one could easily get lost in this urban maze if it was not for the many signs located at every corner, every street cross, and near every large building. In front of one of this buildings, there was a small court with a well in the middle of it. And next to this well, somebody was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could not tell if it was a woman or a man: The person was wearing a long orange coat, and a large cloak hung deep into his or her face. Just standing there, the cloaked figure wasn't doing anything significant - in fact, it wasn't doing anything at all. It didn't even seem as if he or she was waiting for someone, never turning the head to see if someone was coming. As if the person was frozen to the ground it rested at its place, solid like a mountain, unmovable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil someone came and kicked him or her into the face.<br>\r\nTwo feet hit the head directly, sending the body backwards against the wall of the building. The impact was heavy enough to demolish the concrete, some pieces falling to the ground alongside the lifeless body. It was given no rest though as a swarm of bullets crashed into it, piercing holes through the orange coat. As the rain of bullets ended, the cloaked head fell onto its chest, all color vanishing out of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning a pair of twin pistols like a cowboy, the killer looked down at the corpse on the ground, showing no signs of regret or sorrow. Unlike its victim's, the gender of this person was pretty obvious as the most distinctive features were presented quite generously: Above a big booty and slender waist, the killer's torso was crowned by a large amount of cleavage covered in gray fur, a tight black leather suit underlining the female curves. She had a deep rift on the front of her clothes, wearing no bra so the world could see her delightful assets in all their glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick motion, the cat-woman put her guns into their halters. During the entire time, she had kept a smoke between her lips. Pulling out a lighter from her cleavage, she ignited it now, puffing out a cloud of smoke into the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT I T T Y<br>\r\nK I T T Y<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breeze came up, blowing some of Kitty's short white hair into her face. As she pulled it back, her cold, yellow eyes were still looking at the body on the ground. She kept her glance at it as she turned around, and when she could no longer stare at her victim, focused on the moon. It was not a full moon, not quite, a small piece missing at the edge. A large grin suddenly formed on the killer's face, showing her sharp fangs. Looking straight ahead now, the curvy assassin left the scene, her hips and tail swaying from side to side to the rhythmic clapping of her high-heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty stopped. Puffing out another cloud, she slowly turned her head around. On the place the corpse had rested a moment ago the orange coat was now lying on the ground. Another cat-woman was standing on top of it, though this one had a much slender figure than Kitty. Her fur was orange-coloured with some black stripes along it, her red hair going down to her shoulders. On the front of her red tank-top, a black skull was imprinted; below it read \"DEAD HEAD\". Her eyes were covered by yellow sun-glasses, her legs by blue jeans which were neither really loose nor really tight. In her hand, she was holding a strange metal object, looking like a long lamp-holder with a grip on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRENA<br>\r\nWESTFALL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty turned around, putting the cigarette out of her mouth. After swaying her hip as far to the side as possible, she put a hand on her side. \"Oh my\" she grinned, smoke coming out between her teeth. \"They didn't tell me my target was a lil' girl.\" Placing the smoke between her lips again, she added: \"Not that it would have changed anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled back at her, shouldering her metal bar. \"And they didn't tell me MY target was an old hag<br>\r\nwho tries to act cool and sexy.\", she said, adding after a while: \"Not that it would have changed anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hand on her knee, Rena's opponent leaned forward, her breasts hanging down as far as they<br>\r\ncould in the tight suit, while she put her other hand above her eyes as if she was looking for something. \"I'm sorry, my dear, but even with my night-sight eyes, I can't seem to locate any kind of curves on your body. Or is it popular right now to be flat? Cause when I was last time at the beach and all the men were drooling at my sight, it didn't seem to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena snorted. Throwing an angry glance at the gray assassin, she tried to stay calm as she spoke: \"Please leave those kind of insults out. The gal at the super-market already made such a stupid comment when I bought some bras this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kitty stood upright again. Putting her arms above her head, she stretched herself as much as<br>\r\npossible, sticking out her chest while shifting her hips slightly from side to side. \"Oh, don't you know? We cat-women are supposed to be sex-symbols! Japanese manga authors put us as running gags into their stories, always pointing towards a sexual context. The world wide web is full of pictures from pervy little men, showing us with big busts in provocative poses. From the moment she is born, the world expects a cat-woman to be sexy!\" She relaxed her pose, putting one hand on her hip and taking the smoke in the other again. \"You, my dear lil' girl however, would not even be considered 'sexy' if you were a normal human. Actually, not even if you were a normal cat.\" That was it. Rena pressed a button on her metal bar, and a shining laser stream appeared between its ends, it's light narrowing the eyes of her opponent.</span></div></div>",

Putting her sword behind her head, she yelled \"Now shut up and die!\" as she began to run towards her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty put the cigarette in again. Grinning with sharp teeth and looking at the incoming Tigress with an<br>\r\nimmense killing intention in her eyes, she shook two long daggers out of her sleeves, grabbing them<br>\r\ntightly in her hands. \"Hear the lullaby? Rest in peace, lil'girl!\" Both cat-girls charged forward, getting closer with every second, ready to kill once being close enough. However, as they got in range, they just passed each other, and it seemed like nothing had happened. But shortly after, both of them stopped, their weapons in a position as if they had struck just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. The girls didn't move, each touching the ground with one knee. They<br>\r\ndidn't even stir a muscle though the position they were in was quite uncomfortable. Kitty was still grinning as if she was insane, while Rena's expression lacked any kind of emotion. For a short period of time, it seemed as if the world was frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty's cigarette fell out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fake tits and fat ass won't get you anywhere!\" Rena shouted, her opponent falling lifelessly to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the tigress pressed the button of her sword. First, the light stream vanished, and after<br>\r\nholding it for a bit longer, the long metal bar drew back towards the grip, shrinking down to a size more appropriate to carry around. Rena spun it in her hand like Kitty had done it with her pistols before, then hooked it up at the side of her jeans. She didn't bother looking back at her victim, instead just started walking away with her hands in her pockets, whistling a little tune along the way, her tail moving to the melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, her music and tail however stopped after a while. As she stood, she could clearly hear someone else's steps echoing from the walls.<br>\r\nAs she was confident Kitty did not survive her attack, Rena was rather relaxed when she turned around, hands still in her pockets. Behind the corpse, in the shadow of the building, she could see a man was walking towards her. He seemed to have short hair, and wore some kind of trench-coat. As he reached the dead body, he paused. Looking down at her - or rather at her cleavage, as Rena presumed - , the stranger kicked Kitty softly against the side. She moved a bit, but didn't show any signs of life. The man smiled slightly, taking one last glance at the assassin's figure before he turned his head to Rena. As the<br>\r\nman got closer, the surviving cat-girl lifted her sun-glasses in surprise. \"Hey, you're the guy who gave me the gig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\", he said, stepping into the moon light. He looked a bit like a Scandinavian with his blond hair<br>\r\nand light skin colour, but his green eyes did not fit his appearance. His trench-coat was grey, the shirt<br>\r\nunderneath white, and his trousers brown. As Rena looked at his feet, she almost wanted to put her<br>\r\nglasses on again, so brightly were his shoes shining. A red tie was hanging from his neck, moving slightly in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMARK<br>\r\nCHRISTMAS<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to check how you were doing.\", Mark said, stopping few feet in front of Rena. They were roughly on eye-height, Rena maybe being slightly larger as her sandals were lower than his shoes. \"It didn't disappoint, Miss Westfall, this was a good kill.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever\", Rena said, putting her glasses on again. \"Just give me the money and then get your sorry butt out of my sight. That bitch really pissed me off, so I'm in a bad mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Mark's face grew bigger. \"I did not intend to pay you with money.\" Just as he had spoken this out, the laser blade was suddenly dangerously close to his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, listen up.\" Rena snarled, moving her sword below his chin. \"Yesterday evening, I tried out this new Chinese restaurant. I ordered a chicken in a sweet-sour sauce with rice, lots of rice, and three glasses of the finest whine they had. It was one of the best dinners in my entire life. This morning however, when I wanted to buy a new set of bras, I found there was no money in my pocket. I had spent everything at this stupid restaurant! So, I had no choice but to grab my bras and run out of the market, carrying the underwear under my arms. You can imagine how embarrassing this was. I decided to get this job as an assassin so something like this would never happen again. So, if you dirty rat aren't going to pay me now, you can pick up your little shithead from--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I didn't intend to pay you with money\" he interrupted her, snapping his fingers. \"Not that I wouldn't pay you at all.\"<br>\r\nRena lowered her sword, feeling a sudden dizziness coming over her. Stumbling backwards, she put her hand on her forehead, automatically looking down at herself. A warm feeling came over her body, not unpleasant, concentrating at her chest. Her eyes suddenly grew extremely wide when she saw her nipples were poking through her tank-top as her breasts pushed them away from her body. Her flat torso started to gain some contour, straining her new bra as her bosom shot up an entire cup-size. Way too fast the sensation was over, leaving Rena with hard nipples and a tight bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared at herself in awe, thinking she was dreaming. Touching her breast, her nipples got even harder as she cupped the soft flesh. Lost in pleasure for a moment, Mark's voice suddenly brought her back to reality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations. Your breasts are certified B-cups now.\"<br>\r\nSnapping out of it, the tigress deactivated her sword, quickly regaining her calm attitude. \"Well, that's a little disappointing.\" she said, looking down at her chest again. \"All the trouble this morning, and now I have to buy a whole new set of bras again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would wait before doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's tail curled up.\"What do you mean?\" she asked, throwing a glance at her mysterious benefactor. She watched as he started to circle around her, not removing her sight for a second.<br>\r\n\"This town, Santa Bikini, is a city of global economic relevance. Many concerns from all over the world have built HQ's here, earning the town millions of dollars of tax money each year. However, the world is rough, and any day, these concerns could decide to leave the town and move somewhere else. So the question is: What could make the bosses of these global companies want to stay here instead of moving to Tokyo, London or New York? What does it have what these towns don't possess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stopped behind Rena for a moment. \"The answer: We have the most buxom women in the entire country.\" He started walking directly towards Rena, always observed by her. \"In other words, not only its infants, but also the city's wealth hangs directly at the chests of its female residents. To preserve this wealth, the government invented the top secret 'No more A-cups' campaign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena raised an eyebrow. \"'No more A-cups'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Mark stood right behind Rena now. \"Simply spoken, agents like me look for less developed girls like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't get cocky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We then let you fight bigger women from the Union of Busty Babes - short UBB - and give you larger<br>\r\nbreasts in return. This way, we not only eradicate all the flat-chests, but also continue to raise the average breast size as the winners continue to grow and the losers... fall out of the statistic.\" Mark moved his head next to Rena's ear, smiling like a devil as he spoke. \"So, what do you say? How about getting rid of all those women with a bigger bust than you, and aim for the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAim for the top... Rena loosened herself from Mark, looking at the ground. \"So\", she began after a while, speaking slowly, \"you will assign me a person to kill, and when I win, make me a cup-size bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came closer to Rena again. \"That's up to me. If I'm in a bad mood, I may give you less.\" Leaning over to her once more, he whispered: \"But if I'm in a good mood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Mark held out his arm to her. \"So, what's the motto?\" he asked, seeming rather confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared at the ground for a moment, sunken in thoughts. To kill for bigger breasts... to kill for<br>\r\nbeauty... to kill out of own-interest. Surely this was one of the most immoral things one could do in the world. She was not even helping someone with this except for herself, and a bunch of money-obsessed politicians. To put it extremely, the only thing Rena would do was making the world an even worse place, spreading a world view focused on money and outer appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand though, she could have a big bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smile formed on her face, showing her own fangs, a greedy expression glowing in her eyes. \"Why, isn't it obvious?\" Turning her head towards Mark, Rena grabbed his hand. \"No more A-cups, of course!\"</span></div></div>",

The beach was crowded, all kinds of humans and animal-people enjoying their day. Little children played in the water, women took sun-bathes, and men watched the women taking sunbathes.<br>\r\nOnly one spot on the otherwise cramped beach was strangely deserted. In the middle of this large, empty area, a sole woman was lying on a blue towel, dozing in the sun. She wore a small red bikini, emphasizing her female curves while exposing a generous amount of cleavage. Her short hair was dyed to fit her bikini, and she wore dark sun-glasses. Hands behind her head and legs crossed, she enjoyed the warm rays of the sun shining on her slightly tan skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow appeared in her sight, blocking the light. She didn\u2019t bother to open her eyes though. \u201cLook, darling, I\u2019m in a good mood today, so I\u2019ll give you ten seconds to get your sorry butt out of this place. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up like everyone else who was here before me: dead.\u201d<br>\r\nNot impressed by her words, Rena drew her sword. \u201cSorry, but the only one who\u2019ll leave is you! You\u2019re Killer Rack, an assassin from the UBB, and I\u2019m gonna take your head!(And bust)\u201d<br>\r\nCompletely relaxed, Rack rose her sun-glasses, revealing her poison green eyes. \u201cA cat-woman with a tiger-strapped fur and a pitiful chest\u2026\u201d, she commented her challenger. \u201cYou must be Rena Westfall, the one who beat up Titty last night - what a shame. I haven\u2019t fought in a long time, but it seems all I get is a shorty like you.\u201d<br>\r\nRena moved her sword towards Killer\u2019s throat. \u201cWhadd\u2019ya know, looks like rumors spread pretty fast among bitches. Anyway, you\u2019re the next one on my list! I hope you made a last will already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRack let her glasses fall down again. \u201cI did: All my possessions go to the most ugly and flat chested woman in town - which means I need to find a new inheritor after killing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough words - I wonder though how tough you are in battle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assassin smirked. \u201cBefore we start, could you let me go changing first?\u201d, she suddenly asked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind fighting in a bikini, but if you keep staring at me with such jealous eyes, I fear it would distract you from battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short hesitation, Rena went a step backwards. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll grant you this final wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiller Rack got up from her towel, and walked towards the changing cabins. Rena looked after her,<br>\r\nwatching for any suspicious moves. All she did though was waggling her (to Rena\u2019s dismay undeniable attractive) butt with each step. \u201cSee anything you like?\u201d, Killer taunted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be polite and say yes\u201d, Rena responded \u201csince your ass probably wasn\u2019t cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Killer entered one of the cabins. Rena turned her head towards the populated part of the beach. The women visibly enjoyed the attention they got from the male visitors, all of them wearing small two-pieces to show off their female advances\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you done?\u201d, she asked, still staring at the crowd. From inside the cabin, she could hear her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but you are.\u201d A sudden bang jolted Rena\u2019s attention back to the cabin. The door was blown off, a large projectile flying in her direction. The cat-girl quickly jumped to the side, narrowly escaping the missile. As it hit the ground behind her, a large explosion blew Rena away, sand and smoke flying through the air. Right as she landed Rena made a somersault, quickly getting on her feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiller Rack was standing before the cabin, carrying a huge rocket launcher over her shoulder. Her \u201cchange\u201d was reduced to a pair of sandals and extremely tight blue jeans, her breasts still only contained by her bikini top. \u201cNice reflexes\u201d, she grinned, taking aim at Rena again. \u201cGuess that slender figure has SOME advantages.\u201d Rena glanced at her opponent. The distance between her and Killer were around twenty meters. \u201cShould have known your fighting style is as dirty as your finger-nails!\u201d, she shouted, charging towards her opponent. With another \u201cbang\u201d Killer shot another rocket at Rena. A few inches before it could reach her, the tigress lowered her body, trying not to slow down, and leaped forward. A surge of adrenaline went through her as she jumped under the rocket, her hair streaking its metallic surface. Time seemed to be slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the rocket was past her. Feeling victorious, Rena put her feet on the sand. Without losing speed, she continued to run at Killer Rack, the rocket exploding behind her.<br>\r\nRena grinned - only a few feet left! From so close, Killer wouldn\u2019t dare to shoot. The shirtless assassin made an attempt to get away, so Rena sped up. Just before she was out of range, Rena swung her sword. The edge of her laser blade hit Killer\u2019s shoulder, slicing off one of her holders. The sword then went on and crashed right into the changing cabins. Unable to stop, Rena ran into the broken shelter, destroying what was left to them. Splinters of wood went through her fur into her skin - for a moment, Rena wished to wear more than a tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she wasn\u2019t out of danger, Rena fought her way out of the pile of broken wood, getting ready to strike again. A few feet ahead of her, Killer was stumbling forward: She wasn\u2019t heavily injured, but covered her breast with one arm so her bikini wouldn\u2019t fall down. Therefore, she could only hold her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlauncher with one hand, making it harder for her to keep balance.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sugar?\u201d, Rena smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t want me to see the scar from the operation?\u201d Killer turned around, trying to point her weapon at Rena. \u201cToo late!\u201d Jumping forward, Rena was only two steps away from her now. To Rena\u2019s surprise, Killer put on an evil grin. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me!\u201d While shouting this, the assassin turned a special trigger on her rocket launcher. A huge pile of smoke and fire suddenly shot out from the barrel, creating a huge explosion. The immense back draft threw Killer Rack backwards, away from Rena. Our heroine meanwhile had to stop because of the explosion, sliding a few inches backwards. Sand was flying against her sunglasses while the stench of gun-powder hit her sensitive nose. After flying for a few seconds, Killer dug her feet into the sand, slowly coming to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had almost passed half the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Killer pointed her launcher at Rena again, keeping her bikini top up with her elbow.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, shorty, but I\u2019m way out of your league, both in bust and battle!\u201d Firing off the next missile, Killer watched with a wicked smile as it rapidly got closer to Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl tried to plan her next move. Should she charge again? That wouldn\u2019t work, the distance was just too far. She had no choice but to sidestep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena deactivated her sword. With a huge leap, she just avoided being getting hit. The impact of the explosion however got her in mid-air, sending her flying further than she wanted. Landing rather hard, Rena rolled a few meters sideways before coming to a halt.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable!\u201d Rena heard another shot, and quickly got back on her feet. As she ran away, the humming of the missile getting louder and louder, Rena tried to think of a way to get closer to Killer. But even if she did, Killer would just blast herself out of range again, towards the ocean.<br>\r\nAn explosion send Rena flying again. This time, she couldn\u2019t linger her fall: Landing very hard, a pain surged through her leg - it was probably sprained. Cursing, Rena embraced it with both hand, trying to subdue the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Killer looked into her face, a smile formed on Rena\u2019s face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou gone nuts?\u201d, Killer asked, adjusting her top as it slid down. \u201cOr is this your normal state?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rena stood up again, trying to find a stance that wouldn\u2019t be too painful. \u201cEnjoy your little joke\u201d, she said with a devilish smile. \u201cCause it was your last one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiller chuckled. \u201cWell, I definitely enjoyed your last joke. DIE!\u201d She shot her next missile at Rena, confident it would kill her. Rena activated her sword again, holding it in both hands. Her eyes were focused on the missile, concentrated as it rapidly got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was right in front of her, Rena struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer energy sword hit the lower side of the rocket, making its nose rise up. While Rena immediately pulled her sword back, the missile turned 180 degree around itself, pointing at Killer now. With an open jaw, she watched as Rena hit the rocket again, sending it back to her like a baseball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-bitch!\u201d, she shouted, turning the trigger of her weapon. An explosion just like the previous one<br>\r\nemerged from her barrel. Killer was jolted backwards, looking at the dust cloud she had created.<br>\r\nSuddenly, it was blown away when the rocket hit the spot where she had just stood, sending more sand into the air. \u201cToo bad, shorty!\u201d, she called over to Rena. Before Killer could get back on her feet though, a shining object suddenly came out of the smoke pillar, flying directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rena\u2019s sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fuck! She threw her sword at me?!\u201d Panicking again, she activated her blowback once more. Flying backwards with high speed, she felt the air pressing against her skin. Her top slipped out below her elbow, and she lost her sunglasses during the flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid cat!\u201d, she laughed. \u201cDid you really think you could\u2026\u201d Suddenly, as she was still flying backwards, her feet touched something wet. When she looked down, she saw a wide, blue surface below her.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Shit\u2026\u201d Her body slowed down, her legs beginning to sink into the sea. The beach was already far away. With a loud shriek, Killer splashed into the water, sinking into the ocean as she clung to her weapon.<br>\r\nRena\u2019s sword meanwhile had fallen to the ground, only a few feet behind of the last explosion - it wouldn\u2019t even have reached Killer. Out of the smoke pile, a hobbling Rena emerged. She was panting, every step hurting her. She picked up her sword and, dragging her right leg behind her, walked towards the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she reached coast, Killer suddenly appeared again, gasping for air. She was knee-deep in the<br>\r\nwater, her blue jeans completely soaked. Her bikini top hung down her shoulder, leaving nothing to cover her breasts. Erected from the cold water, her nipples stood out from her, large and pink. Some of her wet hair was falling into her face, though it couldn\u2019t cover the panic and rage on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still holding her rocket launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMotherfucking Shithead-bastard!\u201d, she screamed, pointing her weapon at Rena. The distance between them was just enough for her to safely shoot. Aiming for her, she pulled the trigger, ready to hear the cat-girl screaming in pain as she was blown apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that could be heard though was the clicking of her trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne thing about gun powder\u201d, Rena coldly said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work so well when its wet - never watched \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep by step, Rena marched into the water, Killer meanwhile backing up while she desperately tried to shoot. \u201cFuck off!\u201d, she shouted, tossing her launcher away. Suddenly, the assassin shrieked in embarrassment when realizing she was topless, and covered herself with both arms. \u201cYou mothershiting fuckhead! Shitfucker! Mothershit! You... you\u2026 you MONSTER!\u201c While Rena was as cold as an ice-cube, Killer was shaking. At the same time however, she looked at Rena with immense hatred, squeezing her breasts out of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonster!\u201d, she shouted. \u201cYou damn monster! I hate you - ALL of you! You abnormal freaks with\u2026 with fur and\u2026 and tails!\u201d Killer couldn\u2019t go back anymore - the water was too deep - while Rena steadily came closer. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re one of us, just because of some laws and paragraphs! You will always be outcasts, and you know why? Cause you are MONSTERS! YOU HEAR ME?! YOU ARE\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t speak out as Rena cut off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrogant bitch!\u201d, Rena snorted, watching the head fly into the ocean. Shortly after, the decapitated body fell backwards, also splashing into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena put back her sword, she heard someone clapping. \u201cSplendid, Miss Westfall, splendid!\u201d Turning around, she saw Mark standing at the edge of the water. He wore the same clothes as yesterday, except for a pair of sunglasses. Looking closer, she realized it were the glasses Killer had lost during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d, she said, putting a hand on her injured leg. \u201cI got pretty ramped up\u2026 can you do something about it?\u201d<br>\r\nHolding his hands up, he signaled to her he had nothing to share. \u201cMy humble apologies, but I\u2019m afraid my abilities are restricted to women\u2019s breasts. Speaking of which\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click of his fingers, Rena felt a familiar warmth in her chest. Smiling, she watched her modest B-bust blowing up in her top, the fur on her breasts pressed against the fabric. Only a slight bump on her body from the side view, her decent bosom reached forward, curving out her figure. The rising amount of flesh inside them made her breasts swell into every directions, continuing their transformation into perfect spheres. As her coat of fur lightened up, more of her sensitive skin pressed was released, sending a slight shiver over Rena\u2019s spine as her breasts began to touch each other. She felt them starting to slightly hang down, still remaining quite firm though for their size. Needing drastically more space, her expanding chest tore at her already tight top, making it slid up her body. Originally torso-covering, her top slowly slid up, revealing her furry belly as she grew a pair of large grapefruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of her breasts rubbing against each other put Rena\u2019s mind on the loose: Putting her hands on her breasts, she clenched her soft fur balls, squeezing them inside her palms. As she closed her eyes, Rena gave in to the numerous sensations, waves of pleasure surging through her body. Throwing her head into her neck, the cat-girl fondled her bosom, letting her tongue fall from her mouth. The growth didn\u2019t last long anymore, stopping at D-cups, but Rena continued her massage, still standing in the water. Mark meanwhile seemed neither to be offended nor erected by Rena - he just kept looking at her his transparent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena finished enjoying herself, she looked at Mark again, her tongue hanging out of her mouth. \u201cHow do you do that, anyway?\u201d, she asked, taking her hands off her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrade secret.\u201d, he replied. Her agent then turned his back towards Rena, walking away. The newly endowed cat-girl meanwhile stared down at herself, happy she couldn\u2019t see her belly anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care anyway.\u201d, she said, jumping a bit. With delight, she watched her breasts<br>\r\ncontinued to move even as she stopped, the admirable mounds of flesh bouncing slightly. \u201cI just hope you are a bit more generous next time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d Rena walked out of the water, her leg already feeling much better. Her gaze then wandered towards the crowd of people. It did not seem they had noticed the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about witnesses?\u201d, she asked. \u201dCan\u2019t imagine this \u2018No more A-cups\u2019 campaign is something the public knows about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have already taken care of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have not told them the old story of a gas leak and hallucinations, have you?<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, we aren\u2019t that cheap - we didn\u2019t tell them anything, we DID set off a gas leak to cause hallucinations among the beach visitors. They probably thought your battle was one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are always special cases we have to take care of \u2026 \u201cindividually\u201d .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena chuckled. \u201cNot my problem.\u201d Focusing her gaze on Mark again, a friendly smile formed on her face. \u201cJust tell my who\u2019s next on the list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rena believed Mark was raising an eye-brow. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to rest a bit? You\u2019re injured, and you also have to get used to your new body. If you aren\u2019t in top form, any step could be your last during a fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s smile grew wider. \u201cWhat, are you worried?\u201d Mark cleared his throat.\u201cIt would just be a waste to lose someone as ambitious as you - I think you have good potential to get into the top.\u201d That made Rena blush slightly. \u201cOf course, if you really want, I tell you the location of your next opponent. I recommend though you take a break first. You could also test the \u201creactions\u201d of others to your new body\u201d, he added with a sly glance at his client. \u201dSo, what shall it be?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nA harsh wind blew through the desert town, carrying sand, dust and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, actually, it was only carrying sand and dust. But Rena was sure to provide the last one\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the bus she took a look at the wooden barracks and dusty streets in front of her. This was Santa Biquini, the wild west heritage of Santa Bikini, located a few miles outside of town. While Bikini was a relatively young city, Biquini\u2019s foundation was dated only a few decades after the first settlers had arrived in the east. It had once been a popular resting place for travelers, until it went bankrupt a hundred years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany people were quite surprised when learning Santa Bikini was built near one of earth\u2019s roughest deserts. Even more were surprised hearing people had once lived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What weird place for a battle\u2019, the cat-girl thought, hearing as the bus drove off. Rena walked into the forsaken town, dragging her injured leg slightly behind her. As she passed typical wild west huts, like a prison and a saloon, she remembered Killer Rack\u2019s ambush at the beach, and drew her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd truly, right as she had activated her laser blade, a screaming woman with a katana jumped out of the grocery store, aiming for Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena blocked the blow just in time. The shockwave of the impact send Rena\u2019s breasts jiggling, the air<br>\r\nsizzling as she crossed swords with her opponent. All Rena could see of her was a mad grin, and a pair of blood red eyes. The extra weight of the other fighter was putting down on Rena, causing the pain in her leg to shoot up, so Rena pushed her sword forward. With a furious battle cry she broke the metal sword into pieces, shreds of iron flying around the two fighters Still wearing that insane smile Rena\u2019s opponent jumped back, right to the opposite side of the street. Her long brown hair was going down to her knees, almost reaching the end of her brown leather boots. A short, sleeveless dress with a cow-pattern covered most of her body - as an accessory to it, she had a cow-bell tied around her neck. What attracted Rena most though was the deep rift at its front, exposing an alley of cleavage as it reached down to her belly. Her breasts, roughly a cup-size larger than Rena\u2019s, stood out firmly from her body, despite lacking the support of a bra - that thought made Rena glance down at her own chest: Though her breasts hung down a bit, they were far away from what one would call saggy. Still, Rena decided it would be best to buy a bra for them soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at her enemy she just now noticed the huge sword she wore at her back, easily out-sizing its owner. When looking into her eyes again, a certain feeling of uneasiness began to spread through Rena\u2019s body. Radiating an immense murderous intent, Rena's opponent looked like she wanted to kill Rena with her stare alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, the mad looking woman threw her broken blade away. \u201cSo, ya\u2019re the kitten that slain\u2019d two of our gals, ain\u2019t cha?\u201d Rena could barely understand her due to the heavy accent and constant laughter. \u201cDaaaame, you really r \u2018n vulgar gal, ain\u2019t cha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that irony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you \u2018The Cleavage\u2019?\u201d, Rena asked - though the answer was rather obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was even possible, her maniac smile grew even wider. \u201cDame right I aim! But ya may as well call m \u2018Mercy!\u2019\u201d Cleavage then took a fighting stance, grabbing the hilt of her giant sword, \u201cCAUSE THAT\u2019LL BE ALL YA SAY WHEN I STRIKE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both hands she drew, hovering the massive blade above her head. Cracking completely now, the insane assassin laughed hysterically as she charged towards Rena. \u201cYA PIECE OF SHIT!\u201d, she screamed, her body shivering in excitement. \u201cTHEY SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE TAKEN YA OUT OF YA CAGE!\u201d Leaping into the air, she let out a battle cry, half scream and half laughter. The image of the calm cat-girl reflected in Cleavage\u2019s murderous eyes as the psycho sword fighter prepared to strike. \u201cYA\u2019R DEAD, AIN-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud shatter echoed through the city. With a single swing of her sword, Rena had splintered Cleavage\u2019s sword to pieces. The assassin was cut in two at her waist, still having that insane look in her eyes. Her upper half crashed into a building, while the skirt fell off from her lower half, revealing her pink undergarments as it sank down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena deactivated her sword. \u201cJeez, just shut up, will ya?\u201d, she sighed. \u201cThere should be laws against talking like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood quickly lightened up though as she heard a familiar snipping, followed by an also familiar tingle in her chest. With a smile almost as wicked as Cleavage\u2019s, Rena watched the swelling of her beloved bosom, stretching her already tight tank-top. Cupping her breasts, Rena felt the soft flesh pressing against her hands, purring as they blew out in every direction, a slight pain in her back beginning to arise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it. After not even a half cup-size, the growth was already over. \u201cHey! Are you kidding<br>\r\nme?\u201d, Rena grumped, looking around. She found Mark was standing at the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cYou drunk or what? Make my breasts bigger, dammit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Mark wasn\u2019t drunk, though his voice sounded a bit raspy. \u201cSorry, sugar, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ll give you for now.\u201d That said, he turned his back to her, and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait a second!\u201d Snorting, Rena went after him. Her heavy steps made her breasts hop up and<br>\r\ndown, while a slight pain was surging through her leg. \u201cI know you said it\u2019s up to you how big I\u2019ll get, but come on! This... this was practically nothing. If anything I filled out my D cup, but I didn't get any bigger! I thought your job was to increase the average bust size of our town! What the fuck is this be good for, huh? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stopped, looking backwards. He saw Rena was standing directly behind him. \"Yes, but I also told<br>\r\nyou my generosity depends on my mood, right?\u201d The agent turned away again. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in a bad mood right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a hand grabbing his throat. Enraged, Rena dragged Mark towards her, tightening her grip on him. \u201cSo you gave me this excuse for a growth cause you had a bad day?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't use such simple terms, but yes that is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d, she yelled. Her outburst send her chest jiggling, something that distracted Mark a little from her furious face. \u201cI agreed on this because I wanted big tits, not to be dependent on the mood swings of some mysterious guy in a trench coat! So you\u2019ll give me a nice pair of milk jugs now, or I\u2019ll show you what it means to have a REALLY bad day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnimpressed Mark gently put Rena\u2019s hand off his body. \u201cSorry, but I can only use my powers once per day, independent of how I use them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you just made that up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but I wouldn\u2019t grow you more anyway. I just don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let me fight the next one!\u201d, Rena now tried to convince him. \"Hey, let's just go for broke: Let me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfight six or seven of them at once. If they are anything like this idiot, it will be easy. I\u2019ll take on any of those bitches anytime!\u201c<br>\r\nShe then felt Mark's eyes virtually piercing through her body. \u201cDon\u2019t get too full of yourself. You\u2019re still a rookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sick of it!\u201d, she yelled, pointing her finger at his chest. \u201cI wanna rise up into the next level! I wanna fight the strongest fighters with the biggest busts! I wanna get breasts so huge I can\u2019t stand straight anymore, so enormous they touch the ground! I wanna lay down at the beach among those other bitches, get stared at by more men than all together, and feel their envy when I walk around with a harem of hot guys behind me! So if you don\u2019t intend to give me a proper boob boost because your girlfriend dumped you or something, at least let me fight so many assassins I get big tits anyway!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark displayed no emotion, keeping his cold, supreme glare. \u201cFine\u201d, he eventually said \u201cYou want big breasts, and you want them quick? Then how about this: We can do it your way and I'll let you fight the next opponent on the list as fast as possible, or\u2026\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr?\u201d, Rena asked, eager to hear his offer. The agent took in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr you\u2019ll prove me you can fight \u2018any of those bitches anytime\u2019 by going against a higher ranked UBB member - not upper-class, but let\u2019s say the best in your current league. You may call it a \u2018boss battle\u2019 if you like. If you are able to defeat her, I\u2019ll grow you to a size that hopefully sedates you for a while.\u201d Seeing the childish happiness in Rena\u2019s face, Mark quickly added: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate her! The person we are talking about is not as arrogant as the ones you have fought - she is well aware of her limits, which are pretty high by the way. She has stopped climbing up the rank-ladder some time ago, but be warned. She defends her current position like no one else. I already lost a couple of girls to her, so think it through before you agree!\u201d<br>\r\nRena pondered for a moment. One on hand, this was a welcome shortcut on her way to a voluptuous body - but it was a quite risky one, especially since her leg was still hurting, and her breasts started to hinder her\u2026 Then again, could she really let such a great chance just slip away? Not only she would obtain a huge rack as a reward, she could also prove Mark what she was really capable of. If she won this battle, maybe he would assign her to even stronger opponents, making her grow quickly to the bustiest woman in town, if not in the country - or maybe, of the entire\u2026<br>\r\nIt was just too good of opportunity to pass up. \"Sign me up for that boss battle Mark, and I'll show you what I can do.\"</span></div></div>",

A cab drove on the parking lot, only stopping for a short moment to let out a tiger-striped cat-girl before leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked at the large building in front of her. It was a modeling studio, where photographers<br>\r\nsnapped pictures of beautiful woman in front of fake backdrops of beaches, snow mountains, and any other background they needed. There was a main entrance for visitors, but she thought that description wouldn\u2019t fit her right. A bit off center, there was a side entrance for employees, guarded by two men in black suits. \u2018That\u2019s better\u2019, Rena thought with a grin. \u2018Once I\u2019m done with this bitch, they\u2019ll probably want to hire me.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked towards the entrance, a bother she had ignored until now became annoyingly present. Though she was happy her large D-cups\u2019 moved with every step she made, the constant up and down began to hurt. Also, the extra weight on her chest started to drag, her shoulders already feeling pretty stiff. Sighing, Rena placed her hands on the small of her back and stretched it, the fabric of her red tank-top tightening around her. As she watched the motions of her mammaries, a slight fear arose inside her mind. Were her breasts sagging more than before? Quickly Rena shook her head. Not in such a short<br>\r\ntime! She only had actual breasts since last night, and the last battle was just some hours ago. Still, Rena decided to follow Mark\u2019s advice and buy a new bra after the fight. \u2018If they even sell my size in regular shops\u2019, she thought when remembering her agent\u2019s promise, smiling from ear to ear as she arrived at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d, one of the guards asked her. The other one just stared forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl put a hand on her hip. \u201cDo you greet all women so friendly?\u201d, she smirked. \u201cNo surprise theyassigned you to guard the side entrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis colleague kept looking in the distance. \u201cMiss, you do not work here. Either you take the main entrance as a visitor or leave.\u201d<br>\r\nActing offended, Rena folded her arms beneath her chest, giving the breasts a bit of a lift. \u201cNow how can you tell I don't work here?\u201d In a more seductive tone, she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I have the qualities?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no interest from the second guy. \u201cMiss, there is a photo-shoot with one of our top models taking<br>\r\nplace right now. We have clear orders to let nobody enter. Now, please leave or we have to take actions against you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena paused for a moment, but then smiled. She took off her sun-glasses, pulling out a flirtatious face. \u201cReally?\u201d She made a step forward, her face only an inch apart from the guard\u2019s. A bit confused he looked into her eyes, feeling a pair of perky breasts pressed into his chest. \u201cWhat kind of actions?\u201d<br>\r\n\"Uh... well... uh...\" The first guarded stuttered. Rena's smile just widened at his response, revealing in fact that with her new breasts she made this guard speechless. Still, she did have to get inside, and hitting on a plan Rena leaned in a bit further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her lips against his, Rena gave the startled guard a long, deep kiss. With lips still locked, she<br>\r\npushed him against the wall, squeezing her bosom between their bodies as she grinded her hips against his. Finally, the other guard's composure was destroyed as he finally turned to watch the cat-girl who made out with his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss ended, and Rena gave the first guard one final smile. Then, to the great shock of the second<br>\r\nguard, she sliced his partner in two. The two halves to his body crumpled to the ground, the laser sword leaving a clean, cauterized cut.<br>\r\nThe second guard panicked, starting to reach for his gun. Rena, however, was faster as she swung her sword again, giving the man a clean cut in the chest. As the second guard's vision began to fade, his body falling to the ground, one last thought went through his mind, \u2018Couldn\u2019t she have at least kissed me, too?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena put her sun-glasses on again. \u201cSorry, but you fight just as lousy as your partner kisses.\u201d Moving past the dead bodies Rena opened the door. There was a long hallway in front of her, doors at both sides leading to the studios and the models\u2019 cabins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer opponent, Mark had told her, was in Studio 4. She walked into the building, looking at the signs on the doors as she passed them. The deeper she marched into the studio, the more her heart began to pound. She tried to imagine what she would look after the battle, wondering how much bigger Mark intended to make her. Two more cups at least, she thought, if not even three or four\u2026 or five\u2026<br>\r\nOf course, she was also getting more nervous. If this lady was even half as strong as Mark had told her, it would be a tough battle. And though she hated to admit it, her leg still did hurt a bit from the fight against Killer Rack, and she hadn\u2019t gotten completely used to her breasts yet. Maybe it would have been better to rest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the model\u2019s cabins was slightly open. As Rena walked past it, she dared a glance inside. A blond woman was standing in front of a mirror, posing around in a quite narrow bikini. The small top contained a pair of breasts several cup-sizes above Rena\u2019s, standing firmly out from her body while presenting a deep, wobbling cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena quickened her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she reached a door with a four emblazoned on it. Inside, she could hear the clicking of a camera. The tigress took in a deep breath, putting all her courage together. Leaving all doubts behind she opened the door, ready for anything that could await her.<br>\r\nFlashes of light greeted Rena as she entered the studio. The cat-girl blinked a few times, trying to look at the scenery in front of her. A beach panorama screen was built up, enlightened by numerous photography lights. In front of the screen, a photographer was taking shots of a single model. Fitting to the background the black-haired woman was dressed in a small, black bikini. Also, she had a chain bracelet hanging loosely off her wrist and a spiky collar attached around her neck. Her bleak, almost bleached skin added to her overall gothic appearance, alongside the dark make-up she wore, including heavy black lip stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s attention however was mainly drawn towards her body\u2019s proportions. Though she could only see her from the front, Rena was sure her butt would guarantee numerous stares wherever she passed, seeing how her hips stood out from her figure. But as voluminous and voluptuous her rear probably was, the rich front she provided didn\u2019t rank behind in any way. A pair of massive globes jiggled inside the tiny bikini top that only covered a triangle-shaped area around her nipples, leaving free view on the rest of her female charms. The threads of her bikini weren\u2019t very tight so they didn\u2019t damage the breasts' round form, her bosom however still amazingly firm despite the lacking support. Still, her chest's movements were quite tremendous as the model<br>\r\nchanged from one provocative pose to another, the mounds of flesh bobbing and jiggling each time her body shifted. Yet, through it all, the model kept a straight face no matter how obscure the position she took.<br>\r\nThere was no doubt this was the person she looked for: The notorious hit woman and famous photo-model, Bikinihilist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena watched as her target bent her legs behind her head while doing a handstand, presenting her rear to the camera. She had the skill of contortionist, putting her body in such strange posses. And that butt- it really was just as appealing as her chest, and as lousily covered.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be nice if you knock before entering a room, especially when we are in the middle of a session.\u201d Rena heard a monotonous voice speak to her. \u201cNot that it really matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth-model put her feet back on the ground, holding her body up with all four of her limbs. \u201cI presume you are Bikinihilst\u201d, Rena guessed, her eyes focused on the woman\u2019s plunging neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rena\u2019s opponent stood back up again, her breasts dropping down as she straightened her back. Pumpkins were a good word to classify them - not the overly large ones you see at Halloween, but still remarkable for a cup-size. \u201cCall me what you want, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Bikinihilst offered, taking the most simple pose a busty model could take - leaning forward. She continued to talk in a voice Rena thought only a zombie could speak in, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call me, what you think about me, or what you want from me. Who you are is of even less<br>\r\nimportance.\u201d Her upper body formed a straight line, her breasts nearly falling out of their light cover as they swayed in her tiny bikini. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s all sad emptiness engulfing our lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightly dressed goth-girl who hated life and talked philosophically sounding nonsense. Could this get any more clich\u00e9?<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Rena Westfall!\u201d, our heroine declared. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to take your head! And bust!\u201d Maybe this could become her catchphrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither because of Rena\u2019s words or because it was part of the shooting the goth-model took in a deep breath, pumping her mighty mounds to the limit, before releasing the air in a long, exaggerated sigh. \u201cAnd what good you think will that do?\u201d, she asked. Still bending forward, she pulled her left leg behind her ear, standing only on one foot now. \u201cI was once just like you, ambitious, cocky, hot-blooded and careless. I was confident I could defeat anyone, be the best, the strongest, the biggest.\u201d She turned her upper-body to the side, her foot pointing at the roof, her upper breast falling on the lower one. \u201cI thought the higher I climb, the more the void in my heart would fill, until I could finally leave the sadness of my past behind and live the life I had<br>\r\nalways dreamed of. That\u2019s what you think too, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn\u2019t answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The photographer started to walk around her, taking shots from all possible ankles. \u201cNo matter how many I killed, no matter how strong I became, no matter how big my boobs got, there were always more to come at me, to fight me, to tease me with even larger tits. Instead of feeling satisfied, the pressure just became heavier and heavier. An even larger hole formed in my heart - and my pocket, since suiting clothes for these are pretty expensive .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sigh, this time definitely not played. \u201cAfter I finally realized the road I walked was a dead end, I gave up. Now I simply try to pass the time I have left in this world, waiting for fate to finally release me from the pain living causes.\u201d The assassin stretched, tightening her already firm figure. \u201cIf you seek death, then go ahead and fight me. But it would be more wise if you just turn around, forget about this whole \u201cNo more A-cups\u201d business and live the rest of your little life in ignorance and boredom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking dead serious, Rena grabbed one of her breasts. \u201cYou see this?\u201d, she asked, squeezing the squishy sphere slightly. \u201cNot so long ago, many people greeted me with \u201cMister\u201d, or stared at me in disbelief when I told them my age. Other girls constantly teased me, and boys ran off whenever they saw someone more endowed than me - which was pretty much everybody. Now people can only mistake me for a transvestite, and the first thing guys look at isn't my face when I talk to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you stop? The UBB would still let you leave at your current level. But if you rise any higher, you won\u2019t be able to get out anymore. You will be trapped, forever caught in a never ending cycle of dead and combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl dropped her boob. \u201cYou said the battles created a void inside you\u201d, she said, a jiggle going through her jugs. \u201cWell, maybe something like that will happen to me too - but I won\u2019t let it get in the way of my dreams. If there is a hole in my heart, my tits will fill it. I will continue to grow and grow and grow, until there is no more room to go up. I may struggle on the way, I may get messed up, even so far I nearly die. But I will continue to move on, no matter the burden I have to carry. Cause I\u2019m gonna reach the top!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence, the only sounds those of the camera. \u201cI see\u201d, the goth-model eventually said. \u201cIt really is a shame then.\u201d After taking a close up from her chest, the photographer stepped out of the spotlights, leaving the women alone.<br>\r\nIn a quick motion, the top-heavy killer straightened her body. Putting one hand on her hip she glared at Rena, waiting for her bosom to stop before she continued. \u201cYour greed for beauty makes you blind to any kind of reason. Well, I guess I have no choice then.\u201d Putting one leg forward she changed into a fighting stance, her arm pointing towards Rena. \u201cI\u2019ll release you from the burden of life so you won\u2019t have to endure it anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade of Rena\u2019s sword gleamed in a blue light. \u201cYour soul is shrouded in darkness, miss. Let\u2019s see if I can enlighten you before I rip it out of your body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, quit that melodramatic emo-shit, I'm tired of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth assassins rushed forward. In full run, Rena swung her sword. The goth-model simply bent<br>\r\nbackwards, evading Rena\u2019s strike while moving her arm forward. Faster than Rena could react she was struck at the side, a sharp pain shooting through the cat-girl as both fighters passed each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena put a hand on her side, her breasts jiggling as she stopped. Considering she had only been graced by an unarmed attack, it hurt quite much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at her hand, she saw its fur was spilled with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes wide open Rena looked at the spot where she had been hit. A tear gaped in her tank-top,<br>\r\nrevealing a small wound above her hip. Neither was it deep nor was the bleeding really serious - still, Rena stared at it as if she had been split in two.<br>\r\nBikinihilist was standing backwards to her, blood dripping from her hand. \u201cWhat, is that all the resolve you got?\u201d, she asked, licking her fingers clean. Her voice was as cold and emotionless as ever, but Rena believed she heard a hint of disappointment in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA malicious grin suddenly formed on the tigress\u2019 face, revealing her sharp fangs. \u201cMark really didn\u2019t<br>\r\nexaggerate!\u201d, she laughed \u201cYou truly are a demon!\u201d Turning towards her opponent, Rena grabbed the hilt of her sword with both hands. \u201cBut that\u2019ll make the reward only more worthwhile!\u201d<br>\r\nThe cat-girl dashed forward, swinging her sword towards the femme fatale. The photographer watched as the two killers clashed, his camera prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill after the perfect shot, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The photographer turned his head, seeing a man in a trench coat step out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite unusual for you to show up before the end\u201d, he noted the newcomer\u2019s arrival, his attention already back on the busty brawlers. Mark chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be helped, I guess. It is a special event, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth-model sidestepped a horizontal blow, instantly jutting her arm towards Rena\u2019s face. Barely the cat-girl evaded, getting slightly scratched on her cheek. \u201cJust another rookie getting her ass wiped\u201d, the photographer commented on situation, taking pictures of the bouncing bodies. \u201cCan\u2019t really believe you take another try after what happened to your other girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark watched as Rena continued to strike around, swinging her sword as violently as her bosom. Her<br>\r\nopponent didn\u2019t rank behind in any as she dodged all attacks seemingly effortless. \u201cWell, I always<br>\r\npreferred \u201ctrial and error\u201d over \u201clive and learn\u201d.\u201d None of his muscles twitched as Rena took another hit, this time on her arm. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not me taking a try, but Rena. That makes her already better than your girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the rate of attacks from Bikinihilist increased, forcing Rena to go into defense. \u201cNihi is just<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndisappointed her bigger bust didn\u2019t make her dreams come true.\u201d \u201cSomeone like her got dreams?\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore. In the end, it seems she became inpatient and gave up on everything.\u201c The counter tactic now fully turned into an aggressive fighting style, the pale arms of Bikinihilist aiming for Rena\u2019s vital spots. Feeling the situation turn to her bad, the tigress constantly shifted from side to side, trying lure the striking hands into her blade. But no matter how fast she moved, her opponent was always a bit faster. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to waken her lust for battle again, but it was a waste of time. All I can do now as her agent is arrange those photo sessions and rank battles so she at least has a little meaning in her life left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shook his head, smiling slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been too soft, Ryu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould say the same about you. You\u2019ve got a reputation to fall in love with your ladies.\u201d Ryu, the<br>\r\nphotographer, offered. Mark chose silence as his reply while Ryu took more pictures. The battle<br>\r\ncontinued for a while with Rena getting injured more and more often. Her top was taking most of the<br>\r\ndamage, getting cuts and holes in it that grew larger as the fabric was strained by Rena's jiggling breasts, the speed of their bouncing increasing as the tigress had to move faster and faster to stay head of Bikinihilist.<br>\r\n\u201cTalking about reputations, at least Nihi got one for being the best woman in the minor league - not the most charming title I admit, but more than anything you have in store.\u201d With a spacious move Rena struck her sword, but the goth-model simply dived beneath it. The speed in which she ducked and came up again left Rena open for a second, her opponent using this instant for an attack. In the very last moment Rena stepped back, the strike only streaking her shirt. The black skull on her top was ripped apart, revealing a hole full of firm cleavage. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, this cat-girl is actually the only horse in your stable right now, isn\u2019t she? It\u2019s been also a long time since you brought someone into the upper ranks. According to rumors, the higher-ups are already throwing an eye on you - not in a good way, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena\u2019s agent shrugged. \u201cSo what? You tryin\u2019 to scare me?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s quite brave of you to send her into battle. Especially since it\u2019s one she can\u2019t win.\u201d<br>\r\nIn a sudden move Bikinihilist\u2019s leg shot forward, kicking Rena right into the stomach. The impact put her body in motion, the tigress flying right into a wall. Grasping her stomach she fell on the ground, Rena gritting her teeth as she landed hard on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this is your limit\u201d, the goth-model noted, putting a hand on her hip. Slowly, she stepped<br>\r\nforward, looking down on the beaten up cat-girl. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance to turn around and leave.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll never give u-\u201c Her heroic speech was suddenly interrupted by a swell of coughs. A shadow then was cast upon Rena. Standing in front of her, the figure of Bikinihilist towered over Rena, the gaze of the cat-girl getting lost at the view of Bikinihilist 's vast under cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the cheerless woman lifted her leg, stretching her appealing backside. \u201cFine\u201d, she said, her voice even colder than usual. \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. If you live, if you die, if I crush you now, if you get a heart attack in sixty years - in the end, it is all the same.\u201d Her foot stopped next to her ear, her legs forming an straight line to the ground. \u201cI might as well deliver the finishing blow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu prepared his camera, zooming in on the two assassins. \u201cThis will be my best shot.\u201d, he murmured, ready to pull the trigger. Mark looked at the woman on the ground. Her breath was short, she had injuries all over her body, and some of her bones were probably broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe won\u2019t lose.\u201d<br>\r\nJust as the goth-model dropped her leg, Rena jumped to the side, her sunglasses falling from her nose. The floor crackled at the impact of the attack, the sudden dodge startling Bikinihilist and her agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I have a theory\u201d, Mark continued, his girl jumping to her feet and charging forward. For a second, the gleaming blade was right in front of Bikinihilist\u2019s face, it\u2019s light reflecting in her dark pupils. Time seemed to stand still, the goth-model\u2019s eyes wide open while Rena\u2019s were narrow from concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost agents pick their women with battle power in mind - usually former soldiers, assassins or other experienced fighters. They offer them the bigger breasts, the fame, and entice them into the UBB. I was once like this as well, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword flew over Nihi\u2019s head as she ducked, immediately pulling her arm back. \u201cBitch!\u201d, she shouted, striking forward. The tigress twisted her body to the side to dodge the blow, swinging her sword downward at the same time. In a quick motion the goth-model rolled to the side, aiming for Rena\u2019s legs with her feet. The cat-girl hopped, evading the kick, a massive jiggling emerging as the girls\u2019 bodies stopped. Both fighters looked fiercely at each other, their bodies moving wildly as they continued their deadly dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLosing two of my girls has opened my eyes. Experience isn't the only thing that matters in a battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick strike hit Rena on her hand, her blade deactivating as she lost grip on it. At the same time,<br>\r\nBikinihilist went through her legs, brushing Rena\u2019s jeans with her bounteous bosom. In a second she was back on her feet behind the tigress, hovering her arm into the air. All had happened in the blink of an eye - surely it was too fast for her challenger to react. She would fall without even realizing what had<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhappened. A sensation she had long lost arose inside the bleak beauty, her eyes wavering as she swung her palm towards Rena\u2019s neck, seeing the backside of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inch before the kill, she was suddenly staring into Rena\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving grabbed her sword again, the cat-girl held the hilt right at her opponent\u2019s belly. The motion continued, Bikinihilist's arm swinging at Rena. Just as the her hand touched the tigress's fur, Rena activated the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt going through her, the hit woman stopped. Only her bosom kept moving, the gothic assassin feeling it sway in her small bikini. For some reason, she had to remember all the battles she had fought for these mounds, all the pain, the losses, the embarrassment, but also the lust and the joy they had brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she felt was a pain inside her stomach, the laser blade burning right through her innards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu\u2019s camera hit the ground, the agent shocked. He had seen Bikinihilist's move, the one that should have ended the tigress's life. No one as inexperienced as her could have avoided the attack. But, then again she didn't avoid the attack. She just struck more quickly, which itself seemed just as impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing that matters in a battle is will-power\u201d, Mark told his baffled colleague. \u201cRena may be a rookie, but she has something all others lack. Most woman are recruited for the power and fame, and the bigger breasts will help them achieve some other dream. For Rena, it's all about the breasts. She doesn't have another dream that can be achieved by having a larger bust, the dream is to have a larger bust. To be bigger, the biggest, and because of that she has greater drive than even the best of the UBB.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl leaned in to her opponent, pressing their chests together. In Bikinihilist's dark eyes, she believed to see a small glimpse of regret. \u201cSeems like I did enlighten you\u201d, Rena remarked.<br>\r\nBlood run down her black lips, the goth-model looking furiously at Rena. \u201cDamn\u2026 you\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised you are so shocked, or is your death one of the few things that matters?\u201d<br>\r\nIt was getting hard to breath for Bikinihilist. Slowly, the world around her became blurry, the few colors in the studio fading off. \u201cTch - guess I could thank you for releasing me from the misery we call life. But know this. Though it may sound retarded from my mouth, it\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter that you beat me.\u201d Rena felt the burden on her sword getting heavier, the pierced woman losing the strength to stand for herself. \u201cIn the end\u2026 you will only regret\u2026 that I didn't kill you here and now. If you want to see your dreams come true\u2026 you'll have to\u2026 you'll have to\u2026 to witness\u2026 your night\u2026 mares\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fast move Rena pulled the sword out of her opponent. Closing her eyes, the defeated fighter fell backwards, seeing her life go by before her eyes. The image of Rena in front of her became blurred, transforming into the picture of a cheerful girl in colorful clothes, having a small bust, but big plans - an echo of her past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her last moment, Bikinihilist smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gothic fighter hit the ground, her eyes falling shut as life left her body. Only her breasts continued to wobble for a few moments, steadily slowing down. Once they stopped the assassin was completely motionless.<br>\r\nRena deactivated her sword, panting in exhaustion. Silence fell over the studio. Dropping the hilt Rena finally fell on her butt, letting out a long sigh. Her bust went up and down as she took heavy breaths, testing the limits of her ripped up top. She had scratches all over her body, more or less severe, each breath or other move hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain and fatigue soon were replaced though by a rising warmth inside her, concentrating at her<br>\r\nchest. A tingle engulfed her bosom, more intense than any before, flushes of hormones surging through her veins. Gasping, Rena felt the fur on her breasts straightening up, her whole body shaking at the impulse. A pair of pointy hills poked through the front of her top, almost piercing two more holes, her nipples reaching their maximum length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rena was short taken. Once she got over the surprise though excitement filled the cat-girl. With a smile from their owner the dormant domes started to pulsate, their movements sending an electrifying prickle through Rena. Then, with another gasp from her, it begun: Little by little, her bust line reached out, each beat of her heart tightening the fabric of her clothes. Whenever she gained a pound Rena let out little moan, only barely audible, her inner arousal still pretty shallow. Under heavy stretching the hole on her front extended, presenting more of Rena\u2019s female advantages the more she developed. Already stout before the breasts curved into new dimensions, the squeeze in her top<br>\r\ngradually rising as the room inside it shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut although her proportions shifted quite towards Rena\u2019s likings, one thing confused her: Why did she only grow in those small bursts? Before she could think it out however the rate of her moans suddenly accelerated, her voice getting higher with each blow. The distance between the spurts decreased, the amount of gained bust meanwhile increasing, until turning into one constant growth. Her mouth still open, Rena fell silent, too overwhelmed to bring out a sound(though after a while, she began to purr lustfully).<br>\r\nAs the prospering globes occupied most of the space in her tank-top, Rena\u2019s belly-button soon was released from its cover, the red fabric climbing up and turning a bit pale from the stretching. Her top looked like it could explode any moment, the pressure seemingly constraining her growth, overflowing masses of flesh spilling out of her cleavage and any available hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving their days as D-cups behind her breasts swelled through the E-field, striding away from domes towards a more globular form. The sides of her meat buns already graced her arms, Rena\u2019s feminine attributes almost overlapping her shoulders. With each inch they grew, her \u201ccleavage hole\u201d enlarged, the fabric ripping towards her neck. The other tears began to widen as well, bit by bit revealing the full appeal of her furry milk jugs. But even as the fabric stretched and began to rip, small hints of pain mixed into Rena\u2019s arousal. The fabric was to tight, cutting into her slowly as she grew larger. Still, relief came soon enough as one side of her tank top failed. In a flash of<br>\r\nripping fabric one breast was released, immediately jumping forward, celebrating its freedom with some joyful leaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one hindrance was gone the expansion sped up, Rena catching up to the goth-girl. Unable to carry<br>\r\nthe overload on her torso the tigress bowed forward, using her arms to support her chest as she<br>\r\nwatched her breasts slowly grow their way towards the ground, swaying in the air. With their increase in bulk the fur on them thinned out, each individual hair clearly visible. As if it was aware of its lacking cover, new fur suddenly sprouted out of Rena\u2019s bosom, coating it again under an orange pelt. Even between her mighty mounds she could feel the tiny hairs growing inside her neckline, the cat-girl giggling and jiggling as they tickled the sensitive area.<br>\r\nTrembling in delight, Rena glanced at her wobbling meat-pillows. Last night, she had been just some flat cat-girl in a big town, an empty branch waving in the wind. Now that branch sported some of the most luscious fruits on the planet, and was still flourishing. With the rest of her top breaking apart her breasts shot forward, completely free and rivaling honeydews in size. The breasts began to wedge themselves between Rena's extended arms, which were still keeping her from falling flat on the floor. The sensitivity of her skin in combination with the squeeze of her breasts was exhilarating. The hormones in her body set free by the still ongoing growth and the joy of seeing her dreams unfold right before her brought<br>\r\ntears into Rena\u2019s eyes, the smile on her face brighter than anything the two agents had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same suspicious smile as always, Mark stepped forward just as the growth began to reach its end. \u201cCongratulations, Miss Westfall.\u201d, he complemented her, \u201cYou defeated the boss and are now a certified... I'd say G cup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rena sat up, carefully watching each movement of her breasts. Like Bikinihilist\u2019s they jiggled at every move, but were also just as firm even though Rena was topless! Her nipples were almost at the centers of her breasts, the flesh only slightly falling down on her rips. Fearing they would feel a bit too stiff - and because it was tempting her - Rena gave her jugs a soft squeeze. The stout flesh gave some resistance, but she still pushed out a nice amount of breast meat. And the sensitivity - just the bare touch already made her purr again, Rena gargling in lust as she fondled her new mounds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark coughed, reminding Rena that she wasn't alone. Blushing slightly, the tigress strained her back to sit up straight while she covered her chest. \u201cNow don\u2019t be so modest\u201d, her agent urged her. \u201cI\u2019d like to have my share of them as well.\u201d A bit embarrassed, she removed her arms, smirking at her bosom\u2019s bouncing. \u201cNow, I hope you are satisfied for a while?\u201d, Mark asked, seemingly self-contended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked down at her monstrous rack. Each of her breasts was as large as her head, slightly<br>\r\noverdoing her fallen opponent in size. \u201cWell, I guess I can stay like that for a while.\u201d, she declared, proudly sticking the furry spheres out from her chest. \u201cLike one or two days.\u201d Mark sighed.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ryu had walked over to her, looking silently at Bikinihilist\u2019s body. She was still smiling, looking like she would just sleep - if it wasn\u2019t for the hole in her stomach, of course.<br>\r\nRena looked up to the agent, seeing a sad, shattered face. \u201cShe was a tough opponent\u201d, she tried to comfort him. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more important, I think she was happy how it ended.\u201d<br>\r\nRyu was silent for a moment, staring at his dead assassin. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, he finally said, smiling slightly. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been a long time since I saw her so happy.\u201d Turning away from the corpse, he looked into Rena\u2019s eyes(though his own gradually wandered down from her face).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did a good job, Miss Westfall.\u201d His voice was adust, but somehow friendly. \u201cYou certainly deserve your reward. And the result was probably the best for everyone.\u201d Regaining some of his composure his tone got a bit harsher. \u201cBut, don\u2019t celebrate just yet. The enemies to come will be even stronger. I have myself two other girls in the higher positions, and I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re ready to avenge Nihi. Better prepare yourself well!\u201d Looking away from Rena, he kneeled down. Silently, he put his arms under the dead body, lifting it up. Carrying the corpse in his arms he marched towards the exit, his walk as proud as his face was sad.<br>\r\nNobody said a word as Ryu kicked the door open, the agent throwing one last glance at his colleague. \u201cNice catch, Mark.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the two were gone, Mark couldn\u2019t resist a laugh before muttering \u201cAnd he said I fall easily in love!\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Rena asked, to focused on Ryu's exit to catch Mark's words.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Mark\u2019s glance wandered from the door towards the still kneeling cat-girl and her humongous hooters. \u201cNow Rena, will you finally follow my advice and relax a bit before you run into the next battle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all her joy about it, Rena couldn\u2019t deny her chest had become a heavy burden. \u201cYeah\u201d, she<br>\r\nblushed, a childish smile on her face. \u201cCan\u2019t fight when I constantly fall on my own breasts - though it would probably be fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\" Mark offered, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a business card. \"Call me when you're ready for the next match. You may prepare however you like, be it clothes shopping, strength training, or sunning yourself on the beach. I'll see you after your next match, and until then, enjoy your new endowments as much as you please - I presume it will be pretty much.\u201d The agent turned around, heading towards the darkness he had come from: \u201cGood night! And I hope this is the start of a wonderful friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to mysteriously vanish though, Rena cleared her throat. \u201cUm, before you go - could you help me up, please?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena stepped warily off the bus in Santa Bikini's skate park, her beam katana already activated. According to Mark, her next targets were the Cleavsaw twins, Snowy and Ember. Apparently they were both only teenagers if they were hanging out in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rena stepped into a nearby halfpipe, she heard the revving of an engine and dodge-rolled out of the way of a flaming chainsaw blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black blade was attached to a red motor, and the black and red chainsaw was held in the hands of a black-furred wolfgirl. She wore a pair of very short denim shorts, and a Fall Out Boy T-Shirt that barely contained her gigantic tits, which were nearly twice the size of Rena's. Perched on her head was a baseball cap with the words Light 'Em Up on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNOWY<br>\r\nCLEAVSAW <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you to burn!\" Snowy shouted. She revved up her chainsaw and swung it at Rena, sending an arc of flames at her. Rena slid under the fire and swung her beam katana at Snowy, who caught it in the teeth of her flaming chainsaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you're Ember?\" Rena asked. Snowy shoved back on the blade lock before rearing back for an overhead swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell people?!\" She asked, bringing her chainsaw down in a heavy slash before attacking furiously. \"My-\" CLANG! \"-name-\" SWOOSH! \"-is-\" VRRRRRRRR! \"-SNOWY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gout of flame shot out at Rena, just barely missing her cleavage. She quickly spun her beam katana around to a reverse grip and lunged at Snowy. The black-furred wolfgirl brought up her chainsaw to block, but Rena's beam katana skipped along the teeth of Snowy's chainsaw. Rena threw a hook at Snowy's face, bringing the beam katana with it. With a sizzling hiss, Snowy's head hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Good job,\" a voice said from way high up, sarcastic clapping drifting down along with the voice. Rena brought a hand to her eyes and squinted. Doing so, she could just barely make out the other person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Snowy, she was a wolfgirl, and she had the same build. However, that's where the resemblances ended. This wolfgirl was white-furred, and a blue and white chainsaw rested next to her. She wore a light blue dress and a large white hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEMBER<br>\r\nCLEAVSAW <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually managed to kill her,\" Ember said, her clapping stopping. She picked up her chainsaw and revved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ember Cleavsaw,\" she said. \"You killed my sister. Prepare to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber front-flipped down to the ground. The instant she landed, Ember shoulder charged Rena. A pained grunt came from Rena as she was sent hurtling through the halfpipe. She didn't even have time to recover before Ember was on her again, this time kicking Rena into the air and smacking her with an icicle created from her chainsaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice,\" Rena said. \"Of course she would have ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena barely rolled out of the way of another icicle, before trying to block the following chainsaw swing. Her hasty guard was broken through easily by Ember, who once again knocked Rena across the skate park. This time Rena smashed through a railing before coming to a halt. When Ember came flying down from the sky, Rena sidestepped her before swinging her beam katana at Ember's side. The blade nicked Ember's dress before deactivating with a farting noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! Not now!\" Rena shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All out of power? Shame,\" Ember said, swinging her chainsaw at Rena. Rena blocked the attack with her beam katana's hilt, but was once again knocked flying by the force of the swing. She scrambled to her feet and began running as fast as she could away from Ember while shaking her beam katana to recharge it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit!\" Rena said while running. Predictably, it wasn't long before Rena was hit, this time by an icicle piercing her thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Rena screamed as she went down. Ember placed her chainsaw blade against Rena's neck. It wasn't on at the moment, but that would change soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words?\" Ember asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Lay off 'er!\" A different voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the shi-\" Ember said, her full sentence cut off by a flying foot to the face. Said foot belonged to a yellow catgirl with brown tiger-like stripes, who was also completely flat-chested. She wore a pair of khakis, a red polo shirt, and a black vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAMY<br>\r\nNORTHRISE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Rena asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amy Northrise,\" Amy said. \"I'm here to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pulled a thin metal strip from her waistband. She clicked a button, and a blue blade of energy sprang to life from one end. Amy twirled her beam katana before pelting Ember with an onslaught of slashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't kill her, you bimbo!\" Rena said. \"I need to kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, mate,\" Amy said. \"I know. I'm just softenin' her up for ya! Watch, one more slash, then she's yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy slashed at Ember diagonally. After the slash, there was a brief pause before Ember's chainsaw was cut in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's all your, Rena,\" Amy said before jumping up onto a rooftop and running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the he-\" Ember said, her sentence cut off by Rena's beam katana entering her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how to feel about that,\" Mark said, stepping out from an alleyway. \"Yeah, you killed Snowy all on your own, but that other catgirl, Amy, she did most of the work on Ember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark thought for a moment before facepalming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he said. \"This was obvious. I'm in a good mood today, so I'll give you half the growth I'd planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena steadied herself as her breasts began to grow. They swelled in her shirt, the two globes of flesh straining the fabric more and more until they stopped when it seemed to Rena that they were about to burst through her shirt. Rena goggled at her breasts; they must've been a foot long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Rena,\" Max said. \"You are now confirmed as a KK cup- or an L cup, whichever you prefer.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello? Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, who had been dozing off, shot her eyes wide open, taking a nervous glance around. Nothing<br>\r\nsuspicious could she detect inside the small cab however, at least nothing more than in any other cab. The young driver before her cleared his throat, Rena quickly covering her topless body as he looked at her through the inside mirror. \u201cSorry to wake you up Miss, but we\u2019ve arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to the side Rena looked out of the car. It was the in middle of the night, probably past midnight already. The cab was standing in the parking area of a small motel, the single-story building enlightened by the cloudless sky and numerous street lamps. Rena leaned closer to the window, her cat-eyes slightly narrowing as she read the shining sign of the motel\u2019s roof:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEACH CAT CABANA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d, Rena said, smiling a bit. Still occupied with her chest Rena tried to open the door,<br>\r\ncareful not to drop her cover. As she was about to get out the driver once again cleared his throat. \u201cUm, sorry Miss, but you owe me 15 bucks for the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one leg already out Rena turned her face towards him, not looking too content. After a short<br>\r\nmoment though the cat-girl smiled deviously towards the young man, her fangs scaring him a bit.<br>\r\nDropping her arms Rena crawled back behind the driver\u2019s seat, visibly confusing the young man as she tried to squeeze her body through the narrow space between the seats. With some effort Rena managed to fit her massive melons through, presenting them to the startled man in all their naked glory. His eyes followed every of their movements the harsh maneuver had caused, not noticing she was slowly approaching him. With a bit of shock he suddenly felt the cat-girl\u2019s lips touching his own, his eyes wide open. Embracing the driver Rena pushed her rough cat-tongue into his mouth, squeezing herself tightly against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in to his urges the overwhelmed boy let his tension fall: Turning completely over he let her chest press against his own, the massive mounds compromised as Rena almost lay on top of him. Stuck in this pose he tried to get his arms free, their tongues meanwhile playing joyfully with each other\u2019s. Once he got some room the driver put his hands on her furry spheres, the corners of his lips rising to a slight smile as a pair of nipples dug into his chest. It was kind of weird to feel hairs on a woman\u2019s bosom, but he soon stopped caring about it. With fast movements he began to fondle her soft assets, each drive into the firm flesh increasing his excitement. The tigress also seemed to enjoy his work, loudly purring to his massage, her nipples growing harder with each grope. Enjoying the soft treatment Rena loosened her lips from his for a moment, moaning in delight. With a lustful grin she pushed the driver\u2019s face into her cleavage, the boy falling completely on his back as the two connected in an even more passionate kiss\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bare-breasted tigress watched as the cab slowly drove off, waving in its direction. Her breathing was still a bit heavier than usual, therefore the movements of her chest were as well. Once the car was gone her she let out a sigh, taking a look down her body. \u201cPhew! Now these come in handy if you\u2019re out of money\u201d, she smirked, cupping her assets. Feeling their firm, yet soft structure she lifted them up slightly, as if she tried to measure their weight - of course, she just wanted to touch herself a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the bounteous bust in her palms Rena gave it a keen squeeze, wincing a little. A few more<br>\r\ngropes though and she had gotten used to the feeling, the tigress purring joyfully as she massaged her<br>\r\nmonstrous mammaries. Once she was done playing with her new curves she let go of them, the downfall triggering a respectable bouncing. After following their movements to the end she looked back up towards the motel which she called home, seeing it was still fifty feet away. \u201cBut he could have dropped me a little closer\u201d, she mourned, regretting to have given such a high \u201cbonus\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Rena took a step forward. The moment her foot touched the ground a little impact went<br>\r\nthrough her body, the cat-girl clearly sensing the slight vibrations through her bust\u2019s hyper-sensitivity. Step per step, she slowly made her way towards the building, cautious not to fall forward. It didn\u2019t take long though until she began to stumble around, her breasts dragging her from side to side as she wavered her arms to keep balance. Walking like a drunken woman she eventually reached the stairs that led to the first floor, her sharp fingers quickly grabbing the rail. Pulling herself towards it Rena bent forward, needing some time to catch breath - now that Mark wasn\u2019t there to help she felt the full weight of her tremendous mounds, each of them easily packing several pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of rest Rena glanced up the staircase: The way up seemed endless, even though it was just one floor she had to go up. Letting out a sigh the cat-girl began to climb up the stairs one by one, not letting go of the rail for a second. Each step showed small effect on her bosom, the bouncing she had so loved starting to grow really bothersome. Exhaustion was starting to wear on her as a rising pain hit her back, getting stronger by the second. In a steady pace the tough tigress dragged herself upwards, buckling under the load of her bosom. The higher she got the slower and harder became her steps, causing even heavier motions on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the worn-out assassin finished the last stairs, reaching the metal balcony that connected to the rooms. Panting heavily each breath pumped her breasts to the limit, Rena virtually feeling as they stretched, before shrinking back to their \u201cnormal\u201d size when she breathed out. Probably she would have kept standing there for longer if it wasn\u2019t for a cold wind that blew over her top-less body. With a frown Rena put her arms around herself, her nipples growing erect again. But even as she shivered in the cold air, enduring the tormenting weight of her breasts, she was smiling from ear to ear. Even when they were cold and heavy, she still preferred a pair of giant knockers over a warm, but flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing in delight she walked over to her apartment\u2019s door, trying to think about something to warm her up. Her chill rose higher as one arm left her body to search for the keys in her trousers, the fur not preventing her from turning cold all over. With a trembling hand she moved the key into the door, unlocking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA comfortable warmth greeted Rena as she entered her dark apartment, the stiffness in her body slowly dissolving. Closing the door behind her she didn\u2019t even switch on the light, but walked straight to her bedroom. She would never have admitted it, but she was very tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bedroom consisted of an ordinary bed, a closet containing her wardrobe, a little night table that carried her fax machine, alarm clock and a small lamp, as well as a large window that took most of one wall. Again she didn\u2019t turn on the lights, but simply moved over to her unmade bed. She was about to drop herself onto the mattress, when she noticed something was lying on the pillow.<br>\r\nIt was her pajama. Her blue-white, thoroughly buttoned pajama that she loosely fit into - or at least used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d, she thought, smiling mischievously. As quick as her body allowed she removed her<br>\r\nremaining clothes, throwing them in the corner. Standing naked for a moment she first put on the trousers - as to be expected, they were just as loose as before. \u201cNow for the fun part\u201d, she smirked, taking the top. After slipping into the sleeves she began to button it up, going from bottom to top, quickly reaching her outstanding bust line. Every single button there required a lot of effort, the task growing more difficult the smaller her cleavage shrunk. Every time she closed a button her top rose up higher, the cool, smooth fabric sliding over her fur. Purring in delight she finished the last one, proudly looking down on herself. Over her bosom the fabric was lying delicately tight, each button just about to pop off. Every time she breathed in Rena could hear her pajama stretch, the gaps in it large enough for some cleavage to lurk out. Her breasts were taking so much space her belly-button was almost uncovered, the strain even noticeable in her sleeves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how long it will last\u201d, she smiled, patting her meat buns. Carefully, she began to lower her<br>\r\nbody towards the bed, her tail stroking the sheets as she sat down on it. A huge burden fell from Rena\u2019s shoulders, both literally and rhetorically, the bed creaking miserably under the weight of her body. The durability of her top was then put to a test when Rena took in a modest amount of air, letting out a small yawn: the exhaustion was completely hitting her now. Crawling under the blanket she lay down on her side, dropping her head on the fluffy white pillow. \u201cFor starters, I should not sleep on my back\u201d, she thought amused, closing her eyes. It didn\u2019t take long until she had wandered off into the realm of dreams, her sensitive body granting Rena a pleasurable sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun streamed into Rena\u2019s bedroom, bathing our heroine in its golden light. The cat-girl frowned,<br>\r\nabout to roll around. However, she found that simple maneuver to be surprisingly difficult, being unable to lift her upper-body - something was keeping it tied to the mattress. As she slightly lifted her eye-lids she saw a large bump on her blanket, like something big and round was lying underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill rather sleepy Rena smiled, remembering the events of yesterday. Using her arms as a support she<br>\r\nslowly sat herself up, the weight of her chest almost dragging her down again. Sitting on her bed the cat-girl yawned excessively, stretching her whole body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit startled Rena froze in motion, watching a button roll over her bed. Her bust was rocking forth and back, a small amount of cleavage poking out on top of it. After a while, Rena carefully stuck out her chest again, watching as the fabric steadily tightened around her bosom, the gaps between each button growing larger and larger, until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next button flew off, sending her bust line forward. Feeling the motion of her breasts Rena giggled, stretching her body further. One by one the buttons of her pajama popped off, gradually crafting a generous V-neck. With less fabric restraining them, her breasts jumped slightly higher at each blown-off button blew, hopping happily up and down on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last button burst off Rena was left with a ridiculously large rift in her top, revealing more than half of her dancing milk jugs. Looking at the buttons scattered over her bed Rena chuckled childishly, placing her hands beneath her cloth-breaking mammal monsters. Kicking off her blanket she sat onto the edge of her bed, stretching one more time. The fur in her cleavage sucked up the sun light, Rena shivering at the warm sensation. Glancing over to her alarm-clock she noticed it was already past noon, but didn\u2019t care much about it. Actually, it would be better to safe energy for the night life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from her bed she automatically moved towards her closet, until realizing it would be pretty redundant to search for fitting clothes. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to walk around in my pajama.\u201d With confident steps she walked through her motel room, proud of her jiggling bust - it would be a little sad when she would get used to the bouncing, and not sense it so presently anymore. On the other end, if her rack would continue to grow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such hopeful thoughts in mind Rena walked into her living room, the fabric of her top sliding over her breasts as they leapt up and down. It wasn\u2019t any larger than her bedroom, but she had somehow managed to squeeze all her stuff into it: The corner left to her was taken by her TV table and a small couch, both spilled with empty dish boxes - she couldn\u2019t even see her remote under all the garbage. In the same corner was a shelf with some video tapes and games, while opposite to it, her TV, a pretty cheap model with antennas, and a SNES were standing. On the same wall were the entrance to her<br>\r\napartment as well as a desk on which her (extremely old and slow) PC was located. The last corner led to her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena took a look down herself. Her fur looked normal, her front exposed by her blown-up pajama top, but she knew there had to be some traces of dirt inside it. In a single step she reached the door to her bathroom, opening it. In size, it was roughly a quarter of her other rooms - after taking a shower, she always had to be cautious not to accidently step into the toilet. Rena opened the last buttons of her blown-up top, the soft fabric sliding over her fur as she slipped out of it. With a similar gesture she dropped the bottom part of her pajama, leaving both lying on the ground as she stepped into her shower. There were no curtains to pull close, so she directly turned on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl winced a little as the cold drops rained down on her, the temperature visibly affecting her<br>\r\nbust. As the water warmed up though her stiffness quickly dissolved, the outlook of her nipples changing from coldly erected to a more pleased state. Feeling the warm droplets flow over her curves Rena began to fondle her milk jugs gently, the firm flesh softening under the influence of her hands and the warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been great if she could have spent the entire shower that way, but sadly, the rest of her body needed to be cleaned as well. Letting go of her breasts she grabbed the shower gel on her washbasin(she could easily reach it from her shower). Noticing not much was left she squeezed everything into her hand, dropping the empty box. With firm, yet caressing movements she began to rub herself clean, giving her breasts a little extra treatment. Like she had thought the water and foam were soon stained from the blood and dust caught in the battles, Rena even finding some sand from the beach. As she washed the dirt from her body Rena felt like she was peeling out of an old skin, her whole body shaking both from arousal and refreshment. Scattering the foam all over her she continued to passionately clean herself, humming and purring the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the warm water was starting to run out. She pushed the valve to the maximum, getting one more pleasurable drive as the heavy hot drops hit her breasts. Using her foam-spilled fingers she<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthoroughly scrubbed her meat bags, the stirring sensation forcing a moan out of her mouth. It was until all warm water was used up that she finally shut it down, leaving the busty anthro soaked and nude in the shower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have loved to shake some of the water off, if just for the sake of shaking her breasts. For once though the cat-girl stayed strong and used the only towel she possessed, also hanging at her basin. Again she took herself some extra time for her breasts, cautious not to get caught in the joy. As her fur was relatively dry she dropped it on the floor, stepping out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately she had not really eaten anything big, but since the sharpest fangs in the world where not worth much if they didn\u2019t shine, Rena prepared her toothbrush anyway. Half of her mirror was broken, so Rena had to bend down slightly to see herself, feeling a little dragged as she brushed her teeth. Synchronous to the movements of her toothbrush Rena\u2019s breasts jiggled from side to side, the bare mounds swaying freely in the air while constantly knocking against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really impressive how such ordinary tasks could be so much fun.<br>\r\nPutting her toothbrush aside Rena leaned over the water tap, bumping her bust into the basin - it may have filled out the entire sink, but this was less because of her body\u2019s magnificent capacities but due to her basin\u2019s lack of them. After cleaning her mouth with water Rena straightened up again, a little happy she could handle her breasts better now. Her confidence was thrown back on the ground though as her spine reminded her who did the main work, Rena putting a hand on her aching back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling unable to duck Rena kicked her pajama into her arms, then carefully slipped back into it. She left the top completely unbuttoned this time, the open vest fluttering loosely on her body as she bounced back into the living room. Going straight to her couch she threw some dirt aside, then let herself fall onto it, her bust happily hopping as she placed her legs on the table.<br>\r\nSo, what should she do today? Going to the beach was the most obvious answer, but she doubted her old swimsuit would still fit, no matter how much she squeezed herself into it. The thought of going to the beach without a swimsuit tempted her for a few seconds, but remembering what she had done to get that body, she decided not to push her luck too much with the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trip to the mall would be best - unfortunately, she was still completely broke. Sure, she could afford a sweater or something alike from the second-hand shop. But this body deserved more, something to show off and emphasize. She remembered then the payment for the last job she was fired would be in tomorrow. Maybe she should just stay in here for the rest of the day then, and save outside activities for the next one? Knowing nothing good would run in TV - or at least in the channels she received - Rena took a look at her shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll videos she had watched at least ten times, some tapes being so old and worn-out, you had to skip half of the movie to see anything. The video games in her collection could be considered all-time classics, like Secret of Mana or some high quality Nintendo games, but again, most of them she had already finished multiple times when she was a little girl. Staring down her body Rena would have loved to take a round on the Wii - there was this one game she was especially interested in, with a lot of blood and useless violence. But even though it was the cheapest console of this generation, she couldn\u2019t even afford that. And if she decided to spent the day on her computer, it would have probably been dawn before it even had booted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts reached further out from her body, blowing up a little, then shrunk back as Rena let out a sigh. \u201cI should check if the milkman was here\u201d, Rena decided, though she was pretty sure her subscription had run out a month ago. Pressing her hands against the couch Rena stood up, stumbling a little through her room. Standing at the door she turned her head around, looking at the small place she called home. \u201cWell, at least I am spacious now\u201d, she said to herself, smiling again as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parking lot was as empty as usual. Leaning out a bit to get a better view Rena\u2019s leg bumped against something, the cat-girl lowering her stare in surprise. Instead of milk though, she found a package was lying on her doorway. It was a bit larger than average, but still manageable for her to bear. Bending down the cat-girl picked it up, squeezing her breasts as she carried it inside. With a small gesture of her tail she closed the door behind her, putting the package on her TV-table. Wondering who the sender could be she took a look at the address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from the UBB.<br>\r\nImmediately she opened the box, digging through the stuffing. What she found was a letter, which she quickly began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEAR MIST WESTFALL,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE MANAGED TO PASS THE FIRST BATTLES AS A MEMBER OF THE UNION AND GAINED A QUITE RESPACTABLE FRAME ALONG THE LINE. YOU SUCCESSFULLY DEFEATED FOUR OF \tOUR LOWER-RANKING MEMBERS:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTITTY KITTY(D-Rookie)<br>\r\nKILLER RACK(DD-Rookie) THE CLEAVAGE(E-Rookie) BIKINIHILIST(G-Rookie)<br>\r\nAS A RESULT OF YOUR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVMENTS, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY PROMOTED FROM A ROOKIE  TO A FIGHTER.<br>\r\nTO REWARD YOUR EFFORTS THE UNION HAS SENT YOU AN APROPPIATE SET OF CLOTHES, INCLUDING A  STRETCHABLE BRA THAT WILL ENSURE A RELIABLE HOLD FOR THE UPCOMING BATTLES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS SMALL SERVICE, AND LOOK FORWARD TO A SUCCESSFUL CONTINUATION OF  YOUR COOPERATION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIN REGARDS,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE UNION OF BUSTY BABES<br>\r\n(PROPERTY OF THE \u2018NO MORE A-CUPS\u2019-LABEL)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: IF THIS LETTER SHOULD GET INTO THE HANDS OF OUTSIDERS WE WILL MAKE USAGE OF OUR RIGHT TO ELIMINATE YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s charming\u201d, Rena thought. She was quite impressed though the name of the major stood under the script, even though someone else had signed it in his name. So this really was no fluke, this \u2018No More A-cups\u2019 stuff was the real deal. For a moment, she had feared it was all an act put up by Mark, which would lead to an unforeseeable revenge story revolving around tragically romance alongside exaggerated violence and a humorous, yet absurd twist at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, that was a reference to No more Heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the letter aside she searched the box for the promised clothes. The first thing she found was a<br>\r\nred tank-top, looking nearly identical to her previous one. The only difference aside from the larger scale was that instead of \u201cDEAD HEAD\u201d, this one read \u201cDEAD SEXY\u201d around the black skull. \u201cHow thoughtful\u201d she commented, throwing it on her couch. Next was a black leather vest with a white tiger emblem on the backside. It was big, but she doubted she could completely close it on her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t intend to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing in the box was a black brassier. It wasn\u2019t very erotic, except for some frills at the top, but really felt quite elastic like the letter had stated. Impressed by its enormous size Rena whistled slightly, placing one of the cups on top of her head. Even with the volume of her hair it fit nicely around - the thought that her once modest chest would fill out these monsters lured a giggle out of the tigress. All in all, it may have not been the most stylish clothes she had received, but considering it was a free service she couldn\u2019t complain either.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze wandered down towards her furry breasts, exposed by her open pajama. It felt good to walk around half-naked, but considering the dragging in her shoulders, Rena decided to at least put her new bra on. In a simple gesture she removed her top, putting her new piece of underwear over her bosom. With a little effort she managed to close it, forcing a small pressure into her chest. Her breasts resided comfortably snug inside their new support, while leaving enough free area for a worthwhile glance. Now that something held them up the firm appeal of her breasts shot up once more, Rena adjusting her bra a bit to maximize her \u201csqueeze\u201d. Confident with her appearance she put her hands on her hips, feeling a little sway in her bust as she straightened her back. A glance at the TV and she could see her voluptuous figure from the side, her bust line making up nearly half of her width in the reflection.<br>\r\nSmiling at her sight she was about to try on the tank-top, when Rena noticed another piece of paper inside the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bill. According to it she had to pay the UBB 50.000 dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few seconds she had went into her bedroom, searched out the card Mark had given her and<br>\r\nreached her night table, walking with heaving movements through her apartment. Forcefuly she took the receiver from her fax, typing in the number so fast her breasts were still wobbling when she put the phone on her ear. Almost the exact moment her body came to a halt she could hear someone picking up, greeting her with a soothingly friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnion of Busty Babes, Agent Mark Christmas. What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you and what you do for me!\u201d, Rena shouted, slamming her fist into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while before Mark answered. \u201cRena, please tell me you are naked right now, even if you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty sure you look horribly sexy when you are angry, and hearing your breasts were to swing around unhindered would only add to the picture in my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go masturbate yourself later, just fucking tell me what this shit is supposed to mean?!\u201d \u201cI presume our package arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck yeah!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you like the clothes? You know, I was the one who picked-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFuck the clothes, what\u2019s with that ridiculous bill?! Fifty-thousand dollars? I thought you were an agency for assassins with big tits and my battles were supposed to be gigs??!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, and we have transferred a proper amount of money to your bank account. However, you have to understand there are also certain expenses we cannot completely cover with the funds we receive from the government. As such, a certain \u201cfee\u201d was introduced for the participants to pay before each battle - you can see it as a equalization to the other reward we offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why the fuck haven\u2019t you told me about that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause. \u201cSorry, I sometimes am a bit scattered about details. Also, I didn\u2019t want to bother you with too much unimportant stuff at the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDETAILS?! UNIMPORTANT?!?! You know, half the reason I accepted this...\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s say quarter: A Quarter of reason I joined up with you assholes was not only to get a huge rack, but because I fucking need money and can\u2019t get a fuck of a job no matter how fucking hard I try, cause the only fucking things I can do are beat the fuck out of people and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me if I interrupt you Rena, but could you scratch some \u201cfucks\u201d out of your sentences? Though it adds to my image of seeing you rage out with nothing to cover your anger, it is becoming a bit repetitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019LL SAY FUCK AS MANY FUCKING TIMES AS I WANT! NOW, CANCEL THE BILL OR I QUIT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was panting heavily, her chest racing up and down. Beneath her fur, the skin of her face was red from rage, her expression seeming just as wrathful. From the other end of the line, she could hear a sigh.<br>\r\n\u201cRena, please calm down. Both of us know two things very well: First, I am nowhere near the position to cancel the bill, even if I wanted. And second, you are nowhere near the point where you would be satisfied with your body.\u201d<br>\r\nThere was another moment of silence, the only thing audible being Rena\u2019s breathing. After a while, it was growing slighter. \u201cYou talked about a reward earlier\u201d, Rena eventually said, sounding a lot more settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the bill in her hands. \u201cDid you take any of it already out of the count?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the money you received from us is safely stocked at your bank and you are free to do with it as you please. To be honest, we usually demand our members to pay for their battles in advance. Your case was an exception, and I have to go through a lot of paperwork right now because of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks a bunch. So how much we are talking here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d She could hear him shuffle through papers on the other end of the line. \u201cThe reward<br>\r\ndepends on the rank of the assassin you defeated. It\u2019s a fixed system, but I don\u2019t have the numbers in my head\u2026 Ah, here\u2019s the list! All right, you got 1000 dollars for beating Titty, 2500 for Killer, that sword freak gave you 5 bucks, and Nihi was worth 10\u2026 that would make 18,500.\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so I need another 31,500 dollars to get to the next battle?\u201d \u201cWow, you\u2019re good at math. But actually, you need 20,000 more.\u201d \u201cWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the entry fee for the next battle. Did you really think you would get your greatest wish fulfilled for free?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn\u2019t know what she should say. How should she get more than fifty thousand dollars? She looked around. All her stuff together was probably not worth that much money - unlikely she would get it in the near future\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was put off from her thoughts as Mark cleared his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my little kitten. Your beloved Mark has a solution for all of your problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Miss Westfall. Anyway, now that you are a full-fledged assassin of the Union, a variety of special privileges is at your disposal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only hope this isn\u2019t a lame try of yours to get me into bed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, what kind of agent do you think I am? I mean that members of the UBB are granted access to our private labor bureau.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, a job centre! Didn\u2019t you hear me? I absolutely CAN\u2019T hold a job!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an ordinary bureau, Miss Westfall. It is a special exchange place where a certain circle of clients can demand the services of our most skilled members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you mean...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, not THAT kind of services, and not THAT kind of skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you mean it\u2019s an agency for hit men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, rather for hit women, yes. The rewards are usually very good, though we have a little problem right now to propose enough jobs for the exorbitant numbers of assassins our organization currently employs.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have too much people? Well, I\u2019m gonna change that, don\u2019t worry.\u201d \u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I have no choice, though it would have preferred to take the day off. But I want big boobs, and I want them fast.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, my little\u2026 \u201cWatch your tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, you\u2019re even worse than my last girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what did you say about the jobs being too few?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve reserved one for you. A fax should be in your machine, with the address of the agency on it. Just give it to the lady at the reception and tell her your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. And how much will I get?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomething between 30 and 40 thousand dollars, depending on your performance. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got work to do. Good luck.\u201d He was about to hang up when his voice suddenly came back: \u201cOh, before I forget it, there is also a bonus with this job which mainly led me to pick it for you. I think it will be\u2026 very much to your liking.\u201d And the next thing she heard was the dial tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Rena put the receiver back on its place. \u201cWhat did he mean by that?\u201d, she<br>\r\nwondered, looking at her fax machine. There was really a piece of paper inside it - she had not seen it in her rage. \u201cAll right\u201d, she sighed, bending over the night table. Her breasts only slightly fell forward thanks to their new support. \u201cLet\u2019s see what kind of dirty job he wants me to do on my day off.\u201d<br>\r\nThe task itself was simple: Beat up a gang. She didn\u2019t bother reading the reasons or who had requested the job, but directly skipped towards the reward part. Just like Mark said, the client was ready to pay anything between 30 and 40 thousand dollars - not quite enough, but a good start. There was also a footnote about the bonus reward Mark had mentioned, but the only sentence stated it was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena wondered what it would be, when a quick thought crossed her mind: Could it be another bust upgrade? It was just a hunch, but even the idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the probably hundredth time she looked down at herself. Taking normal measurements she was<br>\r\nalready enormous, each of her melons the size of her head - most women had to take surgery for such hooters.<br>\r\nIt was just as Mark had said though: The ambitious tigress was far, far away from being satisfied. \u201cWell, guess my free day has to wait a while.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Biking wasn\u2019t what it used to be anymore. And Rena was damn happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting every bump she could find, Rena rode through the city. Her breasts bounced the entire time<br>\r\nfrom her pedaling and unusual choice of route - for the first time in her life, she was happy to live in one of the poorest districts of Santa Bikini, where the last time the streets had been renovated was before her birth. In their continuous jiggling her breasts rubbed against Rena\u2019s clothes, moving the skull on her front up and down. The cat-girl found she was filling out her new tank-top quite nicely, feeling not overly tight while being stretched enough to leave an open-hearted excerpt of cleavage. On the edges of her generous V-neck the little frills of her bra lurked out, her open jacket hanging just so loose it wouldn\u2019t cover anything of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting slightly Rena entered the main street, continuing her ride on the sidewalk. Whenever she came across somebody, no matter if male or female, she passed him or her as closely as possible. Sometimes, she even tried to hit the person by her swaying bust, though it usually ended with her nearly falling off from her bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving more than one startled pedestrian behind Rena eventually arrived at the large glass building of the UBB. With unnecessary force she pulled on the brakes. The sudden stop caused her back wheel to jump forward, almost tossing Rena off her bike. Despite the danger, she achieved the desired effect: A split-second after the rest of her body her breasts thrust forward, the momentum throwing her forward while her cleavage pressed into her chin. With a bright smile on her face, Rena felt the back wheel falling down again, the impact causing a wave of tremendous movements. Some cars on the street even drove slower as they passed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling and jiggling, Rena leaned her bike against a street lamp and walked over to the entrance. Her breasts still bounced as she walked, but not so much it was a distraction to her. The bra was pratically perfect, allowing Rena to move easily but letting her breasts wiggle just enough to tease and taunt anyone that took notice of them. Moving up to the building, Rena took notice of a large sign with the UBB logo hanging above the door: Blood red, with the first \u201eB\u201d looking a little like a female breast. \u2018Why did I never notice this building before?\u2019, she wondered, passing the automatic doors. Inside, Rena shivered a little as the cool air of the air-conditioner hit her from the front. Feeling something arise on her sensitive bosom, she waited a bit before going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite spacious, the glass windows flooding the hall with sun-light. Several tables with red couches around them were placed inside the room, though nobody was sitting on them right now. The hall was decorated with a lot of plants and a small fountain in the very center. The fountain featured a woman striking a pose... an amazingly busty woman striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the form of the statue, Rena felt her inferiority complex coming up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the fountain, Rena spotted a large sign that read \u201eReception\u201c. Below the sign, a large section of the wall had been cut out, opening up to another room. It was kind of like a bank teller's station, but it was missing the bullet proof glass. It was easily a reception area large enough to seat three people, but currently only one person was working. The receptionist, Rena figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in the very middle reception area, her desk set just below the lip of the hole in the wall. Over the edge Rena could see a flat screen computer monitor, the woman quickly clicking away at a keyboard and not taking notice of Rena. As Rena walked in her direction the woman turned her head towards the assassin, smiling warmly. \u201eWelcome at the UBB agency, where ugly jobs are given to attractive assassins!\u201d, she greeted the cat-woman, \u201eHow can I help you, Miss?\u201d<br>\r\nRena stood in front of the woman, examining her for a moment. She looked like an ordinary secretary... maybe even a bit to ordinary: Short brown hair, an open blazer with a white blouse beneath, and a conservative black skirt. The only thing she noticed was the poor girl had a chest just as plain as Rena\u2019s had been before she entered the Union, if it wasn\u2019t even flatter. Not the kind of person you'd expect working at a place owned by the Union of Busty Babes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi!\u201d, Rena replied, realizing she had been standing their staring for a little too long. She pulled the fax out of her cleavage, having decided earlier to using her super hooters as a pocket was an amazing idea. As she did so, her bra slightly fell out of place, the frills on her cleavage slipping out from beneath her shirt. \u2018Damn, I need to practice this more\u2019, she thought before unfolding and handing the fax over. \"My name is Rena Westfall. My agent said he reserved a job for me.\u201d<br>\r\nThe receptionist took the piece of paper from Rena. \u201eWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark Christmas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment please\u201d, the receptionist replied, turning to her computer. Her hands quickly found their place on the keyboard, typing and using a number of keyboard shortcuts to breeze through the computer menus without ever using the mouse. It was impressive enough, Rena watching the secretary use her keyboard as if she was a master pianist performing. \"By the way,\u201c The secretary commented without looking away from her screen, snapping Rena back to reality. \"Are you having trouble with your bike? You seemed to have problems stopping earlier.\u201c<br>\r\nRena laughed a little, the thought of her bouncing breasts making the tigress re-adjust her slightly out of place bra while the woman wasn't looking. It was a strange question, especially from an employee of an organization that paid money and tits for killing people. Still, maybe she was just making conversation. \"Thanks, but everything\u2019s fine\u201d, she said. \"I\u2026 was just testing Newton\u2019s law of inertia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman threw a casual glance at Rena\u2019s furry bosom.\"I see\u201d, she simple remarked, before turning<br>\r\nback to her monitor. Rena believed to have seen a hint of amusement in her face, but it didn't last as the secretary went straight back to business. \"Ah, here it is. Yes, it seems Mr. Christmas did reserve a mission for you. A relatively small one, but well paid.\u201d At that a click sound emanated from a small device next to the secretary's computer, a gray card popping out the top like a piece of toast from a toaster.<br>\r\n\"Take this card\u201d, the secretary said as she took and held it out to Rena. \"It will automatically record your progress once you step into the mission area. After you are done, return here and give it back to me. The computer will read out and analyze the data it collected, and based on your performance I will then hand out a payment.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know how well I'm doing?\u201c Rena asked as she turned over the card, which was utterly blank except for the UBB logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no in-mission progression, but you can know how you did by checking the color your card takes once the mission is finished. Based on your performance the system gives your one of four different ranks: white, bronze, silver and gold. White means you accomplished the mission\u2019s minimal requirements and thus will receive the minimum payment. Achieving bronze, silver, or gold will get you more money, but to get those rankings you must achieve extraordinary accomplishments. There is also black for failure, but that usually means you died during your mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of extraordinary things do I have to do to get a gold?\u201c Rena asked as she stored the card in her cleavage, slightly enjoying the sensation of the smooth plastic being trapped between her mammoth mammaries.<br>\r\n\"Depends on the mission. Your mission right now is just to beat up a gang, but if you do it quickly or if you do it with style you'll get a higher rank.\u201d She threw a look back at he screen. \"The job is in the old ghost town Santa Biquini, which is a bit too far away to reach on bike. I'll arrange a cab for you - paid by the agency, of course.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was a bit surprised at her kindness, but it figured it was part of her job. \"Oh - that\u2019d be nice, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman clicked twice on her PC. \"Done. Shall I print out a map for you as well? It\u2019s a small place, but I've already seen people get lost between the old buildings.\u201d<br>\r\nAll right, now it was starting to get suspicious. There was no way this secretary was supposed to be that helpful. \"Thanks, but that won\u2019t be necessary. I was there recently.\u201d<br>\r\n\"As you wish. Then let me at least give you some provisions.\u201d From beneath her desk the woman pulled out a wrapped sandwich and a cola can. Rena received the gifts, feeling almost overwhelmed by the woman\u2019s gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201e\"m, thanks again.\u201d Dropping her suspicions she gave the woman an honest smile. \"You know, it feels kind of good to meet somebody nice like you when you\u2019re always around people who try to kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All part of the service, Miss\u201d, the woman simply replied while Rena stuffed the sandwich into her cleavage. Rena then started to put the can in, but quickly regretted it: The can came fresh from the refrigerator, the cold material sending a shiver down her spine. Rena tried her best to keep the cool sensation down, though she could feel her quickly hardening nipples pressing into her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019re in trouble, take some time to regenerate, or in worst case cancel the whole mission and try again later.\u201d Her voice sounded worried and serious, so Rena doubted this kind of advice was part of the standard service. Still, before the tigress could question the secretaries motion she was back at her computer. \"Good luck, Miss Westfall. I hope to see you again soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena simply nodded, quickly walking towards the exit in fear the receptionist would spot the little<br>\r\nbumps in her tank-top. \"Oh, before I forget it\u201d, the woman called out again, startling Rena. \"You don\u2019t need to pay the driver, but it would be nice if you gave him a little tip. The UBB strives to maintain a strong relationship with the cab company.\u201d<br>\r\nRena just nodded again, stepping out the automatic door. \"A tip\u201c the tigress mumbled. \"Let's see, I'm broke and I've got a huge UBB bill to pay. About the only tip I can give is the \"tip\u201c I gave my last cab... driver...\u201c<br>\r\nRena fell silent as she opened the door to the cab, caught mid-sentence as she recognized the man behind the wheel. It was the taxi driver that had driven her home after her fight with Bikinihilist. \"Where to miss...\u201c The driver began before getting struck by a similar silence to Rena. He then smiled, and not just any smile. He smiled like he had just won a million dollar lottery. His eyes then moved to<br>\r\nRena's tits, his smile getting even wider. \"Are those for me?\u201d, he asked, noticing the effect the cold cola was having on Rena's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me to Santa Biquini first, then we'll talk.\u201c, Rena replied, taking the can out from between her breasts along with the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here a moment\u201d, Rena said to the driver before closing the cab door. As she did, the tigress took notice of the fact one of her bra straps had slid off her shoulder. While the bra cups could get out of position with relative ease, the straps had fit really good and didn't move out of place up until now -then again, the \"tip\u201c she had given the cab driver had been pretty wild. They had sure put the car's shocks to work at the very least, so a single bra strap out of place wasn't that surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it back up Rena turned towards the town. Santa Biquini was just as desolated and forsaken as<br>\r\never. It was always hard to believe the sprawling, successful sea side city of Santa Bikini had started out life as a dusty, dried up wild western town, though it kind of made sense. A nearly impassible mountain range separated Santa Bikini and Santa Biquini, and the only reason it was a short drive between the two was because a long tunnel had been dug through the base of the separating mountain range. Once more Rena marched past the old wooden structures, searching for her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtter silence hung around place like a heavy fog. The air was hot and dry, Rena sweating a little in her black jacket. Only the wind could be heard as it blew over the street. \"It\u2019ll probably be just like against Killer Rack\u201c, she thought, her hand resting on her laser sword. \"They\u2019re gonna jump out of a building and\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden tingle arose in Rena\u2019s chest, causing her to stop abruptly. Rena groaned a little as her breasts shook against each other. \"Uh\u2026 S-something\u2019s vibrating inside m-my cleavage.\u201d Diving down into her cleavage, Rena's hand searched for the source of the slightly arousing vibration. Her fingers eventually found what was moving, and when she pulled it out Rena found her culprit was the mission card. After Rena readjusted herself and her bra, she noticed some words had appeared below the UBB logo. They were glowing a bright red, standing out starkly against the dull, metallic like gray of the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTARTING MISSION, PLEASE WAIT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Rena suddenly got blinded by a bright light coming from the card. When she opened her eyes again she found herself surrounded by a group of brutish gangsters, all wearing black tuxedos and sun-glasses. Some were holding pistols in their hands, but most of them were equipped with old Japanese katanas. Rena looked over the circle of men that had popped up around her. \"What\u2019s the fuck is going on here?\u201d, she shouted. Gangster's just don't pop out of thin air like that! Then again, she was the one with bra-busting G-cup because some guy had snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the card back into her cleavage pocket, drawing the laser sword with her other hand. As she looked around she guessed the enemies numbers around twenty people. \"All right\u201d, she said, taking a fighting stance. \"What did that receptionist say? I need to kill you all as fast as I can to get a gold rank? Ya, that's right. Well then, let's make this quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith faces cold as stone the mafiosi charged at her. Dashing forward Rena cut up the throats of three enemies at once. Quite surprised she then noticed their bodies were vanishing into black dust, leaving only their sun-glasses behind. While such a thing would shock most people, Rena was just happy that she wouldn't have to worry about tripping over corpses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the blade at her back she blocked the sword of two killers attacking her from behind, before slicing them up with ease. Again everything but the sunglasses turned to dust, giving sight to the gunners pointing their weapons at her. Their shots echoed through the town, mixing with the sound of Rena\u2019s blade as it turned the bullets into molten scrap. Rena jumped forward, and cut all four of them with a single strike into black dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore mafiosi came at her, Rena smiling evilly towards them. Only three more to go, and she had to be getting a gold rank with how fast she was cutting these guys down. She took her sword in both hands, waiting until her enemies were close enough. Once the time had come she swung her blade in a mighty motion, rushing forward as she cut through the bodies of all her enemies at once. The black dust danced around her figure, streaking her soft curvature that only gave slight signs of bouncing.<br>\r\n\"Good bra\u201d, Rena smirked, patting her bosom. Quite content she looked around, seeing the place was scattered with sun-glasses. \"That should do it\u201d, she said to herself, about to deactivate her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she blinked however, she found herself surrounded by tuxedos again.</span></div></div>",

But I already finished-\u201c Her instincts then told her to duck, the quick motion slamming her<br>\r\nbreasts against her chin. Just in time she avoided a series of bullets, which sailed through the air where her head had been and struck some of the newly appeared enemies. They turned to dust, but unlike before they were almost instantly replaced by more goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, what\u2019s going on now?\u201c Rena grumbled to herself. Turning her irritation towards her enemies,<br>\r\nthe tigress continued her slaughter through the tuxedo wearing men, avoiding and dealing damage. But no matter how many she killed, there were always more to come, and they appeared in steadily shorter periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding some time to catch her breath Rena sliced a hole in the wall of gangsters, quickly running out before it could close again. Once free, Rena turned and ran backwards as she blocked a hailstorm of bullets, new enemies already replacing those that she had just killed. Ducking under the swarm of bullets, Rena dived behind some old barrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?!\u201c Rena cursed, catching her breath. That was when she noticed the gray card was<br>\r\nsticking slightly out of her cleavage. Taking it Rena saw that the text at the bottom had changed. It now read \"Kill as many enemies as possible in the time allotted. Time remaining, 7:24... 7:23\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile grew on Rena\u2019s face, exposing her fangs. Now she finally got it: She thought she had to kill a group of guys quickly to get the gold rank, but it was the other way around. Instead of taking out a certain number of enemies in as little time as possible, she had to defeat as much guys as possible in a limited amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that\u2019s a whole different story\u201d, she said, jumping back into the mass of enemies. Swing after<br>\r\nswing she sliced her way through the bodies, taking out four or five gangster with each strike. Her fine, feline instincts told her whenever she was in danger, so she was able to block and dodge all incoming attacks, and even lead some gangster to accidentally take out themselves. Soon, the tigress was completely lost in battle, slicing her way through the assassins, an orange flash dancing in a mist of black dust.<br>\r\nSwinging her sword in a wide arc again, Rena planned to slice of one goon's head. This one, however, got lucky and ducked, going directly for her body now. Panicked Rena thrust her body forward, as if to tackle her opponent down. Of course, her advanced bosom hit him first, smashing against the ducked man\u2019s face. To Rena\u2019s surprise, her massive bust completely destroyed his head, the sunglasses falling into her cleavage as he turned to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked at the black shades resting on her shelf of a chest, blinking a moment. \u2018Well, that\u2019s a nice way to die\u2019, she thought, but then smiled again. The receptionist had mentioned she could get a higher rank by completing the mission with style. Well, what was more stylish then killing some of these idiots with a pair of G-cups?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in her mind, Rena continued her \u201eballet\u201d through the enemies. In addition to her<br>\r\nsword attacks though, she also began to slam her breasts into her opponents whenever an opportunity presented itself. Soon the d\u00e9collet\u00e9 of her shirt jingled with dozens of sunglasses that had caught on the fabric and were now hanging from her impressive chest - it was practically a necklace of sun glasses. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t have thought my bosom was so firm!\u2019 Rena mused to herself in a brief moment of rest, a moment that ended with her promptly smashing her chest into another killer's head and adding another pair of sunglasses to her collection. Growing more and more excited she slew her way through the mafiosi, losing herself in an ecstasy of sword-slashing and breast-bumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had lost all track of time, finding sheer pleasure in just mowing through so many enemies. She was a one woman army with a deadlier rack than Killer Rack ever had. Grinning widely, Rena turned to slice through five mobsters with a single strike. Before her blade could make contact, though, her enemies suddenly vanished. Her blade sliced through the thin air, Rena quite confused as she suddenly found herself all alone in the center of Santa Biquini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat finally clued Rena into what happened was when she felt her mission card vibrating again.\u201cOh, time must be up\u201d, Rena muttered to herself as her chest buzzed, the strong vibration of the card once again arousing the tigress, but also making all the sunglasses hanging from the neck of her shirt jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to enjoy the vibration for a few minutes, Rena first cleared away all the sunglasses. She<br>\r\ndropped them unceremoniously on the ground, to join the hundreds of others that were scattered<br>\r\nabout the street. They were nice sunglasses, and she'd like to have kept a pair, but they were all human sunglasses. Cat-people needed a different kind of frame. Well, maybe she'd go up against a bunch of cat mafiosi next time.<br>\r\nStill enjoying the fact the mission card was making her chest jiggle, Rena decided to enjoy her provisions. She fished out the cola can, frowning a little bit since it felt warm. But then again it was well pack and cushioned. Poping the top, Rena took a sip. It tasted a bit shallow, but was still prickling a little. Taking another sip, the cat-woman began to admire her work. The entire area around her was a dark mass made up of hundreds of sun-glasses, completely hiding the ground.<br>\r\nEnjoying a third drink of the cola, Rena thought of the sandwich and began to search for it. It had probably been squished flat by her chest, but it was still free food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt for the sandwich, Rena came across the mission card. Having enjoyed the vibration long<br>\r\nenough, the tigress drew it out. There was a smile on Rena's face as the card began to near the surface, the cat-girl certain a golden gleam would greet her.<br>\r\nWhen the card was finally free of the tigress's chest however she dropped her cola \"WHAT THE FUCK!?!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the screen, several bits of data began to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================================<br>\r\nMISSION SUMMARY<br>\r\nMission: Wild Western Cleanup<br>\r\nLocation: Santa Biquini - Main Street<br>\r\nAssassin: Rena Westfall - FIGHTER RANK Mission Time: 10 min<br>\r\nKill Count: 576<br>\r\nKill Rate: 0.96 Kills per second<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMISSION SUCCESSFUL!!!<br>\r\n============================ MISSION BONUSES<br>\r\n--Full Health Bonus<br>\r\n--Standard Combo Bonus<br>\r\n--Extreme Combo Bonus<br>\r\n--Empress Combo Bonus<br>\r\n--Goddess of Death Combo Bonus<br>\r\n--Double - Kill Bonus<br>\r\n--Triple - Kill Bonus<br>\r\n--Quadruple - Kill Bonus<br>\r\n--Quintuple - Kill Bonus<br>\r\n--Sextuple - Kill Bonus<br>\r\n--Headhunter Bonus<br>\r\n--Perfect Defense Bonus<br>\r\n--Berserker Bonus<br>\r\n--Mission Record Bonus<br>\r\n--Chest of Death Bonus<br>\r\n--Sexy Beast Bonus<br>\r\n--Sunglass Rain Bonus<br>\r\n============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bonus list went on for a couple dozen more entries, the secretary just staring wide-eyed while Rena smiled with a broad grin. Oh ya, she was that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are... quiet right Miss Westfall, you have certainly earned a gold rank with this kind of<br>\r\nperformance.\u201c The receptionist was finally able to say, typing a few things on the keyboard as she<br>\r\nadvanced the card-reader system to the next screen. \"Let's look at why the rank was awarded. it may just be a malfunction in the card or...\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist fell silent. The next screen in the card-reading program after the mission performance was the rank award screen, and all that screen showed was the assassins mission rank in big letters. It was specifically made so that when assassins of the UBB were looking at the screen they could easily see their score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the moment the program was displaying only a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\nMISSION RANK -- PLATINUM =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s face turned pale, while the business-like friendliness on her face gave way to a shocked expression. \"Holy fuck!!!\u201d, she screamed. \"You got a platinum rank!\u201d<br>\r\n\"Platinum?\u201d, Rena repeated. \"Oh... That's better than silver right?\u201c She couldn\u2019t remember hearing a mention of a platinum rank when she picked up the mission card.<br>\r\nThe woman opened her mouth as if to respond, but no word left her lips. Looking somehow nervous she clenched her red finger-nails into the armrests of her chair, her breathing going harder by the second.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you all right?\u201d, Rena asked. The receptionist turned towards Rena, panting as she stared wide-eyed into the cat-girl\u2019s face. Then, in a heavy motion, the woman thrust her chest forward, gasping in a high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty surprised the tigress took a step back. Her cat-eyes then also grew quite wide when the woman\u2019s bosom suddenly started to bloat up, rising from her flat chest. The wrinkles on her clothes quickly evened, her bulging breasts growing from plain boards to tiny mounds. Rena could see the woman was visibly aroused by her growth, grinding her teeth to suppress herself. Heavy breaths left her mouth in irregular bursts, sounding steadily more like moans the larger her bust grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons of her blouse were put under rising strain, the gaps between them widening. The first signs of cleavage then rolled into sight, her top bit by bit filling with breast flesh. The fabric was lying tight on her clothes, emphasizing the round appeal of her breasts.<br>\r\nAs there was no room left to grow one could see the immense pressure her breasts endured in her small top, trying to squeeze themselves out of their narrow prison. This put the woman under even more stress, her face flushing red as her sensation manifested itself in another gasp. Something in her\"\u201evoice\u201d hinted though she was not that declined to the situation - actually, Rena believed to see the glimpse of a smile in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the grapefruits on her chest didn\u2019t care much about what their mistress. Pushing on her<br>\r\nblazer the surging orbs finally managed to break a button off. Ironically, it jumped from her bosom right onto Rena\u2019s, bouncing around on her breasts. After hopping around a bit it rolled down her curves, vanishing into the darkness of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the burst-off caused the receptionist gasp in pleasure, a small tear of breast flesh<br>\r\nappearing on the top of her blouse. Her breasts wobbled a little, but didn\u2019t seem to be satisfied with<br>\r\ntheir current state though. The gaps between her remaining buttons widened as the expansion<br>\r\ncontinued, the woman nearly scratching holes into her armrests. She took in a sharp breath, but then let the air out in another moan as the next button flew off, sending her bust further forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small, wobbling cleavage the woman let herself fall into her chair, loosening her grip on it.<br>\r\nSweating all over she could do nothing but pant as her rocking chest continued to grow, tossing a moan out of her whenever a button popped off. Conquering cup-size after cup-size her breasts steadily opened her blazer, while tightly pressing gains each other inside her blouse. The firm, shining spheres packed on gradually more pounds, drawing flesh from invisible sources into them. The deeper her cleavage grew the rounder her breasts seemed to get, forming a softly curved valley of breast flesh. And every time a button popped off it send a little sway through her bust, each bounce visibly affecting the woman\u2019s composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a rough double D the woman\u2019s growth slowed down, coming to a halt. As the last inches were added to her bustline Rena closely examined the pair of breasts that had just bloomed in front of her. Like her own they stood round and proud off from the woman\u2019s body, sparkling from the sweat on her skin. Her open blazer had been pushed off from her firm roundings, while her blouse displayed a neckline going down half her bust. The woman was completely worn-out, her bosom slightly moved by her panting. After a while, she straightened herself up, the extra weight nearly making her fall on her desk. Grabbing her armrests she stopped herself, looking up towards the cat-girl with an exhausted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she jumped up from her chair. \"Thank you!\u201d, she called out in joy, jumping across the desk<br>\r\nseparating them and wrapping her arms around Rena, their breasts pressing together. \"Thank you thank you thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress, now completely confused, absently stroked the woman\u2019s back, patting her a little. What did nerdy perverts call this kind of situation again? Symmetrical docking?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally the woman loosened herself from Rena, taking her hands instead. The smile on her face was the brightest and most cheerful the tigress had ever seen in her life, and her eyes looked like they were wet. \"Oh god damn it, thank you so fucking much!\u201d, the woman said, finally starting to regain control of herself. \"It\u2019s been so fucking long since I even had something that could be called a bust, and then you come and get a fucking platinum rank! Platinum!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rena began to understand the situation. \"So the ranks of the assassins affect your chest?\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman let go of Rena\u2019s hands, wiping sweat and a few tears of joy from her face. \u201eYes\u201d, she<br>\r\nconfirmed \"Sorry. To show off the productivity of our agency, the higher ups decided to make the<br>\r\nreceptionist\u2019s breasts dependent on the performance of the assassins. That way, clients who come here to give us requests can directly see how well the Union is working - and they have something to look at while waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, originally I was quite flat - puberty hated me - so I was glad to get this job. Fuck, it was the only reason I ever signed up for it! And at first it really was great: Day after day my breasts prospered into new dimensions, with silver and gold medals getting achieved en galore. I got so large, they had to build a bigger reception for me to fit in!\u201d The woman laughed happily, Rena watching the jiggles she caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first?\u201d, Rena repeated after the woman had calmed down again. Her joy then seemed to decrease a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, up until a few months ago\u201d, she began to explain. This rose the question to Rena how long that<br>\r\n\"No more A-cups\u201d-campaign already existed. \"A new board director decided to change a rule regarding the amount of jobs an assassin can take on. Before that, each member could take on just one job at a time, and they were only able to access the next one after they cleared or canceled their current mission. But that rule was dropped, so now everyone can take on as many jobs as they want - this is also the reason there are barely any jobs left lately. You see, when the women could only take on one job at a time, they would try their hardest to get the best rank. But now it\u2019s more time effective if they just take on as many jobs as possible, achieve the minimal requirements and come back to collect all their loot in one go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cupped her firm breasts, squeezing them a little. \"As you guessed, the rank of the<br>\r\naccomplished mission decides the amount of growth my body undergoes: Gold boosts me up a cup-size, silver a half. If the assasins gets bronze, my chest stays the same. But, if some assassins finish with white or black cards, I lose some of my chest - only a little bit for white cards, but still some.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her breasts, sighing. \"Thus, thanks to everyone completing missions with white or bronze ranks my breasts started to slowly shrink down again. Less than a month after the new rule went into effect, less than a fucking month and I was completely flat, even more so than when I started this job -you hear this? I took it on because I wanted huge tits, but instead I ended up getting smaller!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she laughed, this time however more bitterly than joyful. Taking in a deep breath she calmed<br>\r\ndown. \"I didn\u2019t know though there was also a platinum rank - there were rumors, but since nobody ever got one I thought that was all they were.\u201d The warm smile returned to her face, the woman cushioning her ample endowments in her hands. \"God, that was really a tit explosion just now - I had already forgotten what it feels like to grow \u2026 or have breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently she stroke her meat buns, humming lustfully. \"It\u2019s so good\u2026 oh god, I think I\u2019m gonna need some time alone.\u201d After a moment however the receptionist had collected herself again, looking brightly int the tigress's eyes. \"And it\u2019s all because of you, Miss Westfall! I can't thank you enough!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena cleared her throat. \"Well, if you want to start thanking me, I\u2019d be more than happy if you gave me my reward.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry.\u201d The woman turned back towards her PC, typing around on it. \"Okay, um - you got the best result possible, all bonuses\u2026 and, er\u2026 er\u2026\u201d It seemed like she had trouble to concentrate, constantly glancing down her own body as her arms brushed against her chest while she tried to work on the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\u201d, she said after some fruitless attempts to type something into her PC. \"Let\u2019s start with the bonus reward first. I\u2026 need some time to get a clear head.\u201d Quickly the woman pressed a button on the card reader, one hand already back on her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before Rena felt a tingle inside her body, gleefully smiling as it slowly grew stronger. To her dismay though the feeling subsided in her chest, concentrating on another part of her body. She didn\u2019t have much time to think about it though as the sensation strengthened, closing her eyes at the upcoming surges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder loud stretching the tigress felt the pressure in her jeans increasing. The plain curves of Rena\u2019s<br>\r\nrump spread out from her body, giving her some more bulk in the butt and hip region. In addition, Rena also achieved a few more pounds on her thighs, her whole legs getting a bit longer in the process. Her white panties slowly slid over the growing roundings of her rear, itching a little as they sunk into her butt gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time her already form-fitting trousers reached their limit. Rena clearly heard the first seams give in, granting her butt some more room to grow. The cat-girl placed her hands on her expanding backside, moving them over the dissolving fabric of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach new pound lured a moan out of her - it couldn\u2019t really compete with the feeling of a breast<br>\r\nexpansion, but pleasure was pleasure. Digging her fingers into her buttocks the cat-girl purred in delight, joyfully squeezing her firm ass. The groping also pulled on the fabric, so Rena soon had a large rift in her trousers, fully filled out by her white underwear. After some more increase in volume though one could see her furry butt on the growing hole, her prospering cheeks pushing her underwear deeper into their rift. No fat was sagging from her big rump, the bonny buns pointing proudly away from Rena.<br>\r\nWith a loud bang her trouser button blew off, just like the ones on the woman\u2019s blouse earlier, while her zipper was blown open. Rena\u2019s flaring hips hindered a fall of her jeans, the fabric lying on her like a second skin. She was still fondling her growing rear, ripping the hole in her pants ever larger, up to the point where it nearly tore up her belt line. Slowly then, her massage came to a halt, Rena feeling as the growth subsided. The cat-girl panted a little, still purring though when she took a look down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacked inside her jeans was a pair of tight buttocks. Though they didn\u2019t turn her into an hourglass, Rena found her lower curves perfectly fit the new endowments of her body, nicely emphasizing the magnitude of her bosom. Her butt\u2019s firmness also stood in no shame to her breasts\u2019, looking like two large rocks were stuffed into her pants. The excerpt from her large tear however showed it was all natural body mass(more or less), her white panties only covering a small area of her butt. Her hips were matching her buttocks perfectly as they stood a bit over her shoulders, forming a well defined womanly curvature with her slim waist. And though they had only slightly changed, Rena found her legs were a perfect end to her perfect body, giving her an inch more height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA broad smile on her face Rena began to shift around, examining her bootylicious backside. \"Not exactly what I was hoping for, but hey - I always liked surprises, and I think I\u2019m going to love this one!\u201d Turning her head around Rena then noticed the woman was \"occupied\u201d with her own curves, soundly enjoying her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m sorry, did you say something?\u201d, she asked, throwing a casual glance at Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl smirked. \"Not so important - I guess you want to enjoy the situation as long as you can.\u201d</span></div></div>",

So hopefully, my chest will hold out for longer than a month this time.\u201c A little sad she looked at the empty space around her. \u201cBut I still miss the times when it was actually narrow behind this desk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe we can help each other out with that\u201c, Rena said, leaning on the desk with a certain smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist quickly caught on, smiling. \"I get ya. Okay, if you promise to keep trying to get platinum ranks, I'll make sure to reserve some of the best missions for you. And\u2026 I'll also make your payouts a little more rewarding.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not... officially, but when my bust started shrinking a few months ago, I hacked into the union\u2019s<br>\r\nnetwork to change the ranks of accomplished mission manually - and I actually succeeded.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it turned out that changing data on the servers didn't affect my body. But, I can affect the payout as long as the data's changed before the transition is made. Still, can I count on you for some more platinum ranks?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \"You get me the missions, I'll knock them out of the park.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\u201c, the receptionist whispered, obviously happy about the prospect of getting even larger tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's look at your payout. The standard payout for this mission would be sixty thousand dollars.\u201c \"Mark said the max would be fifty thousand.\u201c<br>\r\n\"You got the secret platinum rank, so the union is paying a bonus. Now, let's take a look here. You've got an outstanding bill from the UBB for 50,000 and your next ranked match will cost 20,000... and another 20,000 for the one after that... and your bank account has 18,500. Um... let's see.\u201c<br>\r\n\"Okay,\u201c The receptionist said a few moments later, hitting the enter key on her keyboard. \"Here's what I was able to do. I can't increase the payout too much without raising some suspicion, but I can add special bonuses to the mission that are really easy to slip in. I increased the payout of the mission to 65,000, but I also added that you get one free ranked fight.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Add that to the 18,500 you already earned... and... here's the final damage: Your bills are paid, your next two rank matches are paid up, and I was able to leave 13,500 in your bank account.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was speechless for a moment. \"That much!\u201d, she partially shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad clunk of change considering you had nothing in your bank account before joining the UBB.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right\u201d, Rena said, having to lean against the desk. \"But don\u2019t you get a lot of trouble if this comes out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leaned back into her chair. \"Yeah, would probably cost me my head. But better a head --than bustless, right?\u201d, she smirked, patting her bosom. \"Also, it's the least I can do for you, Miss Westfall.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Rena, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Rena\u201d, she said, tossing her breasts up a little. It didn\u2019t seem like she could get enough of their bouncing. \"By the way, I\u2019m Mandy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \"Nice to meet you, Mandy.\u201d Rena couldn\u2019t remember to have ever met such a friendly person in her life. \"Say Mandy\u201d, she began after a while \u201esince we're now in cahoots for this platinum rewards stuff... you want to hang out sometime?\u201c<br>\r\nMandy hesitated, looking a bit nervous. \"I don\u2019t know\u2026 my bosses told me not to build up friendships with the assassins. They - they said it was better for my psyche in case they don\u2019t come back from\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidely grinning the tigress showed her fangs to Mandy. \"If that\u2019s all you worry about, don\u2019t sweat it.<br>\r\nThe only reason I won\u2019t come back is because I got number one and there is no one left for me to fight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress's self-confidence seemed to amuse Mandy. \"Your next rank battle could be anytime, so you may not make it, but how about tomorrow around three o\u2019 clock?\u201d, she suggested. \"There is this lovely little caf\u00e9 near the main street where they serve the best strawberry tartlets in town.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy nodded, seemingly convinced of Rena\u2019s strength. \"Oh, before you go: There's another small mission that just came up, if you feel up for it.\u201c<br>\r\nRena looked out at the clear sky. \"Sorry, but I\u2019ve already got a few good ideas how to spend the rest of the day\u201d, she smirked, patting her new curves. The two women giggled before getting back to business. Mandy asked if Rena wanted some of her reward in cash, and the tigress actually wanted all ten thousand dollars of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was giddy as a school girl as she held the thick stack of hundred dollar bills in her hand, and like so many things that day Rena placed the stack of cash in her cleavage. The weight of it, both physical and monetary weight, just made Rena purr. She then got a little bonus as Mandy offered her a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you don\u2019t have back there?\u201d, Rena joked, tying the towel around her waist.<br>\r\n\"A good receptionist is always prepared.\u201d Mandy replied, waving as Rena strode out of the UBB building with a fresh, curvaceous sway in her hips. Still, just as Rena was about to leave, Mandy called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, the cab agency called a few moments before you came back. They said your driver wants to cancel the bill... and that if you ever need a ride he'll come day or night. You know anything about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena turned her head, smiling. \"Let\u2019s just say I gave a generous tip.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition was written by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me please, we still have much more to see.\" A tour guide bellowed, leading her group of people out into a production area of a large factory. \"Now remember, stay between the yellow lines and keep your masks and goggles on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the tour guide stopped the group, pointing at the many machines. \"This is where Peterson Pharmaceuticals wide array of pill based medicines go through their final stages of preparation. Here, Peterson employs one of the most cutting edge techniques. The pills are all ready encapsulated at this point, but the medicine inside is worthless. As the last stage of production, the pills are sent through these machines. The machines cook them for a set amount of time, causing a chemical reaction within the pills. We can control how strong a pill will be by how long we make it cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour guide began to continue, but a teenaged boy who was forced to come to the factory for a school project began to get boared. He began to lean back, not realizing he was leaning against a control panel. As he stretch and yawned his butt slipped over, and an alarm began to ring through the facility. The tour guide paniced, looking around and seeing that one of the assemply lines had stopped while the machines on it were still working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour guide then saw the teenager, quickly snatching up and pulling him away from the consule. \"Sir, stay in the yellow line.\" The tour guide then put a finger to her ear, pressing the small radio that was pressed there. \"Quality Assurance, we have assembly line five has stalled. There are three pallets of pills that have been in the oven far to long. Make sure they don't get through to packaging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that the guide turned, having to mess with the controls for a few minutes before getting the line back working. Technicians were already surrounding the assembly line, pulling out the bad pallets and whisking them away to some other part of the factory. Security also came, escorting the teenager out while the tour guide continued the tour. None of them noticed, however, that there weren't just three pallets of pills cooking. The very end of a fourth was also in the oven, and had been cooked far to long. These ten pills slipped past all of the quality checkers, eventually getting picked up and placed in a mailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black car pulled up at the corner of Rena's block, the tiger stripped cat-woman stepping out and waving to the people inside before heading towards her house. It was her carpool, the best way to get to work. Still, Rena couldn't help but yawn as she walked back home. It had been a really long day, and she was dog tired. Still, before getting to close to the door she stepped over to her mailbox, grabbing the stack of stuff in there before heading inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindlessly Rena set the mail down on a table, moving into the kitchen as she made herself dinner. She came back, having finished eating, and looked down at the mail. Bill, newsletter from work, newsletter from church, bill, credit card offer. It wasn't anything very interesting until Rena got to the bottom. A deep green package with blue and red highlight stood out to Rena, bright as it said, \"Give us a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena picked up the strange, rather thick package. She turned it over, reading the information on the back, \"Because of proud, and how happy our customers are with our products, we've decided to offer you a free sample. We have spoken and called your doctor, finding out just which of our medicines would be best suited for you. So, why don't you open us up and see just what Peterson Pharmaceuticals can offer you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the introduction was enough to get Rena curious and she broke the seal on the package and opened it up. What she saw listed there made her eyes bulge a bit. It was a ten days worth of Peterson Pharmaceuticals most popular over the counter breast enhancment pill. There were always adds about it on the television. Rena turned the package over again, seriously doubting that they had actually spoken with her doctor. Still, as Rena stared at the pills she couldn't stop her other hand from moving up and feeling her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always been flat chested, athletic and lean in appearance but that was never enough to really push her from just looking good to looking sexy. She had always debated about getting her breasts enhanced, it was kind of a secret dream of hers just to have the hugest breasts in the world. Still, she didn't have the money for surgery and was to embarrassed  to consider actually buying this kind of medicine. Still, even if it was only ten days maybe it would be enough just to give her a little more definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation became to great and after reading the list of ingredients to make sure everything was safe she couldn't help but resist. The packaging said to take only on of the pills a day for ten days. Rena just shrugged, forcing one of the pills out of the package and popping it into her mouth.  Because of the simple fact she worked kind of late, it was already getting close to nine. Rena decided to head to bed early, so she could wake up at a pratical hour and enjoy her weekend. After the week she had, a three day weekend was just the thing she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena lay in bed she gently felt her chest, noticing that they felt strangely numb. Still, she shrugged it off as a side effect of the pill, curling up in her slick black night gown and falling asleep.<br>\r\n==============================================================<br>\r\nWhat will await Rena in the morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: A rack of D sized breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: More Choices</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter written by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday, the one day of the week Rena really found time to do things for herself. Monday through Friday was devoted to work and recovering from said work in the evening. Sunday was the day to get the house cleaned up and do other chores, but Saturday was a day Rena ensured would be a day for relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Rena woke to the sun pouring in her window. It was already past nine, but after a week of work the one thing that Rena enjoyed doing was sleeping late. She never even set her alarm on Saturday unless she intended to go out with friends or had something planned for the morning. Still, the sun began to break past the roof of her neighbor's house, its light spilling on her fur and warming it gently. The increase in warmth was enough to gently rock Rena out from her dreams, the catgirl walking with a great yawn as her arms and legs stretched to their max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying the comfort of her bed for a last few moments, Rena stepped out onto the floor, slowly going over to her bathroom door and stepping inside. With her mind still half-asleep, Rena pulled off her pajamas, a simple tank top and old pair of comfortable short-shorts. She stepped into the shower, pulling the glass shut as she turned on the water. As always, Rena forgot to turn the water on first to let it warm up. The few seconds of icy water that was still in the pipes shocked Rena, bringing her mind to a full state of awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the water warmed to a comfortable temperature, Rena began to wash, looking over her body as she did. Her short but soft fur, wet from the shower's water, shown, shined and glistened. Rena could only sigh, thinking about the way she looked. Her friends said she was beautiful, her lean, thin figure the envy of many women at work. Still, no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't seem to find a good guy. The ones she had managed to date usually didn't want a real relationship, just a fun night in bed. She hadn't even been able to date those kind of guys recently, things at work getting so hectic she was having to put in extra hours. Still, she had Saturday, and after getting a nice bonus from her boss, there was only one thing on Rena's mind: shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing in the shower, Rena stepped out into her heavily steamed bathroom, putting a towel around her body as she looked over at the mirror. Her red hair was sopping wet, so much it looked to be a deep crimson. She did little with her hair, its natural tendancy to hang straight enough for the cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thirty minutes and the clock on the wall starting to read around 10:00, Rena stepped out of her home. Thanks to her job, she was able to afford a pretty nice place to live. A two story house out in the suburbs but still very close to the metro station, allowing her to take the subway into the city and her bike the rest of the way to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena walked down towards her garage, glancing around as she slung a purse over her shoulders. She had chosen to dress in some tight fitting blue jeans and a sleek black tank top, though not the same one she had worn to bed. Even if she was planning to shop, Rena always tried to look her best, always wondering if one Saturday she would meet some guy who was actually worth dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighborhood was in its usual state for a Saturday morning. Some people were gone, other families were out in their yards playing games or in their backyards enjoying pools. It was a very middle class community, and Rena sometimes felt lonely because of the simple fact she was the only cat-girl in the neighborhood. That, and some of the neighbors were racist pigs who thought less of her because she wasn't a full human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there were only two racist families in the thirty or so Rena live near by, so it was nothing she couldn't ignore. A few neighbors even smiled and waved at Rena as she stepped into the garage. Rena wish she had a car, but because she choose to live in such a nice community affording a car was a little out of her budget. Still, a bike was better for the environment and it kept her fit, one of the few forms of exercise she could get on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeddling quickly down the street, Rena got to the metro station, having to wait only a few minutes before the train came and she was whisked away towards the towering skyscrapers in the distance. Six stops was usually how long Rena would wait when going to work, and luckily the mall was fairly near her office. Hopping on the bike once she had gotten back up to street level, Rena began to peddle towards the mall, looking around at the city as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday was busy like usual, and Rena was just thankful for the bike lanes on the sides of the street. Otherwise, she would have to either ride her bike with the cars or walk it on the sidewalk. Still, before her mind had gone too far, Rena arrived at the Rimrock Mall, which in the past year had just surpassed the Mall of America in size and number of stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rimrock had thousands of stores, and was, literally, in fact, a small city. There was even an apartment complex inside the mall, a dream come true for people who always wanted to live in such a place. It was something Rena had tried for a while, but she found her bank account quickly shrinking from her daily shopping sprees. It was the last place she had lived before getting her house, something she was able to afford thanks to her last promotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had been to the Rimrock thousands of times, and soon fell into her usual route as she checked the stores she loved and avoided the ones she couldn't stand. The Rimrock mall was built much like a huge flower. Eight petals stretched out with a single, large courtyard in the center of the mall which was dominated by the Rimrock fountain, a sculpture that depicted a series of rain forest waterfalls that tumbled off the single, huge rock in the center of the fountain's pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy noon Rena stopped, holding a sub sandwich as she sat looking at the fountain, mindlessly chewing. Beside her sat a couple bags. None of her favorite stores had really gotten anything new, and the last thing she really need was more clothing. Rena sighed, guessing that her day long excursion to the mall would end a few hours earlier than she had hoped. Still, she had one more store she wanted to go to: The Music of Ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stood in front of the windows to the Music of Ages, examining the many things they had on display. The Music of Ages had stared as a country music store when the mall first opened. Still, as the mall grew so did the store, and it now stood as the Music of Ages, Music Emporium. Every CD, every genre, they even had used vinyl records, cassette tapes, and even 8-tracks and the hardware to play them. Still, even with its progress the emporium still played and preferred country, its owner a die hard fan who had grown up in Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stepped inside, looking around at the huge collection of CD's. A magazine had done a study of the store, and discovered that the store contained so much music in so many different formats it would take a millennium to listen to every song. It was impressive, and because of it music lovers from all across the city and the world came to the store to find the one CD that they couldn't find. It had become the store's motto: if they didn't have the CD you were looking for then they'd find it, give the you the CD for free, and a fifty dollar gift card. According to the sign above the door, there still hadn't been a single person incapable of finding their CD, a feat no other music store had accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bags in hand, Rena walked over to the customer service counter, her eyes falling on her friend Dexter. Dexter, who was about Rena's age, had graduated college with a Computer Science degree and now managed the store, using his knowledge of computers to keep a constant watch on almost every aspect of the store. He could even tell when one of the public toilets got clogged. It was scary, but he got paid well and all the free CD's he could ever want.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though he was a super brainiac, Dexter wasn't a complete geek. Rena had gotten to know him when she had to return a CD and he was kind enough to show her some other music she would like. He wasn't that bad looking either. Very tall with short blond hair on his head, Dexter was neither over weight nor muscular. He was just thin, both in waist and arm size. He always dressed in black slacks and a white button down shirt, a pair of sleek, square glasses sitting on the bridge of his nose, giving him a distinguished look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dexter.\" Rena piped up, coming to a stop beside the counter, setting her bags down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you'd be in today. I see you've been on your usual mall Saturday shopping spree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \"Yeah, but don't get the wrong idea. All of these bags don't have much in them. There just isn't a lot of new stuff around this week. It's all kind of boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have noticed that the other stores have been slow in getting new merchandise out. I bet they're still trying to recover from the holidays Still, if you're looking for something new I may just have the thing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Dexter bent down, disappearing behind the counter before standing up, holding a CD case in his left hand. The case was black and didn't seem to have any labels on it. Dexter turned the disk over, looking at it as he said, \"This came in today from one of the record companies. It's supposed to be a preview to an unannounced album from some new rock band. They wanted us to give it to one of our best customers and see what they thought. Mr. Maxwell left me to give the disk out. Would you be interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena reached out, taking the disk from Dexter and opening the case. The disk itself had some printing on it, but just the record company's logo and a list of the tracks on the CD. \"What would I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to it and then give me a call here at the store. The record company just wants a loyal customer from the store to listen and then say what they liked out of it. They just want a common person's opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shrugged, slipping the CD into her purse. \"Sure, I'll listen to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, going anywhere else?\" Dexter asked as he turned, focusing his eyes on a computer as some strange things popped on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena lifted her head a moment, staring at the ceiling before saying. \"Nah, I've been to all my usual stores and I don't feel like going anywhere else. So, I guess I'll go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter nodded. \"All right, I'll see you later then, Rena. Call me once you finished listening to the CD; I need to get back to the company soon.\" With that Rena waved goodbye, scooping up her shopping bags as she walked towards the exit. With some work, Rena got all of her new purchases into a single bag, throwing the rest away before putting the single bag into the basket of her bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 2:00 in the afternoon, Rena got back home, putting her bike in the garage and taking her single, overstuffed shopping bag inside. She had purchased a few things she need, shampoo and toothpaste, some food for dinner, but the rest of her purchases had been clothing based. Rena knew it was her weakness, but she just loved getting new clothes. Besides, anything she didn't wear anymore she donated to the local thrift store. It kept her wardrobe fresh, a thought that just made Rena happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even waiting, Rena began trying on her new clothing, standing in front of the large mirror that was in her bedroom, looking over her form. She first tried on a long sun dress, smiling as she twirled slightly. It was a good dress for Saturday's in summer when she would just sit out in her yard, enjoying the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through her new clothing for nearly three hours, trying on every new piece and seeing what went with her old clothing, Rena finally put all of her new clothing up and stepped out into her kitchen. As Rena cooked, her eyes drifted around her house, smiling slightly. The house had belonged to a pair of twins that were joined at the hip. Because of it, all the doors in the house were double doors, the hallways wide. The kitchen, dinning room and living room weren't even seperated by walls. Just a single large room with a kitchen in the corner, the dinning table beside it and the living room furniture taking up the rest of the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating dinner, Rena went into her usual routine, quickly changing into some tight workout clothes before going into her living room. She had tried working out at gyms, but having to go somewhere else to work out was usually a good enough excuse for Rena to not exercise. That quickly led to a small bit of flab forming around her belly, and got Rena into working out at home. She had built her own routine, something just to keep her thin. It had worked, getting rid of the flab and leaving her with a very athletic build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena pushed back her coffee table, preparing to workout, she thought back to the CD Dexter had given her. She liked to listen to music while she worked out; why not listen to the CD? After searching her purse for a few secnds, Rena dug out the disk case, opening it up as she walked back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling out the CD, Rena noticed that there were, in fact, two CD\u2019s in the case, a second one hidden beneath the first. Thinking little of the second disk, Rena took the first CD and slipped it into her stereo system before pressing play. Soon, an up beat and well paced rhythm began to fill the room and Rena smiled. The music wasn't bad. No lyrics, but it had a very energetic feel to it. Rena began to work out, wondering if the whole CD sounded like the first song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena exercised, she found she liked the CD more and more. The music was really energizing and it just made her feel good. It also seemed to be the perfect thing for her work outs. The first two songs were good paced for her stretching, and then as she started to get into the heart of her exercise, the songs got faster to match. Finally, the last few songs on the CD were slow and calming, just the right thing for cooling down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena finished her workout, she moved over to her stereo, pressing stop and ejecting the CD. The music was really good, really energizing. Rena felt like she had gotten a lot more out of the workout because she had been enjoying the music, forcing her body to move with the fast, up beat melody. She would have to call Dexter and tell him that the music was wonderful. Still, as Rena thought about the CD, she remembered the second disk in the album, the one that had been below the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena walked over to her kitchen counter, where the disk case lay open with the second disk sitting in it. After switching the disks, Rena walked into her bedroom, starting to peel off her workout clothing as she prepared to take another shower. Just before she stepped into the bathroom, Rena turned on her TV, slipping the CD into her DVD/VCR player and closing the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stepped into the shower just as the second CD began to play over her TV. The songs were different, but they were the same up beat, energetic style. Rena found herself starting to dance to the music, swaying as the shower water spilled over her. Still, as she got lost in the music Rena felt a strange sensation in her chest, like she was starting to throw around more and more weight. Rena, however, paid it little mind as she continued to jump and jive to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first song ended, and just as the second song began to play an automatic timer on the DVD/VCR clicked. The player stopped playing the music, switching over to a blank tape in the VCR and starting to record a movie. The sudden disappearance of the music snapped Rena back to reality, leaving her somewhat stunned for a moment. She then continued to wash her body, the song still echoing in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked up into the shower, letting the water spill over her face as her hand gently rubbed her fur clean. Her hands then began to work down, washing her hair, neck, shoulders, and arms while Rena continued to keep her eyes shut, listening to the song replay from the jukebox of her mind. Still, as her arms move down to her chest Rena felt something strange, a pair of bulges that hadn\u2019t been there before. Rena opened her eyes, looking down before her eyes widened in shock. Her breasts, which had been a tiny pair of A cups when she stepped into the shower, had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena blinked a few times, her hands moving down as she began to feel her breasts. Was she dreaming? Her breasts had grown to at least a B cup if not a C. Rena began to smile, gently rubbing her breasts together and enjoying the strange wave of pleasure it sent through her body. Rena didn\u2019t know how or why, but her breasts were bigger. She could only smile as she stepped out of the shower, standing to look at her self nude in the mirror and examine her new assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even in the back of her mind, something was eating at Rena. Breasts don\u2019t grow so big in a few minutes. Still, even as Rena\u2019s logic tried to make sense of what happened, Rena stepped out into the bedroom, flopping down on the bed as she\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Note from the Author: This storyline was, in my opinion, one the best of the original Rena's Adventure. Unfortunately, the previous chapter was the only part of it I could find intact. So, I shall recreate it to the best of my ability, with a few personal touches, of course. Anyone who wishes to contribute is more than welcome to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena flopped down onto her bed, her new breasts jiggling slightly, she reached towards her nightstand and grabbed the universal remote she kept there and pressed the play button, activating the CD once more. Rena sometimes liked to listen to music while she slept, especially after a busy day. It helped her to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped through the tracks until she found one with a nice, slow, soothing melody, perfect for helping her get to sleep. As she lay her head on her pillow, her eyes drifted down to the two fleshy mounds protruding from her chest, and she once again wondered how her formerly flat chest had suddenly grown in the time it took her to take a shower. Rena decided to put the thought out of her mind for now and focus on getting to sleep. As the calm music went on, Rena's consciousness began to fade. The last thing she remembered before completely falling asleep, was that same strange feeling in her chest she had felt earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rena awoke to the sun streaming onto her face through her bedroom window. But something was off, it felt like a great weight was pressing down on top of her. She opened her eyes, and nearly screamed as she saw that her chest had again increased in size, this time by quite a large amount. Each breast was the size of a large watermellon, and she felt a slight tingling sensation in them as the sunlight warmed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat up, causing her breasts to flop heavily into her lap. For a moment, she wondered if this was all some strange dream. She gently placed a hand to her right breast and gently squeezed it. It was definitely real, and felt like an overfilled water balloon. Sliding both her hands beneath her breasts, she attempted to lift them and tried to estimate how much they weighed. She guessed they were about ten pounds each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's brain struggled to comprehend the situation. Just yesterday, she was flat as a board. Now here she was with the biggest pair of breasts she had ever seen. What could possibly have caused this? Then, she had a crazy idea. Each time her breasts had grown, she had been listening to that CD. What if...just maybe...no, it couldn't be..., could it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had to know for sure. She got out of bed, and to her surprise, her new boobs didn't weigh her down. She pushed play on her remote and activated the disk again. As the music played she looked down at her breasts, watching for any signs of growth. For about a minute, nothing happened. Then, Rena felt that strange tingling in her chest again, and her eyes widened as her breasts began to expand before her eyes, growing about a centimeter per second, until Rena quickly shut off the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was right, the CD had done this to her! Rena was suddenly overcome by a flood of emotions, chief among them being confusion and joy. Confusion at how this was even possible, and joy because now she was busty, and could easily reel in any guy she wanted with hooters like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her high school and college days, Rena had been ignored by most boys, and picked on by most girls, all because of her twig-like figure. Sure, she was lean and athletic, but that alone was never enough to get her a real boyfriend. It had always been a secret desire for her to be super curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her thoughts turned to Dexter. She wondered if he had known about the second disk, and it's strange effects. There was only one way to find out. Rena quickly got dressed and took her usual route back to the mall. Getting her clothes on that morning required a bit of effort, considering all her tops were made for women who were less full figured than she now was, so she ended up putting on a blue tank top that, thanks to her new assets, exposed much of her trim belly, as well as her bountiful cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself as she looked at herself in the mirror. Am I really gonna turn some heads, she thought. And she was right. Rather than taking her bike, Rena decided to walk to the mall, even though it was quite a distance, and the entire way there, her breasts shook to and fro with every step since she wore no bra, having never needed one before. Just about every guy she passed stopped what they were doing and watched her walk by. Some of them were then slapped by their wives or girlfriends. Rena giggled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the mall and made her way to the Music of the Ages store. Dexter stood behind the counter with his back to her as she entered, focused on his computer screen. \"Hey Dexter.\" Rena said. \"Oh hi Rena, how was that disk I gave, WHOA!\" Dexter had spoken without turning around at first, but as he spun to face Rena, his mouth hung open and his eyes bugged out as he saw his formerly flat friend's new chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena...I...what...did you get plastic surgery?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Rena was offended by this remark, but then she figured that would be the most logical conclusion for her getting such enormous knockers in under a day. \"No Dexter, they're all real.\" Dexter could only stutter \"b-b-b-but how?\" Rena reached into her purse and pulled out the CD case Dexter had given her, she explained everything that had happened since they met yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how, but somehow this music on this disk makes my boobs grow. You wouldn't know why, would you?\" Dexter shook his head. \"I'm just as stumped as you. Tell you what, wait around until my shift is over. I'll take you back to my apartment and we''ll both examine that disk on my computer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next few hours, Rena sat around the food court, receiving more lustful stares from passing men, and a few jealous looks from women. Rena couldn't help but enjoy it, she had never gotten this much attention from so many people before. Aside from Dexter, a couple other friends and her family, most people treated Rena like she was invisible before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dexter clocked out and lead Rena out to the parking lot. Rena was surprised to see a Harley parked in Dexter's space. \"Wow, Dexter, I never would've thought you liked motorcycles.\" Dexter smiled \"Ain't she a beaut?\" As Rena sat on the bike, she wrapped her arms around Dexter's waist, pressing her breasts against his back. Dexter had always been rather shy around women that weren't family members or friends, so the feeling of the busty tigress hugging him, as well as pressing her mountainous mammaries against him, caused his face to turn tomato red beneath his motorcycle helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Dexter turned the key, the engine roared to life, sending vibrations through both their bodies. Dexter was used to it, but for Rena, when the vibrations hit her breasts, it caused them to jiggle about, as well as send waves of pleasure though her body, causing Rena to purr the entire way to Dexter's apartment complex. Not that it could be heard over the sound of the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached their destination, Rena was again surprised to see Dexter lived in a rather nice apartment. \"Just how much does Mr. Maxwell pay you?\" She asked, jokingly nudging Dexter in the ribs. \"Well enough. Now let's get down to business.\" As Dexter took the CD and went over to his computer to insert it, Rena lifted her top over her head, freeing her breasts from their confines. When Dexter turned around and saw his friend topless, he blushed again before facing the opposite direction to give her some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smirked. She was glad that Dexter respected her privacy, and thought his shyness was kind of cute, but if they we're going to test the disk, he would have to see her half naked self at some point, like it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena took a seat on a nearby sofa, Dexter said \"I'm going play the CD now, just tell me if anything happens.\" Dexter clicked the play button, and that same up tempo music began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The music causes Rena's breasts to fill with a light gas, inflating them to boulder size as they lift her up to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The music has an adverse effect on Dexter instead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For about thirty seconds, nothing happened. Rena sat there stating down at her breasts, expecting that familiar tingling sensation of growth to hit at any moment. After a minute had gone by, Rena did feeling something, but not the tingling she expected. Instead, it felt like a strange sort of pressure was growing in her chest. It was small at first, but steadily became more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music had stopped at this point, and Dexter asked without turning to face Rena, \"Well? Did anything happen? Are you bigger?\" Now that the music ended, Rena could make out a strange hissing noise, like that of an open helium tank, coming from her boobs and growing increasingly louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now that Rena noticed her breasts were growing again, getting larger and larger as the pressure and hissing increased in strength and volume respectively. Dexter picked up on the hissing sound and spun in his chair while keeping his eyes shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that noise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it's coming from my chest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Rena's breasts had become perfectly round, and had increased in size another three cup sizes, her nipples fully erected and sticking out from under her fur. Suddenly, Rena let out a yelp as she felt her backside rise off the sofa, and her breasts lifted up to obscure her face as she began floating in mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter, hearing his friend's cry of surprise, reluctantly opened his eyes, which immediately grow to the size of dinner plates as he saw his friend was now being hoisted up to the ceiling by the enormous furry blimps attached to her chest. Rena's breasts were now the size of medicine balls, and were growing larger still as the hissing noise became louder. Rena could feel the skin of her tits become taught like a drum due time the gas filling them, and the pressure inside them had increased to an almost painful degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena suddenly got a frightening image of her breasts popping, and silently prayed that wouldn't. Finally, the hissing and pressure ceased, as Rena's breasts were now the size of boulders. Rena silently thank any higher power watching that she hadn't been outside when this had happened, otherwise, well...she didn't even want to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Dexter, a little help please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter, still in shock at what he just saw, shook his head to bring himself back to earth. \"Um, yeah, right, okay.\" He stood up and approached Rena, grabbing hold of one of her ankles. He pulled Rena back down to the floor, but when he let go, Rena went shooting back up, he breasts making a dull thump when they hit the ceiling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rena, it would seem the music has caused your breasts to fill with some sort of light gas, helium, most likely.\" Rena rolled her eyes, that much should have been obvious. \"That's great, Dex, now how do I get back to the ground?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to do that would be to deflate them somehow. Hmmm...try puncturing them with your claws.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea didn't sit well with Rena. \"But what if they...you know...pop?\" A chill ran up Rena's spine at the thought. \"Good point. We'll have to find another way, but what?\" Just then, Rena felt a light tingle in her nipples as each one fired a small gust of helium. This gave Rena an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dexter, I need you to pinch my nipples.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. I can feel little jets of gas escaping from my boobs through my nipples. Maybe if you squeeze them, you can... well...milk the helium out, like when you let the air out of a beachball.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how am I supposed to even reach your...\" It was then that Dexter got an idea of his own. He grabbed both of Rena's legs and pulled her down again, but this time he laid her down on the floor, belly up, and sat on her stomach, straddling her. Their combined weight was just enough keep Rena from floating off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter looked down at the two massive inflated breasts in front of him, each one topped with an erected nipple like a valve on a pool toy, and he blushed furiously. Rena, despite not being able to see Dexter, knew he was too shy to actually touch her breasts. \"Dexter, please, just get it over with.\" Dexter hesitantly reached out both hands, grasped each nipple between his thumbs and index fingers, and gave them a light pinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSsssssssssssssssssssssssssss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelium began shooting from Rena's breasts in a constant stream, causing Rena to moan in pleasure, which only deepened Dexter's blush further. The twin balloons began to steadily shrink as their gas was released. After five minutes, Rena's breasts had deflated back down to watermelon size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot De-\" Rena said but cut herself off when she heard her voice, which was high pitched and squeaky. Dexter got off of Rena as he said, also in a high voice \"I think all that helium is still in the room.\" Rena giggled \"We sound like chipmunks.\" Dexter, forgetting the fact he was just pinching his friends nipples, chuckled. \"Next we'll start singing Christmas songs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening a window and turning on a fan to air out the room, they both resumed their positions, Dexter at the computer and Rena on the sofa. \"You still want to continue?\" Dexter asked. Rena nodded. Taking a deep breath, Dexter hit the play button, and the next track began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The next track of the CD causes Rena's breasts to grow back to the size they were when they were inflated, but this time, instead of lifting her off the ground, they begin to lactate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The music creates a second pair of breasts below Rena's already existing ones. (Hey, real cats have multiple breasts, so why not Rena?</span></div></div>",

Most of the scientists had gone home, the machines were shut down, and the only people left were the security guards. The building was so silent you could here a pin drop on the 5th floor from the 1st floor. It was also very well protected. Motion sensors, voice recognition software, state-of-the-art security cameras, and the best security force money can buy. For most people, BesionCorp was a fortress that no one could crack. And for others, it was a corrupt business<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see, BesionCorp has been accused of unethical practices in it's pursuit of medicine, and people, particularly animal rights groups, wanted them shut down. But every investigation turned up negative, and the company would go on working. If the people wanted to expose them, they needed someone really good to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's where Rena enters the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rena was considered one of the best corporate saboteurs in the country. She was know in certain circles for being able to complete a job without ever being seen. As a catgirl, she had better senses than most, so she could tell when someone was coming. And her agility and slim frame let her reach places no one else could. So she was perfect to find evidence that the company for cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she crawled through the vents, she ran through her plan one more time. Floor 4, the R&amp;D lab, was the only one with no cameras or motion sensors (which she thought was sloppy on their part), so that's where she was headed. Once inside, she would use her own camera to get evidence of animal abuse and get out the way she came in. If any walked in, she could easily hide in the shadows since she was wearing a pitch black infiltration suit (she thought calling it a catsuit was stupid).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reaching her destination, she unscrewed the vent and leapt out. She looked around the spacious room and found her target. Several animals were in cages on the other side of the room. Heading over, she pulled out her camera and took a few pictures. Then she pulled out her signature tools and placed them on the locks. The miniature explosives weren't enough to do real damage, but they could break the locks of the cages. And they were remote, so she could set them off after she left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she turned to enter the vent again, she noticed a small crate on a nearby table. It was plain white and labeled \"BustUp\". She had heard of this. It was a pill that was supposed to help nursing mothers by increasing their milk production. Rena thought that if this went missing, the company would lose profit and really suffer. Smiling at the thought, she picked up the box and went back to the vent and crawled out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back on the ground, Rena had one more thing to do. She pushed a button on her wrist and grinned as she heard the alarm go off. She raced off, satisfied with a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back home, she showered and changed out of her suit into a simple black tee shirt and shorts. She decided that, since it was late, she would send to photos to the rights group in the morning. She went down into the kitchen to get something to eat before turning in for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she entered she saw the box of BustUp she swiped from BesinoCorp on the table. She got curious looking at it. Could it really make women's breast grow? She opened the box and pulled out one of the pill bottles. The instructions on the bottle only said \"Take three pills with water\". The rational part of her brain told her not to take them, but the curious part said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, curiosity won out. Grabbing a cup and filling it with water, she opened the bottle and swallowed three pills. When she set the bottle down, she wondered about what she had done. Deciding that it was too late to worry, she headed up to bed, forgetting about the food she came down to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In her sleep-deprived state, she did not notice the note tied to the side of the crate. It read: \"Note to staff: this box of BustUp was made incorrectly. The wrong chemicals were used, but our scientists noticed before anyone took them. Dispose of them immediately and DO NOT INGEST\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In her room, Rena collapsed on the bed and went to sleep, dreaming of what she would do with the money she would get for the job. But during the night there was an odd warmth in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What is going to happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena wakes to discover that the pills worked, her breasts have grown 2 cup sizes and she can feel that they are full of milk. But she soon sees that note and finds she has a problem; she can't lactate AT ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Same as Option 1, but her breasts grow 4 cup sizes instead of 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Same as Option 1, but they are not full of milk yet.</span></div></div>",

Rena threw off her covers and tried to get up. But something was stopping her. She felt an odd weight on her chest. She looked down, and was shocked by what she saw. Her breasts had grown! They looked like they were about e-cups now. Rena, still shocked, reached down and poked one of her breasts. It was real. She couldn't believe it. Those pills had actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she got up and out of bed, feeling her new breasts sway with her movements. At that point, she realized that there was another feeling. It felt like her breasts were full of some liquid. So the pills worked as advertised. Not only was she bigger, but she was full of what she assumed was milk too. She couldn't believe it. She had to call another medical company. Maybe she could sell the pills. Really ruin BesinoCorp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, she had to do something about the milk. So, heading into the bathroom, she prepared to milk herself, hoping to get some of the weight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, and nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried everything she could think of, and no matter what, she just couldn't lactate. She even tried milking herself like a cow, and that gave no results. She was annoyed. Those pills were supposed to help production and lactation, so why was she not lactating? She put it off for now, decieding to come back to it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went down to the kitchen, her breasts bouncing the whole way. It was an alien feeling to her, and it made her blush.

She pulled it off and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why I can't lactate.\" She said to herself. \"If I can't lactate now, I probably can't lactate at all. I can't let anyone take this box.

It was an English settlement, with a population of some five hundred civilians, and protected by a fort, manned by three hundred troops. It was a pleasant little town, unless you happened to be named Rena. For Rena, Briston was the most miserable place on Earth. For you see, Rena's race, cat-people, were used as slave labor for centuries, and as such, she was treated like some ignorant beast by everyone in Briston, who viewed her as nothing more than the property of Josiah Blunt, the owner of the local tavern, The Sunken Brig.'For Rena, the tavern was aptly named, because that's what it felt like to her. The brig of a ship. A prison. Her prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Blunt had owned Rena since she was six years old, having been separated from her parents when they were sold at an auction in Havana. For fifteen long, miserable years, Rena dressed in nothing but rags, ate nothing but table scraps, and had been abused by Blunt, physically and verbally. If Rena's body had developed more in her teenage years, she had no doubt Blunt would have used her for more than just house work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENA!\" Came the voice of Blunt, loud as a trumpet. It seemed like whenever he spoke, it was always loudly, whether he was happy or angry, and he was usually the latter, especially to Rena. Rena immediately rose up from scrubbing the floor and stood at attention. \"Y-y-yes, master?\" Blunt stood before her, a scowl on his face. He was a big, beefy man, with a large and bushy mustache, making him look very much like a walrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I want you to go clean out the chamber pots, and bring up a barrel of whiskey from the cellar. After that, clean this place from top to bottom. The governor himself is coming tonight, and I want this place in tip top shape! Make sure he knows this is the best tavern in Briston!\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But master, isn't this the only tavern in Briston?\"'Rena was rewarded for her question with a backhand across her face. \"Don't talk back to me, you wretched alley cat!\" Thundered Blunt \"Question me again, and you'll get an extra beating tonight, am I clear?\" Rena nodded, tears flowing down her cheeks. \"Good. Now get to work!\" Rena spent the entire day cleaning every nook and cranny of The Sunken Brig, after which there wasn't one part of her body that didn't ache like the devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She wished she could just retire to her pile of hay in the cellar and cry herself to sleep, as she usually did. But to make matters worse, Blunt had her serving as a bar wench that night for the governor's visit, serving drinks.' It was a packed house that night, with every table occupied by either sailors, drunkards, or both. All except one table, where the governor and his wife sat. \"Mr. Blunt\" Said the governor \"These premises are hardly what you promised me when you said this was the best tavern in Briston, but I have heard a great deal about your famous brew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Trust me, my lord, when I say we have the best beer in the Caribbean. I shall fetch you a mug at once.\"' He poured two mugs full of drink, beer for the governor, wine for his wife. He handed the mugs to Rena. \"Take these to the governor's table at once.\" Rena did so, but just as she approached the governor, she tripped on a loose floorboard, sending a wave of alcohol splashing onto the governor and his wife, drenching them. Needless to say, they were furious, especially the governor's wife, because Rena had just ruined her best dress. Without a word, the two of them simply left the tavern, never to return.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena braced herself, knowing what was coming. In front of the entire tavern, Blunt grabbed Rena by the hair, and dragged her upstairs. After giving Rena quite the beating with his belt, Blunt proceeded to reprimand Rena for ruining his big chance with the governor, as Rena cowered in the corner.\"This is the final straw, you miserable sack of dung! First thing tomorrow, I'm sending you to-\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rena never found out where it was that Blunt would send her, because at that moment,there was an explosion in the distance, and a cannonball came flying through the wall, and took of Mr. Blunt's head. Rena could only sit there in horror, as she stared at the headless body of her former master. She heard screaming and more explosions coming from downstairs and outside. Rena fearfully peeked out a nearby window to see people screaming in the streets, running helter skelter in a mass hysteria as more cannonballs rained down onto the buildings of Briston. In the distance, Rena could see that the fort that protected the town was in flames, and she could make out just beyond that, a massive black man o'war, launching the deadly projectiles at the town. There was only one logical conclusion. Pirates. Panicking, and not thinking clearly, Rena ran downstairs and out of the now empty tavern, into the street. She knew she had to find a place to hide. The jungle! If she could just get to it, they'd never find her in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after that...she didn't know what she'd do then, but she'd figure it out when she got there. Now there was complete chaos in the streets. Citizens running in fear, pirates raiding houses and shops, carrying their ill-gotten goods back to their longboats to take back to their ship. Before Rena could decide which direction she should run, she felt a sharp pain on the back of her head, and everything went black. Rena awoke with her hands tied behind her back, and a sack that reeked of dead fish over her head. She had a throbbing headache from whatever had hit her, and she felt herself kneeling on a hard surface. From outside the sack, she could hear voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did we get anyone worth ransoming?\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, this island is full of some of the richest families in the West Indies. This lot is bound to fetch us a hefty sum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What about this one?\" Rena felt whoever was speaking nudge her with their boot. \"She don't look rich, probably a slave. She's of no worth to us.\" \"Let the captain decide what to do with her. He'll probably just throw her overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This last statement filled Rena with fear. She couldn't swim, and was sure to drown, or be eaten by sharks. Just then, she heard footsteps approaching, and two more voices spoke, one of them with a thick African accent.' \"What's going on here?\" \"We captured this slave girl in town. Shall we toss her over the side, sir? Or maybe put her to work in the galley?\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither! You know how I feel about slaves! Get that bag off her head, let me see her face.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But sir-\"' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't argue with the captain! Just do it!\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sack lifted away, and Rena saw she was on the deck of a ship, in a row of prisoners, tied and sacked as she had been. She looked up at the four men standing over her. One of them was a leopard-man, dressed in a leather vest, pants and boots. It was he who spoke with the accent.'Then Rena looked up at the captain, a white furred lion man with a red eyepatch and a large scar running down his neck. The man wore a red jacket with a jolly roger printed on it resembling a cat's eye and crossbones. Rena looked in fear before the captain looked down on her and let out a slight growl.\"I see they're still keeping cats as slaves. This hornet's nest hasn't changed. Fire more cannonballs. I feel like giving those cowards a little more of what they deserve. As for our guest, we have a prisoner in the brig who'll swap clothes with her. Willing or not.\"'\"Yes sir.\" said one crew member resembling a minotaur. Rena was escorted away by the bull man as the pirates released a final shot on Briston. She even closed her eyes in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard man walked up to the lion captain as both of them observed Rena. \"You aren't actually going to induct that woman into the crew are you Captain Ritter?\" The lion nodded his head. \"She knows all too well how cruel the world can be. I saw it in her green eyes Ben.\" Ben lets out a slight laugh. \"Are you sure you weren't looking in on her for another reason captain?\"Captain Ritter glared at his first mate and Ben just gave a smug look. \"Aye, aye Captain.\" With that Ben decided to follow Rena down into the brig. Rena saw several of the Briston elite locked up in jail cells. There was one lone woman in the pirates' holding cells, a mouse woman with long blonde hair who was wearing a bright red dress.The bull pirate walked towards the cell with the woman who just gave him a glare. \"You bloody pirates,\" says the mouse woman. \"My father is an officer in the royal navy. You'll all hang soon. Just the mongrels of society who'd take pity only on the worthless.\" \"Shut it Lucinda,\" said the bull man. \"You're still our prisoner. The captain says our new crew member needs a change of clothes and since you're the only other gal on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena watched as the bull got ready to strip Lucinda down. The mouse screamed as her dress was forcibly removed. In the process, it was torn slightly but Rena didn't mind. She even ripped off the bottom half of the skirt so as not to look too much like her oppressors. \"There,\" said the bull man. \"Now you look more like a pirate.... uh, what did you say your name was?\"\"Rena,\" replies Rena. \"And thank you. Nobody has...\" Rena lowers her head before she hears footsteps. \"I'll take it from here Nat.\" The bull man walked off as Ben came up to Rena. \"Better get used to the sea Rena. You're part of our crew now.\" Lucinda let out a scoff. \"Lot of good that does her since you're sailing to the lost ocean.\"Rena looked at Ben in confusion. \"Lost ocean? What is she talking about?\" Ben just let out a scoff. \"You don't have to worry about that right now. We have our heading. Our next stop...</span></div></div>",

There are a few more terms I want to discuss with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, our superiors realize that for this program we'll be pulling you out of society for a quiet a while, and we want to compensate your time as well. Your going to be paid, but that payment will be based on the number of babies your willing to carry. It's all that simple.\"\"And why does it have to be me?\" Rena asked, \"Aren't there others.\"\"Well, yes, there are other tiger-people. The problem is that you are the last female. All the others we've come across are all males, and in such will be the donors for our little program. Still, your the only female we can find. Thus, you see why you are so important. If we had not found you, the tiger - humanoid species would be doomed to extinction. We had almost lost hope when we finally tracked you down.\"Rena stood up from her couch, slowly starting to pace. This was a big decision. The way they were talking, she was going to get really pregnant, probably with at least four kids. She also would be pulled away from her friends and family for a year and a half. That is a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rena also didn't want to see her species end, and they were going to care for her and pay for her time.\"All right, I think I'm interested in doing this, but I don't want to do it here. My neighbors will surely see, and I rather they think I just went away than what they could think if they saw me pregnant.\"Dr. Seaman just smiled, standing up, \"Of course my dear. Our supervisors actually were hoping they could bring you to a more controlled environment, but we didn't want to suggest it. Still, if that is what you want, pack up any personal items you want. You don't need to bother with clothing, if you do recall part of our terms, but anything else that you want for entertainment or sentimental values is welcome.\" Rena just nodded, and while she still wasn't sure there wasn't any harm in going with them. If she really didn't want to, surely she could get out of it. The real point of no return was when she finally got pregnant, but until then she could still back out. After packing a suitcase with her music player, pictures, some books, and her favorite blanket Rena went down stairs. Dr. Seamen, Virginia, and Mr. Smith quickly led her out to a sleek, black car that was parked on the street. With a roar of the engine the car pulled away, Rena turning around to look at her house for a moment before sitting quietly in her seat.It was nearly an hour of driving later that the car pulled up to a large, research facility that was in the mountains north of the city. Mr. Smith grabbed Rena's suitcase, carrying it on his shoulder while Dr. Seamen and Virginia showed Rena inside the very modern styled building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our facility, the Mount Olympus Research Facility. Here, we work on a number of very important research projects. We are trying to develop a cure for cancer, and we also have a large staff of inventors that pump out new devices to make our modern world even better.\"Rena just gawked, looking through some of the windows into the very impressive labs. \"Who pays for all of this?\"\"We get some of our money from government grants, most it it comes from the payments for companies to manufacture the inventions produced by our staff, and we also have a economics research section that play the stock market. They alone make enough money to keep this whole facility afloat, but we like to build up as much assets as we can for new projects, such as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just why are you so concerned with the tiger people, which I'm supposedly one of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the tiger-people you speak off are the subject of great amount of research in our lab. You have some very interesting genetics, and on top of that our head researchers, Dr. Stanton, is one of those old softies that doesn't want to see anything go extinct. He sees extinction as the loss of something more than a species, but as millions of years of evolution slipping away. Still, that is all the technical stuff you don't realy need to concern yourself with. Now, let me show you your home for the next year and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two doctors took Rena into the back of the facility, into a huge white room dotted with black furniture. Eight camera's encircled the room, one in each corner and one half way between each pair of corner cameras. The room, in all essence, was like a Studio apartment. Everything was in a single room except for the bathroom, which Rena could only assume was the small room that was against the back wall. A large bed took up part of the room, a kitchen, dinning table, and a living area with what had to be the most elaborate entertainment center Rena had ever seen. There were also several book shelves, stacked high with a wide variety of books. There was almost a computer, a pretty nice one at that. \"As you can see, we've tried to provide you with everything you could need and, if something is missing, we will be sure to obtain that item or set of items as quickly as possible. Now, you would be watched through these eight camera's and, if you'll notice along the right hand wall, there are three two way mirrors. You will be kept under constant surveillance from there by Mr. Smith.\"Rena tensed a little, she'd be watched by that big bruiser. Dr. Seamen, seeing Rena's reaction, just smiled and said, \"Don't worry, he's big and scary but he's the kindest man on staff. He'll be living in an a joining room, watching you when ever he can and sleeping at the same time you do. You also don't have to worry about him seeing you naked, Mr. Smith is a proud homosexual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena tried to smile, though she didn't know if the fact Mr. Smith was gay would make much difference that he was going to be watching her everyday, completely naked. That was a fact that kept slipping Rena's mind. Still, the trio didn't linger in the main living unit for long before Rena was lead across the hall to another room. The other room was much smaller, but it had a very large bed and the same array of eight cameras.\"Now, this is our study room. Everyday, in the morning, you will be brought in here to be weighed and measured so that we can track your progress, and every week this is where you will get a careful examination to make sure everything is well. This is also where, if you agree to aid our program, that you will be impregnated. Again, I assure that you will be allowed to choose the means.\"With that Rena was shown around a little more of the facility, and after grabbing lunch with the doctors the moment of truth came. Rena remained silent for a time, debating with herself before finally turning to the doctors and, smiling gently, she said, \"Well, if its to save a race of people, how can I say no?\"</span></div></div>",

Your house will be secured and monitored to make sure no one bothers it. We will alert your employer, and we will lock down all of your finances to ensure no one tries to use your identity. We will also alert your friends and family that you have been chosen for a research project, and that you will return in a year and a half. We will not give them the details, since I assume not all of them would approve of your choice.\"Rena forced a smile, rubbing the back of her neck, \"Yeah, dad wouldn't really like this decision.\" \"Don't worry, we'll create a convincing cover story so that they think your helping save many lives instead of rearing them. Now, you may head to the living unit and enjoy the rests of the day. Take the time to familiarizes yourself with everything. We'll start the program tomorrow morning.\"\"All right,\" Rena said before Dr. Seamen quickly stood up and left. Rena stood up a few moments later, only to feel a shadow fall over her. She turned, letting out a smeel Eeep of fear to see Mr. Smith standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was the first time she had gotten such a good look at Mr. Smith. He had a deep, dark tone to his skin, and Rena couldn't help but think he looked like a bouncer for some night club. Still, after putting on a friendly smile he swept his arm towards the door of the facilities cafeteria, saying in his deep but still comforting voice, \"Please, follow me.\"Rena just nodded her head, falling in line behind Mr. Smith. Soon, the pair found their way to the living unit. Mr. Smith led Rena across the room to the kitchen where he pointed to a black metal control panel in the wall. \"You'll notice that there is one of these panels in each section of the room. These are intercoms that connected directly to my adjoining space. If you need anything, you simply have to press this button and tell me. I will ensure that your request is filled, even if I must do something myself.\"Rena forced a smile, \"Thank you, but...\"Mr. Smith laughed, \"Don't worry about anything. Now, I'm going to the monitoring station. Dr. Seamen has asked that you go ahead and get undressed now. If you haven't noticed, there is a ninth camera in the center of the ceiling. It a special scanner that can quickly analyze every aspect of your body and its current state. We need to get some control records so that we have something to compare against when you've begun the program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Mr. Smith gently waved Rena good bye, stepping out of the room and shutting the door. Rena was expecting for the door to lock, but instead of that metal walls began to expand from the floor, and basically locked off access to the main door. Rena was starting to wonder if she had made the right decision, but still everyone seemed really nice.Rena, though a little anxious at first, got undressed. It was so weird to just be standing naked in such a large room. Of course she had her fur, so her sensitive parts weren't really exposed. Still, Rena didn't even like standing naked in her own house. She always wore something, even if it was her night gown. This would be the biggest thing to adjust to.Once she had gotten used to standing completely exposed Rena began to poke around the room. She first tried out the bed, and found it was one of those special swedish beds. It was really comfortable, and Rena couldn't help but purr. After resting on the bed for a time Rena jumped up, going over to the kitchen and poking through the cupboards and refrigerator. Finding some milk, Rena poured herself a glass and drank form it slowly as she explored the rest of the living unit.The part of the space Rena would consider a living room had a large couch, a small coffee table, and a huge television mounted up on the wall. it was one of those HD TV's, and it was massive. It was like being in a theater. Below the TV was even more. A satellite TV box with built in TiVo, a VCR/DVD player, one of each of the new gaming systems, and something else Rena didn't even no existed. It was a voice command unit. She tried it quickly, and to her surprise it actually worked. She could control everything just by saying things, expect the game systems but playing a game with your voice would be really hard. Still, she could turn them on and off with her voice, and that was a pretty nice feature.\"We can also bring you whatever movie you wish to see. We've got a Netflix account.\" Mr. Smith's voice echoed from the nearby intercom, making Rena quickly turn around and looked at the two way mirror where a light flicked on and she could see Mr. Smith sitting there, waving with a wide smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena, instinctively, tried to cover herself up, but after standing awkwardly for a few minutes sher realized that she had been walking around for at least fifteen minutes. If he hadn't seen everything already, there was no point in hiding now. He'd see every part of her sooner or later.After poking around for a little longer Rena made herself a meal. Thankfully, there was a clock on the wall so Rena at least knew what time it was. Soon, after picking up and reading book for a while before watching a movie on HBO, it had gotten pretty late. Rena was starting to get nervous, gently rubbing her stomach as she looked at the clock. Did she really want to go through with this, making herself pregnant. Still, she decided to head to bed. She could probably make a better decision after a good nights sleep. She could still turn back, she hadn't passed the point of no return. At least, not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Dr. Seamen will arive, and after some thinking Rena's sure she wants to go through with this. Now, there is only more decision to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Dr. Seamen voices his concerns about the artificial insemination and how it could lead to some undesired effects in the children. Because of this, Rena decides to go the more natural route. After taking a set of pills from Dr. Seamen, Rena is allowed to the fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena, not wanting to loose her virginity before she finds someone she wants to marry, asks to be impregnated artificially.</span></div></div>",

Even though Rena didn't want to lose her virginity until marriage the risks of mutations in the children were enough to make her consider losing her virginity the lesser of the two evils. Rena said, \"I've decided I'll go the natural route to be on the safer end.\" Dr. Seamen said, \"Nice move which means we can reveal the male were tigers to you so you can decide which one you want to have his children from. But first off take this pill. It will force your body to produce more egg cells far quicker. It should make you able to have I assume octuplets.\" Rena consumed the pill and met the candidates. She wanted the offspring to be strong yet smart as well and have good looks to boot. She decided on the one she could sense was the best choice and the other were tigers left understanding if she was to have children they needed to have good traits. The duo went at it until sometime later. Rena said farewell to her choice and said to herself as her 8 eggs were fertilized to eventually create four boys and four girls, \"I know I wanted to wait until marriage but thing is I know how I am the sole female of my race. If I backed out I'd probably doom my race so by ensuring I have the best case scenario I have that weight off my mind which is this exact one I'm currently experiencing right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote by chapter creator: Apologies if this one was short compared to most writing real chapters is a pain.

She went to her closet and put on some running clothes and then went to the kitchen to get milk. She loved the taste of milk in the morning; it was ambrosia in her mind. After wiping her milk mustache off she grabbed her keys and left her home to run around her neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs could be expected she was quite fast at running and admirably agile. She loved to run; maybe she had some forgotten strain of cheetah in her blood. She would run and jump over potholes, puddles, and many other objects. This wouldn't have been to problematic, but as she runs she has the horrible luck to not be able to watch out for moving obstacles to well. During her run at the end of one block this morning, there was a hedge that took up most corner of the block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Rena, there happened to be a woman in her forth month of pregnancy coming around the corner. A very nicely figured woman with a little bulge of life was walking around miserable. She hated to be pregnant; she had gotten rid of every pregnancy she had ever had because she was not a girl that wanted to settle with one partner for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do this belly of mine? It's going to start to hinder my appearance and no man will want me. I guess I better get rid of this one like all the others. I have to find another woman today.\" She thought reaching the end of the hedge. \"Better do it soon or people wonder what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rena was thinking about the day as she reached the middle of the hedge. \"Well, what am I going to do today? I can finish up this run and then I can go to the store and get some nice fish to eat.\" She held her hands out as if she was holding a giant fish. \"I think that that might be a little big but I love fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at in a moment they collided. Rena out-stretched hands grabbed the woman\u2019s hips as she started to walk up the sidewalk and she shoved the woman down as her shoulder connected with the woman\u2019s sore breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAH,\" shrieked as she fell on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, are you hurt Ma\u2019am? I'm Soooo sorry. I didn't see you there.\" Rena was feeling so guilty as she usually did when she bumped into people. She was just rambling at this point because she spotted the lady's bulging tummy and correctly guessed that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch were the hell you run, stupid. I'm f%^*ing pregnant and you could mess up my beautiful face. Damn, cat-girls. Now my breasts hurt worse.\" As an awkward pause happened, she knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fine spring day. The sun was signing brightly and a cool breeze was blowing across the green field. Sitting on a blanket, the tiger-stripped catgirl, clothed in a yellow dress, breathed in the fresh scent, feeling at peace with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child cooed in Rena's arms, reaching up with its tiny hands to her face. Giggling, the catgirl lowered here face, allowing the baby to gently squeeze her nose and tuck on her whiskers. It was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, having her bright green eyes and its father's spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed the baby on the forehead and said, \"I'm going to name you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crack of thunder woke Rena up with a jolt. She lay there in bed, watching the trees through her window sway in the wind and listened to the soft perpetual hiss of the rain drumming against the metal roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no child. She wasn't even pregnant. It was all just a dream, Rena realized. The catgirl felt hot tears coming to her eyes and she curled herself into a ball. Why? Why did this have to happen with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had everything she had ever wanted: a house in the suburbs, a good partner and a well-paying job. The only thing missing in her life was children. She always wanted her own. Rena and her husband tried for many months, but she just couldn't get pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scheduled a doctor's appointment, and it was from there that they learned the horrible news that she was sterile, never able to bring forth life in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena cried softly, cuddling against the warm and soft figure behind her, who had one of his thick arms draped around her. Although he was sleeping, snoring softly, she got the comfort she needed, knowing that she wasn't facing this problem alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she calmed down. Wiping away a stray tear, she looked at the digital clock next to her bed, wondering what the time was, and saw that it was 5:30. They didn't get up for work until 6:30. Rena tried going back to sleep, but she found that she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently removed herself out of her husbands arm, in order not to wake him, climbed out of bed, and headed to the bathroom to take a shower. If she couldn't go to sleep she might as well get an early start on the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 6:35, and the dawn was breaking. The weather promised a gloomy and rainy day, which mirrored how Rena felt at the moment as she was eating some buttered toast in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud yawn brought her out of her self-pitying. Brian, Rena's husband, a six foot tall, 300 pound leopard, lumbered into the kitchen, clothed in his boxers and night shirt that displayed a video game counsel's remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his soft body, round face, and rectangular glasses that he was adjusting his appearance suggested that he was a nerd. And that was exactly what he was: a nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had known him since the early days of high school, and to this very day, even as a grownup, Brian still loved reading comic books, playing video games, and babbling about computers, a subject that he knew almost everything about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the average person, who had been indoctrinated their whole life about the stereotype of how they were obnoxious, unfunny, and boring people, would probably think that married to a nerd would be a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was actually the complete opposite. Rena found that Brian was the most friendliest, selfless, smartest, and cutest guy she knew. This was her dream husband. Seeing him made Rena feel slightly better, but it wasn't enough to draw her out of her depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, dear,\" he greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Rena said back, her tone listless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was reaching for a box of cereal in the cupboard, but he stopped and turned to his wife when he heard her voice lacking in the usual enthusiasm he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Rena mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian frowned and said. \"If it's nothing then why are your ears drooping,\" he pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn't say anything. She continued nibbling on her slice of toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this about the doctor's visit?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded solemnly. Brian sat next to her and pulled her into a hug. She buried her head into his soft chest felt a teal spill over her eyelid and crust her orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry things couldn't work out the way we wanted,\" he said softly, \"I also wanted kids, but life's cruel. We can't allow this to get us down. If you want to, we could perhaps get an adoption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena swallowed her lump in her throat and wiped her eyes. \"I know this is nothing that we can change,\" she said, \"but it's going to take awhile to get over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian nodded. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Do you think you could go off to work like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was silent for a few moments before she said, \"No I don't think so. I'll make up a story that I'm sick for my boss. I can afford to stay a day at home, just to try and get over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian kissed her on the head, causing her to giggle. She did feel somewhat better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should be getting dressed,\" Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you should,\" Rena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey broke the hug.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena found herself drifting around the house in a trance-like state. She had tried everything: she had read books, watched TV shows, and searched around on the Internet about a way to cope with her situation, but nothing helped. She couldn't escape her depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was wondering if she should seek out a psychologist for help or begin to take anti-depressants, Rena felt her foot colliding against something hard and heavy, the pain bringing her back to the real world. When she looked she saw that it was a toolbox. She had wondered into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike coming out of a dream she looked around herself, noting that it was mostly empty (Brian had taken their van to get to the computer company he worked at) but for one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden in a dark corner, as if it was trying to conceal its hideousness, was a old, dusty yellow scooter. This was Brian's when he was still at college. Rena had hitched a few rides with him and he even showed her how to drive it. The thing was still fully functional, she had heard from her husband, but the vehicle had no use anymore...until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark, rainy clouds, Rena observed while at home, was giving away to some sun, and catgirl had decided a change of scenery might make her feel better. She searched and found a helmet, climbed on the bike, and left the house. Where she was going she didn't know exactly. Rena was thinking that perhaps she, like in her home, should drive around aimlessly or go visit her parents for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she drove, houses, buildings, parks, and fields passing by with a blur, she spotted something that caught her attention. At the edge of town a group of wooden caravans, which looked like they dropped straight out of some children's fantasy book, were gathered together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColorful banners surrounded them, flapping in the wind. Curious, Rena drove there, parked the scooter, and headed inside. It was a gypsy fair. Rena had heard that the town hosted them every now and then. A considerable amount of people were gathered there, buying hand-crafted items from stalls and watching entertaining sights like fire-breathers breathing flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena walked passed the stalls and attractions, eyeing them with interest, momentarily forgetting her problems, she suddenly had to jump out of the way when a trio of child raccoons came rushing passed her, laughing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother female raccoon, which Rena caused was their mother, followed them and shouted at them angrily in a language the catgirl didn't understand. From her bulging belly Rena could obviously see that she was expecting. A burly male raccoon, which was most likely her husband, followed her, whispering something in her ear that made her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena watched as they passed and she envied them. They climbed the short flight of stairs that led to one of those wooden caravans and went inside. A scarlet colored tent, something else that caught Rena's attention, was attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metal plate with words written in gold colored letters hung above it, which read, \"Madame Esmarelda's Fortune Telling and Potion Shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn't believe in silly things like fortune telling and magical potions, but she found that this place was distracting her away from her problems and making her feel alive again. If she participants in something weird at this fair, she might feel even better. Besides, she was rather curious what would be said about her future, just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent was cozy, pillows acting as chairs. A low table was in the center, a crystal ball on top of it, and scented candles were burning, giving the air a sweet scent. Gingerly Rena walked in, taking in the mystical presence that the tent had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she called when she saw that the place was empty, \"Is anyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, yes there is, my child,\" a creaky voice said behind Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl jumped with fright and turned around. It was another female raccoon, but she was old, her fur turning grey. Her hair was tied in a bun, enhancing her sharp features, and she wore a flowing red robe, her arms covered in bagels. She was smiling kindly at Rena, and to the catgirl she seemed like every child's favorite grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"Sorry that I scared you, Rena,\" the raccoon said, \"My name is Madam Esmarelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's eyes widened in surprise. \"H-how do you know my name?\" she asked with shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmarelda grinned sheepishly. \"O, sorry, my dear,\" she said, placing a bony finger to her chin, \"My sooth saying abilities sometimes run away with me. It can scare people sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she continued, beaming and spreading her arms, \"what is it that you seek at Madame Esmarelda's humble shop? Prophecies? Potion? I got them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little freaky that this complete strangers knew her name, but it could have been just a fluke, and she dismissed it. \"Do you think I can have my fortune read?\" Rena said before reaching for her wallet, \"How much would it cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no need for that, my child,\" said Esmarelda, waving her hand, bangles jingling, \"Usually the first prophecy I give out are for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sit down,\" she continued, gesturing to one of the pillows close to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena did just that, slightly surprised. She heard they only pretended to know the future to make money, but this one seemed surprisingly humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it you wish to know?\" Esmarelda asked, sitting opposite to Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was in thought for a few seconds. \"Will I ever have children?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already knew the answer, but the question was just for fun. Esmarelda looked into the crystal ball, making a show of waving her hands over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon shook her head. \"I'm sorry to tell you this, my dear, but I see no children in your future,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded sadly. Even a so-called mystic could tell her that her life would be childless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, being barren is very sad,\" Esmarelda continued, looking just as sad as Rena. \"I can see that you and your husband, Brian, is struggling to cope with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena looked up. Okay, now things were getting weird. \"How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmarelda held up her hand to silence her, standing up. \"Wait here for me, dear,\" she said, turning around and heading somewhere into the back of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned later, holding something in her hand. \"It's a horrible curse for a woman not able to have children,\" Esmarelda said, \"My own daughter, Estrella, was ones barren too, but with a few very rare ingredients and some magic I was able to fix her with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the thing she hand in her paw on the table, and Rena saw that it was a small bottle that contained a pink liquid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now she's going to deliver my fourth grandchild next month,\" Esmarelda said, smiling proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena remembered the younger raccoon that passed her earlier, with her rowdy children and bulging belly. Was that Esmarelda's daughter? If that was, than this can solve her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I drink this, what would my future then hold?\" Rena heard herself asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmarelda looked in her crystal ball again. \"O my,\" she said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" Rena asked, leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A considerable amount of offspring, that's what,\" she answered, \"And most of them look like their father, spots and all, with your green eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. Rena had to buy this. \"How much?\" she asked, reaching for her wallet, ready to pay any amount she asked, no matter how ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Esmarelda said, \"for something like this I would ask 100 bucks, but seeing your story twisted my arm, so I'll give you this for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt tears coming to her eyes. She wasn't sure if this was a dream or real. The catgirl was expecting to wake up any moment, but that never happened. She stood up and hugged the raccoon tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, thank,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmarelda patted her back, saying, \"It's nothing, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O no what time is it?\" Rena suddenly said, looking at her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian had told Rena that he would be home early from work just for her, around 3 O clock. It was now 14:45. He would be home any minute now and very worried when he couldn't find her. It didn't also help that the catgirl had foolishly left her cell phone at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to go,\" Rena declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she left, Esmarelda grabbed her shoulder and said, \"A quick word a caution: there is something extra I threw into the potion. A sexual stimulant. Viagra, as you lot call it, just to get the love rolling, if you know what I mean. So, it's best you don't drink in now, if that is what you were thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded. \"Okay,\" she said, \"Thanks for the warning. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl dashed from the tent, Esmarelda watching as she left.</span></div></div>",

He was debating whether or not he should call the police for help when he heard a familiar noise that took him back to his college days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing back to the garage, he saw his ugly yellow scooter being parked by his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena?\" he asked, confused, \"Where were you?

So, slowly, she woke up.<br>\r\nAnd realized right away something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she wasn't in her tiny apartment anymore. Instead, she was in what looked like a master bedroom. There was a large wardrobe, a full length mirror next to it, three doors, and a medium sized window. Rena also realized she was lying on a huge bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Rena noticed was when she looked out the window. It was the dead of night outside. Which couldn't be right, since Rena took her nap in the middle of the day, and felt like she only slept for 3 hours. There was no way it could be night already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing she realized was that she felt really heavy. She couldn't place why. So, still disoriented, Rena attempted to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was immediatly stopped by someting. Now even more confused, Rena finally looked down at herself, and discovered the final thing that was wrong.<br>\r\nNow, Rena had always been a thin catwoman. Flat stomach, no breasts to speak of, and a boney butt. Even at 21, she had no curves. She felt OK with that So, it was a bit of a shock for Rena to discover that she was currently very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once A cup breasts had inflated to about DD cups, and felt very full. Her black bra (she now remembered she took her nap in her underwear) was straining to contain them. But beyond that was the real surprise. Her belly had inflated to basketball size, an orange furred dome dominating her frame. She also saw that her belly button had popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena spent a few moments in shock, before remembering that she was still in an unknown bed. So, very carefully, she swung her body to the side, put her legs over the bedside, and slowly lifted herself up into a sitting position. Then, she stood up properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrown off by her new center of gravity, Rena wobbled for a few seconds before finally finding her balance. Now up, Rena slowly waddled over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit, pregnancy looked oddly good on her. Her belly was nice and round, her breasts big and full. Turning, she saw that her boney rear had also filled out nicely, becoming a nice bubble butt filling her panties. Rena wagged her tail and wiggled her butt, teasing her own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from the mirror, Rena looked at the wardrobe. As much as she wanted to admire herself more, she needed to find out where she was. And she wasn't going to explore this place in her underwear. So she waddled over to the wadrobe and opened it. Inside was only one thing, a...</span></div></div>",

Rena sighed, and grabbed the suit. If it was the only thing in there, she didn't have much of a choice.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of struggling, Rena finally got the catsuit on. She was currently staring at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the suit was skin tight. She couldn't zip it up all the way, leaving a plunging v-neck that exposed her cleavage and belly button. What was covered was hugged tightly by the suit. Turning, she saw that the catsuit hugged her butt tightly, and that there was a hole for her tail. Finally, she looked in the mirror at the 5 inch heels. She just couldn't understand why they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rena yelped as she felt a kick in her belly. Rena started rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've finally made yourself known.\" Rena said. \"Well, I don't know where you came from, but I guess I'm stuck with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands under her belly, Rena waddled to the door, opened it, and stepped out of the room, heels clacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the room, Rena saw a hallway, much more lavishly designed then the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat on her couch, mindlessly staring at the clock. It was Saturday and, despite all of her best efforts, she had nothing to do. All of her friends were busy with things she couldn't do with them, the house was clean, the laundry was done, she didn't have anything to do for work, and she had already done her usual Saturday run around the neighborhood. It was just a slow day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mindlessly flipping on the television and finding that there was nothing to watch Rena decided that, at least to do something, she could go to the park for a while. There were sometimes fun things going on there, maybe she would see some people throwing frisbee or playing some other sport she could, hopefully, jump in on.With those thoughts ringing in her mind, Rena got up and quickly put on some tennis shoes before heading out the door. She had chosen to wear just a simple black tank top and denim shorts that day, just the right kind of things for the weather. With a smile and a quick glance up at the cloudless blue sky Rena began walking to the neighborhood park.Rena lived in a fairly nice suburban neighborhood called Infinity Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a safe neighborhood, mostly with middle class families that had two working parents and some children that were watched by the few, no working adults in the area. Rena was one of the few cat-people in the neighborhood, but there were a couple families. She was also, however, one of the few single women, every other person either too busy with work to date or already in a steady relationship that just hadn't become a marriage.Rena came to the park, the fairly large grassy area dotted with trees. A large pond sat in the middle where ducks and the occasional toy boat could be sailing across the calm, glossy waters. Birds were chirping in the calm trees, and Rena couldn't help but smile. It was really a wonderful day.After walking around the park paths for a while Rena decided to take a seat on the bench, leaning back as she took a break. Though it was nice out, it was also fairly hot. The sun looking down on the suburb with its glare. Still, other then the sun there was nothing in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Well....... almost nothing.A single, rather large black bug buzzed around mindlessly, going about its usual bug business when it began to notice something. A small glint up beside the sun. The bug turned, tilting its head to one side as the dot grew larger. Then, in a quick cut the bug was gone, blown apart as something streaked down towards the ground, crashing into the tall grass, but leaving no sign of its presence.(Because it works so well in other parts of the story, alien language text will be noted by &lt;&gt;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Is Everyone okay?&gt; A voice shouted from the very tiny, smoldering remains of what was an alien space ship. &lt;Yes, but the engines are shot and the cockpit is totaled. The ship isn't going anywhere.&gt; From the smoke a pair of very tiny figures appeared, no larger than a grain of dust. The figures were snake like in appearance, with frills around their heads, scales on their bodies, and long tails instead of legs.One of the snake-aliens, with tarnish gray scales and green markings on his hood and down his spine, turned and shook his head, &lt;Make sure everyone gets out okay and then salvage what you can. I'm going to go take a look around.&gt; &lt;You got it Lerden.&gt; The other snake, the engineer who had rust color scales, said with a nod before slithering back towards the wreckage. The black scaled snake, Lerden, watched his fellow head back towards the smoking pile of metal before turning his head and looking up one of the gigantic, single leaf trees they had crashed into. It was such a strange plant, nothing like it existed back on their home world.After searching for a time Lerden found a blade of grass that was not standing perfectly straight, and crawled up it until he stood on the very top where he could get a clear view of his surroundings. There ship scanners had already shown him a lot about the planet and huge creatures that inhabited it. The planet itself was as large as their home galaxy, and each person almost the size of a planet.At that Lerden turned, looking up and noticing one of the planet sized creatures was sitting very close to where the ship had wrecked. In fact, her foot was just a mile away(mile for them, not a mile for earthlings). They had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stretched, stifling a yawn. The park wasn't much more exciting then her house. There was just nothing to do today. She debated getting up, but found enough interest in watching a father and son pilot a remote controlled airplane to stay sitting for another ten, fifteen minutes. Still, once that was done Rena stood, stretching one last time before turning and taking a step out, deciding to head home.The walk home was uneventful, even though Rena kept getting a strange feeling that seemed to be crawling up her leg. Still, she ignored it, turning and heading down her walkway before stepping inside her house and shutting her door. Mindnlessly, Rena took off her shoes, tossing them into the corner before yawning and muttering to herself, \"Maybe there's something on TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Rena flopped down on the couch, grabbing up the remote. Still, just before she could turn the TV on she heard a strange buzzing noise, kind of like static. Then, the buzzing stopped and a tenative voice began to say, \"ainlsas2385onffsa89dhqa\". Rena lifted and tilted her head, looking around. She did not realize that the sound was coming directly from the edge of her ear. Lerden and the other alien-snakes sat percariously on the edge of Rena's ear, Lerden turning away from the microphone as he looked at his engineer teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n &lt;What's wrong.&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;She doesn't speak our language sir.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n &lt;Then do a quick mental scan, get me a translator.&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engineer only nodded, pushing a few buttons on the strange metal box in front of him before a small red beam flashed across the nearest part of Rena's skin. On the boxes digital screen,a few pictures of Rena's DNA appeared before the computer analyzed it and had prepared everything, launching a second flash to get the current build of Rena's neural network.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Were good to go. Try again?&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena jumped a second time, turning her head around as she tried to figure out where the voice was coming from. \"Whose there.\" \"Please, do not jump around so quickly. You may throw us off.\" Rena slowed, raising a confused eyebrow, \"What?\" \"Please, just hold still for a few seconds and I'll explain everything I am Lerden, a visitor to this world of giants. Our home world, a great many galaxies away from here, has been ravaged with war for so long I brought these few fathers, mothers, and children here in hopes of giving them a life of peace.\"Rena began to get slightly annoyed, \"Who is this? Rob, are you trying to play a trick on me.\" \"I assure you miss, this is no trick. Please, just go over near a mirror and I can prove it to you.\"Rena, undeniably curious about what was going on, slowly moved over to a nearby wall mirror. She turned her head, and was surprised to see something beside her ear. At first it looked like a small bug, but suddenly part of the mirror's image seemed to be magnified and its showed a small caravan of strange-snake people, probably a hundred or so of them, gathered around bug like vehicles that were clinging to her fur.It was very difficult, but Rena fought the urge to squash all of them with her hand. Lerden took this opportunity to continue, his voice filling Rena's one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you can see, we are a small race. While your solar system has eight planets our has hundreds, each floating around the sun and each planet about your size. The war rages between our people, and our planets. We just had to escape.\" \"But, why are you on me?\" Rena asked, still trying to fight the urge to slap them with her hand.\"Our ship was circling this planet as we tried to find a new home when something huge and metal flew by us. I believe it was one of your airplanes. It threw us off course and we crashed into the forest, or the grass beside your feet. We were just lucky you were there. We would not have survived in that grass for very long, the beastly creatures that hide in it surely finding us a tasty snack.\"\"Well, your safe now. So, how about I put my head down by the table and you get off so I can talk to you.\" \"Of course,\" Lerden replied, not wanting to anger Rena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few tense moments of holding her head above her coffee table Lerden told Rena all his people were off, and she quickly disappeared to get a magnifying glass before returning, looking at the tiny snake-people that now stood on her furniture.\"Thank for not harming us miss....\"\"Rena,\" she whispered quietly, realizing that her voice was probably many times louder to them.\"Rena. Again, thank you. We are safe here, for the time.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lerden sighed, looking back at the hundred or so snake-people standing behind him before talking into the strange voice translator and amplifier. \"Though we appreciate your kindness, we can not hope to survive in this world of giants for very long. Any homes we build could easily be crushed under a leaf from your trees. A gust or even the force of your breath could lift my people off the ground. We, the Pyths, can not hope to survive in such a place.\" Rena felt a little twinge in her heart. It was so sad to hear about these people. Rena couldn't even imagine being so small. They were literally dust-snake-people. Pyths, it was a strange name but Rena just shrugged it off. Still, as Rena watched the tiny people she couldn't help but ask, \"Is there anything I can do?\"Lerden seemed to perk up at this, as far as Rena could tell, as if he had been hoping Rena would make such an offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Please, miss Rena, I must ask you to do something that many of your people would probably refuse. We can not survive in outside world of this planet, but your bodies are in truth much like our home planets. Instead of being huks of stone, they are living, breathing things. The plants that grow on their surface feed the planet and us. The creatures live, as do our people, on and in the planet.\"\"So, what are you asking?\" Rena asked as she lifted an eyebrow.\"Please, great Rena, would you allow us to live within your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Rena couldn't help but shout, obviously hurting the ears of the tiny Pyths. \"Are you crazy, you can't live inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can,\" Lerden assured, his voice trying to be confident though his ears were ringing, \"we have amazing technology, and because your body is so much like our home planet we can easily adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a great many places in your body that have space large enough for us. Our technology can even create several homes in just the space between your muscles. We can leave around ever part of your body, and harm nothing. In fact, we can really be a benefit to your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our home planets are living, and in such they would get old at times. For a while, a planet would die until another one let off a chunk of itself to form a new one. Because this process destroyed thousands of homes and cities, we began developing technology to benefit our planets. From our scans of your body and mind, that same technology can benefit you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena leaned in a little bit, getting interested, \"How would it help me?\" \"Our technology could greatly increase your lifespan, and your youth would be proportionally extended. Any disease that were to enter your body would be killed before it could germinate, our entire power being focused on killing any bacteria or virus. We would take care of your body and, at the same time, defend it. It would be our home, a place my people hold sacred above all things.\" Rena leaned back a bit, crossing her arms. It wasn't a bad deal. Let them live in her and basically get the perks of youth, life, and a killer immune system. Still, the thought of having such creature crawling around inside her made Rena squirm a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she leaned forward, bring the magnifying glass back up as she asked, \"How would I talk to you if I wanted to.\" \"If we were in your body I could set it up so that whenever you perform a set action you could call me or whoever you want. Also, if you really want, we could put a very tiny projector near your eye, allowing us to project a holographic screen just in front of your vision so you could see as well as talk to us.\"\"So I could tell you if I'm not feeling well or not liking something that's going on in my body.\"\"Of course, we would do anything to ensure you were happy. If you are happy, your body will function better and, in such, make our lives easier and our home more pleasant. A few of our planets, the ones that had some form of intelect, became very inhospitable when they became angry.\"\"And, if I let you in, would you promise to stay away from my brain. I don't want you messing around with anything there, just so I know you don't change it so I'm just a puppet on a string to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heavens no. The brain is defended by very powerful and lethal biological defenses. We would never dream of trying to fight those. Besides, a single wrong move in your brain could cause serious damage to your body, we would be putting our only lives at risk.\"\"And, if things aren't going well, how could I get rid of you guys.\"Lerden swallowed, pausing. It was obvious he didn't want to tell her how to expunge them from her system, but at the same time he knew if he didn't tell her it might ruin all the negotiations. Finally, with a sigh, Lerden said, \"A chemical compound on your planet, if introduced to your system, would cause your body to expunge us and anything we were to build. In your terms, it is simply called Penicillin.\" Rena blinked a few times, a shot or pill of Penicillin was enough to make them leave. That was a very simple solution. With that thought, as a kind of backup if things started to go sour, Rena couldn't help but lean towards letting the snake-alien people, the Pyths, actually make a home in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after staying silent and debating it for a few minutes, Rena bent down and looked at all the Pyths through her magnifying glass before saying, \"Okay, but don't go anywhere near my brain. I would actually prefer if you stayed below my neck, but you can do a few things up in my head so I can talk to you.\" \"We will only insure our communication systems are in place and nothing more shall be done in the area of your head, I swear it.\" Lerden said, his voice filled with happiness, \"You don't know just what you have done for my people, miss Rena.\" All around Lerden the tiny Pyths were celebrating, and Rena could only smile until a simple thought struck her mind. She bit her lip for a second, and then asked the awkward question building in the back of her mind, \"So, uh... how do you get in.\" \"We can enter how ever you wish, but the ear would be the easiest for us.\"Rena smiled, as long as she didn't have to eat them. After getting a few instructions from Lerden the tiger-stripped cat-woman bent her ear down by the table, letting the Pyths climb into her ear and begin their journey into her body. Lerden paused, before disappearing into the depths of Rena's ear, using the communication device the quickly say, \"We will make contact with you as soon as possible. And, once again, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Lerden disappeared, and Rena heard and felt nothing of the Pyths. For a while she just sat in her living room, waiting for something to happen. Lerden had asked her to go about her business as usual, but to avoid any very strenuous activity like running or jumping. She could do all those things later, but once the Pyths had been given a chance to set up a small settlement somewhere in her body.Since it was nearing lunch time Rena decided to make herself a quick something, just a sandwich with salad and a glass of milk to wash it all down. Then, she went up to her bedroom, moving across the room before disappearing into her bathroom. She began to take of her clothes, planning to take a nice bath when she began to wonder something. Would the Pyths see her naked, and would it really matter since they were seeing her from the inside.Desiding that since they were obviously advanced aliens and she was basically their new planet Rena tripped of her clothes, putting a towel around her body as she started to fill the tub. The water reached a nice warm temperature, making Rena smile as she gently felt it with her hand.After taking the towel of and sinking her fur covered body into the tub Rena breathed a heavy sigh of relief, stretching out as she rested her head against the back of the tub. Mindlessly, she began to think of what might be different about her life now that she had tiny aliens living inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed without event, and as Rena got ready for bed she still hadn't heard anything from Lerden or any other of the Pyths. Could she have, maybe, just imagined the whole things. Maybe she had just been that board. Still, as Rena wondered about her mental stability she climbed into bed, yawning once before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============================================================<br>\r\nWhat should happen to Rena in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Get a message from Lerden. The Pyths have set up a settlement just below her neck line, and have started to get to work. As time passes, Rena starts to feel better and the aliens starts expanding their city through out her body. Because of their technology, the Pyths should be able to talk and even keep Rena updated about what's happening within the cities that now populate her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The Pyths have established two main settlements, one in each of Rena's breasts. Similiar to option 1, but more focused around the chest area.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Rena was awakened by neither her alarm clock or the sun's rays pouring through the window. It was a beeping noise, and a strange flash in front of her right eye. It was enough to force Rena from her<br>\r\ndreams, making the tiger_stripped cat-woman yawn and stretch, trying to go back to sleep for a moment before finally opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning miss Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena jumped probably a foot in the air, scared half to death by the very up close sight of one of the Pyths hovering in front of her eye. It was like around video screen was just hanging there, but no matter which way<br>\r\nRena looked it stayed in the center of the vision, hanging there like the volume or some other digital readout on your television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pyth frowned, looking at Rena through the screen as he said, \"I'm sorry, did I scare you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did.\" Rena replied, holding her chest as she tried to calm down. She then looked straight at the strange screen, reaching out her hand as she tried to touch it only to find her hand didn't even appear on the top of the image. \"How, how are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A holographic projector build onto your eye. It's projecting the image straight onto your retina so that there is no interference.My voice is also coming from a pair of audio broadcast point that have been installed in your ears. You are the only one that can hear me, which is I feel for the best.\"<br>\r\nRena sighed, finally calming her heart from the scare it had recieved before stretchhing a little more, \"So, am I talking and finally getting to see Lerden or one of my other new residents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, miss Rena, it is me, Lerden. For the time, until a proper settlement can be established, I am the acting leader of these people. Still, I'm sorry we could not contact you last night. It took longer to lay the communication relays then I had expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just nodded, yawning a second time. \"So, where are you guy's at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden smiled, his image disappearing from the screen while a new one appeared. It was kind of a flat map of Rena's body, those kind of pictures you find biology book. Rena found it a little stylized, but then again it was just supposed to be a map. And, about right in the center of her chest, between her lungs, Rena saw a small gray<br>\r\nmass that was labeled \"New Neretin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see,\" Lerden's voice continued as the map faded, \"We've set up our settlement in the center of your body. I do hope that is acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena nodded, \"I just asked you to stay away from my brain, and you did. So, what's going to happen after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My people will begin to build more advanced structures and the population will begin to bloom with some time. You see, while my people have fairly long lifetimes it does not take us long to produce a new generation. It was apart of our evoluction on our home world that, if we were thrown off a planet or it died, most of the population would die with it. We had to evolve so that once we found a new world we could repopulate it quickly. Thus, the population of Pyths in your body will increase quickly, but the more Pyths are nothing to fear. With more of my people it just means more to take of and repair your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can I help in anyway or \t\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden smiled, \"Even when you've given yourself as our home you wish to do more. We could not have found a<br>\r\nbetter place to make our new home. Still, our only request is that you go about your business as usual. We<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsurvive and thrive as long as you do. Also, if you could drink a little water before you do anything else. The water content in your body is a little low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just chuckled, shaking her head as she got out of bed, scratching her belly through her pajamas she went to the kitchen and got herself a glass of water. She drank it down, and actually decided to have a second before getting ready for the day. It was still kind of strange to think there was going to be a population of tiny people living inside her. Still, Lerden was nice and considerate, and she felt he was someone that she could talk to if something wasn't feeling right.<br>\r\nThe next month went by quickly, the Pyths population quickly growing within the confines of Rena's body. As the population grew, Rena actually began to notice how much better she was feeling. She was able to wake up faster in the morning, feeling completely rested. Whenever she worked out she felt she was starting to be able to do more and, on top of that, she was getting really strong while still keeping her lean, athletic figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physical benefits continued as Patina began to notice a few small improvements to her body. Her fur<br>\r\nseemed to gain a healthier shine to it, along with her hair. Her legs and arms seemed to have slimmed a little bit, giving her an ever leaner appearance while, at the same time, she was able to lift so much. Rena could also tell she had a lot more energy during the day, and she actually didn't need a cup of tea or coffee in the morning to get herself ready.<br>\r\nThe Pyths also began communicating with Rena in otherways. After the first week they had set up a program on her home computer that let Rena see everything going on in her body and the Pyths cities. Heck, she could even watch the Pyths television programming. It was a little strange to see a Pyth person talking about her body liike a weather man talking about earth, but it made sense and some of the other shows were quiet good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, the Pyths even gave Rena a chance to come in and see what their cities looked like from a first<br>\r\nhand view. Using their cybernetic technology, if Rena went and took a bath, suspending most of her body in<br>\r\nwater, the Pyths were able to link her brain to a robotic copy of herself. With that robot Rena began to explore the ever growing capitol city of New Neretin, which she found out later was the Pyths language for saying New Hope.<br>\r\nRena even found it funny that the Pyths adopted and then improved the democratic system that was used by the united states. They had a president, a congress, and a supreme court. Still, what Rena found funny was that being the governing force over the Pyths in her body was only a part time job. All the Pyths, even the one elected president, did their jobs governing the rest of the Community every Saturday. Otherwise, they worked like any average person. It was a system Rena actually sort of liked, it kept the Congress and President among the working class. It made them see what everyone on of their laws or acts did to every other Pyth in her body.<br>\r\nLerden, even though he wasn't elected president, still remained the primary representative of the Pyths to Rena. He was the one who came to her when the people, president, or congress had a special request. It was never anything big, they would want her to eat a certain thing or drink a certain liquid. It was all food except for the one time she was asked to eat small iron BB gun pellets. Still, she did, and the Pyths used them as their metal resource instead of the iron that natural entered her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, one month later, Rena woke up with a yawn, smiling as she quickly got out of bed and went about her<br>\r\nnormal daily routine. She showered, got dressed, and then went to her comptuer before checking in on the<br>\r\nPyths. The single tiny settelment that had been in her chest had now grown, and several other cities had sprung up across her body. One month later, there were Pyths in almost every part of Rena's body, their cities stretching from the tips of her hands and toes all the way to her neck line, which had remained the upper limit of the Pyths society since day one.<br>\r\n\"Wow, just short of one billion.\" Rena said to herself, surprised to see that in a month the Pyth population had jumped from around one hundred and fifty to such a huge amount. Still, she could never have felt better, and was happy to know she was giving a home to a billion people. Rena smiled, standing up from the computer as she mentally joked with herself. It was just to bad she couldn't right it off on her taxes.<br>\r\nStill, inside Rena the situation wasn't as keen. Lerden sat around a table with several acting leaders of congress and the president, there meeting one of growing importance.<br>\r\n\"All right, settle down.\" The president said, turning his brown scales head around, \"just so everyone's on the same page lets get the current situation from Professor Gerectin.\"</span></div></div>",

We have done this with our host Rena, but I have discovered a small problem. The re--population process is going to far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean going to far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually, when Pyths try to repopulate on an empty planet there are another group of Pyths there, ones that don't want to share and want to fight for control of the planet. Thus, we have war and conflict where our best men and women go off to die. Also, our races population growth is usually also hindered by the planets natural weather,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut Rena's body is designed to maintaining itself at a constant set of conditions.\" \"What does this all mean Professor Gerectin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that our population has grown and filled every part of this young woman's body, but that our re-<br>\r\npopulation cycle, when were new Pyths are being born at alarming rates, will not end for some time longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To simplify what the Professor is saying, at the rate new Pyths are being born we will begin overpopulating<br>\r\nRena's body within a few earth days. Once that happens, tension will begin to rise and we risk having a civil war, something I don't think we or our host Rena wants to endure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Professor, have you come up with a solution to our problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come up with something, though I wouldn't call it a solution. With our technology and the help of the people we can slow the population growth down substantially, but the reproduction cycle, according to my figures, will continue for at least a few more days if not a couple weeks. Thus, even if we slow the population growth down to a crawl we will still need more room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden shook his head, \"But we can't get anymore room. Part of our agreement with Rena is to keep below her neck line, if we don't she may decide to kill us all. She knows how to get rid of us if she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Representative Lerden, I was not speaking about expanding into Rena's head.\" The Professor<br>\r\ninterrupted, a twinge of annoyince in his voice, \"From my studies of the earthling population, of humans and cat-people, there are a few places where, using our technology, we could encourage Rena's body to grow and in such create new space for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly would you suggest to make this growth occur?\" One of the congressmen asked, leaning in.<br>\r\n\"There are a few options. First, there are some very simple, small changes that we could do that I am sure miss Rena would be willing to allow. These would include making her tail longer, thus providing a great deal of new homes in that area. We could also just make her an inch or two taller, thus increasing the size of her body in safe proportions and creating a great amount of space to open up all across her body. This however, according to my figures, will not be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any other options Professor?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but these would surely require the approval of miss Rena in advance. From my studies of humans and cat-people, I have learned that not all of them are shaped like Rena. Some are a great deal larger, have grown round, there bodies thick with fat, which for the earthlings is a store of energy to be used later. Also, for the women of the planet, I noticed that Rena differes from some who have large spaces, breasts, protruding from their chests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the purpose of these breasts?\" One congressmen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the same as the Herejels that are on our people's women. They originally designed to feed young<br>\r\nhumans and cat-people with milk from their mother. Now, these are our two other options for creating more<br>\r\nspace until this population boom has ended. First, we could possible start building out all across Rena's body. It would give her the appearance have having a little more fat in her body, but we shouldn't have to expand her out to far. The second option is to encourage growth in Rena's highly undeveloped breasts. The growth there would need to be more substantial to meet our needs, but it is also something that Rena may prefer. Also, we should offer her the chance to choose both options, thus giving us even more options to work with.\"<br>\r\n\"So if we have these options why don't we just use them?\" One congressmen asked, pounding his hand on the table.<br>\r\n\"We can't risk upsetting Rena. One month ago she was kind enough to let us into her body, to let us make it our new home. We can't betray that trust by simply expanding her body whenever and where ever we need it. We must first ask Rena.\" another congressmen argued, his voice starting to break into a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is why,\" The President interrupted calmly, \"we have invited Representative Lerden here. He is our<br>\r\nprimary intermediary between us and Rena. Lerden, the next time you speak with Rena please inform Rena of our situation and then ask her about making the small changes first. Only at the end of the conversation are you to bring up the larger space expansion measures. We need her to okay at least one of them, and it would actually be better if she agreed to both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden nodded, and soon the meeting ended. That night, After Rena had gotten back from work, she flopped down in front of the TV only to find Lerden and the round computer screen appearing in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Lerden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, miss Rena. I hope you had a good day at work.\"<br>\r\nRena shrugged, \"It was work so how good could it be. Still, is there something you need to talk to me about. You usually don't come calling unless there is something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nusually don't come calling unless there is something important.\"<br>\r\nWith a sigh Lerden began, explaining the situation to Rena. Then, as the president suggested, he first asked her if it was okay to do the small changes first. That included the increase in height and the length of her tail. Rena thought about it for a time, but agreed none the less. She said the Pyths could make her probably six feet tall, adding about four inches to her height and they could make her tail longer as long a sit didn't drag on the ground.<br>\r\nLerden smiled, bowing his head, \"This is greatly appreciated Rena, but I'm afraid those small changes will not be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Our races planet re--population cycle could continue for another few weeks and increasing your height and the length of your tail will not be enough. We were hoping you would let us expand a couple other parts of your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which parts?\"<br>\r\n\"First, since you are a very lean and thin person, we could expand you out a little. You would look, from human terms, a little fatter but I assure you not an inch of it would be fat. You'd be in no health risk and that growth, while it would be on a very small scale, could provide a great deal of new space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other way,\" Lerden continued, \"is if you let us stimulate your breasts to grow. While this may be a more acceptable growth, we would have to encourage a larger expansion to create the same amount of homes we need. Or, if you truly desire, we could do both but split the difference in new homes we need between the two growths, thus limiting both to half the the projected size requirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you either want to make me fatter but not really with fat, you want to make my breasts bigger, or you want to do a weaker combination of the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden nodded, rubbing the back of his neck, \"Yes, but only if you agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena leaned back a bit, staring up at the ceiling. \"And are you sure it won't be anything to extream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to have a small cushion for the influx of people that will be joining the population. Once our planet re-population cycle is over we can limit the birth of new children more and get the population back down so that you can return to your current state.\"<br>\r\n\"So, it wouldn't be permanent unless I wanted it to be.\" Lerden nodded, \"Yes, miss Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess\t\"<br>\r\n============================================================= <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Rena agree to\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Either breast expansion or a little fattening up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: A little bit of both.</span></div></div>",

She really didn't want to get fat, she liked her lean body. Still, as Rena thought about the other option, the choice of having her breasts enlarged, she couldn't help lift a hand up and gently feel her chest. She was, by all standards, flat chested. Though she liked her body she couldn't help be envious of women who were a bit more bountiful, even if they only had B cups. The jealousy kind of started back in high school, when she lost her high school sweet heart to another girl her Jr. year, when the<br>\r\nother girl was bouncing around with D cups and she was as flat as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rena's attention shifted back to the small round, holographic monitor in front of her eye, smiling as she said, \"You can go ahead a build out my breasts, just don't get to crazy, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden smiled, bowing his head, \"Oh, thank you Miss Rena, you are a wonderful host, we could not ask for a better home.\"<br>\r\nRena could smile as Lerden's picture disappeared. The rest of the evening went by without incident, and as Rena got ready for bed she couldn't help but stop and look at herself in a mirror, trying to imagine herself with bigger breasts. She could only shake her head, deciding to just wait and see what she looked like in the<br>\r\nmorning. She began to crawl into bed, but on a quick though stood back up and grabbed a pencil from another part of the house. She then stood up flat against the wall, taking the pencil and marking her height lightly against the white paint. .After all, Lerden said that they would also need to make her a little taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Rena was woken up by the sun, a smile slipping onto her face. It was , thankfully, the weekend once again. It was actually the fifth Saturday since the Pyths had moved into her body. Rena could only yawn and turn over in her bed, slowly opening her eyes as she looked out the window. That one strange Saturday had really turned out to historic day in her life. It was the day she became a home to a hundred or so Pyths, and a month later she was giving shelter to over a billion of the tiny people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Rena began to stretch, but was surprised when her toes slid of the edge of the bed and began to dangle in mid air. Rena moaned a bit, the morning air feeling cold on her toes as she tried to scooch closer to her pillow. Still, at the same time, Rena found that once her toes were back on the bed she was really close to the bed's<br>\r\nheadboard. Finally, Rena succumb to her own confusion and curiosity, sitting up before slowly opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had been curious about how her feet were hanging off the bed, Rena's eyes were quickly drawn downward to her chest. Protruding there, bulging out against the small T-shirt she had worn to bed, were the clear shaped mounds of flesh that had to be breasts. Rena stared for a moment, and then her mind began to remember what she and Lerden had spoken about the night before. Could the Pyths have finished making her grow already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even taking a moment to think Rena sprung up from bed, darting into the bathroom and shutting the door before pulling off her shirt and looking into the mirror. What Rena saw kind of surprised her, but made a<br>\r\nsmile creep onto her face none the less. Standing out from her chest like a pair of small mountains were a pair of fairly large, nicely shaped breasts. Rena lifted a hand to each one, gently bobbing them up and down. They had to be at least CC cups if not D's. Rena could only smile wider, pushing her breasts together and rubbing them<br>\r\nslightly. She was like a little girl that had gotten a new play toy, but still Rena's mind intruded on her glee and reminded her off the other things Lerden said the Pyths would do.<br>\r\nNot bothering to slip a shirt back on Rena walked into the bedroom, quivering slightly as she felt her breasts sway back and forth with her walk. SHe could feel the delay, the momentum of her breasts making them fall just a few seconds behind the rest of her body as she walked. It was so strange, but it was something could only make Rena smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding her marks from last night Rena measured herself against the wall again, standing back as she<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncompared the two marks. She was taller, but only by about an inch. Rena then looked down at her tail, putting her hand at the tip and letting it slip down to the very tip, her tail did seem longer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Miss Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena jumped a bit, scared by Lerden's sudden apperance. Instinvtively, Rena covered her chest, even though it was really pointless to cover herself up to the people that were living inside of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n\"Just fine, thank you Lerden.\" Rena replied, recovering from being startled. \"I wanted to check in and see what you thought of our handy work.\"<br>\r\nRena smiled, glancing down at her breasts before looking back up at Lerden, \"Well, I'm certainly impressed, but I thought you were going to make me four inches taller, not just one.\"<br>\r\nLerden chuckled, \"Making you taller Miss Rena is a much more difficult feet then making your breasts bigger. We must equally elongate and enlarge multiple parts of your body, adding new length to every muscle, blood vein, and nerve to ensure that your body can still operate properly at the new height. It is a much more technical task since we are doing it across your entire body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how much longer will it take or are you guys done with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me see, I have the construction report right here.\" Lerden said, looking off the side of the screen before pulling something that looked like a digital clipboard in front of his face, \"Well, the incease in height, as you have probably guessed, is at 25% completion. Tail lengthening is also at 25% since were trying to make those two projects match up. And breast enlargement is at 50%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"50%,\" Rena echoed, a little suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, there going to get bigger than this?\" Rena said, her eyes drifting down to her D sized breasts.<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, unfortunately we must make room for the worst case scenarios, in case the population growth can't be control as well as we hope. Still, if you want we can stop, but that means we either run the risk of overpopulation or we'll need to shift the construction over to the other option we had, which was just a little fattening up across your entire body.\"<br>\r\nRena paused again, her eyes still fixed on her already substantially sized breasts. Would she really want them to be any bigger, or could she stand to be a little softer and thicker, just until the Pyths had gotten their population under control.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure I can handle my breasts larger.\" She said, smiling a bit, Lerden nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"as you wish Miss Rena.\" he said, bowing as his screen faded once more, Rena smiling to herself a bit as she completely undressed, stepping into the shower and turning on the water, purring as she got it to just the right temperature, before she took the shampoo from its special place on the shelf of her shower, squirting some on her hand, rubbing it into her bright crimson hair, lathering up with a smile, humming as she washed her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe showering was good, the water from her economy shower was surprisingly warm, much different to what it usually was, and as she rubbed her fur down with her special body wash, she found her hands unintentionally gravitating towards her chest area. Slowly opening her eyes, she looked down at the two furry d cups and furrowed her brow, before beginning to wash them, blushing as the experience was surprisingly enjoyable, her new twin's more sensitive to the touch than normal as she gently, and ever so slowly continued to wash them, savouring the experience as a gentle coo escaped her lips, smiling as her tail wagged a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of sheer bliss in the shower, Rena sat on her bed, wearing some fresh PJ's while she sat her laptop on her knee, looking at some of her E-mails. It was then she noticed an E-mail in her inbox, the sender of whom made her gasp with surprise, as she opened it up, smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Rena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Its been a long time girlfriend, I just thought I'd send this little message to you to let you know some great news, Me and Sarah have moved into the apartment complex a few blocks away from the center of San Francisco, so I thought it'd be best to let our oldest friend know of our arrival, Anyways, Me and Sarah are just getting settled in at the moment, but we'll be sure to contact you again when we're ready to meet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the best, Nicole.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena squealed in excitement, Nicole and Sarah were her two former roommates from college, she hadn't seen them since their graduation, the two other catgirls having set off to tour America's states, and now it seemed they were back from their trip, and Rena couldn't have been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, the tomboy of their college trio, is a black panther catgirl, while Sarah, the adorable wallflower, is a cream furred cougar, the three girls had hit it off during their junior year at college and had been fast friends ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow...I can't believe its already been two years since I last saw those two....heh...boy will they be surprised...\" she said, smiling in a sly manner as she cupped her endowments, already imagining them doubling their current size, as she pictured her friends faces of shock, making her giggle like a schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, I'd better go buy some new clothes, can't let those two see me in old tatters.\" she said to herself, getting up and going to her wardrobe, opening it and finding, to her surprise, where she had once had old worn out clothes, now sat a fully refurbished array of clothing, all of which made her gawk, that is, until a familiar display popped up over her vision, Lerden smiling at her, as she began to grin too. \"Lerden....you guys did all this for me?\" she asked, disbelieving of the gift she'd been given by her tiny residents, Lerden smiling as he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course Miss Rena, you are our host afterall, we owe you more than words can express, so we figured this would be a start of repaying you.\" the Pyth said, making her blush and smile as she slowly took out an outfit, putting it on and smiling at how it fit her new figure perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....its great...\" she said to herself more than anyone in particular, Lerden smiling as he shut off the display so she could admire her new garments in relative privacy. Rena smiled wide as she put on her new boots, taking her handbag and walking to her front door, going to her car and driving out of her cul de sac towards town so she could buy some groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nso, what shall happen next is up to the reader.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition written by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shook her chest back and forth a little, arms still clasped around her exposed breasts, (thank god she had also worn pajama bottom the night before otherwise it would have been a far more interesting conversation with Lerden). Though she could have liked her breasts a little bigger, this kind of growth would be hard to explain to her co-workers on Monday. With that Rena fixed her attention on Lerden, smiling as she said, \"I think I've got a big enough chest already. You can go ahead and do a little of this, fattening yet its not really with fat expansion. Just, please, keep it limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden smiled, bowing his head, \"Of course Rena, we would never wish to upset you.\" With that Lerden disappeared and Rena quickly went about her  morning routine, getting dressed. The morning went by simply, Rena doing some chores around the house and working out, though it was a little pointless. Since the Pyths had moved in Rena's body had been in top physical condition. She was much stronger than she was, and yet her body was still lean and fit. She had gone to the beach once earlier that month and drawn a few stares from men with just her amazing lean body.<br>\r\nAt that Rena began to smile, looking down at her breasts. She really didn't have anything else to do that day, and she couldn't help but wonder just how much a new bust line would change how people looked at her. With that thought lingering in her mind Rena cut her workout short, which had been fairly amazing considering she could feel her breasts bobbing and swaying, and quickly gathered up a few things before heading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it would be easier to drive, Rena popped into her car and hit the freeway. Fifteen minutes later the ocean came into sight, the sparkling beaches of the city fairly populated. It was, after all, summer and the tourist season. .Though Rena wanted to head straight for the beach she knew that, first, she would need to go buy a new swimsuit. After all, her old suit wouldn't be able to contain her new assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Rena first pulled into the driveway of a local beachwear store, stepping inside. It was a small store, just a little thing that sat right on the beach. It was meant to be a place for people, namely tourists, to buy swimsuits if they forgot theirs or simply needed a new one. Rena poked around for a while, but couldn't believe how much they were charging for the suits. It was almost double what they suits were really worth, but it made sense. When people wanted a swimsuit at the beach they really didn't want to have to leave the beach to get it, meaning this store had a very reliable market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after poking around for nearly half an hour Rena found a suit she liked, paying for it before heading outside, a smile on her face. Whiel one of the cashiers had been ringing up her suit the other had been staring at her, or namely her breasts. She could only wonder if he was imaging her in the new suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reparkign her car in one of the beach parking lots Rena got out, taking her small beach bag and heading for the changing room. Thankfully, there were individual stalls because Rena would have surely looked silly trying to put on her new swim suit, silly like a woman who had just gotten breast implants and hadn't gotten used to them. (Which was technically true, but was for the good of the Pyths.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when Rena was ready, she stepped out onto the beach, smiling as she kept her beach bag on her shoulder, which really only carried a towel and sunglasses(fur makes and excellent sun  screen). Barely containing her body, and keeping herself decent, was a small, deep blue bikini. .Rena had seen it in the store and, while it wasn't her usual idea of swim wear, decided that she would get it. This was an experiment after all, to see just how many more people noticed her now that she had more than just a lean body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Rena chose just to lie out on her beach towel, relaxing in the warm sun while she wore her thin, black sunglasses. Still even as Rena laid in the sun she glanced around on occasion. She kept a straight face, but on the inside she was smiling broadly. There had been a troop of college boys nearby, with large black cases on the beach, and she had obviously gotten there attention. Rena watched the guys for a time, her gaze hidden behidn her sun glasses. What were in those strange black cases anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as Rena laid there her question was answered. Another, older college student started drawing the others attention back, opening his own black case and pulling out, to Rena's suprise, a trombone. It was then she remembered reading something in the paper. The local college had a marching band and they had a regular practice schedule, but the bands trombone section practiced a little more, going to once every weekend to perform for the tourist, practice, and have some fun in the sun. Rena could only smile, listening as the twenty or so trombones began to warm up before going into some up beat, kind of jazzy song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two hours the trombones left, but Rena was still lying on her towel. In truth, feeling the sun on her fur really felt wonderful, and it felt even better no her breasts, which seemed a little more sensitive. Still, without the music to keep her occupied, and the slight glee she got every time one of the trombones players glanced back to look at her, Rena decided to head into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, it had been interesting running towards the water in her new bathing suit. Since the bikini was restricting her breasts a bit they didn't sway from side to side as much, but they still bounced up and down a lot and Rena couldn't help but shiver. Then, she hit the water, the temprature difference sending a chill up her spine. Still, Rena went a little farther out. The water was really calm that day, very few waves so Rena was comfortable coming to a stop just about where the water was splashing over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Rena had to stop for another reason. The sensation of the cool water moving against her breasts was just to intense to ignore. With most of her body clearly hidden from any prying eyes, Rena hangs moved up through the water, cupping her breasts before gently massaging them. Through her bikini Rena could feel her very hard nipples, which stood out painly in the cold water. The water itself was entrancing, the liquid dancing around her fur as the ocean pushed and pulled against the water. Combine that with her own massaging hands, and Rena couldn't help but start puring in her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this for a while, swimming around and then getting some very flirtacious talk from a couple of guy swimmers, Rena gathered up her sunglasses and towel and headed home. It really had been a day at the beach, because just as Rena was leaving she was able to stop and watch the sunset over the water. She stayed, standing by her car as she watched the sun until it had completely disappeared, leaving only once it really had started to get dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had gotten home night had settled on the city.. Rena walked into her house, having not bothered to change out of her swimsuit as she dropped her beach bag down beside the kitchen counter and strolled through the house. While she had been expecting Lerden to talk to her at some point, the Pyth never appeared as Rena made herself some dinner, ate it, and then began getting ready for bed. She showered to get the sand and salt water off her fur and then weighed herself. She was right around 155lbs, but she could only expect that after gaining her new assets. Once she had her weight Rena brushed her teeth and soon was in her bed, deciding to sleep naked for the sheer comfort of feeling her sheets on her sun bathed fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something suprising would await Rena in the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: As she told Lerden, when Rena wakes up she finds that she is another inch taller, her tail is longer, and that she now feels softer. She doesn't look any different in the mirror, but Rena can feel it. Every part of her body is a little softer, like she was fatter even though it didn't really happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena wakes up to a huge surprise. Her body has expanded far more than it should have. Her breasts are now boarding at being HH cups and her whole body looked chubby. It was then she learned that, while she was at the beach. another ship of Pyths had detected the civilization living inside her and came to her body for refuge. A few hundred more Pyths wouldn't have been bad, but these Pyths were at the beginning of their Planet Re-Population cycle, and there were a good thousand on refugees that came to Rena's body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This addition written by System_Crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Rena slept soundly, unaware of what what was happening to her body. Still, the morning sun came and with a yawn Rena tried to lift herself out of bed, only to find that her body felt strangely thick. She yawned again, eyes still mostly shut as she got out of bed and began to wander towards the bathroom. She couldn't help to notice that her breasts were swaying more than the day before, but her mind was still to asleep to really process anything.<br>\r\nFinally, Rena stepped into the shower, turning on the water. With the warmth driving away the cobwebs of sleep Rena opened her eyes fully and looked down at her body, planning to clean herself. Still, instead of scrubbing her form Rena screamed, jumping out of the shower and looking at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the night before Rena had become fat. Her once trim, tight body was now cover in a fairly thick layer of flab, her arms and legs thick, her belly round and squishy. The only part of her body that didn't seem to have changed was her head, but what was a thin head when the rest of your body was fat. Also, Rena couldn't help but notice her breasts had also grown. What had been nice, big for society but managable D cups the day before were now much bigger, at least twice as large. They look like a pair of round basketballs standing out from Rena's chest, and Rena could only hold them as she began to wonder what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if answer her call, Lerden appeared in one of Rena's eyes, a very guilty look on his face. \"Miss Rena, I must first apologize for what has happened. I tried to convince them, but the congressmen and president override me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday, while you were at the beach, something miraculous happened. Before we made our home in you, there had been a few other ships that we were traveling with. A meteor shower had separated us, and we feared the other ships had been lost. Still, yesterday while you were on the beach we got a signal from them, and we called them in. They landed and entered your body while you were listening to those trombones play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden sighed, continuing as he leaned forward, \"There were a thousand Pyths that had managed to survive the meteor shower, our freinds, brothers, and family that we thought had been killed. We didn't think before calling them in. What were a thousand Pyths compared to the billion that lived in your body. What we didn't realize was that, since they came here, there bodies shifted into their own Re-Production cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Lerden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pyth sighed, shaking his head, \"Because of them, the whole Planet Re-Population cycle has been restared, but this time instead of just a hundred and fifty pyths at the beginning of the process there are far more. All the pyths that were neard the ships at the time have also been sent into the Re-Population cycle, putting a good 3,000 Pyths reproducing at alarming rates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this why I've gotten bigger, so you can make more room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must understand Rena, i voted to ask you first. Still, the congressmen and president knew that no matter what your answer they would have to take these drastic measures. Just think about it, one hundred and fifty Pyths, over the course of one earth month, grew to one billion. Now, think of what would have happened if you had started 3,000 pyths. That is twenty times more pyths, meaning the populaiton growth would be twenty times faster and twenty times larger. 3,000, in the course of one month, would balloon to twenty billion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena swallowed, the number bouncing around in her head, \"But, you can control it, right? I mean, how big am I going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden just hung his head, as if ashamed, \"A billion Pyths filled up your old body, and with the new growth and the old population, by the end of the month the population will hit twenty one billion. In essence, as of our current situation, you would have to expand to a size equal to twenty one of our old bodies to contain all of our population without overcrowding and, in such, risk starting a civil war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's jaw dropped, looking at her already pudgy form. She have to be twenty one times bigger, all of it either making her look fat or busty. It was, to much. Still, what could she do? The only option to undo all of this was to use a penasilin shot, but if she did that her body would have HH breasts and a the pudgy look of fat. With the Pyths, there was at least a chance to get back to her normal size.<br>\r\n\"Miss Rena, please, I assure you we are trying every possible option to stem the growth. Our scientists are trying to do everything they can, using all of our scientific knowledge to shorten the reproduction cycle. Every Pyth in your body understands the seriousness of the situation, but I fear all we can do right now is sit and ride it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you do anything?\" Rena complained, hoping for some glimmer of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden rocked his head back and forth a little, \"Well, there is one option.  Our scientists and engineers have been working together to make a plan. Right now, thanks to our advanced technology, we have been doing work for you and building up a substantial amount of dollars. It was going to be a gift to you for taking in our foresaken race, but now they are going to use it for something else. Because of the necassary increase in size you will have to undergo the engineers have rented a large cabin in the nearby mountains. It realy is an old ski lodge, so it should be large enough to hold you. On top of that, our scientist have found a way to make the Re-Production cycle go by faster. In essence, you would still have twenty one billion Pyths in your body, but the process would only take a few days, thus shortening the time you have to worry about the growth. Then, once the Re-Population cycle is over we can start sending large portions of our people to colonize other beings, like wild animals. As the population dwindles we could get you back to your normal size, and you'd be back to your origional figure and size in about two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about work, I have enough vacation days to take a week off but not two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will work that out. I promise Rena, since this is our fault we will fix it, but because of this I have finally gotten the presidents word that he won't do a thing until he hears that you accept the plan. So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Rena accepts the offer, driving up to the cabin. It really isolated, which is good for Rena quickly outgrows any clothing she could possibly wear. The growth is also no longer limited to at night, Rena will actually see herself slowly plumping up through out the day, her breasts also getting larger. What is worse, her appetite starts to skyrocket, meaning she has to get a lot of food delivared to the cabin. After all, she's eating for twenty one billion and herself. That's a lot of mouths to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Rena refuses, and demands that she be returned to normal. The Pyths honor her wish, but as the population continues to grow tensions between the Pyths continue to form. Eventually, a civil war brakes out, half of the Pyths in Rena's body rebelling. To fight a war you need space, and soon Rena starts to expand even larger then she would have, the Pyths waring with each other inside her to see who will win, and whether Rena will be treated like a preson with feelings or a planet to be expanded without question.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The proposal Lerden was making was risky; she would have to be isolated in a cabin in the woods, where visits from friends and family would be out of the questions, fattening up to a monstrous size to feed the rapid growing population of Pyths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to go against this idea, but she didn't want a civil war to ravage her body; the prospect of something like that happening to her chilling her to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither did she want to get rid of the snake-like aliens with an injection of penicillin. She found that she had grown quit fond of these creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena crossed her arms, walking slowly towards her window, gazing at the mountains in the distance. She sighed, her mind made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I,\" she began stuttering, hesitating, \"I except.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Lerden smiled gleefully. \"O, thank you, Rena! I knew that you would understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, yeah,\" she said, a bitter tone in her voice, \"Well you better be very happy about this; I'm risking a lot taking this personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much, Rena,\" Lerden said thoughtfully, \"We'll short out all your problems, don't you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the thumbs-up was given, much to the councils pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena began to pack a few items she believed was necessary to have on her lonely stay on the mountains: a few books, her wallet, a CD players, and a few DVDs (she really hoped there would be electricity in the cabin). She didn't bother with clothing, for she knew very well that nothing in her wardrobe would sustain the amount of growth she was about to undergo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left that very day with a small luggage, locking her house and heading towards a bus station. She climbed on one that was heading towards the forest to deliver a hiking party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got off and headed deep in the woods. Lerden contacted her every now and then, explaining where to go and even shining her a map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting when Rena finally arrived at the cabin. It looked small, connected by a dirt road that went many miles before it even reached any civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely isolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do I just waltz in?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lerden said, \"Don't worry: our teams have already prepared the cabin. All you have to do is settle down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rena opened the door, she was greeted by a cozy sight: A fire was blazing in the hearth, filling up the room with warmth, the furniture was standard but good. She explored the rest of the cabin. Her bedroom and bathroom were separated, but her kitchen was attached to her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery modern convenience was available to her: there was electricity, hot water, and electronic devices to cook food and entertain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Lerden asked, sounding unsure and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks wonderful,\" Rena admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena got herself settled in. She took a bath and then went to bed afterwards, fearing what she might discover the next morning.</span></div></div>",

This is NOT acceptable! This isn't what we agreed upon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Rena...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you have trouble controlling this...re-population thingy of yours but there were so many things you could have done! You could have called me and I would have gladly carried them home. I could have provided food in a safe place, lend them a few of your scientists and some metal or junk and you could have easily repaired their ship and it could have found someone else to live in! Why didn't you call me first?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena...I...I wanted to but the President and the Congress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tears it; I want to be brought back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena...we can't do that just yet...the population...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, let me ask you this; if you took out all of your scientists, your engineers, your builders...the ones that weren't repopulating....how long would it take to build enough ships to fly Pyths out of me and to someone else?\"<br>\r\n\"Er....well...I can only guess but judging from the last statistic report...we could possibly make enough ships in just three to four days. And if you brought them back after they've finished building, we could turn you back to normal in less than a day. But...does this mean you are exiling us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stared into the display, trying to convey that she was both thinking and unhappy.<br>\r\n\"...I suppose I'll let *some* of you stay if you can keep things under control but only *after* I've been brought to normal and the rest of you find new homes, because I can't be the only person you could live in. All you need is raw material, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...at our size and with our technological capabilities, we can rearrange almost any matter into other matter to a subatomic level and studying your periodic table has helped us know which materials are similar to the materials on our original planets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm going to give you some food, an old clothes iron I never use, and whatever else you ask for in a safe place and you have seven days to bring me back to normal; otherwise I think I can order some Penicillin online from a Canadian pharmacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf scales could change color, Lerden would have paled. This....this was the first time Rena ever threaten to kill them; they truly had compromised their trust and it could only be rebuilt if they did exactly what she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I understand. I'll tell the President and the Congress and we should have a plan by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll call work and I think I have enough food for a week. But you better now screw this up or else.\"<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!? Lerden, you numb scale! You had one simple task; convince Rena to go to the mountains until we could create ships and you screwed it up!\" the President shouted at the board meeting, slamming his fist into a desk made out of plant fibers while the Cabinet, Congress, and even the Supreme Court glared down at the nervous Lerden, who felt even smaller under the glaring of his rulers. After taking a moment to recover, he began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...try to understand. She is right, we should have called her first and we really could have tried this in a different way. This isn't like when we first arrived; we already had a base, one that could safely protect a temporary settlement until a ship was repaired. And she threaten to use Penicillin on us if we didn't honor her request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe President snarled, looking away for the moment before turning back to face Lerden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for the fact that she trusts you the most, I would have you hang for this. Fine, gather any scientist you want and come up with a plan but know that while you build those ships, we're going to have to suffer because of your incompetent negotiating skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden nodded his head solemnly before slithering out; oh....what has he gotten himself into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If the growth had reached this point over a period of years, she might have gotten used to it but overnight was too much and her patience was running thin. She might just expel them all to prove a point, violating their trust like that. Wasn't the point of a representative was so that things like this wouldn't happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden appeared in her range of vision and Rena crossed her chubby arms over her large breasts, eager for a status report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Rena said, her voice dripping with anger and aggravation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spoken to the three branches and...while they're upset, they've agreed to your demands and I've come up with a plan. I just need you to follow some easy instructions and we'll do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good; what do you need from me to get me back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Lerden's instructions, Rena found a cabinet she rarely used, cleaned it off, and then placed the iron and the old ship next to it; it would help if they could repair one ship before making new ones. Rena also scraped around the house and she soon had a whole array of metal objects that could easily be converted into ships. Putting down some fruit, beef jerky, and few glasses of water, enough to last at least seven days, if not longer, Rena was asked to lean into the cabinet until a few millions Pyths left her body; they weren't in their repopulation cycle at the moment and would take necessary steps to ensure they didn't reproduce outside her body, mostly by keeping the men and women separate as much as possible, working, sleeping, and eating in separate units. While their hearts were heavy, they wanted to make Rena happy and bring things back to normal. Working quickly, they managed to finish repairing their ship just before Rena went to bed, it being a way to travel inside her cabinet to the other metal scraps and food deposits. They had to work quickly and they divided their teams into day and night shifts, so they could work constantly and quickly the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rena plopped into bed that night, the calm quiet of her house able to lull her into a uncomfortable but deep sleep. The situation inside her body, however, was anything but quiet. News of Rena's demands spread throughout her body like wildfire and opinions were split among them. Some of them were angry and didn't understand how, after improving her life in every possible way, could dare refuse their request, after taking the steps to ensure her privacy. Others understood her plight, that her society marginalized thicker people, that it could interfere with her work place, and really, there could have been other options. Others just didn't see what the big deal was; Rena passed by plenty of fat people and they seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with extra space, houses and buildings rose until there were no more room left inside of her. Still, with her demands, they had to deal with the cramped spaces and tensions began to rise among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't she listen to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only needed two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bringing out our best minds and strongest workers...just because she wanted to keep her figure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we do something to her brain; I'm sure we could figure out how to get past those biological defenses if we tried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We have to stay the course and let the rebuilding crew complete their mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our fault! We should have asked her first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we re-build ships ourselves earlier, we could have avoided this situation; we're at fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only for a few days...then things will be better again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rena had no idea, by the middle of the second day, a large group of Pyths had formed a new political organization, calling themselves the Brotherhood of Jertesh, \u201cJertesh\u201d being the Pyth word for \"Dominance\", because that was exactly their view on living inside of Rena was. She got the benefits of living better, so she should listen to them for her own sake. Besides, she wouldn't really use Penicillin if she was still fat,right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a shocking political upheaval, the Brotherhood of Jertesh was lead by non-other than the curent President and several members from the other two branches, driving a deep wedge between many of the Pyths. As bad as the situation was, Lerden, he couldn't bring himself to lie to Rena and he told her about the group but ensured her that it was just nothing more than a political temper tantrum. Still, if only he knew the trouble that laid ahead.</span></div></div>",

The biggest shocker was to come when her vision was blocked by a wall of flesh formed by two breasts and a belly and she couldn\u2019t even move her arms. Those Pyths\u2026why were they doing this to her?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Rena could panic, a display came on, Lerden looking grim, angry, and determined at the same time.<br>\r\n\u201cLerden\u2026what\u2019s happening to me? You said you were going to fix this, I\u2026.I can\u2019t move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Rena. It\u2019s that damned Brotherhood\u2026they did this to you. We\u2019ve tried negotiating but they went behind our backs, added more material to your body. And I believe they\u2019ve even used a chemical to temporarily paralyze you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd unfortunately, it gets worse. They have no intentions of backing down, so\u2026with the help of others, we\u2019ve declared war against the Brotherhood. But please do not worry, Rena. We will prevail and I promise you that we will make this right. We will bring you back to normal, and if need be, exile ourselves from your body if you desire. You\u2019re not a planet to be expanded without question; you\u2019re a person that has feelings that must be taken into consideration and we will see that your wishes are met, even if it costs me my life. I must go now; my people need me and the others. I can only hope you can forgive us when the war is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Rena saw the display vanish and could only lay dazed and confused. She was beginning to regret taking them in her body, or at least regret not going to the mountains as planned. Still, as angry as she was with them\u2026.Rena couldn\u2019t help but feel that Lerden was being serious, that he really did had his back against the wall and if his side won, he really would return her to normal,  no matter the cost. Perhaps dealing with his people was harder than it seemed?<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day and the next day were horrible and painful. In addition to not being able to get food or water for herself, Rena could feel jabbing pains all across her body. Occasionally Lerden would give a brief report; it seemed like they were winning, his side taking over and holding on to most of the largest infrastructure and most of the battle being taken place in the expanded areas but she could still feel the sting of invisible bombs and explosives going off, like pins and needles only it felt more like punches and stabs from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtect the heart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep those morons away from the liver!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold the front line at the neck; don\u2019t give them a single inch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefend the vital spots!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was so intense, Rena couldn\u2019t help but cry in pain and eventually passed out from sensory overload. She didn\u2019t wake up until hours later, during the fifth day. Her mouth was dry and she still couldn\u2019t move. She was a bit surprised when she saw a tube daggling near her mouth; it looked a lot like a straw and as she turned her head up higher, she was surprised to see what looked like a toy ship, the straw going through part of the body while the rest was submerged in what looked like a glass of water being held by another strange-shaped ship. The straw leaked a drop of water on Rena\u2019s mouth and after licking at it with her tongue, she didn\u2019t resist when it the shop lowered the tube in her mouth, sucking down the water like there was no tomorrow. Just as Rena watched the ship leave the room, wondering where it came from, Rena remembered those scientists, engineers, and other workers she ordered to leave her body; even after she forced them from her home, they were still putting her needs above their own and Rena couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bad about herself; whether they knew about the war or not, they could have lost thousands, no, millions of loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to feel worse because no sooner had the ship left, probably to get another glass, the display screen came on, though it seemed a little fuzzier than normal. To her shock, Lerden was missing an arm and he had a head wound wrapped in some adhesive tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLerden! What happened? Where\u2019s your arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not important\u2026.they bombed the bunker and I got hit by some shrapnel\u2026it\u2019ll grow back in time. You are what is most important right now. How are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t move and I think I\u2019m dehydrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is drier in here. Don\u2019t worry, the outside team has finished their ships. For now, they will bring you water and food as needed while we\u2019ll take care of repairing and shrinking down your body before this mess with the civil war started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I move?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paralyzed you, just for a little bit. It\u2019s for your protection; if you were to move excessively while we were repairing your body, you might damage something. Please, I know you had to endure much but I promise you, we will make it right and we will work continuously until we are finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne question\u2026what happened to that\u2026.brotherhood thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.since our planets are alive, we don\u2019t bury the dead as species often do on planets with dirt. We clothed them in biodegradable material and toss them in the stomach; our bodies, when dead, can be quite nutritious for the host planet and we keep track of dead with paper and digital archives after we hold a memorial service. We didn\u2019t have any deaths until\u2026\u2026the war\u2026.please don\u2019t think about it, Rena. Right now, just rest; the dead will give you some much needed food and we\u2019ll have the scientists keep bringing you water and any food that we can slip down to you. I\u2019ll contact you before we are ready to leave your body for good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rena could protest, Lerden turned off the display, his face constantly painted with the look of a deep sorrow. Leaving? They were going to leave her body? Granted, after what she had to went through, she was tempted to be happy about that but a more sensitive side of her told her that it was wrong for them to leave the safety of her body and venture out into the harsh earth or outer space. Even after suffering so much, their injuries, the loss of life, they still put her orders and wishes ahead of theirs. Maybe\u2026.maybe they deserve a second chance, because Lerden and everyone else fought for her sake, not theirs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the sixth day, Rena felt\u2026great. She had the energy to get up, use the bathroom, and hungrily ate two bananas, some bread (she didn\u2019t even bother to toast it up), and even ate an entire bag of beef jerky and a couple of eggs just before gulping down some water. With her stomach full and her spirits returning, Rena got to the nearest mirror and couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still quite tall, now six feet but she could live with that. The important thing was she was thin again, the only noticeable difference being she still had those natural DD cups but she could live with that. Still, this was normally when Lerden would have greeted her good morning\u2026did they already left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena couldn\u2019t help but sit on her bed, feeling a little sad. They\u2026they weren\u2019t bad snake-people-things, they just\u2026needed a place to live. And truthfully, it was going great until those other Pyths came inside of her and things got out of hand\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena didn\u2019t have much time for nostalgia as a display of Lerden came back on. He seemed tired and his eyes were a bit distant from the lack of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLerden, you did it! I\u2019m back to normal! How did you do it so quickly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter we got you some food and water, we called back all of the Pyths who left your body before the war\u2026we all worked together to get rid of the material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026what happened to it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, some of it we dumped in the trash with the ships but the war in your body and your inability to eat took a toll on our food supplies. We had no choice but to convert some of the material into an edible substance and ration it out among us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were eating dirt this entire time?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA better analogy would be to say we were eating payment but after what we done to you, eating dirt would have been the only thing we would have deserved to consume. Now that we\u2019ve fulfilled our promise, it\u2019s time to dismantle the cities and leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026.leave? What for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe broke a promise to you, Rena. We vowed to treat your body as scared and we failed. We caused you pain and misery and repeated the same mistakes back on our home planets. Perhaps our kind is not meant to live inside the giants of this world or even others. Perhaps we need to try to survive in the ground with the worms and hope nature is less cruel to us than we were cruel to you. Good bye, Re-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave! Please, don\u2019t leave me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026.I\u2019ll admit, when things were going crazy, I wasn\u2019t in the best of moods but\u2026look, it\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you and disagreed with going to the cabin. Maybe if I just called in sick or had your guys do your hacking stuff, you could have made it look like I was in a hospital or something or\u2026I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s all my fault the war happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena, no, it\u2019s our fault. We let the greedy and inconsiderate in our mists control the policy of your body. Only by leaving you can we make this right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong! You fought for me, represented me, spoke up for me. You did everything you could for my sake. You and the other Pyths fought against the brotherhood so I could keep on living like a normal person, you took care of me before the mess started, and even after this happened you sacrifice your own comfort to turn me back to normal, even to the point of eating building material; I can\u2019t imagine anyone doing something like that. After all of that, I think the least I could do is offer you a second chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena, you\u2026you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am. However, after what happened, I think I deserve the right to lay down some conditions of my own.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRena, any price we could pay would be worth a chance at redemption. Whatever it is, I promise you we will be diligent this time and honor your requests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, first off, no more secrecy. If something happens, I want to know ASAP so I can help you out. While it\u2019s reasonable to assume the outdoors can be dangerous, I think I can give us some living space in my own house and the outside group seemed to have come back okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand; we will be more front and forward with concerns inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecondly, I want you to continue building ships. You don\u2019t have to leave if you don\u2019t want to but in case there is another population explosion or maybe another group comes here, you\u2019ll have a back-up plan just in case. I can always give you fruit or any food you want and I\u2019m sure you could easily find other people who would be more than willing to give you another home. Maybe you could do that fat but not really fat thing to someone who\u2019s already overweight and not concerned about their body image.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good suggestion, one we will look into should the need arise. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026there is one little thing. You do have a very impressive form of government, one that I think my own government could learn from. But seeing how you were overthrown by the former President and Congress has spoken the need of some measure of balance for my sake. Unless you plan on running for office I want you to be named Prime Minister for life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-excuse me?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Let me explain. Your government will take care of any\u2026let\u2019s call them \u2018internal\u2019 affairs. You know, how you run your government, what buildings to make, your laws, etc. But you will have power on any and all \u2018external\u2019 affairs, things that will affect me directly, like needing me to buy materials for your ships, eating unusual or different foods to help the population, expanding parts of my bodies. While I don\u2019t want to be a dictator, there needs to be a way to convey my wishes; after all, it\u2019s still my body. So if you guys have a plan I don\u2019t like, your word will be taken for my word, you will have the power to veto a measure or law that will directly affect me, and your Congress can scrape a bad idea in exchange for a new one. Also, in the matter of external affairs, I want not only you but as many of your leaders as possible to talk to me, so that you\u2019re not the only one I\u2019m speaking to. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026yes but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. Those are the conditions I want met in exchange for a second chance. Do this and I\u2019ll even allow you some extra room in my neck and checks as long as you leave the rest of my head alone, especially my brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be willing to give us extra space that close to your head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I was thinking about as I laid paralyzed while you were still working on bringing me back to normal. I looked ridiculous with a normal neck and head on such a fat body. So as long as you don\u2019t go overboard, you can have it. While I still don\u2019t want to look fat, if I had to for a short time, I should at least look consistent; a thin neck and head on a large body is very suspicious on my planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter everything you went to\u2026and not only are you willing to give us a second chance, but you\u2019re opening up more of your body to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but only if your people agree to my conditions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first two will not be a problem, but\u2026I know this is highly unusual but would you mind speaking your conditions to the new officers in government as soon as they are elected? I say this because if I tell them you want to give me a position of this\u2026Prime Minister\u2026even if it\u2019s for your sake\u2026they might think I\u2019m just trying to grab power for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll run a bath and you get the robot ready. In the mean time, what can I eat or do to help you rebuild?\u201d<br>\r\nJust in time for work, Rena went about her life as usual. The Pyths were overjoyed that Rena was generous enough to give them a chance to start over and while things were a little too run down for a proper celebration, one was already planned once the sick were cured and the buildings rebuilt. Still, they tried to keep their population growth in check, putting to use some techniques and tricks their scientists had come up with; it wasn\u2019t a permanent solution but it should prevent a repeat incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only two weeks, most of the buildings and cities in her chest and torso were rebuilt and everyone were back to full health, Rena unable to stop smiling when she saw Lerden with a new, healthy arm where there was only a stump not too long ago. With the capital rebuilt and new leaders elected, Rena drew a bath so she could meet them and see the signing of the new conditions, including the ceremony for Lerden to be named Prime Minister; in truth, it was really the same position he already performed for Rena, only now he had more authority so he wouldn\u2019t be pushed around by the government, assuming the new mind set among the Pyths could even make that happen anymore. After that little venture, Rena was more than willing to eat whatever food or materials they asked so they could keep rebuilding their cities while Lerden promised that they would work hard to keep their repopulation cycle down to a reasonable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As bad as the war was, things were, if possible, actually going better than ever. They kept building their little ships in rotating daily shifts with smaller teams, so everyone had a chance to enjoy being in the safety of her body for six days with their families and they even made little barriers around the cabinet so that they could put their brilliant little minds to ease. In a month\u2019s time, the cities were rebuilt back to their former glory, only needing to be filled with people in due time. They even built several museums in the various cities of her body. They were mostly designed to be identical, a solemn reminder of events past so that the younger generation would remember the terrible atrocities and not repeat the same mistakes. Lerden really took to his role as Prime Minister, with all the humility and professionalism of a good public servant, and it wasn\u2019t long that he was giving little reports to Rena daily, to help her feel more in control of her own body, even though the Pyths were being more than reasonable so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was only a matter of time before instinct took over and while they made strides, they couldn\u2019t completely do away with their Repopulation Cycle. Lerden agreed to talk to Rena early about it, before things got out of hand again.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.so you see, while the situation isn\u2019t nearly as bad as last time, it\u2019s still a bit more tricky than before that other ship crawled on your body at the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo even if you were to increase my breasts the size planned earlier, it still might not be enough?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. We need more space but we\u2019re trying to do this right this time. The government is more than willing to send volunteers out to look for other hosts now that we have ships to use if you feel that it would be too difficult to increase your body mass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, after defending me and repairing my body, giving you more space is the least I can do. Still, how much more space do you really need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, unless you did something unusual, it would still have to be a combination of increasing your breasts and increasing your body mass. The only difference is that the more you increase your breast size, the less space we would need throughout the rest of your body. Either way, I think that the absolute worse is that you would look like someone that weighs 200 lbs and I doubt it would be any larger  than that and this time we can make the changes happen much slower, so it would look more natural to the outside world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sat back in her chair. She really didn\u2019t want to get bigger breasts or get fatter and she really could ask them to send some of the population off to find another host, now that a cabinet was filled with a whole fleet of ships that could safely scout for more host bodies. Still, there was a general chance of mind set among the Pyths. The ones that remained and the new generation were more caring about her body, the lessons of the museums sinking deep into the younger generation while the not that much older one still remembered those dark days. They were more respectful and were truly treating her body like a thing to be kept scared, almost like a temple. And she was still feeling the pangs of guilt for not letting them take her to the mountains and causing that war that killed off so many of them; the least she could do is say yes. Even if she looked strange, she really wanted to offer them some more space; besides, she could just claim she was gaining weight, which was true in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================================<br>\r\n1. As Rena sits, she thinks to her day at the beach and recalls the little bit of attention she got. She kind of liked being noticed, that little bit of growth making a few men turn their heads since the growth had a, at least to humans, bit of a sexualized nature to it. It\u2019s then that Rena gets a little bit of inspiration. If she\u2019s going to gain \u201cweight\u201d in order to make room for the Pyths, why not have a little fun with it? She agrees to have her breasts enlarged to the original plan (HH cup) but since that\u2019s not nearly enough, Rena asks them to, in all simplicity, increase the mass of her rear. With some work, it would give the Pyths plenty of room to get their cities large enough until the repopulation cycle is over and would allow Rena to experiment with a very voluptuous hourglass figure.<br>\r\nTo help out Rena, the Pyths agree to tailor fit any and all of her normal clothes for her as she gets a bit bigger, only needing some cheap fabric so their ships can fix up her clothes for her. It takes a few weeks but in addition to a very generous chest that has the feel and shape of natural largeness, Rena also develops a bit of a round bubble butt. It\u2019s almost looks a little too big for her body but nothing too extreme, with just a little more meat at the thighs for support. And it just might make some guys took notice of her more; after all, some guys like a big chest, others like a big rear, and some like a big both. It might make her look just a little bit strange in public but after everything the Pyths went though and the additional sacrificing they put themselves though to make due on their promise, the least Rena could do herself is to sacrifice a little herself.<br>\r\nThis would also be a good time to see where Rena works and how people might react to her growth; if it\u2019s service or customer based, it just might give people a reason to shop and draw in customers, if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Rena simply goes through the original plan, having her appearance look a bit larger. Since it\u2019s all over and Rena is six feet tall, it shouldn\u2019t be too much but if the re-population cycle takes just a little bit longer, the worse is looking about 200 lbs, nothing too bad. The only different is how much the growth is spread between her already enlarged breasts and the rest of her body.</span></div></div>",

Then, as the president suggested, he first asked her if it was okay to do the small changes first. That included the increase in height and the length of her tail. Rena thought about it for a time, but agreed none the less. She said the Pyths could make her probably six feet tall, adding about four inches to her height and they could make her tail longer as long a sit didn't drag on the ground.<br>\r\nLerden smiled, bowing his head, \"This is greatly appreciated Rena, but I'm afraid those small changes will not be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Our races planet re--population cycle could continue for another few weeks and increasing your height and the length of your tail will not be enough. We were hoping you would let us expand a couple other parts of your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which parts?\"<br>\r\n\"First, since you are a very lean and thin person, we could expand you out a little. You would look, from human terms, a little fatter but I assure you not an inch of it would be fat. You'd be in no health risk and that growth, while it would be on a very small scale, could provide a great deal of new space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other way,\" Lerden continued, \"is if you let us stimulate your breasts to grow. While this may be a more acceptable growth, we would have to encourage a larger expansion to create the same amount of homes we need. Or, if you truly desire, we could do both but split the difference in new homes we need between the two growths, thus limiting both to half the the projected size requirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you either want to make me fatter but not really with fat, you want to make my breasts bigger, or you want to do a weaker combination of the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLerden nodded, rubbing the back of his neck, \"Yes, but only if you agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena leaned back a bit, staring up at the ceiling. \"And are you sure it won't be anything to extream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to have a small cushion for the influx of people that will be joining the population. Once our planet re-population cycle is over we can limit the birth of new children more and get the population back down so that you can return to your current state.\"<br>\r\n\"So, it wouldn't be permanent unless I wanted it to be.\" Lerden nodded, \"Yes, miss Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Rena was deciding a few people from the cabinet meeting along with a few scientists including the 1 that was actually at the meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As wonderful, hospitable and adaptable tho Rena may be even our increased male pregnancy rate only jumped from 1 in 10 million to 1 in 6 million.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that mean\" asked Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this brings us kind of to crisis # 2, you see Lerden we are ashamed to say it but a secretary who was apparently violating our NO working while ill or impaired law was apparently running such a high fever when she typed up a report that in a few areas some digits were missing in short our entire math from to start to finish on the population crisis was wrong. It's worse than we feared in fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist was cut off by one of the leaders \"it was so far off Lerden I'm afraid we've had to take actions sooner with or without miss Rena's approval\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastards how dare you\" said Lerden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What actions\" huffed Rena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your tone and your place Lerden you may be considered a leader and our new homes forefather but you are just an ambassador!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem now now let's not get tensions too high! Anyway Miss Rena we've had to as a stop gap measure <br>\r\nand temporarily buy us some time initiate 2 emergency actions. 1st off our science team are adding a cup size to your breasts 2nd you may notice your clothing feel tighter a lot went into the final testing of some new tech of ours combined with that of our unexpected ally refugee arrivals. You should find your tail and entire body proportionally larger as you should be around 8 inches taller by the time our efforts finish\" explained the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena had mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was already going to agree to a minimal amount of breast enhancement and the height isn't a huge deal for the moment, I am however not happy I was left out of the loop\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry about that it's just the direness of our situations. The part you might be happy though Miss Rena is the height and size part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see we kind of need more than 1 planet worth of space. You may recall Lerden explaining that you earth females are on average around the size of 1 of our planets perhaps a tad smaller\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as an accident that has already occurred but thankfully won't be of harm to you has bore fruit in our research and as it would be impractical and risky to ask other humans to be our planets for us the solution we've come up with is to make you the size of multiple of our planets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait how big are we talking\" chime Lerden and Rena in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well using our new tech and methods we've determined a safer way to increase Miss Rena's size and mass proportionally, evenly and safely the only real catch is we don't know how big she will become. Just a small dose of our experimental size ray tripled the size of a test subject and then accidentally added 7 inches to Miss Rena's height and counting since the incident\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena gasped and rushed to measure herself finding that unlike Lerden's earlier predictions she was in fact taller than the original quoted increase and she did notice her clothes getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth the growth does seem to be slowing. We were however hoping to do more. In return it seems that growing in size actually helps us in making you healthier and stronger and our newly added ranks to our science division even has a few ways to help us provide your body with any increased nutrients and calorie intake it needs while eventually eliminating your need to use the restroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena thought for a moment<br>\r\n\"So you're saying I could get quite big\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In theory yes there's a risk to your fellow earthlings but I'm sure we could help with that too, who knows maybe you could be goddess to both Pyths and Earthlings alike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Rena agreed and the Pyths made several more size rays strategically setting them up in various parts of her body. As she was enlarged over the next few days they built more \"enlarging Stations\" that worked in unison to steadily enlarge Rena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bodies proportions stayed the same save overall getting bigger much to the disappointment of a few perverted Pyths and some of Rena's friends who noticed she seemed to be bigger each time they saw her. The only part that seemed to expand although it was at such a minute rate was her chest. Rena as part of the earlier breast agreement had been increased from flat to mid B cup but since then they remained proportionally that size as the breast project was cancelled and deemed no longer needed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The snake-like creature moved swiftly through the system, destroying bacteria that would harm the catgirl later on and cleaned minor and vital organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects that these activities had on Rena was very noticeable to her: on her work days she found that she woke up quicker in the morning, and a cup of coffee was not always necessary, she was much more energetic, a perfect attribute when she went jogging, and she had shiny, healty-looking fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut inside the catgirl's body things weren't so prosperous. There was a feud going on. It first began because of a debate where to establish their first settlement but later evolved into heated arguments. Afraid of a civil war, Lerden decided that it would be best that the Pyths divide themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area they chose was a place where two mounds of flesh rested - the breasts. But, unfortunately, this place was vastly undeveloped, which proved to be a problem later when the civilization were being built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopulation soured, which meant that the breasts were on the brink of overpopulation. Something had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saturday, and Rena was busy doing her weekly cleaning, skipping and jumping around, in couraged by the up-beat music playing on the her stereo, when she heard a voice in her head say: \"Hallo, hallo! Rena, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a jerk, dropping the broom she was sweeping the floor with out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her head. \"Lerden?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that I scared you,\" he said, sounding sheepish, \"But I must ask you a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena relaxed, sitting down on her couch. \"A favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see, we have a little overpopulation problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want me to do about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all that you need to do is give us permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To do what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, Rena, we have established society in the fleshy place known as your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's eyes went wide, grabbing her small mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts?\" she asked a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It was the only suitable place we can stay in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmed down, asking: \" Now what do you want to do then to help your overpopulation problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, Rena, we need to enlarge them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide in surprise again. They were going to make her boobs bigger, the unattractive mosquito bites that did nothing to turn men's heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squealed with glee. \"Of course you can!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rena; you show us great kindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Lerden gave the thumbs-up to begin the enlargement . They got quickly to work, multiplying cells. By the end of day day Rena's breasts were fast approaching the CC-cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her tub was filling with warm, steaming water, Rena took the liberty to rub her boobs. It felt good. She smiled, climbing into the bathtub, the heat making her nipples go erect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not wanting to waste an entire day feeling sorry for herself, Rena got up, stretching a bit, then taking the time to retuck her blue and green stripped sweater back into her loose blue-jeans.\u201cWell\u2026I suppose I might as well clean out the attic\u2026been putting that off for awhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena made her way to her house\u2019s second floor, jumping a few times until she could grab the cord and pull it down, being sure to catch the ladder before it banged against the carpet. As Rena began to open boxes and start separating old clothes that she could give to Good Will with ones that she needed to wash and put up, Rena saw two small boxes that she missed when she first moved into her house. Gently undoing the tape with a claw, she opened it up to see a few knick-knacks that her mother put in for her when she moved out of the house. Putting that aside, Rena saw another box from her mother; opening it up revealed a few stuffed animals. At the top was her favorite, an orange tiger with black stripes that ran all over its body, including its white belly and muzzle, that Rena affectionately nicknamed \u201cCharlie\u201d. Picking it up and giving it a slight hug, seeing Charlie again really brought back memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as Rena could remember, she was always a bit different when growing up. Like many girls, she was cheerful and somewhat of a free-spirit; what made her odd was the way she displayed that same cheerfulness and free-spirited attitude. Growing up, she was a bit of a trouble maker. She hated dresses and skirts, so when she was very little, she would shred any given to her when no one else was around; no matter how many time-outs she got, she refuse to wear even one once without being practically forced into one. This of course caused a major rift between her and her mother; what kind of girl doesn\u2019t like to wear dresses? But this was just the tip of the iceberg. Rena also refused to wear pink, or any pastel color for that matter, even when her mother gave it to her in the form of t-shirts or baseball caps. It was when Rena started school that Rena\u2019s peculiarities really began to cause trouble. Almost on a daily basis, Rena would get into several fights a day, not because she got angry, but simply because she claimed \u201cFighting boys is fun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad was always laid-back and accepted Rena just as she was but her mother couldn\u2019t help but worry about her; why was her daughter acting like this? Proper girls don\u2019t behave like that. She should be playing with dolls and making friends with other girls, not chasing after bugs and frogs and playing with boys when she wasn\u2019t getting into fights with them.After several complaints from teachers and concerned parents, and after staying after school for the hundredth time in the row for getting into fights (\u201cBut wanted to fight me!\u201d), it was suggested that Rena enroll in a karate class to burn off some extra energy and teach her some disciple about not using her fists to solve every problem. While it did cause her to behave better in school, it worried her mother even more, especially when Rena continued martial arts all the way into adulthood. Her daughter just wasn\u2019t like other girls. Rena started to take an interest in video games, almost excessively. Her father decided that it was alright, so long as she kept up her studies in school and with any dojo she belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then there was the fact that Rena had little or no interest in normal TV shows, like reality programs or sit-coms, but continued to watch cartoons and anime all the way through college. Rena liked reptiles, citing snakes as cute, especially the big ones, and wasn\u2019t afraid of picking up spiders and inscects so she could wisk them away outside without stepping on them, and overall just didn\u2019t act very feminate in any real definition of the word other than to grow her hair out and let it hang down over her shoulders. Still, at the insistence of her father, her mother tried to leave her to live her own life. One day, her mother gave Rena a little present, a stuffed tiger, just because. She was expecting Rena to reject this outright, of course, but she was surprised when Rena hugged her present and decided to keep him on her bed, calling him \u201cCharlie\u201d. Since that day, Charlie was special; he was the only present from her mother that Rena never asked for and yet never complained about. Over time, she would eagerly receive a few other stuffed animals, though most of them were rather simple and not overly cuddly or cute (and definitely not pink), including a dog, a cat, a fish, a crocodile, and even an \u201cadorable snake\u201d (that one really confused her mother). Eventually Rena sailed through college and got a job doing data entry. It wasn\u2019t the best paying job in the world but it did allow Rena to telecommute from home and she got excellent insurance and benefits from it, allowing her enough money to pay for food and rent and still have enough to save a little in her bank and indulge in the occansional video game or anime DVD purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her mother was finally able to appreciate her daughter\u2019s new found independence, she still couldn\u2019t help but worry as always. While Rena continued her education with online schooling, she really didn\u2019t have any real direction in her life and aside from going to a local dojo every Saturday and hanging out with some shy but friendly geeks at a comic shop every once in awhile during its after hours to play video games or watch cartoons (who were currently at a Dungeons and Dragons convention and out of town, hence her current boredom; she never did like table top RPG\u2019s, only the faster video game kind), she really didn\u2019t do anything with \u201creal\u201d friends and wasn\u2019t actively seeking anyone for a relationship. Not that it really matter, her mother would sigh; no man would be interested in a girl who didn\u2019t act like a girl. All she did was hang out with her geek friends or stay at home, a house that Rena was only able to afford at such a low price because someone was murdered in it many years ago and no one else wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena smiled and picked up the small box after putting everything else away, taking it downstairs to the washer and dryer; after all, they were in the attic for who knows how long and were probably flithy. After carefully reading the directions, Rena had her stuffed toys washed and dried, placing them proudly on her bed but taking Charlie with her. Plopping him on the couch, Rena flipped on the TV.\u201cSo, Charlie, would you like to watch Paranoia Agent with me? Or maybe Batman, the animated-\u201c was all Rena could say before being cutting off. Rena rubbed her eyes but right there was Charlie, standing up on two feet, with a rather strange look on his face, his eyes becoming large, blank white circles with sad eyebrows and his mouth hung open in weird manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the one I was supposed to see? \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026you\u2019re not what I was expecting\u2026.\u201d The doll said, face turning down slightly in what might have been disappointment.Perhaps for the first time in her life, Rena couldn\u2019t help but let out a rather girlish scream; it wasn\u2019t everyday that a stuffed animal just talked to you\u2026and it seemed like it was being possessed by something.\u201cW-who are you and what have you done to Charlie?!?\u201d Rena snapped, trying her best to look frightening despite the fact she was hiding behind the arm of the couch.\u201cI was sent here to....find a warrior of justice\u2026.I am Doperverti\u2026you are Rena, right?\u201d was all the figure could say. Rena slowly got up.\u201cY-yeah\u2026how did you\u2026Warrior of\u2026what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was sent here from beyond your dimension to find a girl with a warrior\u2019s spirit to fight in the name of good and justice.\u201dThis got Rena\u2019s attention.\u201cYou mean to become a superhero? Like Batman or Superman or the Green Latern?\u201d Rena said, swaying her hips a bit from side to side while holding her fists close to her face in excitement; Rena always wanted to be a superhero; that would just be awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are\u2026..Expansion Girl!\u201d Doperverti exclaimed, pulling out two fans with Japan\u2019s flag seemingly out of nowhere and taking a strange pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..that\u2019s a stupid name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP I DON\u2019T CARE IF IT CHOSE YOU OR NOT YOU CAN\u2019T MAKE FUN OF MY DREAM IT\u2019S MY FANTASY DAMN IT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rena just stare at him with a creeped out look on her face. All this talk about magical girls and fan service\u2026.just what did she get herself into? Why did it have to be her? Why not some other stupid girl that would actually enjoy any of this? And what did he meant by \u201cExpansion Girl\u201d, anyways?As Doperverti slowly calmed down, he looked at Rena with the same creepy, open-mouthed expression.\u201cNow that it has chosen you, you will need to use your new powers to transform into a magical girl of my own design and fight crime and corruption where ever it breeds and help the weak\u2026.especially if it happens to be near a buffet line\u2026\u2026god I hope so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No, forget it, I\u2019m not doing it!\u201d Rena said, crossing her arms defiantly. It was right then that she felt strange all over, a sort of pins and needles pain that caused her to drop to her knees, holding her sides.\u201cUgh\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t feel so good\u2026.\u201d \u201cAh\u2026that what happens when you refuse to transform in the name of justice\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rena asked. Still, she could feel herself getting\u2026heavier? Rena could only stare in silent horror as she saw herself starting to get wider, chest filling out, hips getting larger, belly pushing her sweater up, and rear starting to fill out her jeans.\u201cW-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Rena said, feeling her clothes getting tighter.\u201cAh\u2026sercurity measure.\u201d Doperverti said, his open mouth showing just the slightest hint of a smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t transform, you\u2019ll start getting larger until you reach about 400 lbs\u2026.don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s magical; you won\u2019t get health problems from it and you will still be able to move around\u2026.oh, Rena-chan, you\u2019re starting to look so beautiful\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n\u201cTell me how to fix this, NOW!\u201d Rena said, already pushing 245 and her clothes beginning to rip loudly; she was so frustrated and scared, she barely registered that creepy \u201cso beautiful\u201d comment.\u201cJust yell \u2018Expansion Power Activate\u2019\u201d the spirit said, smile vanishing as he realized that would return Rena to normal\u2026somewhat. Rena wasted no time and, after floating in some strange, pink orb while her body slimmed down again, she quickly found herself wearing a mock sailor scout uniform, complete with a gold tiara with a green gem insert, red boots and gloves and a green giant bow with a green short skirt and matching green tight shorts underneath\u2026well at least it offered some modesty; all things considered, it could have been worse\u2026.though this was a bit much\u2026. \u201cOh\u2026.my\u2026.god\u2026this is the stupidest thing I ever had to wear in my life. Someone is going to recognize me like this.\u201d Expansion Girl mutter, hoping that this was just a really bad dream from eating one too bites of ice cream the night before.\u201cNo, no one can tell it\u2019s you. You\u2019re Expansion Girl now. Even if someone takes your photo or draws your picture, or even studies your face or body for an hour, they won\u2019t be able to remember you. In videos, you\u2019ll just be a blur and in memory, a shadow that no one can recall; only your code name and uniform will make any impression. Just make sure no one sees you transform or they\u2019ll recognize your form no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026.right\u2026.okay, now what?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s time to transform. Whenever evil is around, just say \u2018Expansion Girl Teleport\u2019 and you\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\u201cUh huh\u2026okay\u2026\u2019Expansion Girl Teleport!\u2019\u201dNo sooner had Expansion Girl said those words that she was wisked away in a white flash, only to see herself in front of the exit/enterance of a bank, several scared customers huddled on the floor and two armed men in ski masks panicking; apparently the same flash that happened in Rena\u2019s house happened in here also.\u201cW-who the hell is that?!?\u201d the taller of the two robbers yelled out. \u201cStand back or I\u2019ll s-shoot!\u201dExpansion Girl shallowed hard but refused to buckle down. \u201cDrop the cash right now or I\u2019ll be forced to roughhouse ya!\u201d she demanded, holding two fists up in a threatening manner.\u201cThe hell you will!\u201d the stocker of the two said, aiming his pistol and firing several rounds, the taller one following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansion Girl couldn\u2019t help but shriek briefly as she instinctively covered her arms across her body; however, something caused her to yell an unusual phrase out-loud.\u201cRubber Girl Transformation!\u201d Expansion Girl could feel bullets going into her skin\u2026.only they didn\u2019t hurt\u2026in fact, they felt more like they were gently poking her. Expansion Girl opened her eyes and looked at her body, seeing holes in her but no blood. Taking a moment to look back, she could feel her neck was able to stretch all the way back perfectly in a 180 degree direction to see behind her, almost like\u2026.rubber? Not only that, but she clearly saw what seemed like tubes of flesh and cloth appearing in her back and behind her arms.\u201cWh\u2026.what the\u2026how hell did she\u2026\u201d was all the taller guy could say. Expansion Girl, however, figured out exactly what this was and could only smile devilishly as she evilly glared at the two would-be thieves. \u201cBullets don\u2019t work on me.\u201d No sooner had the words left her mouth did they bounced back off of her body, the holes snapping forward and taking their usual shape in her form. The taller guy just barely managed to miss getting hit. The shorter guy, however, took a bullet to the knee while the rest of the bullets dug into the wall.\u201cGAAAH!!! I\u2019ve been shot! For the love of all that is holy, someone call 911!\u201d He screamed, dropping his gun as he fell to the floor and started cradling his knee cap.\u201cAh, you\u2019ll live.\u201d Expansion Girl said unsampathically as she started to walk over. \u201cNow, do yourself a favor and give up, or I\u2019ll be forced to take more drastic measures.\u201d She said, the words dripping off of her mouth as she cracked her knuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this guy was more trouble than he looked as he immediately bolted for the door.\u201cWha-hey! Wait a minute, damn it! Get back here and face me like a man, you cowardly bastard!\u201d Expansion Girl shouted as she chased after him. Unfortunately, she was finding that running was slightly more difficult; her legs felt a bit\u2026wobbly. It was then that Expansion Girl got an idea and a smile on her face. Taking a good stance, she stretched her right arm out a bit behind her, reaching about thirty feet with seemingly no effort and causing anyone watching to stop and stare in awe.\u201cGomu Gomu no\u2026\u201d was uttered just before her arm started to come back forward at a terrifying speed as she started to shout. \u201cPIS-TOOOOOOOOL!!!!\u201d Expansion Girl\u2019s fist sailed through the air, going even further forward than it was stretched out behind, stretching until it smacked the runner in the back of his right ribs, causing him to scream in pain as he spun a few times in the air before hitting the ground with a solid thud. He could only twitching in agony while he laid there, soundly defeated; anyone close by might have been lucky enough to hear a solid \u201ccrack\u201d eminating from his body. Expansion Girl\u2019s arm swung back as she held her lower right arm with her left hand, smiling triumphantly as it violently snapped back to its original position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Expansion Girl noticed the extra attention her little stunt just pulled and yelled \u201cExpansion Girl Teleport\u201d before anyone could get close enough to start asking questions, hoping her guess was right. It was, as in another white flash, she was back home in her\u2026.bedroom? Well, gift-house, mouth, don\u2019t look, right? Seeing that all of the blinds were closed, she announced \u201cRubber Girl Transformation\u201d again, then sat down on Rena\u2019s bed, hoping that little freak show would show up so she could turn back to normal\u2026if she could\u2026\u201cOh, Rena-chan, you were amazing! A complete natural!\u201d Doperverti said, appearing at her side seemingly from nowhere.\u201cGAH! Don\u2019t scare me like that! Now that I did what you wanted, how do I turn back to normal? I\u2019m not going to become fat again, am I?\u201d Expansion Girl asked, remembering painfully what happened just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Rena-chan, that was just a punishment to get you to perform your duties. Now that you did what you had to do, your original body is back to normal. But I have a question to ask you. What was that\u2026.Gomu thing you just said?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, and here I thought you actually knew Japanese or something. \u2018Gomu Gomu no Pistol\u2019, roughly translates into \u2018Rubber pistol\u2019; Sorry, I just couldn\u2019t resist; One Piece is my favorite anime series and that whole \u2018rubber girl\u2019 thing made me feel just like Luffy\u2026\u2026.only not as dumb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne Piece?\u2026\u2026\u2026what is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one of the best anime series ever made! You mean to tell me you never even heard of it at least once before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only like to watch\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026WHAT?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only like to watch fan service anime\u2026.\u201d Expansion Girl sighed in disguist. \u201cSay, can we do something about this dorky costume? And if I can turn into a rubber lady, wouldn\u2019t \u2018Rubber Girl\u2019 or something along those lines be more appropreiate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but, Rena-chan, stretching isn\u2019t your only power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re\u201d Doperverti began, striking the same strange pose with the fans again \u201cEXPANSION GIRL! You get your powers from all the forms of expansion thought up from the years, everything from rubberhose animations from black and white cartoons to the postings and drawings created on the World Wide Web!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.don\u2019t follow\u2026.\u201d Rena said, growing strangely fearful for some reason.\u201cRubber transformation was just one ability. You also have Air Body Inflation, which\u2026okay, that one is kind of worthless right now, but over time you\u2019ll be able to control the winds themselves! Water Body Absorption and Water Girl Transformation, which will give you the power to control water! And your signature move, Pound Weight Gain, allowing you to increase your already super human strength several times over and control the very earth itself, from causing earthquakes and select point shockwaves and riffs to even performing Magic Alchemy on select, earthbound material! Of course there are other moves but I\u2019ll only teach you those when you are ready.\u201dExpansion Girl could only stare in confusion. Those didn\u2019t so sound\u2026.great\u2026especially that Weight Gain thing. Just what did she got herself into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All you have to do is shout \u2018Expansion Power Deactivate.\u2019 Just be sure to only transform when no one else is looking or else they will always recognize her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansion Girl nodded, not sure if that would really work but she would soon find out. After yelling those words, Rena found herself back to normal, thin as usual. Sighing in relief at seeing that even her clothes were no longer ripped, she turned her attention to Doperverti.\u201cNow that I\u2019m\u2026me again\u2026how were you able to see me when I was gone? Weren\u2019t you here the whole time?\u201d Rena asked. It was then that Doperverti vanished in front of Rena, only to reappear in front of her, levitating with the help of two black, leathery wings that were suddenly on his back.\u201cI maybe not be allowed to fight\u2026but I have powers too. Only you can see and hear my voice now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHuh\u2026that kind of makes you like a Death Note shinigami.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, never mind.\u201d Rena said while shaking head as she got off her bed and grabbed her wallet. \u201cAnd can you find some other toy to possess? I don\u2019t like you using Charlie like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.okay\u2026\u201d Doperverti said sadly, looking at the small assortment of stuffed animals on her bed. \u201cHow about this dog?\u201d\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I like Jeffry. Begals are cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe clown fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t want you to use Charlie, why would the cat be any better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe snake? Crocodile?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou leave Leroy and Billy out of this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe monkey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.eh, what the hell. I never really liked that one\u2026man, I hate monkeys! If it wasn\u2019t a gift from my mother\u2026\u201d Rena started, cutting off when Charlie fell on her bed, back to normal. His face had his usual black beady eyes and simple cat frown. Rena couldn\u2019t help but squeal in delight as she picked him up and hugged him tightly.\u201cOh, Charlie, I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ll never let a crazy pervert spirit ever possess you again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Doperverti said, his now monkey head sticking out of the pile of stuffed animals, his strange face now imposed on it. \u201cI really like this new body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, oh, you\u2019re still here. Why\u2019s that, freakshow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Rena-chan, you are so cruel. It\u2019s simple.\u201d Doperverti said, his mouth turning into a slight smile as he raised his hands. \u201cThis doll has fingers\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you stay away from me or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing that to you, Rena-chan.\u201d Rena sighed in relief.\u201cYou just don\u2019t have any meat on your bones. Maybe later after you turn back into Expansion Girl and gain a little weight\u2026\u201d Rena just stared at Doperverti, eye brow starting to twitch. This guy just didn\u2019t have any tact or bounderies, did he?. \u201cSay\u2026when you said that you needed a girl to be a superhero of your choosing\u2026did you have to use this whole Sailor Moon rip off thing or could you have done anything different, you know, like normal super powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have done something different but\u2026.that wouldn\u2019t be as fun for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Later.\u201d Rena said with a sigh as she started to walk away, putting Charlie in a sitting position on her couch. Doperverti followed, spouting his leathery wings as he followed about head\u2019s height with Rena.\u201cWhere are we going, Rena-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to check out a new gaming store that just opened up; I heard they specialize in old and rare games, so I might find something that\u2019s old but still new to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should practice your new powers more; you need to be prepared when evil strikes. Even if I coach you during fights, you\u2019ll be more effective if you practice in the pocket dimension I have prepared for you. Besides, you really need to learn to control your strength. As Expansion Girl, your speed and strength are far beyond normal humans. You may not have noticed, but you broke a few of that guy\u2019s ribs. If you had punched softer, he might not have even broken one. It\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t do that after using Weight Gain or\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck with this for awhile, aren\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least until your fur starts to turn grey\u2026or you turn 45, whichever happens first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026yeah, I had a feeling you\u2019ll something like say that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena just muttered while looking to the side; this was going to take some adjusting to.\u201cHow about it, Rena-chan?\u201dRena decideds to\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1. Just go to the game store as always and get a bite to eat at a sub sandwich shop. This is a lot to accept in one day and she really needs to burn off some steam. Charlie will follow and even comment a few times but since Rena doesn\u2019t want to look like a crazy person, she\u2019ll just ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2. As much as she is afraid of what the rest of her powers will do\u2026she needs to be prepared for whatever might happen later\u2026.so she reluctantly agrees as Doperverti takes her to his pocket dimension to train\u2026and maybe get Expansion Girl a little something to eat after an intense training session\u2026and by a little to eat, just a bit\u2026maybe a buffet so she\u2019ll gain some weight\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena's fur bristled slightly as she stretched on the couch, and she squeaked quietly with the effort. soon, however, she was bored of the stretching, and couldn't stand her house anymore. She stood up from the<br>\r\ncouch, stretched one final time, and cast her eyes around her room, in an attempt to find something to do. She looked into the cupboard for a light snack, and found nothing there. Well, that was something. She would go out and pick up some snack food from the minimart down the street from her house.<br>\r\nShe grabbed a light jacket on her way out, since the first cool winds of fall were starting to blow. The trees had yet to change, and the weather was beautiful. There was not a single cloud in the sky to block out the deep aqua sky, the air was crisp and clear, and smelled faintly of the first falling leaves.<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath of the fresh air, Rena smiled. \"It's so nice out! Why didn't I think of taking a walk before?\" she asked herself. After a few minutes of walking, however, she was starting to feel unexplainably nervous. She kept hearing strange sounds echoing down the street, and the street itself was so condusive to sound because thee was not a soul in sight. With a shifty glance into any strange nooks or crannies, Rena continued her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, within a block of her minimart, she found why there was such a strange feeling in the air. There was a crowd gathered around the parking lot, and inside she could see only two people inside. One was her favorite cashier, Mo, and the other two loked to be...robbers?!? One had a gun pointed at Rena's good friend Mo, and the other was shaking a bag at him. Mo had his hands up, but his slightly creased face was defiant, and his hands were not moving. It was clear even from the distance Rena was that the robbers were running out of patience. And what could she do, besides watch? She'd be shot if she tried anything! She fell to her knees, and let out a single sob, deep in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, from a tree overhead, a small creature. It appeared to be some kind of very chubby rabbit with an X shaped mark on its forehead. held in it's puny arms was what appeared to be a short, transparent, hard plastic tube, topped on one end by what appeared to be a styliz ed, fat girl made to look like gold and gems, but was actually just spraypainted plastic. for a moment, Rena and this rabbit simply stared at each other.<br>\r\n\"Whaddya waitin for, take the danged ExpandoRod!\" the rabbit shouted, in a deep, rough voice sharply<br>\r\ncontrasting it's soft and cuddly looks. Rena fell back on her butt, and the rabbits formerly serious face melted for a moment, his eyes watering slightly, his arms slackening their grip on the tube, and his fur rustling with delight. Rena's face couldn't have been a look of more disgust if she had tried. Just what she needed, some kind of crazy perverted rabbit while her good friend was getting robbed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon toots, you need this to save your buddy in the store! Move it before he gets shot!\" That snapped Rena out of her pit of self- pity and she grabbed the rod away from the rabbit.<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" she asked. She hadn't thought that far ahead. she realiz ed that nothing would just solve itself now.<br>\r\n\"Just shout 'Expansion Girl Power Activate!' Also, you might want to hide. don't want everybody seeing you transform, do ya?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that.\" Rena stated flatly, and as soon as the words left her mouth, her body began to swell with fat at a frightening pace. She could feel the weight pulling her down, and after only a few seconds, her clothes were stretched to their limit, about to burst. Her chubby hands felt herself around, trying to figure out exactly what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT he rabbit squeez ed between his eyes, sighing. \"That's what ya get fer not transforming in the face of evil.<br>\r\nNow, do it, or it'll get a whole lot worse for you and a whole lot better for me when you start to gain again. I<br>\r\ndon't think your clothes will last much longer...\" His words were more cautioning than his voice, which had slowly become more singsong and giddy until it was nearly dripping with pleasure. Again slightly disgusted at the rabbit's obvious perversion, she hurried into some short shrubs on either side of the road, and held the tube aloft. Just as clothes began to burst from the sudden movement, Rena called out \"Expansion Girl Power Activate!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was back to her normal siz e, but seemed to be floating in a pink, slightly shimmery void. Then, a bright flash of neon pink whipped away her normal clothes, and she was bathed in light, conveniently obscuring her nude body from the rabbit, who had been peeking through the bushes, hoping that he would catch a glimpse when she transforming. Cursing his bad luck, he continued to watch. This show never got boring for him, even though it seemed the same each time.<br>\r\nSoon, the pink light coalesced into an extremely skimpy mock sailor suit, complete with a bow on the chest<br>\r\nand a shiny headpiece. the skirt was a joke, and Rena was glad to find short shorts underneath. What she had been expecting she wouldn't have said, but she was relieved. She also noticed that she could feel some kind of strange, new power coursing through her, which was not altogether unpleasant. In fact, he skin was tingling pleasantly, and she felt as if she could take on the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go in that minimart and show those robber's who not to mess with!\" the rabbit suggested. \"Oh, and if you get into trouble, just eat some of the snacks in there. They oughta fix ya right up.\" Expansion Girl grinned determinedly, if slightly confused, and the rabbit managed to give a thumbs-up with one paw. Expansion Girl nodded, her face becoming slightly more serious, and charged into the mart.<br>\r\nT he gun totting robber quickly changed targets when Expansion Girl burst through the door. and she truly burst them. One flew off it's hinges totally, and smacked into a rack of chips, the other barely held onto it's frame with one small twist of metal. The gun was a small automatic pistol, and Expansion Girl had a small panic attack to see it pointed at her, especially in the shaking and undoubtedly crazed man. He was dressed all in black sweat clothes, with a shoddy winter mask pulled over his face<br>\r\n\"D-don't come any closer! I swear I'll...I'll shoot! Just...don't come any closer!\" Mo looked at her, shocked by such strength. However, Rena slowly advanced. She didn't really know what she was doing, but she'd seen in movies where a superhero was able to intimidate the crooks into fleeing just by staring them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these two were real criminals. They had even pulled off a bank robbery once before, and just wanted to go for a little heist for some quick bucks. The one with the bag, who was shorter and stockier, leapt over the counter and took down Mo, while the other shot at Expansion Girl. The first one hit her in the shoulder, and the she started to dash at him, z ig z agging between bullets. He only managed to shoot 4 times, and none but the first hit. However, Expansion Girl's right straight did hit, and sent tall, dark and ugly flying into a wall.<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to join your friend over there on top of the coffee machine\" Expansion Girl threatened, \"I<br>\r\nsuggest you get off of M- - that citiz en. He grudgingly obeyed, slowly getting off him...then dashing for the door. Instinctively, Expansion Girl tapped her new power, and shouted \"Rubber Girl Transformation!\" She reached out for him, leaping unnecessarily, as her arm stretched and easily caught him, her fingers reaching all the way around him, and her arm sprung back, launching him onto his friend ungracefully slamming the two together. T hey moaned in pain, and Rena decided that they were well taken care of. \"Rubber Girl Transformation\" she said, still not totally understand why she'd said it in the first place or how she'd known what to do.<br>\r\nHowever, she had bigger concerns. Checking Mo, he seemed fine, but had hit his head when he was tackled, and was in a mild daz e. Satisfied that her work was done, she remembered what the strange rabbit had said, 'Oh, and if you get into trouble, just eat some of the snacks in there. They oughta fix ya right up.' An image of one of his perverted faces accompanied the memory, and Expansion Girl shook her head while she swung herself over the counter and walked over to the downed rack of potatoe chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a big bag of her favorite flavor, barbecue, and began to eat them casually, wondering what was supposed to happen. The wound had not hurt much, since she was Expansion Girl, but now any hint of pain was gone after the first few chips, and the wound was well closed once the bag was finished. However, she grabbed another bag, wanting to make sure that the wound didn't leave a mark. She quickly ate that bag, and checked the wound. It seemed to be fully closed and healed, but another bag couldn't hurt. I mean, her uniform was a little bloody. What if she'd lost too much blood? That couldn't be good for you. So, she had a third bag, for blood replenishing. Once she finished it, she did not feel light headed, and was satisfied that she was healed. she grabbed seven more bags, for snacks once she got home, and walked out to address the crowd, trying her best to ignore her loudly growling stomach, which seemed to stick out more than it had at first...</span></div></div>",

She ripped open another bag of the crispy chips and began to munch. The crumbs stained the fingers of her gloves slightly, and there was a good pile of barbecue powder gathering in the folds of her uniform, turning her pink bow slightly more reddish. She didn't even notice, as she chomped the ships down, that she was beginning to gain weight from them. She finished off the last of the seven bags, and had gained a full 25 pounds. Her body was pleasantly soft to herself as she sat on the couch, enjoying her victory over hunger and evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was snapped out of her reverie by a deep, familiar voice. \"YOWZAA! You look nice with a little extra cushion.\" the strange rabbit hopped up from the floor in front f her couch, and sat on her lap. He snuggled into her exposed thighs, appearing almost to be the cuta animal that he most certainly was not.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" EG asked, in slight outrage. \"And why did you follow me home?\"<br>\r\n\"Well excuuuse me, I thought you might have some questions about what happened there. You're a natural, though, so if you just want me to leave you alone, unprepared for anything, well, I guess that's your choice...\" T he rabbit said, not making any attempt to hide his manipulation as he snuggled further into Expansion Girl's slightly pillowy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansion Girl stood up, knocking the rabbit onto the floor. He turned in mid air, landing upright on his tiny legs. \"At least tell me your name, or I'll just have to cal you pervy rabbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT he rabbit huffed \"Well, I'll let that one slide. My name's Boo, but you can call me Master.\"<br>\r\nNow Expansion Girl huffed. \"I may have to stick to Pervy Rabbit... Anyways, what is this costume? Why could I stretch my arm like that? And why am I still hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, one at a time. I'll start from the beginning. You're Exansion Girl, Transforming Defender of the<br>\r\nWeak and Chubby Enemy of Evil! You will never let a crime go unpunished, especialy if it's in the viscinity of a buffet area! Nothing can stop your Rubber Girl Transformation, which allows you to stretch and morph to fit any situation! You have a variety of other powers as well, including Air Body Inflation, Water Body Absorbtion, and, your new signature, Pound Gain transformation! To use any of those, hold the ExpandoRod over your head and call out their names! eep in mind, however, that these aren't all your power, only your special moves. You have several other powers as well, including the ability to eat to heal your wounds, and improved speed and strength when you transform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, great\" the heroine said exasperatedly. \"You should be a public speaker. Now, how do I get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n\"Just do what you did to transform. You know, 'Expansion Girl Power Activate!' Oh, and you need to keep track of that ExpandoRod. They're not easy to come by, and it would be bad if it got into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n\"Expansion Girl Power Activate!\" she exclaimed quickly, and the costume was whisked back into the slightly glittery figurine on top of the rod. It seemed as if her regular clothes had never left. Her slight chub had also dissappeared, as well as her hunger.<br>\r\nGenerat ed f rom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, couldna let me enjoy your new good looks for long, eh? Well, I'll be around for a while.\" boo said. whatever he said, though, he had a look of a job well done on his face.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, how long WILL you be following me around for?\" Rena asked him. Boo seemed not to notice, and hopped under the couch. When Rena peeked under there, she couldn't see him. She shrugged, but heard him chuckling behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, your butt's just not that great. I'll probably be around mostly when you're Expansion Girl. The view's just so much better.\" Boo said, hopping around to where she could see him. \"But, I'll be around. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT his only caused Rena to worry more. But, from all the excitement that day, she was bushed, and decided to go to sleep, even though the sun was hardly setting. she climbed into bed with all her clothes still on, the rod clutched tightly in both hands, and she curled around it, knowing it would be her most valued treasure, her food tube, her superpowers. She drifted off to sleep, and dreamed of turning into that superlass Expansion Girl, and eating and eating... it had been so fun...<br>\r\nIt seemed only minutes after she had gone to sleep when she was roused the next morning by Boo. \"Get up! come on, ya stick figure, get up!\" he was saying, nudging her chest. She swated him away, and sat up.<br>\r\n\"Whaterya doin, Boo? I was having a great dream...\" Rena said, groggy with sleep.<br>\r\nHurry, before you start to gain weight again! There's another crime you have to stop at...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was old and tearing in places, but she didn't care. As she walked up to the door of her house, she began to think of everything she wanted to do with it. After all, one can do quite a bit with a summoning book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena shut the door behind her and walked up to her room. She lived alone in her small house and she didn't mind. She was never one for family or romance. She paused in front of a hall mirror to admire herself. From her clothes to her hair, it was obvious that Rena was a goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she got odd looks from everyone in the book store while she bought it, but she didn't pay the one bit of attention. She had been a goth all her life, so she was used to getting all sorts of looks from people. So what if she wore all black? So what if she liked the supernatural? So what if she preferred to be by herself? Those were what she wanted, and no one could tell her otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she decided to wear something simple today. She only wore a solid black tee-shirt, black leather pants, and black high-heeled boots. The only part of her ensemble that looked out of place was her chain belt, which she always wore no matter what. She also didn't wear much make-up, choosing only to dye half of her red hair black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't she the point in fashion. She had no curves on her body, so she had nothing to show of. She was ok with having no breasts, but she sometimes wished her butt wasn't so flat. At least she was fit and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her room, Rena sat on her bed and opened the book. She flipped through the many types of beings she could summon. Ghosts, vampires, demons. She even saw a wendigo in the book. She kept flipping until she found the perfect creature. A succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructions were surprisingly simple. She only had to say three words to summon a succubus. Smiling, she got up and said the three words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Tjenza, Dfenoz, Daldokos</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke rose from the book and filled the room, causing Rena to cough. Red light appeared in the smoke and a figure formed. When the smoke cleared, Rena was able to see the figure. Her jaw almost dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus in front of her was gorgeous. She had very long black hair, blood red eyes, and full black lips. Her skin was the same color as her eyes. She was wearing a black cocktail dress with black heels. She stood at an impressive height (Rena guessed 7 feet) and, unlike Rena, had curves. She had a modest waist and average sized breasts. But what caught Rena's attention was her butt. It was huge! Almost like she had 2 yoga balls under her dress. Her hips were wide enough to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus looked around the room and saw Rena. She opened her mouth and said \"Hello\". Her voice was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(These next choices determine the succubus's personality)</span></div></div>",

A flick of her tongue gave Rena ample sight to see the succubus' snake tongue. Rena flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello darling.\" The succubus spoke. \" By the mortals tongue, you may call me Eyiza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-yeez-ya?\" Rena responded. She rolled the tongue around her mouth for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now what can I do for you?\" Eyiza spoke. \"Are you looking to wreck a relationship or <i>maybe</i> start one?\" Her eyes wandered all around Rena's body,which incidentally caused the catgirl to shiver in revolted delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..well...I want to have a body like yours\" Rena spoke. The succubus raised an eyebrow at that statement,she licked her lips for a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're one of those clients. Easy-peasy then.\" Eyiza spoke. Gyrating her hips for a moment, the succubus outstretched her hand to reveal a quite scuulent looking piece of fruit. A peach which resembled quite nicely a nice firm butt. Rena stared at it for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it grant me my wish?\" Rena questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything you so desire darling.\" Eyiza spoke. Rena hesitatingly grabbed it through the circle and quickly withdrew her hand. Eyiza smiled down at Rena as the catgirl took a quick bite of the peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is actually pretty good.\" Rena spoke. Swallowing the rest of her bite, Rena waited for the effects to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when does it begin?\" Rena questioned after five minutes of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look behind you.\" Eyiza spoke. Rena did so and squeaked in delight at her now noticeable junk.

There were a few insects chirping and frogs croaking every now and then, but otherwise it was silent. Down on the ground, in the shadows of the foliage, a lone figure crept across the earth, shuffling slowly and softly on it's belly. With grace and precision, the figure slinked over the jungle floor, one bright green eye scanning the environment. The figure approached the trunk of a wide tree, rising to a crouch behind it. Peeking around the tree, the figure squinted into the distance with it's one good eye, it's other eye covered by a black eye patch. Farther down into the jungle, there was an unnatural light glowing through the trees, a sure sign of sentient activity. Squinting further, the figure could just barely see the dark gray of steel walls hidden well behind vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the figure reached up to the earpiece in it's large pointed feline ear. \"HQ, come in.\" The figure whispered in a hushed feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is HQ, agent, go ahead.\" A male voice responded through the earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got visual on what looks like Zivargo's base. So far so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy. How far are you from the base?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female agent reached for her belt and produced a pair of compact binoculars. \"Um...\" Despite the binoculars, she had to lean forward, trying to make her one eye see better. \"... kinda far, I guess...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earpiece was silent for a few moments. \"...Rena. Are you wearing that stupid eye patch again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NO</i>.\" Rena responded much too quickly, self-consciously bringing one gloved paw up to the eye patch covering her left eye. \"And it's not stupid. It's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena, both your eyes are fine. You don't need an eye patch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do! It makes me sneak better!\" Rena cried out loudly as her earpiece sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have any depth perception with it on, Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH. Fine.\" Rena groaned, pulling the black eye patch off of her head, revealing a perfectly healthy green eye behind it. \"Dude, you're the worst handler ever, Dalton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that, agent.\" Her handler, Dalton, said dryly. \"How far are you from the base?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout an eye patch half blinding her, Rena could easily see the base through the binoculars. \"Looks like... about 800 feet away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy. Approach with caution and keep us updated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, HQ.\" Rena slipped her binoculars back into the pouch on her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Rena... still friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly, Rena yawned and stretched her slender arms over her bright orange head, red hair tied back in a ponytail, the rest of her thin body from the neck down covered with a skintight black stealth outfit, her orange and black striped tail sticking out the back. \"Yeah, I <i>guess</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Over and out.\" The earpiece clicked off, and Rena was alone again. Smacking her lips lazily, she though out loud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, alls I gotta do is catch the bad guy and steal his magic potion or whatever.

In the middle of them, stood a blue-eyed rabbit girl with a smug look on her face and her hands on her plentifully wide hips, two long incisors poking down out of her mouth and two long ears poking out the top of her blonde bob haircut. Presumably the leader, she wore a tight red jumpsuit that accentuated her generous curves, the top of it zipped down to her stomach and revealing an ample amount of furry white cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-! How'd you sneak up on me like that?!\" Rena cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't hard, dear. You were so wrapped up yapping on your little radio, I could have had a picnic waiting for you to finish.\" The rabbit girl said in a slight French accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my manners! Lapin La Femme is the name, assassin and bodyguard for hire under employment by the good Dr. Zivargo.\" Lapin says, taking an exaggerated bow. \"And you, <i>petit minou</i>, are now my prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena sighed a breath of relief. \"Oh, good. I thought you were just gonna shoot me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we are. Just with a powerful tranquilizer instead of bullets. Zivargo wants you alive, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Rena says, disappointed, her ears drooping. \"Well, that's not a whole lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can I just ask one more question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose. Make it quick.\" Lapin said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think if I was wearing an eyepatch, I woulda been harder to find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapin stared quizically at Rena for a second. She looked to her side at the armed guard next to her, who looked back at her and simply shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE!\" Lapin shouted. The guards obeyed and shot a flurry of darts from their rifle, pumping Rena full of the tranqulizer and completely knocking her out in milliseconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a deep, drug-induced sleep, Rena's mind started slippping back into lucidity. She blinked her eyes open, momentarily blinded by the bright lights above her. Still tired, she let out a loud yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" An elderly male voice exclaimed. \"Our incompetent guest is awake at last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not a moment too soon...\" The voice that Rena remembered as belonging to Lapin said, sounding annoyed. \"<i>Petit minou</i>, you snore quite loudly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha' happen...?\" Rena mumbled, waking up slowly. From what she could tell, she was lying flat on her back on a hard cold surface of some kind, and she couldn't move her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, my dim friend, is you were captured by the genius of <i>Dr. Zivargo</i>! <i>BEHOLD!</i>\" The surface Rena was lying on suddenly began to tilt forward, revealing a massive laboratory, huge mysterious machines lining the back walls, along with counter tops filled to the brim with beakers and vials of strange bubbling liquids. Directly in front of her were two people, one of them the same voluptuous rabbit she encountered in the jungle, the other a short gray furred goat man, dressed in a white lab coat covered with chemical stains of various colors and large circular glasses perched on his snout. Zivargo the goat doctor was grinning madly and wringing his hands, while Lapin was frowning at the short goat man, arms crossed under her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I do believe it was I who captured her, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, of course, whatever.\" Zivargo said, waving her away condescendingly. Lapin rolled her eyes but stayed where she was. \"Now, agent, perhaps you're wondering why I haven't had you eliminated yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah, it crossed my mind.\" Rena replied, not paying very much attention to the goat doctor. Looking around, she could tell that she was strapped to some sort of operating table, wrists and ankles bound to it with shackles, which explained why should couldn't move. Her head wasn't strapped in though, so she could swivel her head around, noticing her pouches of gadgets missing from her belt. \"Hey! You guys swiped my stuff!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we did. I personally liberated you personal affects.\" Lapin said proudly, laying one white paw on her chest. \"Never know what you secret agents might have up your sleeves, eh?\" The rabbit then leaned forward and loudly pretended to whisper, pointing down at the doctor next to her. \"You ought to thank me, <i>minou</i>. This little creep would have stripped you naked if I hadn't stopped him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! Who knows what gadgets and doodads she might have hidden in that suit of hers?! She's a <i>secret agent</i>, remember?\" Zivargo argued, shaking his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, she hardly has any doo dads at all! She's flat as a board!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two villains bickered, Rena tuned them out and continued to examine her surroundings. To her left she saw a menacing looking robotic arm hanging from the ceiling, tipped with a large syringe filled with a glowing purple liquid. \"Hey, what's that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZivargo grit his teeth, angry at geting distracted so easily. \"Don't get ahead of yourself, pussy cat! <i>That</i> is my masterpiece! The serum that will allow me to rule the pathetic peoples of this planet! The serum that only <i>my</i> master intellect could concoct with such effectiveness! <i>That</i> is why you still live! Understand?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena yawned, bored again. \"Man, you talk too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Lapin remarked, looking disinterested herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat man scowled. \"F-fine! I'll just have to show you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Zivargo produced a remote control from his lab coat and clicked a button on it. The robot arm sprang to life and with a mechanical whir, swiveled toward Rena. Before she could react, the arm reached forward and jabbed the needle into her neck, automatically injecting the purple liquid into her bloodstream. She winced, feeling the liquid pump through her veins. Zivargo watched, grinning like a madman, along with Lapin, appearing more interested in what was to come, as Rena felt strange rumblings inside her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena suddenly felt exhausted and overheated, like she'd been running a marathon. She began to pant, tongue hanging out of her mouth; the bright laboratory lights seemed to abruptly feel much brighter and hotter, like heat lamps that were cooking her. Underneath her black suit, Rena's body was gradually becoming more athletic and sinewy, the tight material showing every emerging bulge of her muscles, her slim arms and narrow legs thickening, flat chest and belly thickening with subtle indications of strong pecs and abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serum's effect ramped up quickly, though, and Rena's body went into overdrive. Muscles on her neck bulged out into powerful cables as her biceps and triceps rose like loaves of bread, pumping up to the size of bowling balls. Her legs, spread a bit by her shackles, packed on sizable bulk, thighs growing large and round enough inward to touch each other and outward to give Rena wider hips- rock hard super strong hips, but hips regardless- while her calves inflated like footballs, which with her bulging brawny buttocks were pressing her body away from the table she was strapped to. Abdominals swiftly grew from subtle to swollen, popping up into dense cobblestones on Rena's belly, obliques on her sides expanding with striated sinew, tapering down to her waist and giving her torso an undeniable V-shape. Rena's chest grew less and less flat with every passing second, bulging with big, heavy pectorals, protruding like an impressive shelf of muscle any bodybuilder would kill for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena grit her sharp teeth as her changes slowed to a stop, her arms, legs and torso all lengthening, making her over a foot taller than when she started, her wrists and ankles straining against the metal shackles due to her increased size. The black stealth suit was stretched to it's limit from her growth, leaving none of her newly pumped physique to the imagination, her arms and legs having extended longer than the sleeves and legs of the outfit, exposing her arms halfway up her substantial forearms and her legs halfway up her huge round calves, exposing more of her orange and black fur between her gloves and boots and the overextended stealth suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was over- Rena stopped growing entirely, and she was suddenly filled with energy again, more vigor than she could ever remember feeling before. \"Wowza!\" She exclaimed, enjoying her sudden increase in vitality. \"That's a heckuva cocktail you came up with, Doc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, grande kitty!\" Lapin said excitedly, strutting over the the table Rena was strapped to, clearly admiring the cat girl's new anatomy. \"You are so... ripply!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Now do you see!?\" Zivargo hollered, beaming. \"I have the means to create an army of perfect soldiers, bring any creature to peak physical condition in mere moments! And best of all, my patented perfect obedience serum is included right in the mix! Any individual blessed enough to become a super soldier will also be blessed to obey my every genius command without question! Imagine, unstoppable armies at my beck and call!

He fumed for a moment, but then Rena's words registered, and he looked genuinely surprised. \"Wait, really? You don't feel compelled to do my bidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, not in particular.\" She did her best to shrug her meaty shoulders, but couldn't quite pull it off due to the combined forces of her new mass and the metal straps holding her in place. \"Go ahead, try to tell me to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZivargo eyes her with suspicion and annoyance. \"Very well then! Agent! Spill your secrets and tell me who you're working for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, ya whack job!\" Rena chimed, smiling cheerfully for a second before reverting back to an apathetic expression. \"Yeah, see? Nothin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Impossible!\" Zivargo exclaimed, recoiling in horror. \"All my projections predicted perfect results! What could have gone wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Projections'?\" Lapin question, tearing her eyes away from Rena to glare at the doctor. \"Did you never actually test this concoction of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I test it?! My calculations are always correct!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapin groaned, facepalming. \"<i>Imbecile</i>, obviously not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you're a bonehead alright!\" Rena exclaimed, grinning like a <br>\r\nmadwoman. \"Alright, enough talk. Time for...\" Rena took a deep breath, her chest flexing and expanding and her stealth suit creaked audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...aaaaactioooo<i>oooOOOOOOOON</i>!!!\" The cat girl screamed, pulling her arms and legs against the shackles binding them. All over her body her beefy muscles flexed, swelling even larger with effort. In seconds, Rena tore through the metal shackles like the were cardboard, her immense strength easily overwhelming the strong alloy. She fell the the cold lab floor below, landing on her hands and knees, revealing her equally well developed back muscles and her thickened tail, lengthened substantially longer and stronger as well, flicking back and forth in the air excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Rena rose to her feet, well over six feet tall and towering over her adversaries. \"Ha ha ha, rad!\" She raised her arms up and flexed them, playfully admiring her biceps as they swelled to the size of volleyballs. \"You do real good work, Doc!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Lapin and Zivargo had both backed away, surprised at Rena's sudden escape; Lapin tensed her own lean muscles, comparatively puny compared to the hulking cat girl before her, a nervous but professional look crossing her face, while Zivargo was practically wetting himself, stumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK! A-a-agent, s-s-stay back!\" The goat man stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!\" Rena refused happily. With incredible speed, she leapt forward at Zivargo, wrapping her herculean arms around and and pulling him tight against her rock hard pecs, rolling into a somersault so as not to crush him and landing back on her feet gracefully, rising to her full height again with Zivargo in her grasp. Her bulky transformation did nothing to diminish her natural feline agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bluh...!\" The doctor moaned, dizzy and constricted by Rena's actions. \"\"L-Lapin, do something!\" The doctor cried, terrified of his own creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Why must <i>I</i> cover for <i>your</i> mistakes?\" The rabbit girl said, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm paying you!\" Zivargo retorted, but Lapin had already leapt into action. Running up behind Rena, who was distracted by the squirming screaming doctor she was bear hugging, she jumped and landed a flying kick on the amazon cat's huge back. It didn't hurt Rena in the slightest, but it did surprise her, causing her to stumble and drop Zivargo, who quickly scrambled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea?!\" Rena yelled, annoyed, trying to look over her shoulder to glare at the rabbit but finding her swollen neck and shoulder too large to quite look behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you expect me to let you simply walk off with my benefactor, kitty cat?\" Lapin retorted, crouching on the floor after landing her last kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Rena whirled around, ready to pounce on Lapin, only to have Lapin's boot heel strike her face, having vaulted all the way up to the top of Rena. The cat girl's head was the only part of her that wasn't souped up with super muscles so Lapin's kick actually did hurt her that time, making Rena stagger. Landing gracefully, the assassin quickly pulled out a stiletto knife hidden in her boot- Zivargo may have wanted the secret agent alive for whatever prideful reasons, but she hardly believed at that point he would care if she killed the cat. She was an assassin, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed of an Olympic sprinter, Lapin rushed forward, jumped and brought both of her legs together, landing a drop kick square in the middle of Rena's chest. It felt to Lapin like she was bouncing off a brick wall and she seriously doubted that she even managed to move Rena, but as she back flipped back onto the floor and landed with the poise of an expert gymnast, Lapin was pleased to see Rena toppling backwards, arms flailing as she tried to keep her balance. She couldn't, and the secret agent fell onto her back with a powerful thud, shaking the floor like a miniature earthquake. Seizing her opportunity, Lapin leaped once more onto Rena, this time landing on the cat girl's chest, and quickly plunged the sharp knife down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Lapin, old habits are hard to break. She was so used to assassinating non-super strong targets that she instinctively aimed for Rena's heart, bringing the knife down onto her adamantine pectoral muscles. The knife simply bounced off, unable to pierce Rena's super developed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Merde...!</i>\" Lapin cursed, feeling like an idiot; she'd gotten cocky and it had cost her. Rena, meanwhile, had fully recovered, and scowled at at the rabbit girl sitting on top of her. To Rena, the knife felt like someone had tried to poke her with a toothpick- hardly damaging, but certainly annoying. That, plus the whole kicking her in the face business, was really putting a damper on her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lapin could react, Rena's hand shot up and grabbed the assassin by the neck, holding her tightly but not choking her. Now that Lapin was in her grasp, Rena could get up safely, rising to her full height and effortlessly holding the rabbit girl up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem, Easter bunny?!\" Rena demanded. Her windpipe half blocked, Lapin was unable to respond, though she did glare daggers back at Rena. The cat girl rolled her green eyes and ignored her for the moment. Looking around, she tried to locate Zivargo...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lapin couldn't possibly hope to last long against the super soldier-ified secret agent- Zivargo knew his concoction made it's subject nearly invincible. But she could distract the huge cat girl long enough for his brilliant mind to piece together a new plan, one that should even the odds nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lapin was jumping about and delivering kicks, Zivargo was quickly grabbing seemingly random beakers and pouring them into each other, chemicals mixing together and changing colors at a rapid pace; after a few seconds, he poured the entire mixture into one large beaker, it finally settling into the same shade of purple as the serum Rena was injected with. Zivargo heard and felt the thud as Rean was toppled to the floor but ignored it- he reached into his lab coat and pulled out what looked like a small water pistol, only tipped with a long needle at the end of the barrel. Carefully, he dipped the needle into the beaker and flicked a switch on the side of the gun, the purple liquid suddenly sucking into the gun. After a moment, the gun was full and Zivargo held it up admirably, smiling smugly at his handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling around, gun at the ready, Zivargo saw that he had been correct- Lapin was no match, held in the air by the neck by the super sized agent. Rena was looking around, presumably for him, which was fairly terrifying. She finally spotted him and turned to face him, left hand on her large hip while the other still held Lapin. She did not look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done being a mad scientist yet?!\" Rena demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe half-sneered, half-smirked. \"Hardly!\" He fired the gun, and with a tiny puff of air, an entire syringe shot out, a special dart gun of his own (self-described genius) design. \"And I am <i>not</i> mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZivargo had surprisingly good aim, and the dart found it's target: Lapin. The needle pierced her just below her cleavage where her fur covered flesh was exposed, and the rabbit girl gasped as much as Rena's tight grip would let her. The new serum self-injected into Lapin and she could feel the chemicals begin to take effect almost instantly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Currently we have him surveyed it case he does snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodename:Stregtho<br>\r\nHeight:5'4-7'8 Hair: Brown, Shaved into a buzz cut Costume:Appears to be a flexible material, blue in coloration and fist in center. Full head concealing mask and goggles. Hair the only opening on the outfit. Appearance:when first appearing to us she seemed to be on the scrawny side. We assumed her to be a mentalist, until she revealed her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower:When given enough time hitting a wall,she seemed to grow. Revealing herself to be a absorber of the kinetic variety. Growing more taller, muscular, and shall we say more buxom(Side note,Jack says she was more buxom than even Me. He somehow after that got out of his chair and did chicken noises.That is strange right.....\ud83d\ude00) Back to the topic at hand. When testing out her level of strength, she demonstrated something truly frightening. She shown to be able to lift more than one our commanders, Fortbusters. At a astounding 22,000 tons, which she appeared to not even look winded. We cut it shortly after wards telling her she only lifted 3,000 tons,which she appeared disappointed in that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRejected:If she took 3,000 tons as her maximum then she obviously doesn't know her strength. She'll might be given a full membership soon.when she gets a teacher, I'll send a report to Potential this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodename:Construction <br>\r\nHeight:5'7 Hair:Covered Costume: A helmet,some Mk 2 armor set and rubber gloves Appearance: Sounds to be in his middle age, A full Mk2 armor mask obscured his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: A surprising amount of  fine control with construct building. Constructs from about 3ft to 5ft and fully humanoid. The ability to make small, but focused thought.Either than that he  actually had a great deal of knowledge of actual construction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRejected: He was actually on board with becoming a new member. It was until we mentioned one of our commanders, Blacklist. He then seemed to be in a hurry to get out of our building. We are still trying to find out where he has gone. He could be a old nemesis of blacklist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodename:Hijack<br>\r\nHeight:Bananas Hair:your mom Costume:The greatest Appearance:U would love to know right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: I'm extremely glad you asked for Miss Amazing Doctor Hijack. Well you see i can take over a system and transform into anything i want. However unlike other so called Techno-paths i have a devastating trick. My fixes instead of getting a investigations is instead considered normal. So big bad will, instead of getting evil ray telling him it can now be shot. He will now see it as it now has tiny ducks inside it. Lol, but my tricks can be seen through by high level mentalists or willpower individuals. This doesn't mean we have part ways right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRejected:See you on Tuesday right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodename: Smile<br>\r\nHeight:6'0 Hair:? Costume: A eerie yellow suit and a grinning mask with small eyes. Appearance: maybe it had some skin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers:Teleportation(?)Super speed(?)Switching(?) What it did appear to have was an aura of calm and a sort of high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRejected:just too weird for our public eye. Which i need to say is that our team has a giant eyeball and smile is weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCodename:Regenerator or dubbed \"Bloatcat\"<br>\r\nHeight:5'6 Hair: Covered Costume:A white costume with no apparent opening except eye holes and one for the tale. Thick opera gloves and boots were only distinguished by their raised look. Appearance: The \"Lady\" made motions to slightly give the impression of being nervous. While appearance wise she looked to be cat girl like. With and actual tale swinging behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Nothing i've seen power wise before. When going she to the testing she we watched as she demonstrated her ability. Breathing in very hard, we thought she was your run-of-the-mill air manipulator. Instead she .. Inflated herself, Jack especially looked slack jawed at her bloating form. She swelled to 7ft then 10 to finally 20ft high and what i assumed 6 feet around. Her breasts ,feet, hands  and head were the only distinct parts of her. Looking down at us she told us\"would we like to see her bigger\"?  <br>\r\nWe kindly replied no and asked what she could do in this form.Regenerator said the following about her form. The bigger she got the stronger she got. As a example she picked up the demonstration block which as you know weighs 25 tons and hurled it. Crashing into the nearby target area. Next she told us she could float around, but the experimental area was a tad to small for her. After wards she said she could take both dangerous or normal, air and liquids into her body without killing herself. Regenerator then finished off her usages with the ability to well regenerate. We asked how she would show this ability. Waddling up to us she asked if i could puncture her. Rightfully i was aghast by this, but she insisted on it. Taking the nearest metal shard i sent it flying at her. A loud bang was heard and i feared that killed her. When i opened my eye regenerator was fine, but looked less ball like and more fat woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRejected:The public sadly won't be able to take a woman like that. She inflates to obscene proportions and wears a skintight outfit! P.r relations might go down for it. Especially those up tight religious folk. So sadly i had to let her go. She looked really devastated under that white mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most powerful heroes on earth, Fortbuster looked up from the terminal.looking into the face of one of his subordinates, Mind freak with confusion. Trying to keep a face that still showed peace. Fortbuster opened his mouth and said..<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight, these people have a hero team now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shivered, ten spite her white, fluffy fur, for the metal walls and tiled floors where cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the end of a hallway, and another metal door opened, and this time it revealed something a little disturbing for the catgirl: rows upon rows of glass containers stood side by side, and inside these containers were both humans and anthros, unconscious, floating in bubbling green water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was what looked like gas masks attached to their faces, most likely supplying them with oxygen and preventing them from drowning. One thing the catgirl noticed was that all of them were male, their body's thick with muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there examining them, she could have sworn she saw some of them expanding with more muscle, but she was suddenly interrupted when somebody shouting angrily behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blood ran cold. While giving a \"eep!\" in surprise, and trying to cover herself even more, she whirled around and saw that it belonged to a brown bear, which had a body that could put even the strongest bodybuilders in the world to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could guess, he would have stood over six feet tall, his black latex suit, a badge of a muscular arm flexing on his right shoulder, emphasizing his neck, pectoral, biceps, sixpack, and leg muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large bulge, the size of a melon, portrayed between his legs, and the catgirl could only guess that this was his manhood. His eyes had a strange green glow to it, which reminded the catgirl of one of those radioactive chemical barrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear studied her for a few moments, before his face twisted into a toothy grin. \"Another experiment trying to escape, hey?\" he said, \"Time to put you back in your cage again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started towards her, the very ground shuddering under his impressive amount of bulk. She was rooted to the spot, terrified, watching as the bear approached like a looming storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as his meaty hand reached out to grab her, his face suddenly contracted into one of pain. He gave a howl of pain, bolts of electricity running across his bulky frame. His body went stiff, his stomach convulsing, and he fell towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl stood there dumbfounded, unable to grasp what just happened as she stared at the smoking body of the muscle-bound bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be enough of that,\" said someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the direction where the voice had came from, she saw a kangaroo dressed in trench coat, a blue shirt, and a pair of long black shorts, in his hands a stun gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the catgirl, a friendly smile appearing on his face, saying: \"Greetings.\"</span></div></div>",

She had broken off of the trail sometime in the morning, and spent some time hiking through the jungle till she came across a small ruin nearly completely lost under the thick foliage choking the stones. Exploring the structure hadn\u2019t revealed much except some old and much worn carvings that she could barely make out. She was about to head back the way she came and return to the beachside resort when a section of the floor gave way, dropping her into a room hidden by the collapse of the ruin above. After brushing herself off, her eyes fell on a small altar that instantly trapped her attention. Everything except the small stone shrine was pushed from her mind as she moved closer and knelt before it. Time seemed to both slow to a crawl and rocket past as Rena continued to stare the altar, her eyes tracing every curve and line that remained on the damaged stone. A pair of candles rested atop the stone, somehow still burning with cool blue flames despite how long the room had to have been sealed, not that Rena was thinking about that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the catgirl managed to blink her eyes, seemingly taking far longer than it should have, and when they opened again suddenly found herself stumbling along the hiking path with no idea how she had gotten there. The blazing sun long had since set and been replaced with the pale glow of the moon, which barely provided enough light through the thick canopy above to prevent her from tripping over every root and rock along the way. Another slow blink and she was now blundering through the soft sand with the surf softly crashing just to the side of her. Her hazy mind finally made the connection that she was heading for the bungalow she was staying in, and barely allowed her to avoid colliding with the few other people out enjoying the pleasant night. A third blink brought her to the pair of steps leading up to the veranda and soon enough into the pleasant front room of the bungalow. After passing through the threshold, Rena finally regained some control over herself and her mind, and there was only one thing on her mind now\u2026</span></div></div>",

They had met more than a year before, and been dating for a large portion of that time. Things had been going so well that the catgirl should have been expecting something like this, but it was still quite a surprise when her lover had revealed plans for this vacation just a couple days before, and continued the shock by saying that she had gotten both of them time to get away to this wonderful resort. Today had been the first day in this paradise, and something seemed to draw Rena to go on that hike but hadn\u2019t been able to convince her girlfriend to join her, the hike where she found\u2026 Her thoughts couldn\u2019t quite connect with what she found, instead turning her mind back around to her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked through the door into the next room, Rena shrugged off her shirt, her touch briefly lingering on her flat belly. As sometimes happened, she momentarily thought about how she disliked how her body hadn\u2019t developed much at all, but something tickled at the back of her mind making her think that this might change soon enough. Turning her attention outward again, Rena now noticed how the lighting in the bedroom was dim, lit only by a large number of candles resting on nearly every horizontal surface in the room, but still no sign of her girlfriend. After she took this in, her shoes were kicked off and her pants joined her shirt on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of this seemed to be a trigger, because it wasn\u2019t even a moment later that a very familiar melodious voice called from the attached bathroom, \u201cThat you, Rena? You\u2019ve been gone quite a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, baby, just got back,\u201d Rena replied, heading for the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good timing, I just got ready and was about to wait for you, be right out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena thought about heading on in, but decided to do as bade and returned to the bed. A breeze flowed in through the slats over the window, causing the candles to flicker vigorously and made the canopy hanging over the bed flutter. As everything stilled, the bathroom door lightly creaked open, admitting the focus of her desires who seemed to light up the room better than the candles.</span></div></div>",

Clad in an open front negligee with matching panties, the bovine paused for a moment, letting Rena drink in the wonderful sight. Huge breasts stood out proudly from Sarah\u2019s torso, casting a shadow over the rest of her body, and her wide hips and thighs completed the exaggerated hourglass shape. Thick waves of blood red hair cascaded from her head, reaching past her shapely rump, as well as framing her sensual face with those luminous blue eyes. Plump lips curled slightly as she enjoyed Rena\u2019s wandering gaze, while her slender hands lightly ran through some of the short, luscious fur wrapped around her body. Rena was struck by the familiar envy she felt whenever she saw Sarah, as well as the only occasionally spoken question of why such a beauty would be with the comparatively plain young catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold herself back any longer, Sarah sashayed up to Rena, reaching a hand up to lovingly caress the shorter woman\u2019s cheek, before reaching her hand under the catgirl\u2019s chin to ease her up into a kiss. Then \u2013 despite Rena\u2019s obviously growing ardor \u2013 Sarah stepped back from the catgirl, a giggle escaping from the bovine as she did so. Once she had opened up a bit of space, Sarah lifted her hands over her head before ever so slowly starting to sway her hips. The motion gradually ramped up, soon setting her huge breasts quaking in time with the simple dance. Rena tried grabbing a hold of the cow, but her target escaped her grasp time and again, keeping just one step ahead and laughing the whole time. Rena was able to eventually corner Sarah against the bed, just in time for the bovine to run her hands through her hair, letting the thick locks fall where they may as her body continued to sway this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her quarry \u201ctrapped\u201d Rena pounced, knocking the both of them into a tangle of limbs on the bed. Their shared laughter died as their lips locked again, Rena\u2019s hand reaching up to grasp one of Sarah\u2019s meaty mounds. Breaking apart breathlessly, Sarah slipped out of her lingerie quickly with some hurried help from Rena, before the two of them collided again. Rena acted with a passion that neither of them had seen before, but it proved quite enjoyable to the couple, so much so that they hadn\u2019t finished even when the last of the candles had flickered out with only a puff of smoke to mark their passing. When Sarah finally collapsed into the pillows completely spent, Rena could almost make out the wide smile splitting the bovine\u2019s face in the wan moonlight. The catgirl yawned and felt the shroud of sleep falling over her too, so she rearranged what she could of the covers over the two of them before nuzzling into the best pillows she ever had: Sarah\u2019s lovely breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the catgirl was lulled to sleep by the steady motion and noise of Sarah beneath her, as well as the crashing of the waves on the beach outside. Her dreams were an odd mix that night, almost all of them featuring a single figure again and again in different ways. The person felt oddly familiar to Rena, even though she was sure that she had never seen her before. However, deep within her subconscious mind, the catgirl made a connection with what she was seeing.</span></div></div>",

But she did believe in the other tale they told, that this isolated, and abandoned, mansion had treasure hidden deep within its bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a treasure hunter, Rena was willing to believe any story about priceless artifacts, even if it was silly. She would spend a long time researching about it, and that was exactly what she did with the Legend of Patterson's Treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to locals, there were heaps of treasures that the wealthy Patterson stashed away somewhere in his mansion. After a major storm called Hurricane Franklin struck the coast of this poor little town a few decades ago, Patterson, his wife, and children, mysteriously vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople tried, with the mansion now unoccupied, to find the treasure, but legend has it that they were driven mad and out of the building by the ghosts that protect the treasure inside.

Sighing, she opened Heavy Matters to the first page, finding a similar set of instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I. The names of those written in this book shall gain or lose the amount of weight specified.<br>\r\nII. In the case of multiple people sharing the same name, the book knows who the intended target is.<br>\r\nIII. Reality shall change to accommodate the changes made by this book, unless specified otherwise.<br>\r\nIV. Only the person writing in this book is aware of the changes in reality by default.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two books had the same instructions, only with \"amount of weight\" replaced by \"number of cup sizes\" in the Tome of the Twin Mountains and by \"number of children and number of months\" in the Author's Guide to Addition and Multiplication. The rest of all three books were blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what the hell,\" Rena said. \"No harm in trying it out. If it's fake, it's fake. If it's real, I can fix whatever I change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a nearby pen and wrote in neat, flowing script in Heavy Matters \"Rena Westfall +400 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Rena finished writing, she shrieked in surprise. Her formerly rail thin body had abruptly shifted to that of the fattest woman she'd ever seen! Her belly flopped over her knees while sitting down, her boobs had blown up a few sizes, even her fingers were pudgier! Thankfully Rena's chair had widened to accommodate her thickened thighs and butt, otherwise she'd be stuck! With a quick inscription of \"Rena Westfall -400 pounds\" our favorite catgirl was back down to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was actually kinda fun,\" Rena admitted. With a furitive glance to the side for whatever reason, Rena put her pen to the paper again and played around some more. One moment she was a normal weight, the next she weighed three tons, then three ounces, then seven hundred pounds, and so on until Rena got bored. She quickly wrote in a loss of 350 pounds, bringing her back to normal, before feeling unsatisfied and wrote herself up to a chubby 200 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of you should I play with now...\" Rena mused to herself, scratching her new potbelly.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(Originally written by Pwnisher696, now under new management)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what you're thinking, \"Yet another fetish story? Don't we have enough of those already?\" You're right, we do. But let me explain. Some time ago there was a story on this sight called Rena's Adventure. It focused on a catgirl that would have different adventures, depending on the storyline chosen, all of which featured various forms of expansion. Though not created by them, the story's two foremost contributors were writers by the names of System_Crash and Nameless One. These guys were amazing! Their work made what would have been another fetish story into a series of epic adventures of novel quality, with some expansion thrown in. Sadly, the story was deleted. In honor of System_Crash and Nameless One, I have decided to revive the story, with a few personal touches of my own. I know I can never be as good as them, but I  will do my best to restore this interactive to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's how it works, you select the main expansion theme (Inflation, weight gain, BE, etc.) Then you pick a storyline featuring that choice. Please feel free to create your own storylines as well. The more the merrier! I will also add some of my own, as well as ones from the original that I can remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we get to the rules, a quick summary of our main character. Rena is a 21 year old catgirl with orange fur and black stripes like a tiger. She has sparkling green eyes, long red hair down to her shoulders, with a skinny figure with a flat chest and butt (but that's soon to change.) Her personality depends on the storyline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n 1.\t I know nobody's perfect, but please try to use correct grammar and spelling. I understand if you make a mistake here and there, but not through the entire thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2.\t Unless you're giving more options for storylines, all chapters are to be long. Absolutely NO short chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 3.\t As far as nudity goes, from the waist up, be descriptive, from the waist down, be discreet. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n 4.\t No sexual intercourse, please.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 5.   No toilet stuff. That's just disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 6.   Please be as detailed as possible when adding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 7.   This may be a fetish story, but I also want to see plenty of plot. Don't focus the entire thing the expansion theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you read the original, and want to see it resurrected, I implore you to help by contributing. Let's make this the greatest expansion story ever! All credit goes to Nameless One and System_Crash, as well as the creator of the original story, Teriki Tora.<br>\r\n</td>",
