Sitting on the sand, the take a look at the vast expanse of water before you, feeling the gentle winds blowing against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the temperature got hotter and hotter as the noon gradually approaches. Eventually, it has become too hot for you lie down on the sands. You decided to take a swim in the sea. Taking a few steps from the umbrella you're under, you feel the frigid water lapping first upon your feet, then your knees, your arms, and finally your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started swimming and playing around in the water, enjoying the fun. Half an hour later, you grew exhausted from all the swimming. You turn your back against the water and lie down on it, feeling the waves bobbing on your body as it carry you through the water. The waves made you sleepy and before you know it, our unknowingly doze off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you're awaken by the salty seawater entering your mouth. You suddenly opened your eyes and struggled slightly at the bitter taste that has enveloped your tongue. You look at your surrounding for an idea of where you are after falling asleep and find that you must have drifted at least 2 miles (3.2 km) offshore because the beach is some distance off on the horizon. Desperate, you swiftly swim in the direction of the shore before any troubles could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut within 10 seconds, you hear the sounds of splashing water behind you. You spun around only to see that it is.....</span></div></div>",

This blue whale that stood before you was the largest you have ever seen, not to mention the only one.  There was a curious look in the whales eyes, as if it just wanted to know what and who you were.  The look in it's eyes assured you that the whale was not a threat.  You swam closer to the whale and started to rub it's skin.  It's skin felt rubbery and slippery to the touch.  <br>\r\nThe whale shut it's eyes and indulged in the message you were giving it.  After a while, your arms go tired and you stopped and treaded water and thought of what to do next.  All of a sudden, the bright sun was blocked by something.  You turned around to see the whale's cavernous mouth was wide open and you were under the roof of the mouth.  Paniced, you tried to swim out of the sea mammals mouth, but the Whale was sucking in water and kept you from going anywere.  The whale then closed it's mouth, leaving you in darkness.  All the water drained out of it's mouth whitch only left you laying on it's tongue.  Suddenly, the whale swallows you and you slid down it's throat.  A few moments, you plopped into it's stomach.  It took a while for your brain to process what just happened.  \"That....whale just ate me!\"  You yell to yourslef.  You look around the stomach, it was large, to say the least.  100 feet high, 200 feet wide and long.  The lapping water around the stomach gave you the feeling you were in some kind of mini ocean.  You were surprised there was enough air to breath and that you weren't being digested.  You sat on the soft stomach fllor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whale started to talk to you. Out of all surprises you've seen so far, this is the most bizarre. Although the voice is muffled by the thick blubber around you, the voice is unmistakably 'human language.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. You sure do taste good on my tongue, human.\", a deep feminine voice said, \"I hope you'll enjoy your stay in there. I promise I'll keep you safe as long as you're in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seems to be booming around you as if a loudspeaker has been place next the your ears. The voice is further amplified by the vastness of the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What........what the heck does that mean?\", you tried to yell, \"You just..............Did you......just talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you thought that the voice might be your imagination. But it became apparent to you that the whale has the ability to speak your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did. I can talk because the vocal cords of whales are similar to those of humans; you get the picture when you hear us 'sing'.\", the whale said, \"Is there any else you want to know, my curious human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you eat me and trap me in this...huge stomach of yours?\", you replied stoically. Your voice echoed in the stomach and when you listened carefully, you can hear the sound of the whale's breathing and the beating of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt lonely and when I saw you swimming in out of the shore, I guess that you would make a good company to me.\", the whale said, \"In this season, there aren't many whales in this region; I happen to be here because I'm just wandering the seas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....that doesn't answer my question. Why did you eat me up for? You know, I thought that I'm going to be killed. Good thing that your stomach acid doesn't seem to affect me.\", you respond promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hear a brief giggle from the whale as she gave her explanation: \"Unknown to you, I can control my digestive system at will, in fact, I have control of all the workings in my body. You know, I just want you to be with me; no harm is going to be done. Can you stay in me? If you promise me, I can let you travel in my entire body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hear her words, it made you kind of feel sorry for her. The whale must have been swimming alone lately, you thought. You remain seated in the whale's stomach for some time, feeling the gentle movements of the stomach wall as the whale swims into deeper waters. You thought so because you felt a 20 degree slope in the 'floor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the whale continue to swim, you talk to her again: \"Umm. I'm kinda get what you mean by 'lonely'; no friends, nobody to talk to but yourself. It probably made you feel gloomy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, in some way, true.\", the whale replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. Before we go on any further, can I ask whether you have a name I can call you? It's sorta impolite of me not to ask you for your name?\", you asked the whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. My name is <i>Nakii</i>, a name derived from whale language; it means \"smooth-swimmer.\", Nakii said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nakii....it's surely a beautiful sounding name.\", you compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", Nakii replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second.\", you said, \"What do you mean by you can control your entire body and that I can travel in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a vastly different internal system when compared with ordinary whales.\", Nakii said, \"I come from a group of whales that has inherited this mysterious ability so don't be surprised when you discover something in my body that 'isn't-supposed-to-be-like-that'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. Makes me wanna take a look around your body\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Would you like to start exploring me now?\", Nakii asks you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to start exploring Nakii's body some more. You wondered what kind of things await you within her.  You see something in the stomach already that catches your eye.  A sign that reads \"Internal beach area.\"  As you read the sign, you had to agree, the stomach had many features of a beach.  Lapping waves, and warm \"weather.\"  The only thing that was missing was a sun, but there was more then enough light for you to see the mini-ocean like stomach.  The water was just like the water on the outside, warm, salty and in some parts of the stomach, it was deep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you explored the stomach, you could estimate that the deepest part as at least 15 feet deep.  You decided that you wanted to explore other areas.  You walked around the stomach and you noticed it had one opening.  At first you thought that it could be Nakii's bowls, but there was no foul smell coming from it.  So you started to squeeze through it.  Although it was a tight squeeze, Nakii sensed you were in there in relaxed her muscles in that area allowing you to enter yet another chamber that was equally as big as the stomach, only this chamber was dry of any ocean water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked and noticed that there was a information desk in the middle of the chamber, along with some sort of house.  You thought it was strange to see an information desk let alone a house inside a whale.  You also noticed that both the information desk and the house were made out of a fleshy and bony material.  You knew Nakii could control all the things in her body, you didn't realize how right she was.  Not only was she able to control her body's functions, she was also able to create an inner-world in her body.  \"Why don't you check out the house?\"  Nakii said.  \"I think you'll like what you find in there.\"  You thought you could either take a look at the house, or check out the information desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou decide to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You went over to explore the house since it seems to be 'weirder'. How can a house exist within a whale? Just how is it even possible?, you thought. It reminds you of the countless cartoons you've seen before as a kid where a character enters some giant creatures only to discover that their interiors are like a maze of rooms or 'robotic' in appearance, complete with computers and gimmicks. You certainly didn't expect Nakii to have those things in her but what are the odds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traveled toward the 'house-like' structure. It appears to be single-storied, built with obviously organic materials you have no idea of. The basic shape of the house is irregular and a definite shape cannot be defined. Along its walls, the 'house' has small circular windows that have translucent films over them. You walked around the house to survey it out of interest. Then, you noticed an entrance on the side of the structure. The entrance is simply a circular hole that you can use to crawl into the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll take some time to check out this 'house'.', you thought as you begin to crawl on your knees through the hole. When you fully entered the structure, you are greeted by what looks like a bed room. This room has protrusions from the floor made to resemble a comfy couch, a desk, chairs, and best of all, a huge bed. The room appears lighted but you can't figure out a source. You guess that that walls are probably bio-luminescent (gives off light themselves). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the arrangements of the things in the room are somewhat disorganized, you're still comfortable with it since you aren't very demanding when it comes to neatness. When you attempt to sit on the couch, you are surprised at its flexibility and fleshy feel because you sink deeply into it. You also realize that there is what you suspect to be a television display built into the 'walls' directly opposite of the 'bed'. You tried to find a way to turn it on, but there is no apparent switches, buttons, or remotes that could perform that task. Out of frustration, you pounded on the display, which is slimy to the touch. Then, as if you've performed some magic, the display turn itself on. 'Man, it's probably touch-activated. Why didn't I thought of that?', you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display showed a message that welcomes you into your \"house.\" The display went on explain that you can watch virtually anything on it providing that Nakii is within a particular receiving range as she swims in the ocean. It also informs you that you can also watch a selection of \"programmings\" made by Nakii herself which the display promises will let you know more about the whale. You are greatly interested by the way the display presented those information, you decided that you'll look over them at a later time. Right now, exploring is much more important in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl out of the \"house\" entrance back into the huge chamber. What do you decide to do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you neared the desk, you noticed no one was really standing there.  You looking around, there was absolutly no one to be seen around the desk.  You decided to turn for a moment to think of what to do next.  You suddenly felt a presense nearby and looked towards the desk again.  You saw, what looked like another human, standing behind the desk.  The human figure seemed to be wearing a blue bikini, and seemed to be wearing a sea-shell neaclace, whitch looked a lot like the ones you saw back at the beach novelty stores, but better seemed more unique then the mass-produced version.  You slowly made your way towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  You ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave a giggle.  \"Im Nakii of course, silly.\"  The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"  You started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you there are many things I can do with my body.\"  Nakii started.  \"Such as creating a hologram of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another look and Nakii.  You noticed that although she was in her human form, she still had many whale features, such a shiny,sleek and wet skin.  Overall, she looked really nice.  And her clouthing and neclace really suited her as a marine animal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this information desk for?\"  You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not only will I give you a map of my body, but I can also give you a \"Personal\" Tour of some hotspots of my body, like my brain, heart and many other features.\"  She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\"  Nakii asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment and decided to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few moments listening in revealed that their engine had apparently stalled, leaving them stranded.<br>\r\n<i>Perfect,</i> she thought, before swimming up behind them. It didn't take long for the teens to notice the blue whale behind them, holding its mouth wide open. They hurried down to the back of the boat to investigate.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, is that a blue whale?\"<br>\r\n\"It's so... big!\"<br>\r\n\"Looks larger than the ones I saw on that whale tour...\"<br>\r\n\"Why's it got its mouth open?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it thinks we have food for it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, whale, I don't think you'll like our sorts of food.\"<br>\r\n<i>Ah, I see. Time for plan B then...</i> She dives back down into the water, and a moment later resurfaces from the front, blanketing the boat with her mouth and taking the teens by surprise. Just as she did you, she holds them in her mouth for a moment before somehow sending them down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you waiting inside Nakii's stomach, you watch as the yacht slides inside, with the teens on the ship being variously distressed. Fortunately, she was acting quick to settle their fears, giving a similar spiel and offer that she'd given you when you were eaten. They eventually left the boat and swam over to you. \"So... you're the one who suggested she eat us?\" said one of them, a girl.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you answered, figuring it would be best to be truthful. \"She was feeling lonely, and I felt it would've been nice for more people to get to know her.\"<br>\r\n\"Suppose this'll be better than being trapped on a broken-down yacht,\" a boy sighs, shrugging his shoulders. \"I don't quite get all that stuff about different internals, though...\"<br>\r\n\"I assure you,\" Nakii's voice reverberates, \"You'll understand it once you see it. Now then, would you like to take your first steps inside my body together?\"</span></div></div>",

For a minute you and the orca simply stare at each other. Then the orca swims closer to you.  You're utterly spellbound by seeing this majestic marine life up close and personal.  You reach out and touch it, feeling the rubbery and smooth skin.  You spend the next few moments simply petting the huge predator.  It seems to like being petted.  You swim even closer to the orca expecting it to swim away but it doesn't. Instead it clicks at you and opens its mouth.   You stare at its teeth and the tongue.....and the opening of the throat.  Ever since you were little you had this weird fantasy of being swallowed up by a whale.  Maybe because you've been to Sea World many times as a kid.  You had fantasies of feeding yourself to the orcas after a show as if to thank them for entertaining you.....and maybe for payment of how humans hunted whales to the brink of extinction.  <br>\r\n       The mouth does look awfully inviting.  You just imagine yourself going down its throat and into oblivion.  You find yourself reaching out and massaging the tongue which is smooth and slimy.  The orca clicks again. You feel this overwhelming urge to climb into the waiting mouth......but stop yourself.  You stop massaging the tongue and you back away.  The orca then suddenly lunges toward you with its mouth wide open.  It has you in its mouth and closes it on you.  It then swallows, sending your head even closer to the throat.  You start to struggle of course but it has a firm grip on you.  It doesn't swallow again and seems to be enjoying your taste.  Then it starts playing with you with its tongue, licking slowly all over your hapless body.  No matter how hard you try the orca seems determined to not letting you go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Alright then\" you say aloud.  \"It's pretty obvious you're not letting me go....and I have this irresistible urge to feed myself to you as stupid as that sounds.....\"  You could've sworn you heard the whale laugh.  You then to start to crawl to the welcoming black hole of the throat.  \"Eat me then\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The orca must've heard you because it swallows you in two quick gulps sending you down in darkness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A few moments later you deposited in an absolutely huge chamber that must be the stomach. You land in ankle-deep water and greenish stomach acid.  The stomach smells strongly of fish and the acid has no effect on you.  The inside of the stomach is pink and pulsating.  You can hear the heartbeat of the orca.  The stomach is also lighted: soft light that seem to be coming from the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I feel like I'm in a JRPG when you get swallowed by a giant beastie\" you say looking around your fleshy prison <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What's a JRPG?\" asked a feminine voice all around you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You look around.  You're alone in the stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It's me doing the talking\" said the voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You're the whale?!\" You yell. Your voice echoes in the stomach.  \"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Of course I can\" said the orca. \"But you couldn't understand me from out there\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Um......can you let me out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Nope.   You can't survive for long in the water without help\" said the orca.  \"By the way my name is Ijengi....but I suppose you can call me Jennifer.  My name means \"Surface Dweller\" in whale speak on account I was born on the surface....a rarity among my kind as you might imagine' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Why did you eat.....er.....why did I have this urge to feed myself to you?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I ate you because I'm lonely\" said Jennifer.  \"And......You had an urge to feed yourself to me?  That's an odd urge to have......anyway feel free to explore my innards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I might as well\" you sigh. </span></div></div>",

Your first thought is that it's probably a large fish or even some abandoned fishing nets. Moments later, the water near you began to bubble and a dark object rose from the depth. When the droplets of water cleared away and you have a chance to glance at the thing before you, you realized how wrong your assumptions were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you is a blue sea dragon. It huge, a rough estimate gives it a length of more than 600 feet. It's head is 15 times the size of your body. You are truly frightened; Impossible. Dragons only exist in myths, not in reality, you thought, Does this mean all those fables were true to some extent? Filled with fear, you briefly take some time to marvel at its imposing stature. Its appearance resembles an oriental dragon but yet something made it very distinct, namely it shimmering blue scales and dorsal fins. Two long stag-like horn protruded from its head toward the skies like two solid poles. When you looked up your eyes met its. Its large azure eyes gaze at you with a mixture of curiosity and ferocity, a pair of orbs with dark slits trained on you with its mouth slightly hanging open, revealing rows of sharp teeth. The impossible has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a deep voice in your head: \"Well, look at what we've got here. A human, this far from the land and alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the dragon's mouth isn't moving at all, so you conclude that it's communicating with you some other way. You're still at shock from the initial encounter so the dragon's voice barely register with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard my voice? Please speak.\", asked the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to blurt out a weak 'yes'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now I want to know what are you doing in this part of my realm, human?\", the dragon inquired firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I was enjoying myself in the water near the beach.\", you said as you point toward the shore on the horizon, \"Then. I fell asleep and unknowingly drifted here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea dragon looked at you and studied you carefully. You are trembling both from the cold water and the stern stare of the dragon. You notice how its eyes locked onto you, watching your every move. Those blue eyes shimmer with mystery in the sunlight and ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds understandable.\", said the dragon as it slightly eased its gaze, \"But....you have still trespassed on my realm and you are required to do something in return for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really didn't meaning to intrude.......dragon.\", you said trembling slightly, \"But there is nothing I can do. What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Originally, such intrusion would called for a quick execution......\", the dragon said. Your face went pale when you heard the word 'execution.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seeing that you really aren't some hostilities or intended to harm me, I'll be more lenient with you.\", the dragon continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the terms? Does that mean you'll let me go?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not actually.\", the dragon replied, \"I will require you to make up for the intrusion by staying with me...... or rather inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do.......Doesn't.....If you mean eating me alive, aren't you also technically killing me? That will mean the same result for me anyway?\", you nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I haven't finished yet, human.\", the dragon said, \"I never said that I'm going to eat you outright. What I want to say is that I wanted you to stay \"in\" me and understand dragons a little better. It won't hurt you and you'll be sustained. All you have to do now is agree and enter through my mouth. Be prepared to start a long journey of understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your decision?\", asked the dragon, \"Choose.\"</span></div></div>",

No matter what choice you make you'll always end up with the dragon; escaping is impossible given the distance of the shore and the sea dragon's potential prowess. Seeing that you have few options, you made your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll go in you.\", you said in a conceding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise choice made.\", the sea dragon tells you, \"Now, prepare yourself for the 'entrance'.\" As he finished speaking telepathically, the dragon opened its wide mouth before you. The rows of glistening razor teeth slightly frightens you about the notion that you have to enter through that potentially deadly entrance. Blobbing up and down in the turbulent water, you look back toward the far-off coast to take what could be your last look at land for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Before I go in, promise me that I will not get hurt once I enter you.\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to worry.\", the dragon calmly tells you, \"I will stick to my words, human, meaning there is no possibility that I will break it. And now, it is time for you to truly appreciate my majestic appearance, both outward and inward. Enter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started paddling toward the mouth of the dragon. You eventually swam into the mouth, just floating above the tongue, briefly stopping to examine the surrounding. From this vantage point, the sea is framed by two sets of teeth. Above you, the dragon's palates stretch and arch overhead like some otherworldly structure; they appear like a cathedral. Is this what 'preys' will see when they get eaten?, you thought. But that is certainly not the case for you. You continue to swim toward the large gullet, preparing to enter what may be an \"organic palace.\" Once, you enter the gullet, you entered a long tunnel which you suspect is the dragon's esophagus. The tunnel is as large as a conventional tunnel that can fit a truck. Thus, you have little difficulty in walking straight up in the esophagus. The tunnel is quite curvy and the surrounding walls are slick and sticky. At first, you're surprised that there is no pulling action or moving muscles; everything is pretty much static save for the constant rush of air from within the dragon. Then, you thought that the sea dragon probably stopped his esophagus to allow a easier passage for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour's worth of traveling, you eventually arrive at the stomach of the dragon. The stomach is vast and long, the size of an average gym if you're no mistaken. The surrounding walls have a blue color and are glowing brightly. The floor is covered with a shallow layer of seawater. Rather than a stomach, you think that it looks more like a room. You have never seen anything so beautiful before; you might say it even looks palatial. You swayed slightly as the stomach began moving; you assumed it's because the dragon began swimming again. You notice that there are several portal-like entrances in the back of the stomach. Each those holes seemed big enough for you to access or go through. You wondered......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have sensed your arrival in my stomach.\", said the dragon, it voice surrounds you, \"You are free to remain in here until you want to look around. You may try one of those portal to access the necessary part of my body that you want to explore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened carefully to the sea dragon's words before making your choice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wanted to see the mysterious-looking entrances for yourself. Since you never been inside a mythical sea dragon before (which is still unbelievable in your opinion), you don't want to waste your time sitting in the stomach doing nothing. Rather, you want to know as much as you can about this sea dragon. You set off to check out one of the entrances. The seawater in the stomach slowed your way as you sloshed across it, creating waves and bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one strange phenomenon in the dragon's stomach that baffles you: where ever you walked, the flesh under your feet would glow, leaving a 'blazing' trail behind you. Every single step will result in a light blue glow on the floor. The subsequent light trail will slowly fade away within a minute or two, you discovered. You have no understanding about the purpose of this phenomenon. Assuming that it's some way of tracking your movement in his body, that might explain why the dragon knows that you're in his stomach in the first place. You walked the entire length of the large stomach, finally arriving at the end with the entrances. There are at least 20 holes for you to choose from. Realizing the sea dragon may be bigger than you expected it to be, you picked one hole on the right and headed in, allowing the tunnel to guide you to the 'unknown world' ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you will find my body a rather hospitable place.\", you heard the dragon said telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the esophagus, the passageway is large enough for you to walk straight up, possessing same features: rubbery and slippery. Every step you take creates a strange squeaking noise on the floor. The passage is lit primarily by the blue glow of the 'light trail' you encountered in the stomach but the walls themselves also gave off a faint glow. The passage seems to take you to 'further-back' sections of the dragon's body. Finally, the terminus of the passage is in sight and you arrived at a new location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new place you're in is even larger than the stomach and there is a towering structure in the center of the room. Upon careful observation, you find veins running through the stem-like thing and a large spherical object embedded right in the middle. You approached it for a better look. The stem is at least 200 feet tall, making you look small by comparison. The sphere above constant shimmers and emit a bright aura. The sight is plainly beautiful; the object is shinier than any jewelry you seen before. Yearning to know more, you decided to ask the sea dragon what is it that you're seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,yes. I see that you have arrived at the place where I kept my \"Dragon Pearl\".\", the dragon's voice boomed in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 'Dragon Pearl'?\", you asked puzzled, \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every dragon of the sea is gifted with a 'Dragon Pearl' upon birth.\", the dragon said, \"The pearl are said to contain the very essence of the dragon, that is.. his characteristics, given powers, and nature. In my case, I was given a pearl that gifted me with the ability to communicate with the humans ashore and a kind heart. Those pearl are said to be from the deepest part of the ocean where only the strongest sea dragons will venture to. The pearl has the power to enlighten and purify anything that is sinister; nothing evil can come close to it. I can bring it closer to you if you want to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a look at it, please?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle rumbling vibrates throughout the entire chamber as you see the Pearl lowering down to where you are standing. You shielded your eyes due to the intensity of its brightness. As you adjusted to the new brightness, you approached the Dragon Pearl. Truly, it is a magnificent sight. The colors swirl within the orb, hues that resemble rainbows, many colors of which you never seen before. Out of curiosity, you stretched your hand and touched it. Despite being in a warm body, the Dragon Pearl feels cold and you can feel the energy emanating from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\", the sea dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything so majestic before; even the brightest of diamonds looks dim when compared to your Dragon Pearl.\", you complimented, not knowing if you're over-exaggerating your statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because humans have never seen and is highly unlikely for them to ever discover one of the pearls on their own. Dragon Pearls can only be found and used by sea dragons that dwell in the depths of the ocean. Human technologies, if I am not mistaken, are not capable of reaching those parts.\", the dragon explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like the myths I've read before about dragons. I've also wished dragons were real because I love them so much for their strength and nobleness.\", you replied kindly as you admire the simple beauty of the pearl. Until now, you thought that dragons are non-existent and the pearls they hold are just purely ornamental or cultural. Who could've guessed that you will actually encounter one, especially after it eaten you and you're now on some kind of trip through its innards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you truly admire dragons like me.\", the sea dragon said, \"There are still a lot for you to learn about me, about sea dragons. As you venture within me, you will see more sights to behold, more things that will open your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly will.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to see more parts of me?\", the sea dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After admiring the gargantuan \"Dragon's Pearl\" for a long time, you decided that it is time for you to explore another place in the dragon. You used the passageway you entered to return to the stomach where you have more choice to choose from. At the stomach, you look at the countless other tunnels. Once again, you randomly choose another tunnel to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..Before I continue going around in your body, how large is your body and what kind of things may I find in here?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how to put it.\", the dragon says, \"I'm one of the largest sea dragons in this region; the other dragons would look tiny if you do a side-by-side comparison. You can probably imagine my sheer size by the length of my body and its width. And to answer your question about the things you will find, there is too many to precisely explain but I'm preparing a living space somewhere in here for you as we speak. Other than that, there is nothing more I can say. Please take your time to look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered another tunnel, this time on the left side. Similarly, this tunnel twists and turn at every corner. It took you roughly 10 minutes to completely navigate the soft and often slimy tunnel to enter the new chamber before you. It's a smaller room In this new chamber, there is constant rushing sound of water even though you know that you're within the sea dragon. You look around the room, attempting to locate the sound. You finally discover that the rushing sound comes originated from a tall tank made from flesh. You find a slope at one side of the tank, so you climb up, intent to see what is going on in it. Without much effort, you reached the top and looked into the 'tank'. You saw a deep, wide shaft (resembling a large well) with a gradually rising level of water in it. The water is coming in from somewhere beneath the well. The water level continue to rise until it reach just a little above the fleshy brim where you're standing. You wonder what is the purpose of this 'well' for the sea dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you have arrived just in time to see me replenishing my \"drinking water tank\".\", said the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drinking water?\", you asked as you stared at the water, \"I thought that dragons do not need water to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contrary to your belief, sea dragons do need water.\", the dragon explains, \"Like humans, we need fresh water despite the fact that we lived in the ocean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you live in the ocean all the time, how are you going to obtain drinking water?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's relatively a simple process.\", the dragon said as he smiles, \"What you're seeing in this chamber is a part of the \"Water-Conversion\" body system that all sea dragons possess. First of all, when I feel that the 'well' or 'container' in the front of you is running low on water, I will open my mouth to take in a large quantity of seawater. Even though the seawater will travel through my mouth, it will not end up in the stomach because there is a secondary hole that I can open near the gullet that will divert the water to the appropriate area. Those water will travel through a system of filtering cavity along my body to remove most if not all of the debris or unwanted organism out of the seawater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to listening closely to every sentence, words that the sea dragon is speaking. You must admit, the dragon's voice has a strange charming and melodious voice if you disregard the fact that his voice is telepathic in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After undergoing that process\", the dragon continues, \"The seawater will travel through a \"mineral absorbing intestine\" that will effectively remove the salt from the water. The minerals extracted from the water will be used as nutrient for my body. After that, the water will travel through several more tracts before arriving at the 'well' before you for storage and use. When I needed water, I will use another drawing hole beneath the 'well' to transfer it to the part of my body that needed it most. Any remaining debris or unabsorbed minerals will continue down the system for eventual disposal at my urinary system or simply out of the genital into the seal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the long and descriptive speech the sea dragon gave you, you learned the method a sea dragon extract drinkable water from an otherwise unpalatable brine. \"That was an interesting fact I learned.\", you said, \"That's a really an unique body system you explained to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always my pleasure to be a \"body guide\", the dragon said, \" In addition to providing me, you can also use the water from this 'well'. The water is extremely pure and good-tasting if you try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cupped your hand to fetch out a small amount if the water and drink it. The dragon was right, the water is tasty; there is an unexplainable sweetness and refreshing quality in it that is not present in the water you drank before. The water is so clear that you can see the bottom of the 'well' clearly. You drank some more of the water to quench your thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm. I never know that drinking water create by sea dragon can be so delicious.\", you compliment, \"I absolutely like the way your body organs work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you.\", the dragon said, \"This is the first time I heard someone said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is there anywhere else I can go now?\", you asked, keen to know more about this interesting sea dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. It is quickly approaching mid-day.\", the dragon said, \"It is about time that I will be getting some meals for myself. What will I catch for today?...... Say, I want to ask you the pleasure of joining me for mealtime and enjoy the fresh catch from the sea for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds lie a great idea!\", you said, \"Where do I have to go in you for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a eating chamber I 'reserved' for you located near my head. Take the middle hole in my stomach to get there. We'll talk some more once you get there.\", the dragon tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. We'll meet then.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling hungry from the fact that you haven't eat anything since the morning,  you decided to head for the eating chamber and have lunch with the dragon. You left the Water Conversion Chamber and returned to the stomach. From there, you took the hole in the middle just as the sea dragon has instructed. As expected, there are twists and turns along the tunnel. What makes this one different from the previous holes is the abrupt u-turn halfway in the tunnel. No doubt, this is to lead you toward the dragon's head. You walked slowly, imagining the looks of the next chamber you will enter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile thinking about the possibilities, you failed to notice that you have reached the end of the tunnel; it was an accidental tripping that made you realized your surroundings. The room is huge and brightly lit. Like the stomach before, the room is round. At the center is a small raised platform made to resemble a table. When you check out the 'table', you found a large plate the entirely covers the surface. You place you hand onto the plate and feel it.....it's glass. That's not the only unbelievable thing you see in here: there's also two large round viewing windows that are showing scenes underwater. Despite being somewhere deep in the ocean, you can perfectly see everything outside; you can even make out an underwater mountain range on the horizon. You saw various kinds of fishes swimming up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the \"Eating Chamber\".\", the dragon said, \"This will be the place where you have some of the food I catch. Today, I'm looking forward to catching some fresh fishes for lunch. In addition to being an eating area for you, it will also be a viewing room where you can relax yourself by watching the scenery I'm seeing; It will probably be a welcomed feature for you since this is the only place in my body where you can see the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds excellent.\", you tell the dragon, \"So what will probably be on today's menu anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost certain that it will be fish.\", the dragon replied, \" Because I prefer eating my fishes raw, I have to ask you beforehand if you would like me to grill it up with my fire to make it more palatable for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, that will be a good idea.\", you said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. The fishes are coming up right ahead!\", the dragon said with a heightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the windows, you saw a school of fishes just ahead. Previously unnoticed, you also see the dragon's snout that is slowly opening as the dragon began eating down the fishes he caught. Moments later, you heard a loud gulp emanating from beneath the chamber followed by a short burp. \"My apologies for the sound. I just swallowed my portion of the meal.\", the dragon said with a smile, \"Your food will arrive shortly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, two grilled fishes were eventually dropped onto the huge plate from a hole in the ceiling several minutes later. You went over to take a look at the fish. It's salmon. You immediately began digging in the food. It was extremely delicious as you haven't ate anything since morning. Half an hour later, you finished eating the salmons and you're completely stuffed. While you walk around the eating chamber, you found another entrance that leads to another unknown part in the dragon's body. You asked the sea dragon where will that entrance lead to.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That will take you to the Communication Center.\", he answered, \"Unknown to humans, we sea dragons have a secret magical ability that we used to pass information to each other by transmitting signals our horns; such communication can include our locations, news, or when there's nothing in particular to talk about, random talks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised.\", you said, \"That would be no different from the two-way radios we (humans) often used.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking about human technologies, I happened to found a way to receive human electronic transmissions using my pronged horns.\", the dragon explains, \"I actually discovered that by chance; one time, I was communicating with other sea dragons as usual. Then, after I finished talking, i decided to check out my current positioning. As if it were a coincidence, i received a strange signal that doesn't sound like the usual transmission between dragons. It took me about several days to realize what I did: I was the first sea dragon to ever intercepted human communication; It was a radio program that I heard. Eventually I took more interest in the human civilization. Through several tries, I learned how to intercept radio communication out at sea; I used the information i heard to avoid encountering humans boats and the like. Secondly, I used it to learn human languages which significantly contribute to my fluency of your language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the reason you can communicate with me.\", you said, \"I'm just wondering if you can do anything else with this ability?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hmm...possibly, my communication center can also allow you to received what you humans called the internet and television. That will most definitely keep you from getting bored over your long-term stay with me.\", the dragon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, do you want to check it out now?\"</span></div></div>",

You decided to go ahead and check it, see if there's a chance of you watching some of the programs you like to watch. Just because you're inside a living creature it doesn't mean you can have a normal life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll check it, yeah. I didn't think it'd be possible to have internet in here, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect it either but there's no sense on arguing about what's possible and what isn't\" the dragon replied. You had to agree on that, you weren't of the type to have a deep interest on the mechanics of everything in the world. After a few minutes you arrived to the Communication Center. It was less impressive than you thought it'd be. You had imagined an huge console that'd let you enjoy television or internet at your leisure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead there was only one machine resembling a normal computer. It even was marked with a brand and all. \"I swallowed this computer some time ago to experiment with it. What you'll use here is the result of that experiment: a fully functional computer!\" He sounded proud of the achievement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty cool, if it works\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works. Give it a try\" you found several applications installed. Normal stuff like an internet browser, a television service and a chat. The chat was locked. \"You should spend some more time inside me before you try to contact anybody. It's not that I trust you, it's that it's a bit early for that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to reckon that made you a tad uncomfortable. You had a life out there, how were you going to make everything be in order now? People were going to get worried about your disappearance. You told the dragon that. After a short discussion he agreed to let you contact some family and friends with the condition he watched over what you write. That was more acceptable than being outright uncommunicative so you accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a couple hours watching television after that. You and the dragon talked about the type of shows you liked, he was willing to give them a try and discuss them with you. He didn't seem that impressed but admitted he was at least entertained and that swimming in the sea with the TV show as background noise was relaxing in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I'm curious about\" you said while you were leaving the Communication Center \"I had never known sea dragons really existed but I suppose all theories are wrong. Since I have the chance to be inside you could I...could I study you? Okay, maybe studying is not the word, what I mean is if I can explore, see how everything works, hear what you have to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! In that case there's one question first:\"</span></div></div>",
