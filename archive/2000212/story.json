Be whatever type of person, appearance, and major you want to be.  The only difference is that you're 5'3\" (160 cm), but it's not like that'll matter for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda Stein - 21 year old, 6'7\" (2m) sorority president with an amazingly toned body: if she had to, she could probably win a fight with one of the school's football players.  Long auburn hair usually in a ponytail, icy blue eyes, and bronzed skin finish making her the fitness enthusiast's dream.  Her family is incredibly rich, so she has never had to work a day in her life.  Since she's been spoiled rotten she's never suffered, and may not even recognize when she's being cruel.  All the same she's a bully, and loves being so tall.  If there were some way for her to get taller, she wouldn't hesitate.  Majoring in urban design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana Ivanova - 22 year old, 6'2\" (188 cm) dorm rat despite being a senior.  She's rail thin, to the point that she once made a belt out of three bracelets hooked together.  Shoulder-length straight black hair, dark blue eyes and pale skin make her look like a mortician, and sometimes that's not too far off.  However she doesn't look malnourished, instead she's just very conscious of what she eats.  Lana comes from a poor family and identifies with those less fortunate, so she does her best to help people whenver she can.  Working on a thesis in particle physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga Sergeyeva - 21 year old, 5'10\" (178 cm) member of Fulda's sorority with a very well-kept and shapely body.  Long free-flowing blond hair, grey eyes and cream skin all come together very nicely to give her the typical sorority girl look, but she's anything but.  Her family is fairly well-off for first generation immigrants, and she was instilled with a love of studying from an early age.  Though she was always taught to be kind she can definitely take playing a joke a bit too far, and Fulda has been a very bad influence on her since she joined.  Majoring in medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoshan Aghajeni - 23 year old, 5'7\" (170 cm) foreign exchange student from Iran with a very vibrant and vivacious body.  Long black hair, lightly browned skin and irises only a few shades lighter than her pupils indicate that back home she was a Persian princess.  She absolutely loves being at your university, and takes every opportunity she can to exercise not only her right to expression, but her ability to show herself off.  No matter what she has a positive and energetic demeanor, and throws in flourishes whenever she can.  Majoring in performance art.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your head down to watch your step you contemplate how brilliant it was to leave such an easy class for your last semester, finally allowing you to relax.  All you have to do is get a C on the final and you'll keep your GPA totally intact, something you're fairly certain you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of stationary Converse shoes and fantastic legs come into view, but you're going too fast to sidestep the owner.  You speedwalk right into someone's chest, though it feels like you ran into a wall.  Sheepishly you look up to apologize, and are surprised to find a pair of breasts blocking your view of the person's face.  In your surprise you try to back away but a firm hand claps you on the shoulder, holding you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a problem, nerd?\" she asks, turning her icy eyes down to you so that her auburn ponytail falls forward.  Oh crap, it's Fulda, Queen Bitch of the campus.  \"You ought to - man you're small!\"  From the sound of it she hadn't even realized who it was who had bumped into her.  She jerks her arm back, pulling you into her so that you slam into her white tank top-covered chest again, eyes below her breasts.  \"I feel like if I fell forward,\" she whispers, \"I could crush you flat.  I didn't even know men could be as small as you.  I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoubtedly she's smiling from the perverse pleasure she's getting, but you don't look up to check.  Instead you duck away from her hand, brushing by her black short shorts, and head into the crowd entering the lecture hall.  Luckily you easily hide yourself, and make your way into the dimly lit room.  You head to the back row, hoping to avoid any possible pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dim as the screen comes on, and you can't believe your fortune: not only is there no one else in these back two rows, but Fulda never found you!  With a sigh of relief you close your eyes, pull out your notebook and get ready to take notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you look back at the screen you're very disappointed.  Rather than the lecture slides you see a solid wall of muscle in a tank top with a dark red ponytail on top sitting in the chair in front of you.  You groan, tap her on the shoulder and ask, \"Excuse me, would you mind moving, or at least sitting lower?  I can't see the screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it nerd,\" she snorts, \"It's called good posture.  Maybe if you had it you wouldn't be such a manlet.\"  Defeated you lean back into your seat and slouch down, exhaling deeply as you try to focus on at least being able to hear the lecture so you can connect it with the reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end, almost as if to spite you, Fulda shifts up to more totally block your view.  \"Come on, really?\" you ask.  \"You don't have to be rude about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" she says, apparently sitting even straighter.  Incensed you start trying to look around her, but no matter what you can't seem to look past her as she continually sits taller and taller in her chair.  Your frustration continues to build until you feel like you could scream at Fulda, consequences be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you snap, pull your legs up onto your chair, and stand on the seat so that you can see over her, but you're still blocked by the middle of her back.  Not quite realizing what this means you bellow, \"This is absurd, I just want to watch the lecture without some giant woman getting in the way!\"  Odd.  Either your voice cracked for the whole sentence, or someone's been releasing helium into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda has also had enough.  She shoots up, becoming a tower instead of a mere obstruction, and hops over the chair she was sitting in.  You had been so focused on her 'sitting taller' to block your view that you didn't notice everything else getting bigger too.  With a glance at the giant woman you see you're just a bit over her knee while standing on the chair, and seem to still be getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plants one of her massive Converse on the edge of the chair and leans in.  You realize that just half of her shoe comes up to your chin, and you back away with a gulp.  \"Do we have a problem,\" she asks, \"or are you done trying to feel... big?\"  Fulda flashes her pearly whites and you whimper, not yet done shrinking until you reach...</span></div></div>",

Fulda pivots her foot forward and back on the chair's edge, intimidating you as casually as possible.  \"Wh- ho- what's going on?\" you ask, bewildered by the gigantic woman leaning over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda replies with a smug grin and says, \"You're getting what you deserve, pipsqueak.  Bumping into people without saying you're sorry, losing your temper during lectures, it's amazing no one beat some sense into you before now.  But now I can do it with just one finger, and anyone can crush you without even knowing.\"  She pauses and lets out a low laugh.  \"So nothing's really different for you I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bump into the back of the chair, unable to put any more space between yourself and Fulda.  She begins reaching forward, causing you to cover your head reflexively.  To your surprise she doesn't smash you; instead you feel the ground beneath you tip forward, and you open your eyes to see that you're racing down the chair's seat on a collision course for the rubber toe of Fulda's massive Converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on her shoe you skid until you're on the black canvas, face up and looking at one of the gorgeous legs of the woman you can only guess shrank you.  Before you can get your bearings Fulda tips her shoe on the side, spilling you off onto the carpeted floor.  Quickly you stand, and find that you're barely any taller than the rubber around her shoe's sole.  You look up the colossus of a woman to see her peeking over her breasts at you, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights come on in the lecture hall, and everyone begins going for the exit.  Scores of feet hitting the floor create a cacaphony, and you think this might be a chance to get away.  You start running along Fulda's instep, sure that you're in the clear as you pass under her ankle.  Just as you pass her heel though she drags her foot back and turns it, blocking your path.  Quickly you turn right, hoping to get past her heel again, but she merely pulls her other foot in, causing you to run into her shoe.  Before you can turn around and try again she closes her feet together, trapping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem very insistent on getting away,\" she taunts.  \"Did you consider that I'm the only person who knows where you are, or that you're an inch tall?  Anyone else would stomp you flat without a second thought, if they even noticed you.  But maybe that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to the pounding of feet in the room, and picture how congested it would be trying to get out.  She's right, it would only be a matter of time before you found yourself under one of those shoes.  \"Fulda!\" you shout up, hoping she can hear you.  In response she takes a step down the aisle, freeing you from your prison, and turning her other shoe to continue walking away.  \"Don't leave me here!  You're right, without you I'll probably be stepped on, take me with you!\"  Her other shoe leaves the ground, sailing over your head, but stops with you in the center while she considers what to do. </span></div></div>",

After a few seconds she moves it back to where it was and sets it down in front of you.  Relieved, you lean forward against the toe of her shoe, gasping for breath you didn't know you had been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant leg before you bends, the act of squatting enough to push her shin out above you.  From the side a humongous arm curves around her sculpted legs, thumb and forefinger at the ready.  As her fingers overtake you, you feel a strong tug on your collar as your shirt is pinched by Fulda's powerful digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Fulda stands, holding you close against her as she does so.  From her shins up you feel the full weight of your significance: her kneecaps alone are taller than you, after all, and her thighs are more like mesas than parts of her legs.  You can feel the heat from her midsection as you pass it since her tank top does a poor job insulating, and she practically rubs you against her breasts as she lifts you past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she gets you up to lip level, her enormous face exuding mercurial confidence.  Her icy blue eyes are lit up with delight, and she puckers her lips at you before going into a smile.  \"You need to work on your begging,\" she says.  \"Maybe a bit more pleading would do you some good, hmm?\"  You do your best to stare into at least one of your eyes while she decides what to do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly you feel the grip on your collar release, and you find yourself plummeting through the air.  With a glance below you see Fulda's ample cleavage, the center directly below you.  You do your best to brace for the impact, unsure of just how soft breasts are when falling on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the fall isn't too far, and you don't gain too much momentum before your landing.  Even at falling speed her boobs are fairly soft, and as you bounce up and down on them you wonder how this can possibly be related to what she just said.  You extend both arms and stroke each gigantic breast with a hand, just glad that finally something positive happened with this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda simply rolls her eyes and digs a finger in just beyond your head.  Her finger curls below you and hooks you up, dragging you along her cleavage and towards the rest of her body.  Your legs drop as you reach the part before her breasts meet, and you slide down into the gap when the rest of your body is pushed forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you twist around, allowing yourself to see where you'll be going, but find your view blocked by a palm and outstretched fingers.  \"Hope you enjoyed it while you could, nerd,\" she says, \"because the ride's about to get bumpy.\"  With that one of her manicured fingers pushes on your head, driving you down into her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you a stream of light pours in and you can see Fulda's chin, her attention entirely turned away from you.  You try to \"swim\" forward or up, but Fulda's breasts firmly pin your arms to your sides.  With a shrug you settle in for the ride, not sure how this could possibly be unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single step lets you know real fast.  As Fulda's breasts bounce you're dropped a fraction of an inch further away from the air and light: additionally when they fall back into place they smack into you, not enough to worry about being crushed but uncomfortable all the same.  With each step they bounce a little more, dropping you further until you're standing on the bottom of her bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat is no joke either.  It was bad at first since you were in a sleeve surrounded by Fulda's body heat, but as the ride goes in it just gets hotter.  Probably before she even leaves the room you break out into sweat, and you're forced to rub your face against her breast to keep sweat out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the bottom of her bra, the pounding of her breasts gets worse since you're at their stopping point.  If this goes on much longer, you don't think you'll come out of her cleavage the same way you went in.  However if you were inside one of her cups, you think, you'd essentially be in a gigantic shock absorber, or you could try to slip out the bottom. </span></div></div>",

Luckily the timing is very predictable, and you're able to pinpoint the next time they'll rise off of you.  As soon as the weight leaves you throw your legs down from her bra before they can slam back down, freeing you from your jiggling torture chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly your new situation isn't much better.  You're not sure what you expected, but there's nothing to drop down onto - her shirt's totally untucked, meaning you're likely to go careening to the floor if you fall, and her navel is an incredibly hard target to hit.  On the plus side light freely bleeds through her shirt, bathing her abs in a pale light so that you can see her chiseled six-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe worst of all, the shaking continues to jostle you.  It's not as intense as it previously had been, but with each bounce you swing back and forth a bit more.  With each swing your grip weakens a bit, and you're not sure how much longer you can hold on.  Feebly you try kicking your legs in the air to push yourself up, but your arms are just too tired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda suddenly stops, and you're projected forward farther than any swing yet.  You try to capitalize on the momentum and turn yourself around, but with your already weakened hands it's questionable whether you'll be able to make it.</span></div></div>",

You grit your teeth as you speed towards her chest, your knees bent so as not to break against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet sink into Fulda's soft skin, the force not even reaching the pliable cartilage underneath.  With a sigh of relief you begin walking your legs up her sternum, keeping your death grip on the underside of her bra.  The effort of holding on for dear life works with Fulda's intense body heat to make you start sweating, and with each vertical step your legs burn just a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough sheer force of will you get your legs above you, and coil the rest of your body in.  Fulda's breasts are no longer bouncing up and down, a good sign that she's stopped and this could now be the safest place to be.  Carefully you push up with your arms, slip your head back inside her bra and push with your legs.  Your body stretches back out, pushing along the underside of her boobs as they impede your movement still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the immense weight and heat emanating from on top of you, you know you're safe compared to a few minutes ago.  You breathe a sigh of relief and brush some sweat from your forehead just when you hear... a car start?  Above you her breasts are parted by two fingers, and you look up through her cleavage to see Fulda sternly peering down at you.  \"I don't know what the hell you were doing,\" she says, \"but it was really annoying.

It doesn't seem as bad this time since you're used to it, but the bouncing with each step is far from pleasant.  You lay down to try to mitigate the impact, spreading it over your whole body and wait for her to stop walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully your ride is short, and almost as soon as she stops Fulda slides two fingers down into her cleavage, parting it above you.

Fulda kicks off her massive Converse and sets them down on the bench, trapping you between them and her ass - truly putting you between a rock and hard place.

You gulp, and turn your attention away from the massive implements of doom Fulda so casually dropped on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is naturally drawn back to the enormous athlete a couple feet away from you who's already dropped her shorts to the floor.  She pulls up her pair of navy blue volleyball shorts which barely cover more than just her panties, and support her firm, round butt significantly more.  It mesmerizes you to the point that you barely notice her take off her shirt, revealing a well-defined musculature which she quickly covers back up with her T-shirt the same color as her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with the basics Fulda slams her locker shut, pads and socks still in her hand.  She kicks her shoes over to the bench with her huge bare feet and follows after them, stopping right before you.

Her fingers close around you and lift you up from the bench, then she slowly, almost as if she's being careful, pulls you further into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relaxing ride is cut short when Fulda suddenly turns and slams herself down, causing a calamity throughout her body and slamming you down into her palm.  Her fingers grip you slightly tighter, holding you more firmly and making it so you can't get back to your feet.  You feel yourself being moved again, and two of the enormous fingers lift off from your torso.  However your legs are still firmly pinned down by her other two fingers, and you can only watch as Fulda grabs the enormous rolled-up socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda carries the socks along with you down to her feet and holds you against her large, calloused foot as she works her toes into the opening.  You're unable to hold your breath for the duration, but luckily for you the smell isn't nearly as bad as you expected: it's actually somewhat pleasant, and seems to be Fulda's natural fragrance.  Before you can begin to really enjoy yourself she begins pulling the sock up, taking you along with it and dragging you along every inch of tanned skin on her long, toned calves as the white fabric in her hands gets more taut.  When you find yourself against her knee she legs go, snaps that sock in place, and repeats the process with the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she's done with that her arm explodes into motion again, snatching up one of her knee pads from beside her.  Surprisingly this smell is much less pleasant than her feet, having accumulated months of sweat without being washed.  It probably wasn't bad enough for a normal sized person to even notice, but for someone held right up against them while being able to use it as a shelter it's a whole different story.  You do your best to only take short, gasping breaths as you're dragged along her seemingly endless sock while in the knee pad's cloud, allowing yourself to feel some relief when you begin traversing her bare thigh.  The other leg is less of an issue now that you know roughly how long you'll have to breathe in Fulda's accumulated sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she's fully equipped she turns her attention back to you, still pinned in her palm.  She flexes one of the fingers holding you, making you wince as it feels like your pelvis is about to be crushed until she relents, then flashes you a sadistic smile.  Fulda stands, her glacial eyes fixated on you the whole time, and walks over to where she had kicked her shoes.  Slowly you feel yourself being lowered to where Fulda's decided to place you.</span></div></div>",

Your proximity to her keeps you from getting a complete picture of where you're being taken, but it doesn't exactly take a genius to reason it out.  When you see her other hand moving to the waistband of her shorts below, you get all the confirmation that you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Fulda's fingers dig into the top of her shorts and pull the fabric out, creating a gaping pit below you with her ass forming a large, rounded crevice.  She relinquishes her grip on you, and you find yourself plummeting through the opening into her shorts.  Almost as soon as you're inside she pulls her fingers out, letting the fabric snap into place around you, trapping you against her butt and casting you into darkness.  Fulda briefly flexes her butt, squeezing you tightly, then releases you once more into your terribly restrictive surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's butt cheeks shift subtly as she puts on her shoes, one slightly pushing you against the other in turn.  When she begins walking you find yourself being swayed along with her rear end as it grips you firmly, holding you in her crack.  You make some effort to wiggle your way down or to the side, but can only progress a few millimeters at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour progress is halted again when Fulda stops, having reached her destination on the court.  She squats down, pushing you into her cotton underwear so that the tautness effectively forms a seal around you.  The pressure varies as she squats lower and raises up, but the message is clear: you're not going anywhere soon.  Fulda yells \"Come on girls, let's go!\" and you get the distinct feeling that as the game progresses your lot will only get worse, perhaps significantly so.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds she comes to a rest, and you jiggle up and down with her buttocks while they come to a rest.  You try to grab onto her panties to stop yourself from getting thrown about, but with the quick, violent movements you're never able to get a good grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after she stops Fulda squats down into a ready position, tightening her panties around you as her ass pushes outward.  The tightly-woven mesh pushing into your skin makes you forget about trying to anchor yourself, and the pressure from her butt contorts your spine into a sharp curve.  The heat begins to catch up to you as well, and beads of sweat form on your forehead well ahead of any on Fulda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she explodes into action, bounding across her section of the court in a brief sprint.  The loss of tightness around you is offset by how hard you're hammered by her buttock, knocking you into the cotton fibers of her panties before you're thrown back to make a shallow imprint on her ass.  Each long, pounding stride she makes throws you again, catching you in a repeating loop of bouncing between her ass and her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a loud thud and feel her body vibrate for an instant, then she slows down, allowing you a reprieve from being thrown about inside her panties.  Instead she begins shifting her feet in place, creating an all new uncomfortable sensation for you while you're again bounced back and forth between her buttocks, this time much more quickly and with less force, never allowing you to center yourself or get some rest.  Each light shift makes you feel as though the world is vibrating, and though you try to make it stop you're unable to cease the constant bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat begin to form above you, adding to the humidity of your already dire situation.  You don't have long to dwell on it though, since Fulda resumes vigorously running, throwing you into her panties over and over again and ramming you against the harsh weaving.  Suddenly there's a change, and you find yourself weightless and released from one of your bounds.  Whatever's happening, you know it won't be good for you, and you brace yourself for the worst.</span></div></div>",

The instant she lands nearly all of her weight is pressed onto you, along with the energy gathered during her fall.

She slides along the floor for a foot, grinding the broken puddle of your body even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda trips, and there's nothing she can do to stop herself from falling.  When she lands she hears the resounding thud of her butt hitting the ground and feels a wet puddle, about the size of a quarter, against her skin.

Feebly you try to push away from either surface trapping you, but her butt is too firm to move and her panties are too pliable; you simply can't get any leverage either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure suddenly subsides as Fulda shoots up, and you're hammered back and forth by her swaying buttocks.  Each one slams you into the other, and in your disoriented state you barely realize that the squeeze came back momentarily, and then you felt free again as well as weightless.  However the sensation only lasts a second, and when gravity comes back you're slammed down hard, making you slide down her butt so that you rest under the curvature of a buttock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Fulda moves or hits the ball back there's a light jiggling atop you as her butt bounces from the movement.  Each bounce mashes you back down into the fabric of her panties, rendering any sort of repositioning impossible, let alone escape.  You resign yourself to simply having to deal with the incessant pounding until once again you feel the tightness of her firm butt followed by a brief moment of weightlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Fulda slams back onto the ground, the force of which sends you tumbling down.  You fall down the rest of her panties, then slide out of the lining feet first, the rest of you following as you desperately claw for a handhold.  As you fall out of her shorts you try to grab onto the bottom of those as well, but the mesh has nowhere to grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plummet past her thighs until you land on her sock, buffeted by her flexed calf encased within. Immediately you begin rolling down the back of her leg, clawing at the fiber to stop yourself but coming up empty each time.  Down the slope you see the back of her shoe waiting, and you brace yourself for impact against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fulda shoots back up, straightening her leg and launching you off from her Achilles heel.  You arc through the air before impacting on the hard wood floor, sliding on the polished surface.  Quickly you take stock of the situation - three pairs of athletic shoes within sight, each hundreds of yards away, and one massive pair belonging to Fulda directly behind you.  There's a loud thud as Fulda begins moving again, and you realize that there's no way you can stay where you are.</span></div></div>",

Briefly you consider going to one of them for help but dismiss the idea, foreseeing that nothing good will come of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles as Fulda runs back and forth, almost circling around you.  Patiently you wait for her to make another pass, her feet thundering on the hard wood floor as she moves.  You wait for her to start the approach towards you to make your move.  When the thumping from her running crescendos you make a break for it, heading for the near sideline.  You've successfully moved out of her path and think you're home free when an enormous black shoe comes slamming down in front of you, blocking your way.  Unable to stop you run into the treated leather, the cacophony of the near impact followed shortly after by the dull thud of her hitting the volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly you push off the shoe, propelling yourself in the other direction.  Fulda starts running backwards, clearing the path in your new direction as the thumps from her footfalls grow quieter.  You use the extra momentum to carry yourself forward, heading for the adjacent square occupied by a blond equally as titanic to you as Fulda is.  Rapidly you approach the dividing line, sure that soon you'll be free from Fulda's tyranny and off this deathtrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross over the dividing line into the blond's quadrant and feel some amount of relief.  The giantess here is fairly far back and out of your way, she probably won't even be an issue as you traverse the couple hundred yards to the other side.  Just as you think this though the distant crashes of the blond running in place suddenly grow louder, and you see that she's coming right for you!  Immediately you freeze in place and cover your eyes, unwilling to watch certain death approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a familiar crash as the blond's black shoe smashes into the ground before you, followed by the same dull thud of the ball.  The shoe runs into you as the woman slides, driving you backwards.  It takes all of your effort pushing back to keep from slipping under her sole, but luckily you remain standing.  Unluckily when she stops and pulls her foot away, you see you're back where you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance forward and back - to one side a pair of giantesses endlessly move back and forth, forming a mobile wall of tremendous feet you can't hope to get past, and on the other is a quartet doing the same.  To your left Fulda doesn't show any sign of slowing down, and on the right you're not sure you can really be safe while crossing the blond's zone.

As far as you can tell, she still thinks you're in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic you spin around, hoping that you'll fare better in the blond's area, only to see her rapidly running back and forth to keep pace with the ball.

Further, while the blond is standing still and patiently waiting for something to come her way, the brunette seems almost bored with the game, glancing down at the floor and idly kicking the air every now and then.  Her socks have begun to fall a bit from inattentiveness, you notice, as the thumping's intensity is joined by Fulda's right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you is a lightly tanned woman with chocolate brown hair, and with just a cursory look you can tell she's ripped in all the right ways.

In a couple seconds the rest arrive to find her still in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That!\" your chosen giantess declares, pointing an accusatory finger down at you.  \"That weird bug!  It looks like a man, but, like, a tiny one!  It's freaking me out!\"  All of the women fan out to form a circle around you, each of them casting scornful glares in your direction.  As you look at the sixteen titanic shoes forming a ring around you, you find yourself wishing that you could shrink even more, preferably down to nothing.  If looks could do it, you feel that all of them combined just might accomplish it.</span></div></div>",

As soon as your eyes reach it, her butt, which would draw your attention even at normal size, supported by the taut cotton fabric and absolutely immaculate, begins racing down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you turn to your right and start running as fast as you can.  All around you the shadow rapidly expands as Fulda carelessly sits, her rock-hard ass plummeting like a meteorite.  You haven't even taken four of your incredibly short steps before the shadow covers all you can see, and an instant later everything goes black as you're smushed under her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough in incredible pain, you aren't flattened just yet.  It occurs to you, through the intense agony of most everything being broken, that if you had stayed put her butt cheeks are probably separated enough by her shorts that you would have been provided a relatively safe sanctuary.  As soon as the thought enters your head Fulda minutely lifts up from her seat, carrying you on the bottom of her shorts, and immediately drops back down, sandwiching you between her butt and the bench.  Before you can finally expire she begins grinding her butt back and forth, finally smashing you into a paste underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda pulls her second sock tight before she realizes what the odd-feeling thing she had been sitting on was.

You hear Fulda giggling as you stand back up, and she walks over to the bench to properly tower over you while she changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes travel up the gargantuan girl before you, comprehending only with difficulty her sheer size.  When she drops her shorts to reveal her black panties there's no big surprise, since she consciously chose her shorts to hide as little as possible.  After she takes her shirt off though it's abundantly clear: from her chiseled abs to her toned thighs, and her biceps like rolling, dusty hills, Fulda is absolutely jacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as she reveals it she covers herself back up.  She pulls a teal tank top over her head, though it's evident she tore it away to reveal her midriff.  Then she pulls on a pair of spandex shorts that stretch down to her knees which somehow leave even less to the imagination than before with how it clings to her.  Finally she drops herself back onto the bench, causing you to stumble into her, so that she can put on her ankle socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a tug on the back of your shirt, and Fulda picks you up.

That way I know where you are at all times, and if you try to get away...\"  She sets her thumb and forefinger apart just in front of you, then pinches them together while she mimics a squishing sound.  \"Got it?\"  You nod fervently, and she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you in a loose fist as she walks through the gym, letting you bounce around on her fingers.  Small circles of light stream in on either side, providing you some illumination, but even if you could get to them with all the jostling you wouldn't be able to fit through them.  Besides, Fulda seems intent on the idea that if she can't have you, no one can, and she could easily just tighten her fist once and crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're no longer being thrown around, you know she's arrived.  Her fingers open like a blossoming flower and you're almost immediately snatched up by her other hand, then held before her face as you're pinched between her fingers.  She locks her cold eyes onto you and remarks, \"My spotter isn't here yet, so you're going to be my tiny personal trainer.\"  Momentarily she sets you down on a bench, then returns with two 45-pound barbells, slams them down around you, and pinches you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allows you to linger a second admiring her 6-pack until she lifts you back up to her lip level, her face barely concealing disdain.  \"I'll be doing curls.  I'm going to set you on my thigh, and if my arm gives out it's going to land on you, smashing you instantly, and if I lean for leverage you'll roll off my thigh.  Your job is to motivate me to keep going and use good form, because right now I neither want to lose you nor smash you accidentally.  All you have to do is lay there.  Got it?\"  Again you nod vigorously and she sits, laying you down atop her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle into the thin layer of spandex on her sculpted leg muscle and hope you don't get squashed.  The first two sets go easily as the monolith overlooking you easily hoists the weights over and over again on each side, her movement creating a slight swaying and rising motion as her muscles tense and relax.  Sweat begins forming all over her, though thankfully you're protected by her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda downs a torrential deluge of water and begins her third set.  Already you can tell it's different - her arms are shaking, sweat's running down her arms in greater quantities, and each time her forearm gets a bit closer to you.  On the fourth rep a sweat drop passes from her arm to your chest, and you decide you've had enough.  You roll yourself over, sliding down the inside of her thigh so that you land on the bench.  You look up at her from the canyon you've fallen into, but from the look on her face you can't tell if she's angry or just straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are loud thuds as she drops the weights, her sets finished.  The convection oven between her thighs cools off as she pulls them away, exposing you to fresh air... and Fulda's anger.  Before you can even duck she swipes you up in her hand and wraps her fingers around your body, leaving just your head exposed.

The violence with which she snatched you up makes you think she may crush you in her hand, possibly as an accident, and from her expression you expect her to explode with rage if you survive.  After a brief interlude without your bones being smashed or your eardrums bursting by her yelling, you chance to open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda definitely doesn't look pleased, but the momentary breather she took looks like it's saved your life for the moment.  \"I'm not sure what's worse,\" she begins.  \"You thinking I'm too weak, or you trying to run away from me.  Maybe your tiny brain can't understand the concept that you're only an inch tall, and only I know that.  Nobody else here does, and if they see itsy-bitsy you running around they'll smash you.  Only I can protect you, but if you keep acting like this I'll flatten you myself.  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you really have no choice: if you don't tell her what she wants to hear you're dead.  Vigorously you nod in agreement, and Fulda smiles.  \"Glad you see it my way.  I don't trust you as far as you can throw me though, so I'll be putting you somewhere safer.  For your protection, of course.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like the sound of that, but Fulda's fist is still clenched around you, and her maw is mere inches away.  She lowers you from her face until you're staring at her manhole-sized belly button, and as you look up the stony cliff of her abs she peers down at you mischievously.  Fulda moves you around her waist and holds you against the small of her back.  Above you, past the stone slab of her back, her piercing eyes gaze over her shoulder, and below you her free hand pulls out her waistband revealing a broad cavern.  The pressure around you releases as Fulda lets go, and you slide down her sweaty back, into her spandex shorts, and come to a stop wedged between her left butt cheek and the spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud pop as Fulda lets go of the elastic, sealing you against her butt.  The air is humid with her sweat, and the musky air is unpleasant to breathe, to say the least.  When she steps you strain along with her skintight shorts, and the material seals you in tighter as you have nowhere to go against her toned butt.  </span></div></div>",

There's nothing solid underneath your feet, and being secured in this way is something you've never experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly the jiggling stops, and you simply detect Fulda making slight adjustments in her position.  Before you can start getting comfortable you feel yourself drop sharply as her butt shoots down, pushing you further into the spandex as the material tightens even more around you.  The sudden strain shocks you, and you wince as she stands back straight, relieving the new pressure on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as it's gone she squats back down, putting the same amount of force on you as before.  The ongoing strain on your body makes it worse, but despite the immense pain you don't feel as though anything's broken either.  However you get the distinct feeling that if this goes on much longer the cumulative strain will make your body pop as you're smashed against Fulda's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twelve excruciating dips you hear a loud clang of metal on metal above you.  The spandex has relaxed to its state from before this began, and you let out a sigh of relief.  Your body is bruised but not broken, and as far as you can tell she stopped just in time - the heat coming off her butt is almost enough to make you pass out after that, and if she keeps going it's not likely you'll make it.</span></div></div>",

As the small pocket you occupy cools down you take measured breaths, hopeful that the torment has stopped for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's butt begins bouncing as she walks, strangely comforting to you considering how scared you were during this just a few minutes ago.  You remain tightly sealed against her butt as she goes, jiggling with it the whole time as she goes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the constant rhythm stops, and a single finger pulls the spandex on top of you away.  You make the mistake of breathing in deeply only to get a lungful of humid booty sweat and hot air, causing you to start coughing and your eyes to water.  While you're stunned a massive hand reaches in and grabs you, forcibly pulling you out of your imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen next you can open your eyes you're looking Fulda square in the face, her thumb and forefinger hooked under your armpits.  \"My spotter just texted and said she can't make it today, so I have to cut our workout session short,\" she says.  \"Too bad, too, it looks like you could really use some gym time.\"  She prods your bicep with her free hand and adds, \"You pathetic little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's face shifts as she kicks off her shoes, and you're slowly lowered to be set on the floor of her locker.  As you look up at her from chest level she leans in, a metallic bang ringing out as her elbows slam into the ground in front of you.  She crosses her arms and stares at you, regarding you as a cat does a mouse.  \"I'm going to go take a quick shower,\" she says, \"and when I get back I want to see if you learned anything today.  Okay?\"  With her right hand she gives you an \"affectionate\" tap with the tip of her finger, knocking you on your butt, and she closes the door.

Briefly you consider escaping, but you have to admit Fulda's right: no one else knows what's happened to you, and it's not like an inch-tall person is a common encounter.  Besides, you're about five feet off the ground, so even if you could fit through the door crack you'd probably splatter all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you sit down to ponder how to pass the time until your keeper gets back.  No, not keeper - captor, you think, since you'll escape as soon as you're able.  You pull out your phone and begin scrolling through your contacts for someone to message when it strikes you just how ridiculous you would sound.  Who on earth would take a text seriously that said \"Been shrunk to one inch tall, please help?\"  At best someone would think you're doing some role-play thing and text back.  More likely they'd just ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsent anything else to pass the time, you turn on your phone's flashlight and start looking around.  Unsurprisingly everything near you is drab gray metal, with large shapes looming on the periphery of your vision.  You walk towards the nearest one, which is gradually revealed as more light is able to reach it - an enormous dark blue running shoe which seems like it would not only dwarf the room you live in, but is as large as your building, to say nothing of how it makes you feel.  Closing in you only feel smaller as you're able to more accurately size yourself up with the shoe until you're standing decidedly under the tip of the toe, just barely grazing the underside as you reach up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there's still no sign of Fulda, you decide to continue exploring.  You jump up and grip the tip of the shoe with your hands, starting it rocking back and forth, then back away.  With a running start you leap onto the shoe's toe as it dips down, digging your feet into the rubber and scrambling onto the top.  Your feet sink into the light mesh fabric as you crawl your way up the tongue, holding onto the laces for support as you go.  While you climb it's impossible to shake the notion from your mind that you're climbing up Fulda's shoe like a grade school child on a jungle gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the summit you sit down on the rim and survey everything around from your lofty perch atop her shoe.  Several pairs of shoes are lined up between you and the wall - a pair of stark white tennis shoes, black basketball shoes, and some high-end soccer cleats - all of which positively dwarf you and everything you own.  You pan right and spot sets of athletic clothes, nothing more than a pair of shorts and a T-shirt each, which stand taller than you even folded and compressed.  When you pan right you see an enormous tennis racket - the perfect thing to swat you like a gnat - and a white tennis skirt which, despite their notoriously short length, still seems more like a pavilion tent to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked you turn off your phone's flash, returning the locker back to near-absolute darkness.  This is the first time you've been able to evaluate your size against common things without Fulda threatening your death, and you can fully appreciate your situation: you're not just a bit small, you're absolutely puny!  Fulda may be significantly taller than average, giving her substantially larger feet, but even with her borderline case it sinks in that she hasn't been kidding, and you really can be crushed by anyone on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you absorb this information there's a cacophony as metal is wrenched against metal and the door is yanked open, filling the locker with light again.  Fulda fills the doorway, massive as ever, her head turned away for the moment.  The sudden assault on your senses startles you and you feel yourself tipping backwards into her open shoe!  Quickly you reach for a lace, hoping to keep from falling in.</span></div></div>",

Trepidation builds as the silence goes on, and you worry she may go ahead and crush you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she breaks the silence with an earth-shattering syllable.  \"Hi.\"  Such a simple word, said so closely by someone so much larger than you, and after such a build-up, comes out more as a bellowed assault than a polite greeting.  You clap your hands to your ears and Fulda smiles sadistically while waiting for you to uncover your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you want to feel big, just think of that,\" she says, much quieter this time.

Before bringing her hand back down to her side she pinches off both ends of her fist, making sure you can't slide out but also sending you back into darkness.  With some ire you notice this is starting to become a pattern: every time Fulda needs to carry you somewhere, you're kept entirely in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being blocked from any significant incoming light your new vessel is far and away the most pleasant one yet.  For once you're not being constantly barraged by breasts or bounced up and down and nearly broken by her butt.  Fulda's fingertips provide some very pleasant cushions, and her ambient body heat is pleasant as opposed to sweltering.  As her arm moves back and forth you feel like you're in a porch swing, and if you close your eyes you can almost forget you've been taken captive by a woman who shrank you down and seems intent on tormenting you so that you can doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the idea presents itself to you, Fulda reaches her car and you're mildly jostled.  You hear the door open and slam close, followed by the seat belt clicking and the ignition firing.  \"I need two hands for this, bug,\" she declares without even opening her fist.  Instead she just drops you where you'll hopefully be staying for the duration of the ride.</span></div></div>",

Your short fall has a padded landing on top of her thigh, but you still have the wind knocked out of you.  Standing, you gasp to get air back into your lungs, doubled over from the shock of your impact, and begin staggering up her thigh towards her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she puts the car in gear you wish you had stayed on your stomach.  As the car reverses you topple backwards, flopping to your back on the plain of her leg.  Looking up the enormous woman's torso you spot her dark red locks, still damp from the shower, and the nonchalant expression on her face.  It seems as though she's entirely unaware of your tiny self struggling to stand back up atop her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several false attempts due to the varying accelerations you're subjected to, you manage to firmly stand on your feet.  Your feet make shallow dimples on her thigh as you jog, still winded, towards the hem of her shorts.  Fulda shows no reaction as you get closer, your pace steadily taking you closer to something you can anchor yourself to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're barely more than an arm's length from your goal Fulda corners sharply, knocking you off your feet.  You're thrown into the side of her opposite thigh, hanging momentarily before sliding down the steep slope to her leather seat.  This landing is not nearly as cushioned as the previous one but you manage to roll as you land, minimizing the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom deep between her thighs you look up at Fulda.  She smirks slightly, probably pleased at messing with you without even having to direct any attention your way.  You turn and look down her legs, toned behemoths capped by long Converse that rest on the pedal.  Absent anything else to do you walk along them, running your hand along a thigh as you go, while Fulda arrives safely at her place.  When she finally stops you're nearly halfway to her knee, and you hope she'll be able to find you to get you out.</span></div></div>",

She reaches a hand down and pokes her fingers into the seat before you, blocking your path down her leg.  Her fingers begin scraping along the leather towards you, forming a wall whose inexorable advance you can't avoid.  Unable to resist, you get scooped up by her fingers as they form a shovel perfectly sized for your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're held between her powerful thigh and fingers as she scrapes them along, trapping you against her.  She presses you slightly into her skin, not pushing hard enough to harm you but definitely enough to keep you from getting out.  Luckily she digs into her thigh enough that you can't slip between the two surfaces, keeping you from being unintentionally crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cell made from fingers steadily moves you up Fulda's thigh for some time, and then begins rotating.  She turns you perpendicular, head towards her knees, as she continues pushing you along the silky smooth skin of her upper thigh.  Suddenly Fulda unclasps her fingers, and the momentary lack of pressure drops you to rest on the side of her ring finger.  Fulda withdraws her fingers quickly enough that you can't be ferried out on them, and you're gripped firmly again, this time by the skin-tight cloth of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda swings her monumental legs out of the car, swinging you along in a disorienting loop.  As she steps you're able to peek through a miniscule gap down her leg so that you can watch her muscles tense and relax with each stride, her enormous Converse slapping the ground hard enough to make small earthquakes.  The ground changes from concrete to linoleum tile, and then again to carpet as Fulda enters and walks through her sorority house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs you hear her open another door, then quickly close it behind her.  There's a faint click as she turns the lock, then the carpet far below blurs by as she steps to the center of the room.  \"We're home, bug,\" she declares, the vibrations from her booming voice shaking you slightly.  \"Are you ready for some fun, just the two of us?\"</span></div></div>",

Then, much more quickly, Fulda slams her foot down, the torque making your head spin as you're turned back upside down.  The downward force exerted by your body after the stomp is enough to break the tension of her shorts, and you're sent rocketing out the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide down her leg, gaining speed with each inch of tanned flesh you pass.  When you reach her calf you continue along her muscle's curve, and before you know it you're launched off the side like it's a ski jump.  Rapidly you spin through the air, your view constantly shifting between the floor as it gets closer and Fulda, who seems to loom ever larger as you plummet to the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you lose your lunch you impact upon the carpet, slightly sinking into the surprisingly plush fibers.  The softness of her carpet, combined with the incredible spin you're in, keep you from being seriously damaged by the landing, and you continue your roll along the carpet until you make impact with a heavy, solid rubber object.  You regard the obstacle that stopped you, much longer than it is tall, with a single black horizontal stripe running the length.  It dawns on you that this is no coincidence - rather, it's Fulda's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous shoe lifts up and swivels, centering your prone body directly under the sole.  Fulda swings it up and down like she's pumping a pedal, bringing the diamond-patterned rubber close enough for you to touch before swiftly withdrawing again.  After several pumps she leaves her foot in the up position, letting it loom over you while she ponders what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Never in your life did you imagine you'd find yourself in awe of a shoe, but here you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too bad you're focusing so near, or you would have noticed Fulda's frustrated sigh while you stand there paralyzed.  As fast as you can blink her titanic shoe swings down again with so much force Fulda couldn't stop it even if she wanted to.  You're laid out hard when it slams into your head, and most of your bones crack as they're trapped underneath her shoe.  The pressure increases as Fulda lifts up her heel, and with a quick twist your body is broken up and smeared among the carpet fabric.  Fulda stomps her foot down a couple times for good measure, totally flattening your crushed remains, before walking off.</span></div></div>",

No longer paralyzed with fear as you were when she was rapidly swinging her foot up and down you force yourself to stand, your legs sinking into the long, soft carpet fibers.  Fulda continues lowering her foot as you try to escape from under it, your progress hindered as you have to step over each knee-high thread in your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you darkens as the bottom of her shoe encroaches ever closer.  Energized by fear you continue your path, certain you can get free if you just keep going.  Your head bumps against the rubber of her sole as you step high, and with a battle cry you throw yourself forward, knowing that it's now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you Fulda's shoe lays flat against the ground, just barely missing your feet.  The canvas of her humongous shoe wrinkles as she lifts her heel, driving the ball of her foot further into the carpet.  A swishing sound permeates your ears as she twists her foot back and forth, grinding her shoe into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you escaped this squeeze, you know the other shoe has yet to drop.  You get back to your feet and continue your trek over Fulda's carpet, doing your best to cope with the rough terrain.  Behind you the sound of her shoe grinding into carpet stops, and you feel the minor quake as her heel sets itself back onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda allows your trek to continue for some time while you navigate your way across her floor, neither of you sure of any goal you might ultimately have.  Suddenly your escape is halted when another shoe sets down in front of you, this one practically vertical except for the toe being pushed roughly into the carpet, so close that you're sure it was specifically targeted.  You look up the massive rubber sole, dozens of feet high, to her calf above as it pops out from the strain, and then to her horizontal thigh beyond her crooked knee.  For a moment you simply look up at her heel towering above you, waiting for Fulda to make her move.</span></div></div>",

Boy, would my face have been red!\"  She lets out a sarcastic laugh and lifts up her shoe, then pulls it back toward her, making sure its entire length passes over your head.  When she sets it down she continues, \"You should be more careful, or I'll treat you like the pest that you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's as clear a signal as any that Fulda's done playing for now, so you turn around to regard the giantess.  She stands with her feet shoulder width apart, the tips of her shoes about six inches away from you.  As you look up her leg muscles twitch involuntarily, and you note that her well-worn black short shorts have been molded to her thighs rather than impose their own form.  Her arms are crossed under her chest, pushing her well above-average breasts up even more.  By the time you reach her face she's glowering down at you, and you get the feeling she's trying very hard to conceal outright disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda begins impatiently tapping her foot, each thud sending a minor tremor through your bones.

With great precision she pinches the back of your shirt with her fingertips and picks you up from the carpet, letting you dangle helplessly.  She then stands back up, rapidly propelling you into the air, and holds you facing away from her at arm's length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swing back and forth, kicking uselessly in an attempt to steady yourself, you note that Fulda's room is fairly large, and it doesn't just seem that way due to your shrunken size.  In front of you is a massive combination desk and drafting table, with a tower of books and a closed laptop atop it.  When she rotates, starting you swinging in a whole new direction, you see a large entertainment center, the centerpiece of which is a screen wide enough to span your entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turns again you're overlooking a bed, probably a queen-size though it looks more like an aircraft carrier to you.  \"That's the biggest bed they'd let me put in here,\" Fulda explains.  \"Shame, since my feet still hang off the end, but I can't see that making a difference to you.  But just so you don't get any funny ideas, if you try to climb in bed without me knowing you're going to end up inside one of those shoes, got it?\"  She tilts you, allowing you to see a neat row of footwear ranging from an old, beat-up pair of All-Stars similar to what she's wearing now to knee-high boots and formal heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a few steps of her incredibly long legs she carries you before her closet.  Before you can stop swaying she pulls the door open, revealing a line of clothes hanging from a rack.  She rotates her hand slightly, directing your view down to some scattered shoes that apparently didn't make the cut for display and... a house.  \"And this is where you'll be staying when not with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Fulda?\" you shout.  \"Aren't you a bit old to have a dollhouse in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns you around just so you can see the nonplussed look on her face.  \"That was part of my senior project, you stupid bug.  It has full electricity, plumbing, and even furniture and heating.  It's probably better than whatever craphole you lived in before.\"  Pointedly she bats you with a finger and says, \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

As you consider her silhouette she begins tapping her foot, and the steady thud of her shoe on the carpet seems like a timer.  \"Get in there,\" she orders, \"or I'll find somewhere much less accommodating for you to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to risk angering her further you walk up the steps and pull the door open - surprisingly it even has a latching doorknob.  Once inside you close the door and have a look around.  To your right is a coat rack, complete with a wool overcoat which seems roughly your size.  In front of you it opens into a living room, fully equipped with a chair, couch, rug, and even a tiny TV, all scaled down to be usable for an inch-tall person.  The TV even looks like it's hooked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you forget your predicament and start walking around the house, marveling at how well it fits you.  When you look out a bay window you're suddenly reminded of your situation as the entirety of your view is Fulda's ankle.  You follow her leg all the way up as if you're just now seeing her for the first time.  \"Turn on the lights and head upstairs,\" she commands, \"I have a very important feature to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flick the switch at the base of the stairs, and to your astonishment the stairway comes awash in artificial light.  The stairs creak as you ascend, and at the top you're met with three open doors.  To your right you see what must be your new bedroom, and you quickly enter, switching the light on as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can properly survey your bedroom the lights go out and the ceiling is torn away.  A spotlight shines down on you, limiting your vision, and Fulda booms, \"The roof slides off so that I can check on you any time I want!  See, isn't that useful?\"  Fingertips enter the beam from the flashlight shining down on you, and begin their approach.</span></div></div>",

It's not that far to the floor, you tell yourself, and the carpet should provide enough cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the window you glance upward and see Fulda's outstretched fingers coming perilously close.  You take a deep breath and brace your hands in the window frame, then throw yourself forward.  As you fall you tuck your legs in, and you hit the soft carpet in a roll.  Immediately the flashlight shifts, keeping you in the center of the spotlight, and you know you're not out of the fire yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly you scan the nearby line of shoes, trying to pick out which ones would be the hardest for her to get to.

Curiously she doesn't make any attempt to grab you as you approach the discarded footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spotlight stays on you as you move, though Fulda continues to merely watch.  You reach a temporary haven underneath the arch of a high heeled shoe, and suddenly you hear a click and the circle of light disappears.  There's a brief rustling, and Fulda announces, \"Sure, I'll play your game bug.  I'll leave and turn the light on so that you can find a good place to hide.  In five minutes I'll come back and look for you.  Hide well.\"  The sound of the door closing echoes briefly, and then the whole closet is flooded with light.

Immediately you turn left and run for the back of her shoes, hoping to find some way to escape there.  Though her heels are firmly together you think you just might be able to force your way through!  Just when you're even with her monumental ankles you throw yourself into the air, aiming between her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land hard on the canvas, and manage to force your arms through the small gap while the rest of your body slams back into the rubber.  Frantically you start kicking at the soles' sides, trying to climb up, when you feel yourself being lifted from the ground.  With a look back you see the incline getting steeper - Fulda's standing on her toes!  While you dangle you try to dig your fingers into a crease or find a handhold, eventually finding yourself almost vertical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resolve to patiently wait to be let back down, though your white-knuckled grip weakens with exhaustion each passing second.  Your heart jumps as Fulda hops, momentarily disrupting your position.  When she lands the force dislodges your fingers, and you find yourself plummeting back down to the carpet.  Fortunately the fibers are soft and you're unharmed, but before you can get back up Fulda's set her heels down, trapping you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately you turn and run towards her toes, sure you can find some way out through them.  As you approach though Fulda begins rapidly lifting and setting her toes back down, the steady, booming rhythm making it apparent what will happen if you try to slide through them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right you spot a crease in the shoe from the incessant pounding, and you run to climb it.  Hurriedly you climb her instep and find yourself atop the shoe, standing among the laces on the undulating canvas.  You waste no time in making a mad dash for the toe, only to be stopped when a huge tanned fist slams down in front of you.  Before you can get away Fulda lifts up her heel, trapping you in this narrow passage.  She spreads her fingers, allowing them to advance towards you, while you can do nothing but wait and see what she does.</span></div></div>",

Her fingers pull back just as quickly, but before you can feel any relief she cocks her middle finger behind the tip of her thumb.  An auburn ponytail descends before you, and you glance up to see two piercing blue eyes focusing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you anticipate an immediate strike you're disappointed, and Fulda leaves you waiting.  Instead you find yourself being moved while she rotates her leg, pointing her toe inwards.  You find yourself nearly looking dead-on at her opposite ankle when you feel some rustling from the shoe you're on.  Quickly you spin, stepping away from the canvas wall, to see her lining up her fingertip with your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" she says, and releases her finger.  It swings along her shoe until it pulls up, striking you squarely in the stomach and lifting you off your feet.  You remain doubled-over on her fingertip until it's fully extended, at which point you fly off at what seems like a hundred miles an hour.  Fulda's ankle whizzes by as you gain altitude, and it's not long until you sail over your dollhouse and through the doorway out into Fulda's room.  Not far past that gravity reasserts itself, and you rapidly find yourself pulled back down to the carpet, landing on the soft fibers with enough force to keep you rolling another half foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a rest lying on your face with stars at the edge of your vision and gasping for breath.  With great effort you look up to see Fulda turn around and start slinking her way towards you, carefully putting one foot in one of the other as she approaches.  Frantically you try to push yourself up but your arms simply have no strength while you continue gasping for air.  Each step Fulda takes rumbles through the floor, giving you a sense of urgency, but still your arms won't work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo feet away Fulda slams her shoe down with enough force to cause some minor rattling from the shockwave.  Her shoe begins to bend again for her next step, and as she picks up her back leg it swings out wide in an exaggerated motion.  You do your best to muster what strength you have to get to your feet and run as the titanic Converse swings inward.</span></div></div>",

Shakily you push yourself up, trying to force yourself to your feet as your elbows weakly shake under your own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's foot slams down next to you, dropping you back to the floor as her stomp shakes your elbows.

She sets it down and digs into the carpet, then scoots it forward until the cold rubber touches your arm.  With a quick kick she flips you over, and she lets her shoe linger over you a moment before setting it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain lying on the ground looking up at Fulda's powerful legs as they converge hundreds of feet above you inside her relatively tiny shorts.  She places her hands on her waist and glowers down at you, then says, \"Look at you.  No fight left in you, too weak to stand up or even roll yourself over.  It's like you've lost all will to live.

You wiggle your body to test her grip and find that you can't even so much as budge your legs.

She sets them down side by side, then reaches into the refrigerator to retrieve other sandwich supplies - meat, cheese and condiments - all while maintaining her grip on you.  Her massive hand quickly assembles a pile of meat and cheese on one slice of bread while leaving the other one conspicuously barren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she puts the finishing touches on her meat mountain you find yourself being forced downward by Fulda's iron grip.  She sets you down in the middle of the empty bread slice and opens her fingers, dropping you onto the field of organic wheat bread below.  Before you can get up she pushes her index finger down on your back, pinning you in place.  Wide strings of a yellow, sticky substance begin crossing over you, and Fulda withdraws her finger as the morass of mustard encroaches over more of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to force your way free but the tangy veins of mustard aren't making it easy, and before you can make any serious progress Fulda picks up your slice of bread and turns it over, then slaps it onto the pile of meat so that you're on your back.  While you test how constrictive your new environment is you're lifted up between Fulda's enormous hands so that you and the sandwich you're in are held in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth wide just as you confirm that you barely have enough space to wiggle your fingers beneath the bread.  Slowly you feel yourself pulled towards her gigantic mouth, and her maw looms larger by the second.  You squeeze your eyes shut when you feel her breath on you, and feel a sharp jolt of movement followed by what must be her teeth sinking into her meal, but you don't feel like you're inside her mouth.  Cautiously you peek and see her lips wrapped around the sandwich beside you as she bites down on a section.  You watch her chew, then she viciously attacks the other side, going through the same pageantry as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda makes a show of eating the rest of the sandwich, cutting her teeth mere fractions of an inch from where you're pinned down, cutting an outline around you.  After each bite she pulls back so that you can watch her chew and swallow a load of food several times your size while you struggle to move more than just your arms from in between the bread and roast beef.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth darts past you and nips off one more block of food, the last hanging off the inch-long block she's carved around you.  She barely even chews it before swallowing, then finally meets your gaze.  Fulda squares the morsel you're in with her mouth, then asks, \"Did you manage to find some motivation?\"  Her gigantic mouth inches forward and her hand repositions itself to catapult you inside while you struggle to get free.  \"Last chance.\"</span></div></div>",

Her teeth smash together and grind on each other, creating a horrendous noise like you never thought you'd hear just as you bump up against a big, soft, slimy tentacle - Fulda's tongue.  This would complicate your escape greatly.  You had hoped to end up outside her teeth so that you could just walk along her cheek, but as you could still hear the racket of her chewing you realize that it could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's tongue circles above you, collecting the mashed up remains of her meal.  You run forward along the inside of her gums, brushing off a sopping wet crumb that landed on your shoulder, until you reach the back of her incisors.  While her tongue is lifted you crouch down for refuge, and as she tilts her head back you grab onto the back of her gums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a rush of saliva that threatens to take you away with the torrent and a sucking sound as her throat muscles contract, but your grip holds firm.  Her tongue comes back to rest, laying loosely on top of you as the soft tip quivers.  Light floods into Fulda's mouth as she slightly parts her lips, letting you see the pink interior and mashed sandwich remains, but before you can make your move a torrent of water begins flowing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of her tongue spreads, holding you in place while the water rushes in.  Every second, like the tick of a metronome, her tongue flicks up, allowing water to gush over you as she swallows.  Again you hold on for dear life, clinging to the base of her incisor now as water floods the interior of her mouth and her throat creates a ricked riptide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue relaxes and darkness returns as her lips close once more, and you know you have to move soon.  Fulda's tongue jabs into the gums next to you, searching for stray food, and you decide to get out before it pins you against her teeth.  You spring into action, pushing off the soft matter under her tongue and vaulting between her teeth.  You land in a crouch outside her teeth and jump forward, using her gums as a springboard, forcing yourself out of her mouth and back into the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass through you grab onto her bottom lip, allowing yourself to swing down and dangle in front of her chin.  Air from her nose blasts you as you hang off her lip, swaying back and forth.  The light dims considerably as a shadow covers you, and with a glance you see her hand racing towards you.

You timidly look around the model city, standing on your toes to see above Fulda's shoes, wondering what exactly her game is.  You're so caught up the only thing that breaks you out of your confused state is a hard bump on your back as Fulda guides her shoe into it, followed by a push as she sends you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you waiting for an engraved invitation?\" Fulda asks.  \"Hurry up and get out there, I don't have all day.\"  You look over your shoulder at her mammoth shoes menacing you and take off down the street.  As soon as you've taken a few steps Fulda lifts up her leg and steps over you, her tremendous stride putting her foot down a block away.  She's careful not to step on any of the small cars on either side of her foot, as they would easily be smashed under her foot nearly twice their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Fulda walk off into the distance, the rumbling from her footsteps getting duller as she progresses through the streets as though she's on a balance beam.  It occurs to you that she's not really paying attention to you, and this may be your chance to go off on your own.  On the other hand it seems like if you do what she says she's fairly amenable, and may actually be pleasant if you help her out with this.  When you glance up you see her standing between two skyscrapers, and realize what you have to do.</span></div></div>",

It's going to take you a while to make it there on foot, you realize, but as long as she stands out against the skyline you'll have a marker to head towards.  Since this is the first break you've gotten in a while you set a moderate pace, hoping to rest a bit from Fulda's constant threats of crushing or eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the first intersection you realize that following in her tracks will be exceedingly easy.  From one side of the road to the other, and from the last house to the next, stretches an enormous shoe print indented into the road about a quarter inch.  You hop down into the footprint at the heel and walk forward, being careful to maintain your footing in the indentation of her tread.  Each diamond-shaped pattern pressed into the road presents a new challenge for you to navigate as you cross Fulda's enormous shoe print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the end you hoist one leg over the ledge and pull yourself up.  You pass through five such footprints, going a bit faster each time as you get used to the uneven surfaces, before you come to a much larger intersection.  There's no footprint directly ahead of you, but you look to your left and see the trail continues that way, now with a more natural gait as the street expands to a boulevard.  At the same time Fulda bellows \"Hurry it up, pipsqueak, I don't have all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the direction of her voice and see her crouched down between two tall buildings, butt resting on her heels as she impatiently glares at you while holding a pair of fine tools in her hands.  After a second she turns away and resumes work touching up the facade on the building before her.  Heeding her demand you pick up the pace, walking swiftly in a gentle slalom between indentations from her shoes.  As you walk you glance side to side through the storefront windows, each seemingly fully stocked with goods - the level of detail so meticulous it's almost like Fulda shrank a whole city and put it in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of weaving between her footprints you come to a long bridge with the ground under it painted blue.  Surprisingly it shows no significant wear despite her having just walked across it: Only the slight indentations from her steps that you're used to seeing.  As you cross you watch Fulda stand to a crouching position, still intently focused on the facade.  While she works she taps her foot lightly, sending rhythmic tremors through the bridge you're walking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes ten minutes of walking but you finally make it across the bridge, a mere block away from Fulda.  You hurry to her, running through her footprints as necessary, until you're standing by the toe of her Converse.  When you look up at her you see she's still absorbed by her work, and absent any way to effectively contact her you simply standby.  Several more minutes pass while you watch her work, trying not to feel nervous about being this close to her unaware.  Finally she puts her hands to her sides, looks down, and notices you're there.</span></div></div>",

It staggers you to a knee, and you nearly bash your head against the rubber-tipped toe of her shoe.  You grab a ridge and pull yourself to your feet, then look up her monumental legs to see her pointing at something just behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you turn your head and see a small red tool box stocked with instruments perfect for someone your size.  Unfortunately you were never that handy with tools and you wouldn't even know where to begin using them in this miniature city.  You begin to tell Fulda as much, but she scoffs and interrupts you, saying, \"You think I'd trust someone puny like you with this?  I was pointing at the door.\"  To emphasize her point she slides her foot forward and steps on the tool box, smashing it flat with a screech of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to isk the same fate you turn away from the enormous Converse and go to the building, the door opening with surprising ease.  \"Go to the top,\" Fulda commands, her voice resonating inside the building lobby.  Immediately you see an elevator and call it, causing the door to slide open at once.  You step inside and press for the top floor, surprised to find each button has its own articulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride up is quick and complete with a ding when the elevator stops.  As soon as you step out, almost as if it were timed, the building shudders as the wall in front of you slides away.  Fulda pulls the panel clear and leans it against the building then squares up with it again, your vantage point letting you see the cleavage revealed by her tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo thuds, accompanied by a trickle of particulate, sound from the ceiling when Fulda slams her hands onto the roof, her breasts pouring into the narrow opening.  As soon as it happened she pulls away again, the top of her face filling the view now.  Her sky blue eyes stand out against her tan skin in the darkened building, and she says, \"Looks like you made it, so I guess it works.  You finally caught a break.\"  She continues to look at you impassively.  You shuffle your feet, uneasily waiting to find out what's next.</span></div></div>",

She plunges it into the open building, fingers outstretched as her open palm glides closer toward you.  With nowhere to run you simply stand there, waiting for her to pluck you up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palm stops inches from your body, the wall of soft, wrinkled flesh topped by hard callouses just below her fingers.  She readies her fingers to strike, bumping one against the ceiling in the confined corridor, and sends her thumb around your side.  In a practiced motion Fulda clamps her thumb and forefinger onto the back of your shirt, then lifts you up by it.  With your feet off the floor all your weight is being held up by your shirt pressing into your armpits, a very uncomfortable position as your shirt rides up with her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly Fulda pulls you out of the building, letting you swing by your shirt as you come to a stop.  She stands up to her full height and leaves you just above chest level, dangling above her cleavage while she considers what to do with you now.  After a moment she decides, and almost cautiously begins lifting you up to her left shoulder - it seems that, for now, she's at least satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoes dimple the smooth skin on her broad, tanned shoulders, the warmth from her bare flesh keeping you comfortable.  You turn and see Fulda looking at you as she sets you down, then turns away as she withdraws her hand.  Across the cotton strap of her tank top you look up at her ear, unadorned except by a small hole in the lobe.  Now that you're not immediately worried for your life and have close access to her ear you realize something - you're starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Fulda,\" you begin when your stomach growls, \"I haven't eaten since you shrank me, I don't suppose you could give me some food?\"  Fulda turns her head, placing her pink glossed lips mere inches from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" she asks.  \"I just gave you a huge sandwich, and you didn't even eat any of it!  You've barely done any work anyway, how can you possibly be hungry?\"  You remain silent, worried you've done something wrong.  She sighs, nearly blowing you off your perch as her warm breath buffets you.</span></div></div>",

There's nothing you can do about it now though, and at least it sounds like you'll finally get to eat.  She turns her well-chiseled face forward, and you settle in for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Fulda's first step you're thrown off balance, your feet shifting within the dimples they've made in her supple skin.  While you struggle to regain your balance you look over the crest of her shoulder at the miniature city below, getting a touch of vertigo from feeling hundreds of feet up.  You manage to grab the edge of her tank top strap to secure yourself, then ease into a sitting position, letting your legs rest on the gentle slope of Fulda's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sway with the rhythm of Fulda's steps, never loosening your grip on the fibers of her shirt.  In order to avoid vertigo you do your best to focus on anything but looking down, shifting your glance between her lips and ear while she indifferently looks down, doing her best not to step on anything.  Before you know it she's reached the door, and you lean with her movement as she pulls it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gentle ride continues as she walks down the long carpeted hallway, and you allow yourself to relax a bit. As soon as Fulda hits the stairs though you're jolted back to high alert, seizing some fibers of her top in a white-knuckled grip when the shocks from her steps hit you.  You bounce with each thud of her feet on a step, sliding around on her smooth, bare shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackhammer-like shocks stop, and you're treated to the only moderately uncomfortable shaking accompanied by the crack of her shoes slapping on tile.  You recognize the kitchen when Fulda walks into it, and she follows a familiar path to the refrigerator.  Her hand grabs a bowl full of green leaves and assorted vegetables, and in a single motion places it on the counter and slams the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can appreciate the size of the salad Fulda's hand appears in front of you, blocking your view as two fingers pin your arms to your sides.  You're lifted from your perch and held above the bowl momentarily before the fingers release you, allowing you to drop into a bed of spinach.  \"You've got five minutes,\" she declares, \"then you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assess the salad into which you've been dropped.  Leaves of dark green spinach comprise the bulk of it, with carrot shreds longer than your arm interspersed throughout along with some slices of tomato as well as some cherry tomatoes larger than you.  Immediately you seize a branch of carrot in both hands and try to shove one end into your mouth, but find it too large - instead you settle for nibbling at the sides, your tiny jaw muscles going into overdrive to even pierce the hard orange surface.  So engrossed are you with trying to eat you barely even notice Fulda fidgeting with an item in her hand.</span></div></div>",

Your feet slip along the dark green leaves, making you trip over a stem and fall face first into the bed of spinach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get up Fulda stabs downward, her fork piercing the salad just in front of you.  When she withdraws her food you're lifted up as well, but luckily slide off the leaf she's snagged and land on your back in the greens again.  You watch her cavernous mouth open to receive the fork load of food which easily disappears behind her lips.  Loud crunches reach you while she chews, and you force yourself back to your feet to avoid the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back up you begin running again, and Fulda holds her fork over you like a Sword of Damocles.  You barely get up to speed before she brings it down again, piercing a cherry tomato in front of you and splashing you with its juices.  Quickly you hop back before she pulls it out, and you watch the hill of vegetation be pulled toward her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to get some cover you jump into the hole left behind, your fall thankfully cushioned by the soft leaves.  You spread some of the spinach in the walls apart and climb into it, crawling through the porous spaces within the salad.  The darkness around reassures you that you are, for the moment, unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of your clever ruse you feel a nudge on your back as the leaves are shoved away, and you see Fulda above you brushing them away with her fork.  She smirks and says, \"Nice try,\" as she blocks the path behind you, leaving you trapped in the small clearing around you.  Fulda slightly rears back with the fork then plunges it down, and you close your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Your ankle is trapped under her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically you thrash to get free, but no matter how hard you try there's no getting free.

Her hand draws you slowly toward her mouth, the giantess hoping to build tension as you draw ever closer.  An enormous pink tongue slides out, wetting her lips in anticipation of your arrival.  Throughout all this you never stop trying to get free, but fail to make any headway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're a mere few inches away Fulda parts her lips, revealing to you the gaping maw from which you had so recently escaped.  \"Fulda, please!\" you beg.  \"I thought we had an understanding!\"  If she hears your pleas she shows no sign, and you're drawn closer to your doom.

Her knees bend and torso begins to lean over, and you instinctively turn and run from the giantess descending towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you the street is deserted, as one would expect of a model, toy-sized city like this, filled only by non-functional cars and the slight indentations from Fulda's shoes.  In mere moments you feel a heavy object slam into your back, followed by a set of very large fingers wrapping around you.  You're plunged into darkness as Fulda snatches you up with a swipe, though you know you're being lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her fingers peel away she maintains her grip with a pinch on the back of your shirt, allowing you to dangle helplessly in front of her.  \"I don't want you nipping at my heels,\" Fulda says, her cold eyes impassive.  \"I want you to look around.

Fulda clasps a hand around the inflated bag and draws it across her body, allowing it to rest on her side a moment, with you sliding along from the movement.  Suddenly her hand shoots forward, throwing the bag in the same manner she would a frisbee, making it rotate rapidly.  Centripetal force throws you against the wall while you fly above the city, and you try not to throw up from dizziness during your descent.</span></div></div>",

Air rushes past you as she inhales while you plant your hands against the crust and push as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first progress is slow, with tiny amounts of progress for each push.  As you push though momentum builds, and when your torso's free you know you're almost out.  A huge gust of air hits you when Fulda sighs, coinciding exactly with when your legs finally slip free.  With nothing left to hold you in place you plummet down, falling the entire length of Fulda's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile falling you watch her push the tiny bit of sandwich you were on into her mouth followed by a satisfied smirk.  Before you can dwell on your close call you land on Fulda's hard thigh with your mustard-covered body making such a slapping sound there's no way she didn't hear it.  Sure enough she looks down with an expression of surprise, still chewing her food.  She quickly dusts off her hands, swallows, and booms, \"What's that on my leg?  Is that a little crumb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thumb and forefinger close around you, lifting you out of your small pool of mustard on her smooth thigh.  Fulda's face looms ever larger as you get closer, and her excitement grows until she has you dangling just six inches from her face.  \"Yes, just an itsy-bitsy teensy-tiny crumb, must've fallen out of my mouth.  No problem, no one has to know what a mess I made.\"  She looks at you playfully and begins moving you toward her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap Fulda!\" you shout.  \"I got out, you know I want to live, you know I'm not a crumb and I'm not even as small as one so just put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression becomes much more serious.  \"You could <i>easily</i> be that size you know,\" she says, continuing to move you toward her mouth.  \"Besides, I'm not convinced.  You just yelled at someone thousands of times your size, that doesn't sound like someone who wants to live to me.\"  A cruel joviality returns to her voice as she adds, \"Maybe if you begged me not to I'd reconsider it though.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you beg?</span></div></div>",

However, she continues to hold you right in the middle of her mouth, so you decide to keep begging.  \"Please don't eat me or crush me!\" you plead.  \"I know I'm so tiny you could smash me with your little finger accidentally, but I want to live my tiny life as long as you'll let me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda begins moving you away from her mouth, and you realize she had you just under the tip of her nose this time.  \"Your voice is funny,\" she responds, her voice - amplified by proximity and sheer size - rattling your bones.  \"And I guess if you want to keep living your pathetic life under my thumb I can let you for a bit longer.  No promises though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh with relief as she begins lowering you away from her face, finally reaching a point where it no longer dominates your entire view.  She sets you in the palm of her other hand and looks down at you coldly, then prods you with a battering ram finger.  \"You're still covered in mustard and weird meat juice,\" she says, \"so you'll have to get cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers snap shut over you, pinning you in her hand and covering you in darkness.  Your stomach nearly jumps to your mouth as she drops her hand to her side, and the constant swinging as she walks does nothing to ease your nausea.  Distant thudding, muffled by all the flesh surrounding you, reaches your ears as she ascends the stairs, and the loud click of a doorknob being turned signifies your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few seconds more Fulda opens her fingers, exposing you to a white light that burns your eyes.  From your vantage point you see a toilet to the side and a shower behind Fulda, and though the view is obscured you'd bet you're being held over a sink.  You turn to try to see what you look like in her hand, but her fingers block your view of the mirror.  The sound of running water starts, and Fulda begins lowering the hand you're in towards it to clean you in some way.</span></div></div>",

You turn to see a waterfall pouring out of a huge silver faucet, the vast torrent immediately running down the drain after it hits the bottom.  You're carried into the porcelain fixture finally, and continue riding the massive palm into the downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water breaks on Fulda's middle finger first, dissipating harmlessly into rivulets and running down the sides to drip into the sink.  As she pushes further and further in though small streams break off and run down her palm, pooling around your feet.  The intensity increases the closer you get, until you're about waist-deep in lukewarm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Fulda gets you directly under the tap.  Directly being hit by water is vastly different from standing in it, and the force from the faucet staggers you to a knee.  Fulda holds you under it, letting you be pushed down by the water until you can barely stay on just one knee.  She moves you around a little bit, making sure every bit of you gets cleaned, and you realize that you're short of breath.  You face down and try to breathe in, but the air is thick with water, and even though you're breathing well enough you feel like you're going to drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think you can't hold out any longer Fulda moves her hand a bit, taking you out of the direct stream.  Immediately you take some deep gasps of pure air, free from the constant rushing of water.  Fulda quickly moves you back in though, and the feeling as though you're going to drown returns.  After the second stint you realize that you're being waterboarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda does this to you three more times, no doubt feeling an evil mirth as you're tormented, before withdrawing her hand from the sink.  She straightens her hand, allowing the water to dissipate and roll off her hand while you kneel in the middle, sputtering for air.  As soon as her hand's clear of the sink she tips her hand over, dumping you roughly onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you can fully open your eyes you see Fulda drying off her hand with a towel.  When she's done she tears off a square of toilet paper and hands it to you, and you use it to do your best to dry off.  You're able to get your face and hands dry, but your clothes remain sopping wet whenever Fulda takes your makeshift towel and throws it in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda looks down at you, and you look up at her, no doubt a pitiful sight as you shiver from the cold.  Suddenly her hand raises and two fingers wrap around your arms and torso, pinning you in place while she carries you off to what she has planned for the night.</span></div></div>",

She turns you over several times, inspecting what's exposed of your tiny body as large drops of water fly out from your hair.  Apparently she's satisfied by what she sees, and lowers you down to her side as she walks out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride is short but uncomfortable.  With each step Fulda's long arm swings like a great pendulum, covering so much distance you're sure she's exaggerating it.  G-forces strain your body as you're thrust back and forth, and your view constantly changes in a great whirl with you unable to focus on any single thing in the distance.  Each time you rush past Fulda's thigh you think about how, were she to accidentally bump her hand into it, you'd be dashed to pieces against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ride ends above a large table with what seems to be a small group of tiny buildings and construction materials on it, much like the house Fulda has for you in the closet.  She drops you from a great height of two inches onto the table in the middle of the street so that you stumble on landing, then smirks.  To your right is a mostly finished building, and on your left there's a pile of wood panels, glue, and an exacto-knife that could cut you in half.  Luckily for you Fulda doesn't even seem to consider that, and leaves you alone on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge strides take her to the closet, into which she momentarily disappears.  She quickly comes back out holding a simple black dress and lays it on her bed, then bends down to pick up a pair of enormous six inch high heels and sets them aside for later.  Briefly she reaches into a drawer to pull out a pair of skin colored nylon stockings which she tosses on top of her dress, then she walks back over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a lucky little bug,\" she says as she leans on the table, her arms out to either side of you.  She leans over you as you crane your neck up at her and continues, \"You get to go to a Gamma Tau Sigma party free of charge, brought in by the president herself.  I just hope you don't have too much trouble joining in from...</span></div></div>",

It happens so fast you can't even duck under her truck-sized hand as it overwhelms you, her palm knocking you off balance and her fingers snapping shut to trap you inside her hand.  Momentum carries her hand forward, and in under a second you're yanked free of the table, though you can't see anything aside from slivers of light on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn two bounding steps Fulda carries you to where she wants you to be, and you feel a nervous anticipation while you're not being moved.  Once you begin ascending it's similar to the trepidation when a roller coaster is going up the first hill, and you know that the ride is going to be less fun.  When the ascent stops Fulda turns her hand sideways, and you brace yourself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's fingers lift away and you look to see where you'll be falling.  Her other hand has spread out the opening on what appears to be a long nylon sock, and you're being dropped right in the middle.  You desperately try to grab onto Fulda's hand and stop yourself from falling, but by the time everything registers you've fallen far past it.  Everything takes on a peach colored tinge as you fall into the stocking, and when you look up all you can see is her triumphant face.  At the bottom you land where her heel will go and continue rolling down the woven surface until you come to rest in the very bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another slight falling sensation as Fulda sets her stockings down on the bed, with the leg you're in hanging off the side.  You sway back and forth slightly before it comes to a rest, and you consider any possible way out.  There's certainly nothing you have that can cut through these fibers, and the climb out would be mostly vertical and take hours.  Realizing you're out of options you resign yourself to just watching Fulda change, despite the difficulty of seeing through the loose, wrinkled fabric that gives everything a skin colored tone and makes everything look foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the difficulty seeing you know when she reaches over you to grab her dress.  You do your best to follow her movements, despite the poor visibility and perspective from below her knees.  She slides it on easily then zips it up, and reaches back onto the bed.  There's a thump as her heels are pushed out, then she sits down on the bed.  Gingerly she picks up the stockings you're in and readies herself to slide them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're steadily pulled upward as Fulda pulls the stockings onto her legs, any possible exit you may have had now blocked.  Five humongous toes pierce the fabric above you, the largest of which is right on course for you.  As they slide ever closer you try to think of the best way to mitigate this.  Just as you're about to be overrun by her big toe you realize that if you survive this you'll be sucking on her toe all night and quickly turn over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's toe strikes you in the back and you think this may not have been the best decision as your spine curves to her toe's shape.  She twitches her toes a couple times, securing the stockings on her foot and shoving you further into the nylon.  When she's satisfied the fabric is pulled so tightly around you that you're effectively immobile, cocooned in by nylon and her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're secure Fulda tilts her foot down and begins lowering it into her size 15 heel.  The foggy look the stocking gives everything makes this surreal and dream-like, as if the idea of being shrunk down and dropped into a stocking wasn't fantastical enough.  When her toe slides into the shoe you're cast into darkness, unable to turn your head even if you could see past her foot.  When you come to a rest inside the shoe's toe Fulda twiddles her toes again, wracking your body with agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you're simply kept there while Fulda puts on her other stocking and shoe, waiting in the dark for something to happen.  Finally she stands up, putting her weight onto her toes, and you wish she had stayed seated.  Though it's subtle her toe pushes into your back further, causing pain to shoot through you.  You're swung up and down as Fulda gets a feel for the shoes, and each time the sole touches the ground it feels as if you're about to be squeezed apart.  Luckily she's satisfied with the fit before then, and you survive to feel her take her first step.</span></div></div>",

Every step Fulda takes, though she favors the leg where you're riding, subjects you to dizzying G-forces when her toes swing back down.  You do what you can to get into a more comfortable position, but between Fulda's massive foot in your back and the stocking at your front you really have nowhere you can move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Fulda reaches the stairs the rhythm of her step has become familiar to you.  First her toe jams against your back, pressing you slightly forward into the nylon mesh, then she lifts her foot and your stomach feels like it drops.  When she lifts her toes your stomach flies the opposite direction, and you get momentary vertigo from the blood rushing out of your head.  Her heel sets down, slamming you back onto her toe before she swings her foot down, accompanied by a resonating thump and blood rushing back to your head as well as another jolt of pain in your back.  Then it begins again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you aren't dashed apart against her toes when she's descending the stairs tells you that she's being careful with you, making sure that her toes never fully set down on a step.  You're aware however that just one misstep would be your doom, and if she stubbed her toe you would barely hear the impact before being squished.  This particular danger passes however when she reaches the bottom, and a whole new danger presents itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fulda arrives the party is in full swing, with loud music blasting throughout the area and all of her sorority sisters present, drinks in hand and making idle chat.  The bass makes it so you don't get any reprieve from your insides being shaken even between steps, though Fulda's shoe protects your ears from the music's volume.  You endure a dozen more steps in quick succession while Fulda goes to get a drink, then glorious stillness when she finds a spot, the only discomfort coming from the music.  Knowing her, however, your reprieve will be quite short lived.</span></div></div>",

In a way knowing what's coming makes each agonizing step easier to endure, since you know when the worst is over and she's finally moving her other foot.  That's not to say that it's any less painful now, just one more thing you've come to endure.  Luckily you don't have to deal with it nearly as long this time, and you enter the calm before the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda takes her drink and heads over to where her sisters are dancing with the special guests.  She takes extra care that no one steps on her toe, not wanting to end the night for her captive just yet.  Looking over the crowd she finds a timid man dancing by himself, exceptionally short and wiry.  He looks to be about the size of the twerp who ran into her this morning, maybe a little smaller than he was.  The perfect target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deliberately bumps into him, planting his face into her abs.  He looks up at this mountain of a woman and steps back so that he can see around her breasts.  \"What's up, small fry?\" she asks.  You find that despite her shoes muffling everything else around her you're able to hear her perfectly, her body carrying the vibrations of her voice down to you.  While the man stammers for an answer Fulda interjects, \"Yes, I know, me, I'm fucking tall.  Let's dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head whirls as Fulda spins around, turning to face away from her dance partner.  Before you can recover your orientation your back rings out in agony, her toe digging deep into it.  The nylon around you pulls tighter, pinning your arms against her toe in a crucifixion position from her leaning forward.  This new degree of pain pulses with the bass as Fulda shifts her weight minutely with the beat.  As if that weren't enough her toe wiggles up and down, running the length of your body and spreading pain all around while she subtly taps her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer Fulda turns around from her new partner and rams her ass against her chest, grinding it against him.  She goes back and forth, firmly jostling him with her buttocks but careful not to knock him over.  \"Well fucking do something!\" she shouts over the din of the music.  \"Grab my ass, jump on for a ride, something!\"  The man continues to just stand there, bewildered by what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure intensifies and pain wracks your body as Fulda leans forward even more.  As if that weren't enough the activity and heat has a tangible effect, and she begins sweating.  Beads of warm salty liquid run down her body and get absorbed by her stockings until they're saturated.  Already near capacity from the sweat on her legs the droplets begin dripping down and pooling in her shoes.  You gasp for breath and nearly choke, the smell and humidity too much for you.  It's all you can do to keep that air in your lungs, no matter how foul it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you reach your breaking point the pressure on you lessens; Fulda is leaning so far forward she's on her hands.  That's not to say it's easy, and you expect each thump of the bass to bring yet another staccato pulse of pain with it.  Over time the smell gets worse, Fulda's foot odor mingling with the sweat that pervades the air inside her shoe.  You limit yourself to short, gasping breaths between beats, trying to brace yourself without gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll make it easy for you!\" Fulda shouts, and begins bending her knees.  Her squats pay dividends when she gets low enough to line up her butt with her partner's crotch, grinding it back and forth still.  \"What, do you not find me attractive?\"  She leans forward and plants her hands on the ground, now pushing with enough force to drive him back.  Still he stands there, looking more worried than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over your body pain builds again, starting much stronger this time.  You grit your teeth, taking shallow breaths through your nose as Fulda's toe spreads your shoulder blades and shoves you toward the point of her shoe.  The harder she pushes the worse the nylon feels against your skin, and you worry that your body will break before even one thread tears.  Just when you think you can't take anymore the pain relents, returning to ambient, but still significant, levels.  For a last slap Fulda spins around on her heels again, disorienting you as you're swung with the greatest amount of torque possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda groans with impatience at her partner's lack of enthusiasm, and she pushes herself back up to her full height.  He takes a step back, allowing Fulda enough room to spin her enormous feet around and confront him.  She looks down at him and he sheepishly looks up to make eye contact.  \"Okay dude, seriously, what's the deal?  Are you scared of me?  Do I intimidate you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it would help if I took my heels off?  Make myself not quite so gigantic in comparison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\"  Fulda eyes the man carefully while he looks side to side, hoping to find some way around her and out of this.  However, as usual Fulda is in control, and considers that she might not need to tower over him quite so much.</span></div></div>",

First she frees her right, then her left, and gently slides them over to the left side. When she steps down from her extra six inches the bottom of her breasts bounce off the top of the man's head, rustling his hair and making him blush.  \"There.  Still intimidated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were worried that you're going to choke on Fulda's foot sweat the tables turn in your favor.  Small amounts of light creep into the shoe as Fulda withdraws her foot, taking you along with it.  Fresh air cycles in, and you allow yourself a few normal breaths to test it out without being nauseated.  Sounds rush from all around to assault your ears, the menacing bass meet with overpowering treble and resonate throughout your now-sensitive ear canal.  Not just that but you hear scores of voices, each indistinguishable in the din, but they all seem to be enjoying the party atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets her foot down on the carpet, and you revel in the relatively cool air.  Your eyes take time to adjust to the low light after absolute darkness, but when they do you become awestruck.  Around you are dozens of titanesses, each hundreds of times your size, moving about and gyrating on their partners.  The ground resonates not only from the music but the impacts of each of their steps, and you realize that one misstep for any of them would immediately spell your doom.  Incredulously you're glad to be stuck inside Fulda's stocking: you wouldn't last a second on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Fulda, as towering as ever, tinged pink through the fabric of her own clothing.  Across from her stands a man much shorter than she is, who looks like he can't decide whether to run and hide or play dead.  The look on Fulda's face shows that she is not in any way amused by him, and she seems to be waiting for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clock chimes, the sound ringing throughout the entire house.  All of the titanesses including Fulda cheer, and their cheers are quickly joined by screams of fear that raise in pitch; in just a few moments, the screaming has entirely died away, and the cheering intensifies.  You had been stunned by the giantesses earlier, but if you hadn't seen this there's no way you'd believe it: the man Fulda had been towering over rapidly dwindled away before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes snap back to the floor before you where you see the same man, no more than an inch tall.  He looks up at Fulda, mouth agape, no doubt in shock at what just happened if he can even believe it.  A wave of thuds shakes the floor, followed by more cheering from some of the women after they stomp on their shrunken man.  Fulda, to her credit, only spreads her feet and places her hands on her hips in a menacing fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\"  you shout to him.  \"She'll crush you, all of them will!  Go hide while you can!\"  The man either does not hear you, or is unable to act on your words and move.  He stands transfixed, staring upwards in awe at Fulda, not fully processing what's happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about now?\" she booms down at her new shrinkee.  \"Are you scared of me?  Do I intimidate you?  Should I make myself more gigantic in comparison?\"  She smiles sadistically at him while he only stares up dumbfounded.  \"Well?  Say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man remains frozen, clearly terrified and confused by this turn of events.  Fulda taps her other foot impatiently, the shockwaves resonating through the floor and seemingly draw the man out of his reverie.  All at once he throws himself to the ground and starts begging through tears, \"Oh my God please don't kill me I don't even know what I did please let me live please!\"  She remains silent while considering his pleas, the only sound the steady thump from her foot.</span></div></div>",

You watch her hand descend while she bends down, her target not even trying to move out of the way.  Whether he's given himself up to his fate or can't even comprehend what to do you can't tell, but when he disappears inside Fulda's hand his sniveling stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands back up once she's secured her quarry and starts walking over to a small group of women.  Compared to earlier Fulda's long strides are amazing and comfortable.  No longer is her big toe threatening to split you in two, and now she gently sets her foot down instead of needing to slam it on the ground.  Her stockings, formerly a harsh mesh that you were forced against, now comfortably hold you aloft, stretched tight enough to keep you from sliding down but loose enough you have some motion.  Were it not for the persistent sweat, you might actually enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ride is fairly short, and Fulda stops outside the ring of women, which quickly expands to allow her in.  From ground level it's difficult to make out the details of what's happening, or what's gathered this crowd.  In front of you is an unremarkable brown leather ottoman, and on either side is a pair of enormous shoes, their owners leaning over the platform above.  Whatever is happening, they certainly seem excited about it; screams such as \"Get him!\"  \"Stand back up you wuss!\" reach you even on the floor, punctuated by the occasional slam of someone's hand on the leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women clear a path for her, and Fulda makes it to a chair overlooking whatever this event is.  She kicks her feet up, her long legs stretching well onto the footrest, allowing you to finally see what's going on.  There are six women total here, all of them yelling furiously, drinking deep from red Solo cups, or slamming their hands down with a loud pop.  You look down and see a small man roll backwards into the divot created by Fulda's feet resting there, pursued by another wielding a sewing needle as a spear.  All the women shout in excitement, and you realize that this is an arena for shrunken men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pitched slightly into the air as Fulda lifts up her feet, then you quickly drop back down, bouncing several times before Fulda's feet come to rest.  Half the women keep cheering while the others curse in anger, and with a quick glance down you see only one man standing, looking up in shock a half inch from Fulda's heel.  He drops his improvised weapon and backs away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin brunette reaches out and claims her fighter while all the other women take a shot.  They've made a drinking game out of tiny person blood sport!  Once they've all slammed their shot glasses back down and refocused on the sport, the victorious brunette looks to Fulda.  \"You always bring something fun, you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda twitches her toe, wiggling you back and forth.  \"I actually brought two this semester,\" she begins, \"and I'd like to start out with...\"</span></div></div>",

After keeping you inside her shoe and grinding her toe into you for past hour, does Fulda really think you're in any condition to stand on your own, let alone fight?  Your arms remain pinned against her foot by her stocking, keeping you from struggling to escape your new predicament.  Even if you could, you realize that there's nowhere you could go that isn't contained within her nylon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lifts up her foot and points her toe downward, facing you toward the floor.  The netting around you begins to loosen, losing a little bit of tautness each time she rolls her stocking down a bit more.  Soon you drop away from her toe entirely, landing in a loose end dangling from the tip of her foot.  Little by little the reservoir gets larger until the whole thing is pulled off her foot, finally freeing you from your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have any time to execute any escape plan; Fulda's watchful eyes land on you the instant she pulls her foot away.  Before you can even stand up her fingers have cinched around your waist, lifting you out of the tube and into the air.  She briefly inspects you to make sure nothing's broken then, apparently satisfied, places you above the middle of the ottoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight grip around you releases, and you drop an inch to land softly atop the leather.  Fulda withdraws her hand to resheath her leg, and you take a moment to observe your surroundings.  On every side you're surrounded by women who would have towered over you normally, but now are positively enormous.  One blond points down at you while whispering in her raven haired friend's ear, then they both start giggling, the latter slamming a fist into her own palm.  It's clear they will only be satisfied by blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive tanned hand sets down beside you and quickly withdraws, and you turn to see Fulda looking down at you impassively.  While turning your attention back forward you notice she left you a circle of cardboard and a long metal splinter.  Apparently these are to be your sword and shield.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin brunette lowers her hand in front of you then opens her fingers, dropping her chosen down for another fight.  He clutches his sewing needle tightly while looking absolutely terrified at the prospect of another fight, and you pick up your weapons.  All the women lean forward, blocking out the light above you and making you feel as though you could just wither away now.  After a tense moment the black haired woman to your side leans in, placing her mouth between you and your opponent, and bellows \"Fight!\"</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly he levels his needle point toward you so you raise your shield, waiting for him to make the first move.  Both of you stand in a temporary stalemate, neither willing to take the risk of being too aggressive off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour audience, however, doesn't really care about whatever strategy you would like to employ.  A massive hand reaches in from the audience and slams you in the back with a manicured, log-sized finger, pitching you forward toward your opponent.  You manage to raise your shield in time to keep yourself from getting impaled, then turn to face him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin circling around him while he nervously clutches his makeshift spear, likely still shell-shocked by the last fight.  With a couple quick jabs you probe his defenses, and find that he only blocks them mechanically and with the minimum amount of effort.  Emboldened by his apathy you strike fast, hitting him with a shield bash to knock him off balance and move for a slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your strike connects you feel a sharp tug on your collar and you're rapidly pulled away, leaving you to swing at empty air above his head.  The fingers that grabbed you maintain their hold, making you dangle helplessly above your opponent.  He makes a half-hearted jab upward at you, easily deflected by a kick, then the giantess lets go, dropping you back onto the leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses let out an excited cheer, causing a bustling cacophony to assault you while you roll to the side, narrowly avoiding another strike.  You reorient yourself for another attack when you notice a new shadow centered around you.  With a dive forward you escape a fist slamming down, but the sound of five pale digits balled up slapping on the leather leaves no doubt what would have happened had you remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get serious!\" Fulda yells at you in what you can only guess is an attempt to encourage you.  \"My reputation's on the line here!\"  It was unreasonable to hope she wanted you to win out of concern for you life, it seems, but you square up against your opponent anyway.  Just as before he seems unwilling to actually fight, and only wants to keep you at bay.  Behind him you notice two giantesses, the same pair that had been giggling before the fight, lean in expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move quickly, hoping to finish this before they get a chance to interfere.  Resolutely you raise your shield and charge in, purposefully catching the needle's tip with your shield, then swiftly deliver a kick to his sternum, knocking him backwards.  He catches before getting too far though, anchored by your shield, and you move to finish him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can strike the blond reaches in, her fingers placed precisely to form an impenetrable wall.  With a flick of her wrist she rams a finger into your chest, flipping you backwards as she raises her hand and dragging your opponent to the ground with you.  There's a thundering clap of skin on leather, and two long, pale fingers stretch out on either side of you, your head resting just beneath the webbing between her fingers.  She shouts a jubilant \"Yes!\" and lifts her hand, and you stand back up, albeit with shaking knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you is little more than a red smear with thick streaks on the edges in the outline of a human body, and the open palm of the dark-haired giantess as if she intends to grab you.  However she only holds it up, and you see the smashed corpse of your former opponent wedged between the underside of her knuckles, his clothing saturated with blood.  She waves down at you, shaking his limp head back and forth, then withdraws her hand with a giggle.  Quickly she wipes her hand off on her thigh then high-fives her friend, both quite pleased with their killer combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" Fulda says, her eyes lit up in excitement and upturned in a smile that, for once, has no malicious thought behind it.  \"I knew you could beat him!\"  She actually seems happy with you for once!  While you stand there stunned at your victory she fills two glasses taller than you with vodka, and all the other giantesses fill one.  At her signal they all bring the shots to their mouths and toss them back, Fulda rapidly chaining two of them to spill liquor down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" she declares, slamming both glasses onto the ottoman in front of her.  \"Which one of you has the next loser?  Or do I need to put my other one into the ring already?\"  The giantesses turn to discuss among themselves while the thin brunette and dark haired slapper sit idly, the latter still looking satisfied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deliberation among the giantesses continues for over a minute, turning to them making deals between each other before too long about who would get the turn after and exchanging favors.  Fulda sighs loudly from exasperation and extends her arm, placing a hand down in front of you.  She opens her fingers, dropping the unlucky man she had caught just minutes before, and points at the blond.  \"You're next, Olga,\" she declares. \"I want to do a clean sweep of that side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Fulda withdraw her hand to rest it on her chair so that she can majestically preside over the next combat, then turn to face your next opponent.  He looks puny, and not just because he's less than an inch tall.  Rail-thin with sunken eyes he's almost malnourished, and you wonder whether he had ever left his room before tonight.  You had heard him speaking with Fulda earlier, and it didn't seem likely that human interaction or physical activities are on his list of hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, he is not taking his new stature or situation well at all.  In the last ten minutes he had been shrunk and then plopped down in the middle of six beautiful giantesses, all staring at him intently, waiting for him to fight to the death.  He stands there awestruck, his eyes jumping every few seconds between Fulda, Olga, and one of the other monumental women, all waiting for him to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of nothing happening you begin to grow bored, and apparently the women do as well.  A rumble sounds from Fulda's throat when she clears it, drawing your attention, then she bellows, \"Fight!\"  You snap your attention back to your opponent, and find that he hasn't even picked up a weapon: in fact he's still gawking at the women surrounding him.  Something in his brain must have broken - or maybe it was something in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting an easy victory you advance, but your aggressive move must have snapped him back to reality.  Instead of fighting he opts to run, turning tail from you and fleeing for the far edge and leaving you to stand there in disbelief.  Fortunately all the women have turned their attention to him, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce and leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis trajectory puts him on path for an Asian giantess who has been eyeing him hungrily the whole time.  She reaches for him, extends two fingers, and gingerly plucks him up by the collar.  He continues trying to run, his legs kicking at empty air in a feeble attempt to escape while she lifts him up to eye level.  Casually she tilts her head back and opens her mouth, and his legs stop pumping.  There's a high-pitched squeal as she lowers him into her maw, then he disappears behind her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she holds her pose, looking serenely at the ceiling while her very confused victim no doubt rages blindly at her tongue.  She concentrates, and a lump begins moving down her throat, transporting the man down to her stomach.  Once he's through her esophagus she places a hand on her chest and smiles, then she turns to face you.  Leaning over quite far she lets her head hover mere inches from you, tilted down so that her coal colored eyes bore into you.  Menacingly she opens her mouth and sticks out her tongue, revealing the vast cavern empty except for her teeth, and goes \"Ahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's enough,\" Fulda declares, and the Asian sits back up in her seat.  \"It's your turn Olga, show us what you've got.\"  The blond shrugs and reaches into her lap, where she withdraws her own shrunken man.  Unceremoniously she drops him in the middle, and you find him to be perfectly nondescript, the perfect sort of person to go missing at a party like this.  Olga looks down as the two of you square off, her gray eyes flitting back and forth from hundreds of feet above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new opponent quickly picks up the left over sewing needle, claiming it as his spear for the upcoming fight.  It was too much to hope for a second person to run, but after what happened to the last guy you can hardly blame him.  You raise your shield while he levels his spear, both waiting for the command.  Finally the Asian speaks up, yelling \"Fight!\"</span></div></div>",

It's easy enough to deflect his jab, though, and move in for a slash of your own.  He's able to slide out of the way of your counterattack though, and all you've accomplished is changing places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you parry your opponent's attacks you watch Olga get increasingly irate that he still hasn't finished you off.  She moves to get out of her seat so that she can come intervene but Fulda grabs her wrist, keeping her in place.  She sits back down annoyed and yells, \"Well fucking gut him already!\"  Her dark-haired friend takes the hint and reaches forward but in turn Olga stops her, likely not wanting to risk her own champion getting smashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't mean other women are similarly restrained, though.  During a strong jab a shadow appears over the combat and you roll forward, just in time to get out of the way of a gigantic hand slamming down.  The impact disrupts your movement, knocking you and your opponent prone from the shockwave, and the slapping sound nearly bursts your eardrums.  A long slender thumb lies before you, which thankfully does not close in on you.  Just as soon as she struck the giantess pulls her hand back, disappointed to have gotten neither of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back up your opponent moves to seize the initiative with a series of quick jabs to drive you backwards.  While you manage to step out of the range every time it does hold your attention, and you don't even think about how close you're getting to the Asian.  You block a strong jab then feel a rough tug on your collar, and you're quickly lifted away from the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're turned around mid-air and see that the same giantess who ate your last opponent has now grabbed you.  She looks you over hungrily with her velvety dark eyes, lifting you further away from the ground.  All the other giantesses gasp and watch with rapt attention as you're drawn upwards and towards her and she grins in anticipation, but doesn't reveal her row of pearly white teeth just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the previous one she holds you above eye level and tilts her head back, then begins slowly lowering you toward her mouth.  Her pink lips part, revealing a dark pit lined with teeth and her eager tongue ready to strike when you enter.  Hot breath blasts you, getting more intense as you're gradually dropped into her mouth, and you can see strands of saliva on her uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your feet are just above her lower lip you decide to strike, jabbing your makeshift sword upward and into her fingertip.  Your ears are overwhelmed by her yelling \"Ow!\" but her lips close reflexively and her hand flinches, pitching you forward.  Her grip releases and you go tumbling down her chin, helped along your path when she suddenly whips her head forward, her lower lip bumping into your head and throwing you away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land back on the ottoman to a series of oos and aahs and one very surprised opponent.  The crowd is torn between cheering at your return and booing, but before you can relish the accolades you still need to win this fight. At first you have trouble getting your feet under you and your opponent merely watches, the butt of his needle planted on the leather so he can lean on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA humongous hand sneaks up behind him, middle finger cocked back by her thumb, and you slow down your movements a bit.  The giantess readjusts her hand, picking the perfect trajectory while he continues to watch you smugly.  There's a dull thud and her finger shoots forward, slamming him in the back and throwing him forward at extreme velocity.  You finally stand and watch him fly through the air, collide with Fulda's chest and fall back down, landing on one of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand befuddled for a moment in his absence, the only thing remaining of him in the arena the sewing needle, clearly making you the winner.  Safe from any other grabbing hands you watch the tiny body try to stand up on Fulda's leg, but see that he's unable to even reach a sitting position.  Fulda smirks and lifts up her other leg, does an exaggerated arc with it, and crosses it over her other one, trapping the man between her thighs.  Her muscles briefly tense, and you get the feeling that's the last anyone will ever see of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictorious once more you return to the center while the giantesses pour out their drinks, and Olga pours a second one for Fulda.  Despite it being incredibly surreal that this is even happening you're glad that you've made it this far, especially when you consider the alternative.  Olga and her friend glower down at you along with the brunette, but Fulda is pleased as punch with you, going so far as to even blow you a kiss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses pound back their shots and slam the empty glasses onto whatever surface they have available, Fulda again double-fisting due to your success.  You look to the two who don't seem incredibly bitter toward you as you await your next opponent, and they in turn look to Fulda to see what's next.</span></div></div>",

Her breath reeks strongly of alcohol, and you feel light-headed from the blast.  \"I'm actually a little proud of you, even if the best you've done is not die.\"  She gives a wry grin before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may not seem like it, but there is some strategy that goes into this, and there are some rules.  We can intervene at any time, doing whatever we want to one of you, as long as it's not one we sent out.  We feel it keeps fights from going on too long or getting boring.  Also if you end up clearly defeated and at weapon point but still alive it's up to the closest person to decide what happens.\"  She sees the surprised expression on your face and adds, \"We don't like explaining these things before it starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda pauses to swallow the built-up saliva before moving on, the liquid audibly sloshing around before a loud gulp.  \"You've managed to piss off Allison and Olga pretty well by beating them, and even if Brit weren't Olga's best friend she'd probably have it out for you to get back at me for crushing hers when we first got here.  Don't turn your back on them, and if you can lead the fight away from their side.

So stay close to my left side and watch those three, got it?\"  You nod, figuring that at the very least Fulda wants to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand descends back to the leather plateau, Fulda not even bothering to trap you with her fingers this time.  When it sets down you confidently walk down her fingers and onto the ottoman, ready to face your next opponent and glad to no longer be in a miasma of alcohol breath.  \"Okay Li, let's see what you've got,\" Fulda challenges the apparently hungry Asian, and you turn towards her in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

Instead of relying on the sewing needle like others have before she tosses him a bit of chain from a piece of costume jewelry, and he eagerly snatches it up.  No doubt he had seen her eat one man and try to eat you, so he knows not to try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam sees that you're both more or less ready, and calls for the fight to begin.  You heed Fulda's advice and charge forward, shield raised, so that you can get away from the giantesses who want to smash you.  Your charge clips your opponent, knocking him off balance and buying you an extra moment to turn around while he recovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to play defensively, backing away from him so that you can put more space between yourself and the vengeful women.  He whips the chain around in circles while slowly moving forward, his weapon itself about half again long as the two of you are tall.  For now he seems to be managing it well, and you're glad you've been able to minimize the threat from getting smashed beneath a palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you're about to go on the offensive he decides to strike, swinging his chain at your makeshift sword.  You avoid getting it caught and duck below the rest of the chain then move forward in a burst, ramming him with your shield.  He staggers backward and you step in, stabbing your metal sliver at his stomach.  In the nick of time he sidesteps, leaving you to stab at air, but you're able to return to a ready stance before he can take advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you jockey for position, neither willing to overcommit to what could well be a fatal misstep.  In the distance you see Olga and Brit gauging the range, trying to find out how far they would have to lean over in order for their strike to hit you.  Your opponent continues to spin his chain whip maniacally, leaving you no good openings, and you keep your shield up while staying in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA five-pointed shadow appears around you, a clear sign that someone has grown bored with the fight.  The shadow focuses on you as the hand descends, only to suddenly cease with a loud snap of flesh on flesh.  You look up and see that Fulda has wrapped a powerful hand around Li's slender wrist, holding it in place.  \"No cheating!\" Fulda declares, keeping her wrist in a firm grip.  Li winces and nods yes, then Fulda releases her hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distraction is enough to give your opponent an opening, and he slings his chain forward, wrapping it around your ankle.  With a firm tug he pulls your leg out from under you, knocking you onto your back.  He moves in and steps on your wrist, holding your shield arm to the ground while he swings his chain high.  With a grunt he brings it down, smacking you in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's eyes light up at your misfortune, especially eager to decide your fate, and her champion swings the chain again, hitting you in the ribs.  While you contract from the pain he winds up for another strike, and Li exaggeratedly licks her lips.  If he hits you again, it will be difficult to justify letting the fight go on any longer.  He begins his downward swing, and you do what you can to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis strike is disrupted by your improvised sword as his chain wraps around it, keeping it from slamming into your body.  With another quick yank he pulls it out of your hand, throwing it to the side.  Before he can begin his wind-up again you cock back your leg and kick him right in the gut, knocking him backward and away from you.  While he's still doubled over you jump back to your feet, ready to get back into the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw your shield at him like a frisbee before his chain gets in motion again, hitting him in the forehead.  Now without weapons you charge while he's dazed, tackling him with a well-placed shoulder to his sternum and taking him to the ground.  Your fists begin their work, each taking turns repeatedly punching his face until it's a bloody mess.  Feeling that your work is done you give him one more for good measure, then stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda and Li look at each other, unsure of what to do: Li doesn't want to finish off her own entrant, and Fulda wants it to end before one of the women smashes you.  Out of the corner of your eye you see Olga lunge forward and you quickly jump back, trying to get out of the way of her hand.  Surprisingly she isn't going for you; instead her fingers snag your opponent's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith relief you watch her drag him across the arena while you gather your weapons back up.  Olga leans to one side, lifting up a butt cheek, and sets the defeated man down underneath it, blood almost certainly rendering him blind.  She forcefully slams her butt back down, flattening him beneath it.  \"What?  It was a good fight,\" she explains, and you return to the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe post-fight alcohol is distributed, and Fulda leans down once she's finished with it.  \"Be on your toes now,\" she whispers, engulfing you with her alcohol-infused breath again.  \"There's not really a safe zone anymore.\"  She sits back up, resuming her regal pose overlooking the arena, and looks to Mariam.  \"All right, let's see yours now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariam reaches down and plucks her champion up from the floor, sandwiching him between two well-kept fingers.  She moves him up to her face, nearly inside her mouth, and whispers something quietly enough that not even you can hear it.  Then she moves him away and sets him down beside you in the center of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up the sewing needle, likely just hoping to keep you at bay until one of the giantesses wins for him.  Your final opponent is exceptionally scrawny, and even if he were at full size you doubt that a teenage girl would have trouble overpowering him - not that the same wasn't necessarily true of you too.  Much more worrying is the eager gleam in the eyes of all the giantesses, and you can tell that they're barely restraining themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga calls for the fight to start this time, and before she even sounds the last letter you explode into action, leaping forward without regard for your opponent.  You just make it past him before Olga's hand connects, slamming onto the leather with a great cacophony with the tip of her middle finger just short of you.  The rush of wind from her hand hitting blows you forward several inches, and you see Li's arm winding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even bothering to stand you wait for her arm to come down, hand balled up in a fist.  You roll to the side, narrowly avoiding getting smashed by her strike, and quickly get back to your feet.  Your opponent stands there, confused and more than a little shocked, still where he was when the fight started.  Fulda pensively watches you from behind him, unable to stop the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou square up with your opponent who isn't even really paying attention to you and prepare to charge.  Before you can start moving an enormous finger slams into your back as Allison pushes you forward.  Just when you're able to stop yourself she pokes you again, harder this time and pitching you forward, nearly impaling you on the sewing needle.  In preparation for the next strike you raise your shield, only to have it come from the side.  Allison's finger whacks you in the shoulder, throwing you sideways and knocking you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you come to a complete stop there's a tug on your back, and Brit lifts you up by your shirt.  You dangle helplessly in the air, unable to do anything to free yourself, and she slightly rocks her hand, swinging you back and forth like a pendulum.  When you're moving forward she lets go, sending you flying over your opponent to land roughly on the ottoman's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi sets her hand down beside you while you're laying there trying to gather your strength, index finger cocked back.  Perhaps too eagerly she releases it without setting it up, just slightly clipping your shoulder.  While it's not enough to shatter your arm it does send you skipping across the leather, bowling your opponent over when your flat trajectory collides with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd like nothing more than to take a minute to recover, but the self-satisfied look on Olga's face tells you that's not going to happen.  She slowly moves her hand toward you, index finger outstretched, directly on course to smash your head with it.  Wearily you get back up, saving your head from the impact, and turn to actually get some fighting done.  Before you can move though Olga presses her finger down, creating an indentation that draws you back toward her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bump into the final knuckle of her extended finger and she lifts it away, the sudden return of tautness to the surface pitching you forward.  Olga slams her finger back down where she expected you to be, pulling you back in to the simulated gravity well.  Instead of lifting it up again she lightly kicks you with it, pushing you forward an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you run forward trying to escape she walks her fingers alongside you.  They're more than three times as long as you are tall and they easily outpace you, even with her moving them slowly.  She moves them in front of you, allowing you to periodically get out from under her palm by running between her fingers.  She lets out a light giggle, and you get ready to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's fingers burst forward, placing you directly underneath her palm.  Just when she slams it to the surface you dive forward, barely escaping from underneath her hand as it falls backward.  You find yourself between two massive digits when you get back up, and they immediately close together like a pair of scissors, trapping you between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure is light at first, just enough to keep you from moving, but it steadily increases.  It's not long before her fingers restrict your breathing, and you find yourself not even able to breathe in.  Olga continues to press her fingers together while you ineffectually slap at one, trying to get her to let go.  In just a few moments you know she'll crush your torso with nothing more than two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately you reverse your sword's grip and plunge it down, piercing the skin of her middle finger.  You ram it down as hard as you can, the tip nearly poking through the other side, and Olga recoils from the sharp pain.  You're yanked backward by her hand and thrown tumbling, but the others aren't ready to finish you off, having expected Olga to do it.  Gasping for breath, you push yourself back up and charge at your opponent, still standing in the middle dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the others can react you charge at him again, hoping to cover enough ground that they'll risk smashing him too.  A wall of fingers lands before you, stopping you in your tracks as you slam headlong into it.  Allison's thumb closes against your back, trapping you in her hand, and you just now realize you left your sword in Olga's finger.  It looks like this is it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, instead of crushing you under her thumb Allison picks you up, keeping you firmly planted in the center of her palm.  With a flick of her wrist she tosses you forward, sending you sailing over your opponent and in a hard roll until you come to a stop.  By now you're not even sure where you are or which giantess you're beneath, and it's all you can do to keep moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out you're beneath Li, and from her face you figure she worked something out with the others so that she'd be the one to finish you off.  Expecting you to be defeated her hand slowly descends toward you, fingers outstretched, hoping to build trepidation before she snatches you up.  You get up to a knee and turn yourself toward her thumb, gathering your breath while the shadow darkens around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's fingers start to close around you right when your adrenaline fully kicks in, and you spring yourself out from beneath her hand.  You leap over the tip of a finger on your way out, narrowly escaping the fist closing around you.  Thinking quick you grab the chain left by your last opponent, lying not far from where you stop, and get ready to get back into the combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can move toward the center Li's hand winds up for a quick swipe at you, and crouch low enough that her palm passes harmlessly above, just close enough to rustle your hair.  You run forward, moving with enough speed that her second swipe merely glances you with the very tip of a finger.  She groans in frustration, and you know now's the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow gets fuzzy around you as Li raises her hand, ready to bring it down and simply smash you to bits.  You whip the chain forward, catching you unaware opponent by the ankle, and pull it taut.  Around you the shadows grow darker and you yank the chain, jerking your opponent to where you are.  You don't stand around waiting for him to stop though: as soon as you pulled him you began to run, diving forward and back toward the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more skin slaps against leather, and you hear the faint sound of over two hundred bones cracking simultaneously from the hit.  \"Fuck, ouch!\" Li yells before the sound dies down, and you guess that, adding injury to insult, she stuck herself with your opponent's needle when she smashed him.  You grin weakly, and manage to push yourself back up one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" Fulda yells excitedly.  \"I can't believe you survived all that punishment!\"  The other giantesses mutter among themselves, disappointed that they couldn't kill you even working together.  Li pulls the needle out and sucks on her hand where it went in, seething with rage while you're congratulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands from her chair, towering so far above you atop the ottoman you still have to look up at her knees.  She places her hands atop her hips to add to her imposing image and asks, \"Anyone else have a shrunken man they want to throw in?\"  After a beat she continues, \"Congratulations, Fulda Stein's shrunken man, you are the champion of this year's tournament!  The reward, as it is every tournament, is that you get to keep living - at the mercy of the woman you represented, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so tired at this point that you don't even mind that the reward is simply not dying: after so many near-brushes with it during that fight, you know that alone has value.  You look up at Fulda silently, only able to spend this time regaining your strength.  For the moment you're too exhausted to escape, and hope that, after all this, you've managed to earn some sort of reprieve from her.</span></div></div>",

They down their liquor in a single draft, Fulda managing to fit both inside her colossal mouth at once, then slam the glasses down.  Fulda stands against the ottoman, pressing herself as close as she can to you, while you crane your neck back at her towering body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey down there little guy, how 'bout a victory lap?\" she asks, her speech getting lazy from intoxication.  She sinks to the floor and sits down, stretching her impossibly long legs out.  They have to be about as long as a football field, you think, and you notice that she's put her high heels back on.  Her ice blue eyes fixate upon you, though the alcohol has made them somewhat glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Fulda,\" you begin, \"I'm really tired from all that and I just want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonshense!\" she interrupts, assaulting you with a wall of sound and alcohol breath as she forgets to control the volume of her voice.  \"The night's shtill young!  I wanna dance!\"  You don't want to succumb to her demands, but you realize there's the very real possibility of her having a titanic tantrum if you don't.  She narrows her eyes and adds, \"Remember like twenty seconds ago when I said 'at the mercy of...' etshetera?\"  Fulda's not-so-veiled threat is very clear, and you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Fulda!\" you say with feigned enthusiasm, \"I'd love to dance!\"  Nothing you'd like more than to dance with a drunk woman over a thousand times your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd agree,\" Fulda says with an involuntary grin plastered on her face.  \"Let'sh go!\"  Despite her impulsive state and excitement doesn't swipe at you with one of her enormous hands.  Instead she sets a hand, palm up, on the side of the ottoman and lets you walk onto it.  She waits until you get to the middle before standing, placing her other hand around you as a guard wall.  Even the ascent is as mild as it can be considering her legs have to extend all the way up very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda walks very carefully back to the dance floor, almost cradling you like an egg in her hands.  \"You're gonna have lots o' fun!\" she declares, eyes widening to emphasize how much fun you'll have.  Her breath still reeks of alcohol so much that your eyes water, but you suppress a cough so as not to tip her over the edge.  \"More than the lasht guy I danced with, I hope!\"  She laughs hysterically at this, throwing her head back and stumbling over her heels.  You force a small laugh, probably not even worth the effort to compete with her belting peals of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the dance area you had just left a half hour ago, the music still playing but nobody around.  \"You ready to shee my moves?\" Fulda asks, following it up with a wink.  You give an enthusiastic thumbs up from her palm, and a huge grin breaks out across her face.  \"Okay, s'go!\"</span></div></div>",

You walk off, your feet making small indentations on her palm and fingers as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're safely off Fulda stands back up to her absolutely monumental height, wobbling a bit when her legs fully extend.  You stare up at her towering over you, understanding how the poor guy she shrank earlier must have felt, then remind yourself that applies to you, too.  She spreads her feet so that she can stand astride you and places her hands on her hips, looking down at you.  Despite her best efforts not to, she cracks a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we begin, li'l dude, I have a question.  And you gotta be truthful.\"  Fulda does what she can to hide her smile but she can't help herself.  \"Are you scared of me?  Do I intimidate you?\"  She stifles a laugh while you decide whether you actually should tell the truth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, she's getting nicer, and you might be able to warm up- no.  She tried to crush or eat you multiple times today, put you in a death match against a bunch of other shrunken men, not to mention she's the reason you're an inch tall in the first place!  \"Yes, Fulda!\" you yell up at her.  \"You terrify the ever-loving shit out of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda busts out laughing at your response and takes a good ten seconds to compose herself again.  \"Good!\" she says.  \"After all, I am...\" she raises a foot high in the air and sucks in breath before yelling, \"<i>absolutely gigantic in comparison to you!</i>\"  With that she stomps her foot down, bringing it dead center for your head.  You flinch away from the rapidly approaching shoe sole and cover your head, unwilling to look death in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot slams into the ground with a sound like artillery firing next to your ear, and generates a shockwave that knocks you on your back from a sitting position.  You look up horrified at the titaness stretching up as far as your eye can see, who busts out laughing again so hard she has to double over.  \"Oh my God!\" Fulda says between laughs, \"You're pathetic!  Like I would step on you after that!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the toe of her shoe for support while you stand back up, and she takes several deep breaths to compose herself.  Many of the giantesses from around the party have gathered around to witness the imminent spectacle.  \"Okay so, li'l dude.  For real.  Let's dance.\"</span></div></div>",

Though the steps she takes are small each time she sets her toes down generates a minor earthquake, and they lift up enough for you to fit beneath them.  While she gets warmed up you can do little else but stare up at her in awe and hope you don't stand where her feet want to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only one dan-cing!\" she bellows down at you, then begins to shake her hips a little more.  You make a token effort to shuffle your feet back and forth, moving between the tops of two carpet fibers while trying to stay on your feet through the pounding.  So far you've been safe from any errant steps, but you still feel safer staring up at her from between her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say dance at me, I said <i>with</i> me,\" Fulda chides, intensifying her movements even more.  Her toes constantly grind into the carpet and every few seconds one of her heels slams down with enough force to rattle your teeth.  \"Do I need to motivate you a little more?\"  She begins lifting up one foot fully, stomping it down next to you and twisting once, then repeating, each time missing you by less than an inch.  You try to match her pace but with the constant stomping it's hard to to focus on anything but getting stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Li'l dude, if you don't start dancing with me I'm going to assume you don't find me attractive,\" Fulda warns, her hips fully gyrating.  \"You saw what happened to the last guy who wouldn't dance, right?\"  You shudder at the memory of Li eating that man.  You're not sure if that's what she's implying, but even if it's just shrinking you, you'd rather avoid it.  \"So get on me and dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her foot going up and down, marking the rhythm and counting how long it's down.  It's not very long, but with each twist you think you'll have enough time.  Two more steps pass and you go for it, hopping on the tip of her shoe and running as far up as you can.  The next time she lifts her foot up you're thrown on your face, but you manage to grab hold of the bottom of her high heel's opening.  Her foot slams down, twisting you back and forth, but you maintain your grip and gradually pull yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" she shouts down at you.  \"Now grind on me!\"</span></div></div>",

Does she seriously want you to grind against her foot?  Her leg would be a very long climb, hazardous with how it's moving right now, and she isn't going to help you get up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for her to step down again and weather the shock from the impact, then while she's twisting throw yourself forward.  The momentum while she twists works to your advantage, and you manage to grab a handful of her nylon stocking each time.  She continues to throw you around, your legs swinging wildly as she gyrates her hips, but after a few more stomps you're able to get your feet situated at the base of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda continues stomping her foot over and over, pitching you up and down while you try to work up the courage to actually do this.  The rhythm is easy enough to find thanks to your whole body literally moving along with it, and you look up to Fulda for reassurance.  Once you got on her foot she seems to have entirely lost herself in the dance, throwing all caution to the wind.  For someone as large as she is even at normal height, she's quite a good dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you decide to throw caution to the wind and just go for it.  You grip both handfuls of her stocking as tightly as possible and start grinding against her foot, really throwing your hips into it.  The skin on her foot is soft enough for you to not feel like you're rubbing against a skeleton, and the stocking helps keep the friction down.  This is the closest you'll be able to get to dancing with her, and unbelievably you're getting into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get so involved in the grinding, in fact, that you don't even notice when you're not being thrown around anymore.  You're totally oblivious until you look up and open your eyes and see Fulda's enormous face peering over her knee.  She laughs and and yells, \"Yeah, li'l dude, give it to me!\" over the music, with absolutely no cruelty in her tone.

You look up her unbelievably long shin just as her face crests her knee, smile plastered across it.  \"Okay, I've got another idea,\" she says giggling.  \"Get off my shoe and head around back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and hop off, glad to be away from that accident waiting to happen.  It's impossible to deny that you were having fun, but it was only a matter of time before you fell off and ended up under her shoe.  Swiftly you walk along the outside of her shoe, running your hand along the black suede until you run out of toe.  To keep you occupied until the heel you look up, gobsmacked by a shoe eight times as tall as you are, to say nothing of the person wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the towering tapered column you run your hand along the polished surface, marveling at your distorted reflection.  Fulda peers down at you over her shoulder and calls down to you, \"Hey.  Little guy.  If you want to be that close to my heel I'll put it on you.\"  You pull your hand away and walk back, looking up at her for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go stand under my ass.\"  You can hardly believe what you just heard.  Luckily Fulda repeats it so you can be sure.  \"Go.  Stand under.  My ass.\"  With a shrug you move away from the heel entirely and stand between her feet, looking upwards.  Fulda looks down her back so she can watch you, and tells you when you're in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda drops her butt down toward you in a squat so quickly and suddenly you're worried it's going to smash into you.  Again you shield yourself uselessly with your arms while it bears down, only to feel foolish when it stops well above your head.  You move your arms away and see that they couldn't have protected you from Fulda's bubble butt - nothing could if she sat on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins waving her magnificent black-clad ass forward and back above you, pulling her dress tightly against it.  \"Hop on!\" she orders.  \"I'm going to twerk you!\"  At such a promise you begin frantically jumping as high as you can, trying to grab on to the fabric of her dress.</span></div></div>",

The six inch heels are really working against her now: if not for them you would probably be able to grab a loose thread and pull yourself up at the very least.  Unless you had the jumping power of a flea it's an impossible jump, and you're not too keen on letting Fulda see if your leap scales higher the smaller you get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fulda, your heels are too high!\" you shout at her from under her butt.  \"If you take them off I can make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I take them off my legs and butt won't look as fantastic,\" Fulda replies, sending a hand back to grope one of her own buttocks.  \"And I wouldn't be over seven feet tall anymore.  No, I have a better idea.\"  A low chuckle reaches down to you from her throat, and you become concerned for what's about to happen.  You have yet to meet one of Fulda's ideas that you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's ass shoots into the sky as she leans forward, her knees slamming against the floor so hard you have to set your footing from the shockwave.  Her heels kick up horizontally, and she begins to slowly straighten her legs, sliding them along the floor away from her.  The hem of her little black dress approaches and she warns, \"Don't you dare get fresh.\"  Not wanting to risk her wrath you back away from the encroaching skirt line, careful not to end up inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her skirt stops threatening to engulf you it's safe to assume that her legs are fully extended, and she begins to lower her chest to the floor.  Gradually you walk her back sink to the floor as little by little more of it disappears, blocked by her monumental butt.  She rests her chin on her hands so that you can still see a sea of auburn hair beyond her posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down the length of Fulda's legs to where you stand, amazed that they don't start to converge toward the vanishing point - though, you suppose they aren't approaching the horizon, just the wall of her house, and things like that don't really apply to someone your size.  Her well-developed calves transition into her toned hamstrings, which support her built quads, all under a thin layer of nylon.  Your gaze continues upward and you find yourself staring up Fulda's skirt, her privates concealed behind yellow lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, stop looking up my skirt.\"  Fulda pauses, and you hear scattered giggling from the other giantesses assembled to watch.  \"Now climb up to the back of my thigh, lie down in the middle of my ass and hold on.  Got it?  Go.\"</span></div></div>",

With a shrug you head for the one to your left and stand at the base momentarily, looking up.  Fulda's thigh is well-muscled, and her skin has been shown immense care, rendering it very soft.  This ought to be a piece of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently you grab a handful of her stocking and dig your foot into her skin, boosting yourself up a bit.  You reach up with your other hand and grab another bunch of the netting, securing yourself a bit more room to continue to ascend by dimpling her thigh with your other foot.  The skin you're against twitches, and you hear Fulda giggling.  \"That tickles li'l dude, hurry up!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pace increases, and you crest the ridge of her quad shortly.  Fulda involuntarily jerks her leg, swinging you into the mountain of skin before you can stop yourself.  You recover and shake your head to refocus yourself and reach up once more, hoping to finish the climb before the risk becomes too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully you reach the top before Fulda twitches anymore, and you take in the sights.  Her thigh is dozens of feet wide where you are, and her leg gradually tapers off over the several hundred feet it stretches out before going into her shoe.  On the other side the cream color quickly gives way to black satin and rises up, her butt forming a perfectly round hill with a slight dip in the middle.  Beyond that the next you can see of her is the mane of meticulously braided dark red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can get impatient you step up onto her dress, walking in the middle of her thigh like it's an asphalt street.  The care she puts into her body is evident, since at no point do you feel yourself wobbling or on unsteady footing.  In no time at all you've reached the end of her leg, and stand at the base of her massive buttock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the opportunity to slap her butt, your hand barely making an indentation in the firm surface.  Satisfied you hoist yourself up again, navigating the sharply curving surface of her posterior.  Soon you're able to walk along the surface, bouncing between steps thanks to the firm buttock below you, and head for the dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a lark you sit down on the downward slope, sliding yourself down to the great ditch between her butt cheeks.  You turn yourself over and wedge yourself further in, thankful for the layers of cloth between you and her ass crack as you grab on.  \"Ready?\" Fulda asks, and you check your grip.  \"Let's go!\"</span></div></div>",

When she gets to her knees you're entirely vertical, with two solid black hills blocking your view to the sides.  You look up and see her back stretching towards the ceiling, an insurmountably high cliff if you wanted to climb it with your bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud thud and some jiggling to your side when Fulda plants her foot on the ground, the other side following suit shortly.  She pushes her butt out, tightening the already form-fitting dress around her butt and stretching your arms to maintain their grip.  You hear a clap as she plants her hands on her knees, then get subtly wiggled along with her butt while she does a test shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little of a warning was not enough.  When Fulda starts twerking in earnest you rocket upwards, only to suddenly stop and shoot down when she reverses direction.  Your stomach turns over repeatedly while she does this, the dozens of shakes adding up to make you feel extremely nauseated.  Not wanting to puke you close your eyes and hope the feeling abates soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time her butt shakes is terrible for your once-solid grip on her dress as well.  While you're carried up and down by her butt your body moves along, and your shoulders quickly feel the strain.  Her buttocks jiggle up and down non-stop, pulling some of the fabric out of your hold as her dress shifts along with it.  You're driven a little deeper into her crack, her massive ass seeming to grow more massive by the second.  At least this time you're not inside her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience seems to enjoy it, all the assembled giantesses cheering loudly when Fulda starts twerking with you.  It's impossible to keep your bearings straight while on Fulda's rapidly rising and dropping ass, but you know there's a semi-circle of women behind you, all making comments and filming the spectacle. You pull yourself tighter.  At least if you were on the other side you'd be spared the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your hands slips free, Fulda's jiggling ass finally pulling the fabric out of your grip.  You're now swinging wildly with her butt, flopping up and down along the one point of contact you have.  Each time you swing up far enough now to smash into her buttock and push in before rocketing back down to slam face-first into it, over and over.  You feel your grip start to loosen, the strain of only having one hand on wearing it away.  The audience, for their part, loves it.</span></div></div>",

You feel a sharp pain in your shoulder from the jolt - nothing broken, but you'll definitely feel it in the morning - and get swung hard in between her buttocks.  Before you can drift back out she clenches her butt cheeks around you, holding you in place with her firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands back up, her ass pressing even tighter on you as they come together more naturally.  As a precautionary measure you work the fingers of your free hand into the stitching of her dress, not sure when she'll unclench her butt to release you.  For now though her gravity-defying ass helps you defy gravity as well, her black satin dress surrounding you.  While you could struggle to get free, you don't see how that would improve your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins walking, and you feel her buttocks tighten and loosen around you with each step she takes.  The tensed side always pushes you into the relaxed one, shoving you into the mound of muscle.  Every time her heel sets down on the floor her ass jiggles from the impact, moving you up and down with it.  It may not be ideal, but you vastly prefer this to hanging on for dear life as you had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery few steps Fulda stumbles from the complexity of walking in these heels while inebriated, briefly causing her butt to relinquish its grip on you.  Fortunately each time it happens you're bounced rapidly back and forth between her buttocks, keeping you level without putting any strain on your grip.  She's always quick to recover and soon reaches her destination, putting a stop to the feeling that you're constantly being juggled by her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn both sides of you her muscles relax, relinquishing their iron grip around you.  No longer engulfed by her ass you find yourself hanging on to it, nestled between her buttocks with a long drop to the linoleum floor below you.  Soon enough you feel a hand on your back, and Fulda's mighty fingers seize your torso.  With a gentle tug she pulls you free of her butt, breaking your grip easily, and moves you around to the front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets you down atop the kitchen counter and releases her grip, allowing you to stand on your own.  You rub your shoulder to hopefully relieve the future soreness while staring up at her from waist height, finally able to marvel at the size of more than just one part again.  She slams a shot glass down onto the counter next to you, the sound of glass banging on tile like a gunshot, and sets a large, rectangular bottle full of clear liquid down beside it.</span></div></div>",

Curious, you watch her withdraw her hand, fingers pinched around something so small as to be imperceptible in her grip.  She sets her hand down before you and opens her fingers, then pulls her hand back to twist the cap off the enormous liquor bottle in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you don't see anything, but the light clatter of glass bouncing against the tile floor makes you inspect closer.  There on the counter, stopped by a rough patch of grout, is a tiny shot glass, perfect for someone your size.  You look it over, and to your surprise it doesn't even appear to have been broken off of anything - as far as you can tell, it was made for people your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you turn your attention back to her Fulda has already poured a drink for herself and is eyeing you impatiently.  With one hand she's holding a dropper inside her full glass, and with one brief squeeze she withdraws a couple drops of liquor into it.  Her other hand points at a space on the counter top, her waist-high finger flat on the ground, indicating for you to place your glass there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you set the glass down Fulda pulls out the dropper and moves it so that the open tip is suspended above your glass.  With a very light squeeze she forces a single drop out, allowing it to dangle on the end before gravity pulls it down.  The drop itself is several times larger than the glass, and leaves it overfilled in a small puddle of vodka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you pick up the glass so that the smooth, wet surface doesn't slip through your fingers and look up at Fulda.  She raises her glass in a toast and you follow suit, spilling a few microliters  of vodka onto your fingers.  Swiftly she raises her drink to her lips and tips it upward, pouring the entirety of the liquor into her open throat.  You mimic her as best you can, but the liquor is much harsher on your than it is on her, and your throat burns when the alcohol is reluctantly forced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your glass back on the tile and look back up at Fulda, who promptly refills your drink.  Just as last time the liquor spills out onto the counter, creating a pool of vodka, but this time Fulda hasn't poured one for herself.  \"Go on li'l guy, drink it,\" she implores, pointing to your glass.  \"You've got a lot of catching up to do.\"  Reluctantly you pick it up and drink it down.  This one tastes no better than the last, and you set your shot glass back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even swallow your saliva Fulda has refilled your drink again, and you're not so sure about this one.  You hesitate to pick it up again.  \"What's up?\" she asks, pausing to giggle and mouth \"me\" in response to her own question.  \"Don't you want to be my dinky drinking buddy?\"  You're still unsure about this, and look with consternation at what Fulda wants to be your third shot in the space of a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for the Pledge Method,\" Fulda declares, and picks up the bottle.  With a quick jab from her other hand her finger slams into your chest, knocking you to your back and pinning you down beneath her fingertip.  While you struggle to get free she positions the bottle's mouth over your head and gradually tips it until a steady stream of liquor begins pouring out.  You try to turn your head and hold your breath, but there's much more vodka in that bottle than you can withstand, and each time you gasp for air you drink a little bit of it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how long this lasts, but when the steady stream ceases and she sets the bottle back down it's almost a quarter empty.  While you remain pinned under her finger, your face and back soaked with vodka, she leans her face down until her full pink lips are inches above you.  She grins while you cough, trying to eject some of the vodka that went down the wrong pipe without breathing in too much of the reeking miasma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better, my tiny little drinking buddy?\" Fulda mockingly coos, keeping her finger firmly pressed down on your chest.  For once her breath is less alcoholic than the air around you, and it blows the cloud of foul air away from your face.  \"But I think it's time for us to get out of here.\"  You gulp, and she finishes, \"Let's go somewhere...</span></div></div>",

Not that she would have to, since whether you want to or not you'll be going with her.  She slides her thumb around your vodka-soaked back and lifts you up, and you prepare yourself to endure being carried once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you up to her face and holds you steady, turning you so that you can look at her while walking.  The manic look in her glazed eyes is somewhat unsettling, and makes you worry about what's coming when you get to her room.  You look down at your feet dangling freely and watch her walk, each step with her heels carefully considered so that Fulda doesn't lose her balance, and try not to think about the four hundred foot drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVertigo sets in when you realize you've never felt this high up combined with the disorienting effect of your size, and the alcohol takes effect.  Your vision begins to swim, exaggerating the light swaying with each step Fulda takes, and warmth spreads throughout your body.  You look up from the floor at Fulda's face and see the same frenzied expression, if anything more intense than before you looked away, and try to find anything else to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left a long-legged blond in all white sits on the couch with a small cage containing about six shrunken men on her lap.  While you watch she reaches into the cage, causing all the men to scatter, but she easily catches one between her fingers.  She pulls him out and holds him aloft, watching him without emotion while he futilely tries to get free.  Then she pops him into her mouth, and you turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side there are a few more women - many of them look to have gone to their rooms when the party died down - and you focus on Li sitting at a table.  She looks furious, still sour over you escaping her twice, and appears to be shouting wordlessly at the table top in front of her.  It takes a couple seconds for your brain to process that there must be a man she's yelling at, shrunken by her fury to be as small to you as you are to Fulda.  Again you turn away, unwilling to watch these events unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda grins down at you smugly, though her eyes still show a barely restrained mania.  \"Looks like you lucked out with me, huh?\" she asks, stammering over the first couple words.  You wouldn't even be here were it not for her shrinking you this morning, but now doesn't seem like the best time to correct her.  Whatever response you could give would have been drowned out anyway by her pounding footsteps on the stairs and her need to concentrate on the handrail so that she won't fall up the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou involuntarily grin while Fulda ascends the stairs, the alcohol giving you a sense of euphoria out of sync with your current situation.  It seems to be affecting you much more, and quicker, than her, probably on account of the massive size difference.  In order to keep your vision steady you focus on one of her pupils for the rest of the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not much longer until Fulda pushes open the door to her room, closing it with gusto once she crosses the threshold and locks it.  She kicks off her heels and sends them clattering across the carpet, then closes the rest of her hand around you and leans against the door.  With her other hand she taps your head as it barely pokes out from her fist, then she says, \"Looks like it's just me and you now.  What should I do with my pea-sized partner, hmm?\"</span></div></div>",

You bend your knees to soften the landing and she pulls her hand away, placing it atop her thigh with a resounding slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer,\" she says, beckoning by curling one finger towards her.  You take a small step forward, not even leaving the carpet fibers you're standing on.  \"Closer.\"  This time you take a slightly larger step, crossing over one of the lines in the carpet but not wanting to fall for a trap.  \"Closer!\" she shouts, much more resolutely and staccato than last time, and points at her knee.  Not wanting to antagonize her any more you comply, realizing that now not being near Fulda is what's dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry as best you can, but the surface isn't easy to walk on even in the best of times.  Booze interferes with your sense of balance wile you approach Fulda, and you stumble several times when the carpet you're on shifts unexpectedly under your weight.  As you walk Fulda simply watches you, an amused grin on her face while you struggle to move a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you reach her knee and place both hands on it to steady yourself, leaning against her stocking-covered knee.  Fulda giggles, making you giggle back, and says, \"Man, you're small.  You're like, teeny-tiny.  Itsy-bitsy.

She slaps her hand back against her thigh, making you wince from the crack, before continuing.  \"You might be less small soon, though.  We're going to play a game: I'm going to ask you five questions, and depending on if I like your answer you will either gain or lose height.  In vino veritas, my friend!\"  Fulda cackles, making you clutch your head.  Something tells you the house always wins in this game.</span></div></div>",

She doesn't keep you waiting long, and she begins by slamming both of her palms on the tops of her thighs and shouting \"So!  First question!  You've been small all your life, but now you're <i>small</i>.  How do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was okay this morning, being the height I was used to,\" you begin, \"but now that I'm this small it's changed.  In less than a day you've tried to crush me who knows how many times, nearly eaten me, and I've gotten very familiar with your butt.  I can't go outside, and being around people is a hazard since they can crush me without even knowing.  So I'm not much of a fan of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.  Bad answer!\" Fulda bellows, and immediately doubles in height.  Your vision blurs while your eyes adjust to your new size.  She grins down at you and taps a finger, the rippling of her skin making you wobble while you stand.  \"Next question!  If I were to make you big - I'm sorry, normal sized - again, what's the first thing you would do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder this one for a moment, wondering if you can come up with an answer that won't result in her shrinking you more.  \"Well, you towered over me earlier, so there's not a whole lot I'd be able to do really, and I'm sure you'd just be itching to shrink me again.  So I'd probably wait until your back was turned and make a run for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked the part where you admitted you're small and pathetic compared to me no matter what,\" Fulda begins, \"but I don't like that you'd run away from me.\"  With that Fulda doubles in size again as you shrink, towering over you even more.  The thigh you're on now seems more like a long, steep cliff.  \"Don't you trust me?  Aren't we friends?\"  You stand there in silence for a moment, wondering where she's going with this.  \"Psst, that's the third question, dingus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there were ever a question with no right answer, this is it.  You decide to simply be honest and see what happens.  \"The only time I'd heard of you before this was how much of a bully you are, and you've done nothing to change my mind.  Hell, you shrank me <i>through bullying</i>.  Maybe some day we could, but right now you're just someone who picks on people smaller and weaker than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda looks genuinely hurt by your answer, and you brace for her response.  She doesn't say anything, but you see a tear forming in one eyes.  With a flutter of her eyelids she blinks it back, and you watch as she grows again.  Double, quadruple, octuple... you really pissed her off.  By the time she's done shrinking you you're standing in between threads of her stocking on a single, unbroken section of skin, the nearest crag in her skin pattern out of your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips move violently while she shouts down at you, the rumbling vibrations passing through her thigh just before her booming voice reaches you.  Her words are indistinguishable from a loud rumble at first until you piece together all the sensory cues.  \"Really?  After all I've done for you, you don't think we're friends!  Should I throw you out in the hall and see how the other girls treat you?  Maybe you'd like to go see Li?  Answer me, pipsqueak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" you shout up immediately.  \"I saw what they do to their shrunken men, I'd much rather be with you!\"  You expect to shrink again, and close your eyes in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you prefer me, at least,\" Fulda says with her rolling thunder voice, \"and you'll come around soon enough.\"  You open your eyes and see that she's the same amount of huge as she was before.  Not that she isn't the size of a county to you now.  Sweat has beaded on your forehead, and you wipe it away then sit back on one of the nylon threads, bouncing up and down with the elasticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last question, and I better like your answer or you better get used to being a speck.  Do you think I'm pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is an easy one.  \"Yes, Fulda.  I think you're beautiful.\"  You sit there for a second, waiting for her response, and realize that your voice is probably so small she has the same problems you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes light up, and you know she finally understood your answer.  \"Well, in light of that I can overlook that whole not friends thing,\" she says, smiling.  Fulda gradually becomes less monumental until she only towers over you as much as she normally does, and you return to your one inch height.  She lifts up a hand and holds it above you, tilted back and ready to swat you.  \"We better be friends by tomorrow though or I'm throwing you to the others.\"  You vigorously nod your head, and she rests her hand back on her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets loose an enormous yawn and looks back down to you.  \"Well, I'm tired, so I'm going to bed.  That means you are too.\"</span></div></div>",

The friction from her stocking keeps you from sliding, and you work your hands into the nylon weave to keep from falling off when she stands.  Her thigh's incline rapidly increases until you're dangling from your handholds, your feet searching for some grip against her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to reach my garter before I'm done, li'l buddy,\" she says, peeking over her breasts to look down at you hanging from her stocking.  She takes a step, pushing her thigh against your body as it moves forward then suddenly dropping it again, making you swing back and forth after you bang against it.  There's not enough time for your swinging to stop before she takes another step and starts the sequence over once more, making it hard to imagine you'll be able to reach her garter any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet thudding against carpet give way to them slapping against the bathroom's tile, and you find yourself rapidly approaching the sink.  She comes to a stop, and a few seconds later your swaying finally ends, allowing you to finally plant your feet against her thigh.  \"You know, I should probably get you a toothbrush too,\" Fulda booms just as you push yourself upwards, the vibrations fraying your nerves while you seek to grab some fabric for stability.  \"Don't want your mouth getting all gross and rotted, do we?\"  You wait to make sure she's done so that you aren't dropped to the floor by another ill-timed sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds of her brushing her teeth make their way down to you, and you capitalize on having a couple minutes free from interruption to start your climb.  The nylon provides secure handholds for you as you make your ascent, and her rock-hard thighs are easy enough for you to press your feet against.  You make quick progress up her thigh, and in just over a minute you've climbed inside her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're mid-reach Fulda lifts up the leg that you're climbing and swings it over, crossing it with the other.  The sudden movement spooks you and you freeze, leaving yourself vulnerable.  Her thigh's incline steepens, becoming reverse and causing your legs to fall away from her thigh, leaving you dangling helplessly by one hand.  When her foot sets down vibrations run all the way up her leg, minutely shaking her skin and making you wobble in place.  Your grip loosens as a finger slips out, and you look down the long drop to her feet.</span></div></div>",

The nylon stretches as you pull down on it, the threads lengthening the longer you dangle from them.  Making your best effort not to pull down any harder you reach up with your free hand and just barely manage to hook a fingertip into the fine mesh, giving you a tiny bit of leverage.  With a few flexes of your hand you get enough for a solid grip, and when your other hand gets situated again you're ready to continue your climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's leg however remains steady, leaving an inverse climb that you don't think you have the upper body strength to complete.  Little by little you work your way around her thigh, reaching a few fractions of an inch out with one arm to solidify your grasp before moving your other one to cover the ground.  Soon your feet are able to contact her thigh, and you use them to help you on your way.  When you make it to the inside of her thigh you look up and see that now the climb isn't even vertical, though the incline is quite steep.  You dig your feet in and start pushing up, climbing against the solid muscle of her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farther you get under her skirt the less light there is, making it difficult to keep track of your progress.  You try not to let the encroaching darkness bother you and simply focus on the climb, moving one hand and one foot at the same time without ever losing contact with the other two.  Your progress feels like it is much quicker than it had been previously thanks to the easier incline, and you continue pushing yourself further into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reach your goal Fulda lifts up her leg again and you press yourself into her thigh, readying yourself for what comes next.  She moves her leg back and holds her foot into the air while she bends down, holding you sideways while you desperately cling to her.  Fulda loudly spits the toothpaste out, splattering it against the sink, and brings her leg back down once she turns on the water.  Her foot sets down hard, sending strong vibrations up to you again, but you simply hold on and weather the shockwave until it passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda takes a moment to gargle some water, during which you continue pressing yourself into her thigh.  She could start walking again at any time, you tell yourself, and then you would no doubt end up on the floor.  Water hits porcelain when Fulda spits out the water, and you risk a quick advance upward with two swift kicks while the faucet is running.  As soon as the faucet goes back off you stop, pressing yourself into her skin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fulda turns around she brings her legs close, nearly squishing you between her thighs as you pass by.  Her thunderous footsteps shake you each time her heel hits the floor and again when she sets her toes down, subjecting you to non-stop vibrations while she walks.  You do your best to keep holding on despite the difficulties presented by her strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the vibrations stop, and you regret your decision when she brings her other foot in, mashing you between her two muscular thighs.  You can scarcely breathe while held between them, much less move up or to the side, and you hope that she doesn't flex them before you can escape.  There's the sound of a zipper moving followed by fabric hitting the ground, though they're both difficult to discern through the mounds of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lifts up her other leg to step out of her dress and you seize the opportunity, exploding to the side to get out of this trap while you can.  You scurry forward, your foot slipping in your rush, and pass the crest to the front of her thigh before she even sets her other foot down.  Quickly you get your stance back under control, just in time for Fulda to lift up the leg you're clinging to.  With a toe she hooks the dress on the floor and kicks it out of the way, the movement jolting you as you're rocketed to the side, then sets it back down with the familiar vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see that Fulda is looking at herself in a full-length mirror, getting a good view in her yellow bra and panties.  She presses on her six-pack abs and looks over her uniformly tanned skin, trying to find some sort of flaw that you haven't the faintest idea of where to begin.  For your part you look up and down her legs trying to find yourself, finally spotting what looks at first glance like a tear in her stocking a few inches from the top, but on closer inspection is the entirety of your body.  Wow, you really are puny compared to her, and look pathetic clinging to her thigh like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda reaches down with a hand and places a fingertip next to you, then flexes her quads, pushing you outward and straining your grip.  She presses down with her finger, dimpling the skin around it and pulling you towards it.  Apparently satisfied she pulls her hand away and leans down to do the same to her calf.  Once done she stands back up and mutters, \"Looks like it's ab day tomorrow.\"  Before she turns away she waves to you in the mirror and says, \"You're almost there, keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more steps jostle you Fulda leans over again, her fingers grabbing onto the straps of a white chemise on the floor.  While she's bent over her breasts get increasingly close to you, pressing against you when she's fully bent over.  Her bright yellow lace bra engulfs you, and you're just as immobilized by her breasts as you were by her thighs.  The frills rub over your clothes and body, hooking on, though you can't say how secure.  Suddenly she stands, and you feel a powerful tug from her bra.</span></div></div>",

You rocket upward, held against her bra by the interwoven lacing that had worked its way around your legs and clothing until she's nearly fully erect again.  Throughout the ascent you scream uncontrollably and grasp for something to hold on to while you get lifted ever higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fulda can stand all the way up you hear a loud rip, then you're set free from your bonds.  You fly away from her in a free fall, turning end over end as you're thrown forward and plummet downward.  Your trajectory takes you over the rug Fulda has at the foot of her bed and you manage to land at the bottom of her mattress, then bounce several inches along the comforter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan loudly from the pain, and it feels as though large portions of your arm and face have either been skinned off or badly scraped.  For a moment you can do nothing but lie there and feel your skin burning until you hear the thud of Fulda's footfalls.  This draws your attention and your head shoots up to see her walking toward the bed, right on course for where you've fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thuds get louder as Fulda closes in until she's standing at the foot of her bed, towering over you down on top of the covers.  She pauses for a moment to bring her feet together and you look up, sure that she'll look down and spot you.  To your disappointment however she keeps looking forward, and doesn't notice you right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda turns around and begins sitting, dropping her yellow panties-covered butt down toward you.  Your eyes widen while it descends, growing increasingly large in your view until it blots out everything else.  With a crash she sits down, her right buttock directly on top of you.  You're smushed under it, and the pain from dozens of broken bones overrides that from your deep scrapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's butt pushes down harder on you when she pulls up her leg, and you're dragged along the comforter by her slight shift.  \"Hey, where'd you go li'l buddy?\" she asks, her voice muffled by her ass.  You can't even push against it since your arms are pinned by her enormous butt, and it feels like they're broken too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpots appear at the edge of your vision, especially apparent in the absolute darkness under Fulda's ass.  There's a rumble through the mattress when Fulda changes her legs' position, and you're dragged a bit further forward.  Your body stretches like it should never have to and you gasp vainly for breath while Fulda takes her time removing her stockings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lungs burn and everything hurts, but Fulda's enormous weight refuses to move off of you.  Unbeknownst to you she's looking through her stockings and everywhere around the bed to see where you've gone, but doesn't think to look under her.  Unable to breathe you drift off to sleep, never to wake up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Fulda wakes up and walks across the room to take a shower.  In the mirror she spots a large red spot on the butt of her panties.  Curious she takes a closer look and discovers your bled out, suffocated corpse stuck to them.  \"Oh.  Whoops!\" she says, then peels you off and throws you in the trash.</span></div></div>",

You quickly recover from the shock of it, and once she stands back up you force yourself to kick upwards a few more times.  Your climb brings you close enough that you can see the dense, dark fabric of her garter with your own eyes, and you know you'll be at the top in just a few more seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you see Fulda reach behind her back with both arms and reach up between her shoulder blades.  With one quick movement she unclasps her bra and lets it fall to the floor, one of the cups nearly crashing into you as it falls past.  You look up at the bottom of her bare breasts, still bouncing slightly from being freed from the bra.  They look rather large, though proportionate to someone of her size, and she clearly needs no help from any sort of push-up.  Just from here you'd say they're about the size of your old dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda has no intention of putting on a show for you however, and quickly slides the chemise over her head and pulls it down to cover her body.  She slaps her sides to make sure that it's going to stay roughly in place and you take the opportunity to thrust yourself up once more, covering the last inch of the stocking to the dense material above.  You manage to get your feet up to the thicker material, and know that with just one more push you'll be at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can cover that last bit Fulda steps with the leg you're on, pushing you out with her thigh and breaking your focus.  Fulda's foot sets down, creating a familiar set of vibrations from the impact that don't abate until her other foot has set down.  When she begins stepping with this leg again you decide that, hell or high water, you're reaching the top, and throw yourself into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after your foot and hand leave the stocking you have second thoughts.  The push from Fulda's thigh and sudden cessation of movement make it feel like you've been snapped by a leash, and all your limbs not securely grasping something go flying backward.  When she brings her foot down your body slams back into her thigh, leaving you with only one hand to weather the impact from her footfall.  Your fingers shake but don't let go, and you maintain your tenuous grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her other heel set down, and judging by how close Fulda is to her bed it's only one more step until she's there.  Quickly you get your grip back and wait for her thigh to stop moving forward before you push against her muscle with your feet, driving you toward your goal.  The vibrations fro her footfall shake you during your last ascent, making your shoes slip from their spot, but your hand manages to grip the top of the elastic.  Your other hand latches on right when she brings her other foot up, making your body wiggle from the impact as you dangle by your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda spins around, throwing your body horizontal from centripetal force, and slams her butt down on the mattress.  The spin and jolt from her sitting make you lose your grip with one hand, throwing you against the bare skin of her thigh with such force that you nearly sprain your wrist.  After slamming into her leg you stay in place for a moment before swinging back down, dangling by one hand between her thighs.  While you struggle to hang on Fulda looks down and grins, no doubt amused by your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you made it!\" she says, still smiling, and you involuntarily smile back at her.  Then you feel yourself being lifted into the air as she lifts her foot up to set it on the edge of her mattress.  You continue dangling by one hand while you watch the spire of her leg rise a hundred feet into the air before stopping, a spectacle to behold from near the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda works her fingers into the elastic and pushes upward, gently rolling the stocking off of her leg.  You no longer see a reason to hang on and let go, dropping a few inches to land softly atop the feather quilt and her mattress.  You're mere inches from her heel, slowly getting less defined as the nylon gets progressively looser around her leg, and just a bit farther away from her panties.  With a glance up you see her focusing intently on getting the stocking off without tearing it, paying almost no attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything Fulda finishes pulling it off her foot and tosses the empty stocking over to her discarded dress, then slams her leg back down onto the mattress.  The sudden indentation from her leg makes you stumble backward until you bump up against her thigh, and you hear a booming giggle from above.  \"I saw you eyeing my panties down there,\" she says, bringing a hand to rest above you.  \"Why don't you do yourself a favor and stay out of them for now, huh?\"  She taps your head with a fingertip and gives you a noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda brings her other foot up onto the mattress and works her fingers into the elastic of that stocking as well, carefully rolling it down her thigh.  You watch her meticulous work, and the whole process takes about thirty seconds while the nylon is pulled off of her ridiculously long legs.  Once this one's off she also tosses it over to her discarded dress, then turns her attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word she pinches your collar and picks you up from the mattress, falling backwards while you're lifted into the air.  When she lays down her arm abruptly stops, causing you to swing vigorously back and forth in her grip.  She laughs and continues bringing you forward, lowering you towards her face.  When you pass over her chin she opens her mouth and starts lowering you into it, then slams her teeth shut just beneath your feet.  Fulda bursts out laughing again, spraying you with spittle, and says, \"You're too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she sets you down on the tip of her nose and lets go, leaving you to stand unsupported on the cartilage.  You struggle to find some way to put your feet so that you won't go tumbling off at the slightest of movement and resolve to sit down, straddling the bridge of her nose.  \"Man, you're really small,\" she says, reiterating her previous point.  You simply look her in one of her eyes in response.  \"And I did that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  And how's it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels great!  I always feel so powerful after I shrink someone and they're at my feet, begging for their lives.  'No Fulda, don't step on me!'\"  She laughs at her high-pitched impersonation, then continues, \"And of course I usually step on 'em.  Or keep 'em for a while.  In fact there was this one time back in high school...\"  She trails off.  \"But we can talk about that tomorrow, if you make it that long.  Find somewhere comfortable and let me know so I can turn off the light, and don't shrink!\"  With that she turns her head, throwing you off her nose, and turns onto her side, leaving you to find a spot to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Quickly you look from her head all the way down to her feet hanging off the edge of the mattress, looking for somewhere that might be safe, and resolve that the best spot would be somewhere on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Fulda's face and stand under her nose, looking for an easy way to get up to her cheek.  She keeps her eyes open to watch you, and hot breath from her nose blasts you while you make your decision.  Her lips are a no-go, since you might slide through them into her mouth, and even if not she might push you in anyway.  Climbing the nose seems like a terrible idea too, and without poking her in the eyes you don't see how that route could be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to get there, you realize, is to climb up her hair.  You start walking around her head, her cold eyes following you until you pass her eyebrows.  Fulda sighs as you walk along her forehead and move on to her long, straight strands of auburn hair, not sure what you're doing but certain that you're keeping her up.  At last you reach the back of her head, where her braids come together with a blue ribbon, and you feel this is the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on one braid you grab several strands of hair from the other in each hand, then use it to pull yourself up like a rope.  Fulda's soft, silky hair proves easy to hold on to and strong, more than enough to support your weight of a few ounces.  You climb up the braid until you feel that it's flattened out enough for you to walk along it and then you let go, not wanting to pull out her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you stand you sink until you're waist-deep in Fulda's braid, and have to carefully climb over it with your legs until you get out.  In front of you is Fulda's ear, sticking out just far enough that, were you outside, you would be able to take shelter under it from the rain.  You high-step through her thick strands of hair and pass her earlobe, then look at the wide plain of her cheek that is to be your bed tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walk out onto her skin you're surprised by how easily it gives to your footsteps, and how soft it looks up close.  Here and there is some light freckling that would have certainly gone unnoticed were you not literally walking across it.  You lay down in the middle and snuggle close, getting as comfortable as you can.  \"Okay, I'm good,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a minute I thought you were gonna try to be the big spoon,\" Fulda says, reaching behind to turn off the lamp.  You're jostled slightly then there's a loud click, and the room is plunged into darkness, the only light coming from her laptop.  \"Oh, and don't try to Incept me.  It never works.\"  In only a few moments she drifts off to sleep, and you follow soon after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having arrived much too early for your next class you decide to take a seat on a nearby couch and wait for the door to open.  At the very least you can get some reading done while you wait, and it beats having to walk back to your apartment only to have to come back.  You reach into your bag and pull out your planner to see if you have anything you can get done in less than thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even crack the cover you hear footsteps coming up the hallway toward you.  You raise your eyes and see Vevina, one of your classmates, gaze absorbed by her phone while she approaches.  When she gets close she looks up, sees you on the couch, and lets out a light sigh.  \"I knew my clock was running fast,\" she says, sitting down next to you.  \"Oh well.  How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you get ready to make some small-talk, but the floor rumbling beneath your feet derails your train of thought.  \"The hell was that?\" you ask rhetorically.  \"I've never heard of an earthquake here.\"  Before Vevina can answer the floor shakes again, more intensely this time, and it's accompanied by a booming thud as if something large hit the ground hard.  Over the next half minute the booms get progressively louder and the floor shakes even more until you could swear it's coming from just outside the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final thud loud as an artillery strike rings out, and the building shakes with enough force to rattle the windows in their frames.  Outside a dark shape blocks sunlight from reaching the windows, casting the hallway into dim lighting.  You rush to the window and throw open the curtains, then recoil from what you see outside.  A burnished metal circle the size of your head is in front of you, and a white shoelace runs through it, contrasting heavily with the black canvas of the shoe it's on.  Quickly you close the curtains and back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud thump and the building shakes when something lands heavily on the roof, shaking the hanging plants and knocking books off the shelves.  Cracks appear along the wall and drywall falls off while the shaking intensifies, and you can do little but stand, unsure if it would be any safer if you left.  You peer through the window slot in the door and see the students inside taking cover under their desks from debris falling from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an ear-splitting crack the roof is torn away, exposing you to whatever it is that's been causing this.  Fingertips curl around the edges of the roof as long cracks appear along its length, and you realize that an enormous hand has torn the building's roof off.  Dread takes root in your gut and the hand tosses the roof aside for it to shatter against the ground hundreds of feet away, and the hand moves aside enough for you to see past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding astride the building and leaning over it like it's some sort of ant farm is Fulda, her blue eyes alight with pleasure.  Her legs stretch up dozens if not hundreds of feet before going into her black shorts, and a low chuckle escapes from her pink lips.  \"Found you!\" she says, her booming voice echoing throughout what remains of the building.  A hand grabs you by the arm and pulls, dragging you along while you continue to stare transfixed at Fulda.  While you watch Fulda reaches down and sets her hand against the top of the classroom's wall, thumb pointed downward.  With one thrust she jams it into the room, filling it entirely amidst the grinding of metal and screams of your fellow students as they're crushed beneath her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVevina pulls on you harder and your brain finally kicks in, allowing you to start running away from Fulda.  You quickly run past her and start pulling her along to the nearest stairwell, where you jump down the stairs two at a time.  At the bottom you reach the glass doors and find that the doors are blocked by an enormous wall of white and black rubber which bends slightly when Fulda twitches her toes.  Fortunately the impact of her footfalls and tearing off the roof has broken the glass, and the two of you are able to duck under the push bars and slip out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run along the tight space between Fulda's shoe and the building, dragging Vevina along with you as you go.  After what seems like forever you pass the toe of her shoe and turn, running along the curve of her shoe.  As you pass Fulda lifts up her shoe and rotates it on her heel, lining it up with the building you just left.  Violently she slams her shoe back down, knocking the walls down and smashing everyone inside with a deafening crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust from the debris spreads quickly, engulfing the two of you in a haze within seconds.  You cough and cover your nose and mouth with your free arm while running, trying to put some space between you and the giantess.  Rubber grinds against concrete as Fulda rotates her show about its heel again and sets it down parallel with you with another crash and shock wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a firm yank on your arm when Vevina falls, and you take several seconds to stop so you can go back for her.  She's lying on the ground at the edge of the dust cloud, having tripped over some debris on the ground, and looks to be having trouble getting back up.  You reach her just when Fulda sets the heel of her other shoe down behind her, the sole looming over you.  Vevina grabs your hand and you pull her up just when Fulda's shoe swings down, crushing your friend beneath it with the force of a truck slamming into a wall.  Fulda grinds her shoe into the ground and you're left holding Vevina's severed hand, blood splattered across your clothes and face.  At least, you tell yourself, it was quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you are frozen in shock, staring up at Fulda through the haze of dust from the building's wreckage, still holding your friend's hand.  She's large enough to block out the afternoon sun at the very least, and as she looks down at you she places her hands on her hips.  Fulda lets out a booming laugh and lifts her foot, revealing Vevina's mangled body ground into the pavement.  Her shoe rises higher, allowing you to see the rest of your friend stuck to her shoe, and the urge to run finally kicks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and drop Vevina's hand, running as hard as you can for the nearest building.  Fulda stomps her foot down on top of you, heel slamming back on the concrete while her toe is temporarily propped up by the building.  Before it can collapse under her weight you leap to the side, just barely escaping from under her sole before it can slam down with a thunderous roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you recover from the shock you continue your pace, and decide to take shelter inside the nearby student union.  Rubber grinds against concrete again as Fulda repositions her shoe so that you're between her feet again, and you just barely stay safely within her shoe's instep.  You run along the inside of her shoe and push off from the toe, the rubber giving you a short boost away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blow past a low wall and some shrubs then turn toward what you think should take you toward the student union building only to stop dead in your tracks.  Not only is no one else here, it looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time.  All the doors are boarded up and the lights are off, and on either side leading away are twenty foot high brick walls.  Frantically you run up to one of the walls and look for a way past it but find nothing - it appears to be one solid brick laid in the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more pounding footsteps and Converse flank you on each side, trapping you against the wall.  You look up at Fulda who regards you from on high, a smug grin on her face.  \"Nowhere to hide, nowhere left to run, huh?\" she booms, then laughs at your predicament.  She raises a shoe and holds it above you, the distinct diamond pattern blocking her face with the imprint of your friend's remains still evident on the tip of the toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoe races toward you with you centered under the widest part of her shoe, making any escape impossible.  The wall disappears as her shoe draws near and you fall backward, no longer having anything to lean against.  Before you even hit the ground Fulda's enormous Converse slams down, flattening you easily.  Everything goes black.</span></div></div>",

Light pours through the windows and onto you, giving you a throbbing headache when you manage to pry your eyes open, and your mouth is entirely devoid of moisture.  You instinctively try to pull the blanket back over your head until you remember that your sole source of heat is Fulda's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's hand reaches up and hits a button on her phone, showing that it's a little bit after ten am and she has two digits worth of notifications.  She groans again and turns her head, causing you to shift backward on her cheek.  Friction gives way to gravity and you fall off her face, clip her ear's cartilage with your legs, and land on her pillow.  She continues to roll over until she ends up atop you, pinning you beneath a pile of red hair packed against her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm weakly under her as you try to poke through her hair without getting tangled, barely able to muster the energy to move your limbs.  Fulda makes a sound like she's started, then says, \"Oh fuck, sorry little guy, forgot you were there.\"  Her voice sounds tired and a little hoarse, and she's probably just as hungover as you are.  She lifts her head, pulling you to your feet as you have a hand jammed into her thick hair, and you quickly pull your hand free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you disentangle yourself from her hair you stagger towards the pillow's edge, the pillow's soft ground not helping your complete lack of desire to do anything right now.  After a few seconds Fulda gets tired of holding her head up and lays it back down, slamming it into the pillow.  You're briefly pitched up into the air and land in the well created by her weight, causing you to slide down until you bump against her nose.  She giggles for a second then lets loose another groan, this one much louder than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to get out of bed right now,\" Fulda complains, flakes of dried skin and lip gloss landing on the pillow beside you.  \"I've got, like, a killer headache, and it looks like my phone's been blowing up all night, it'll probably take an hour to get through all this stuff.\"  You push yourself up so that you're leaning against the tip of her nose, causing her to smile involuntarily.  \"But I have a study group later, and the gym, and I'll probably feel better if I eat something and shower, but then again my bed is real warm.\"  She sighs, the warm breeze bringing much appreciated moisture, and thinks about what to do.</span></div></div>",

She moves her hand forward, pushing you into the tip of her noses cartilage while her fingers squeeze it, making a solid cell around you.  Her fingers slide back off her nose and come together, closing around you and pulling you off the pillow and away from her face.  While you welcome the darkness inside her hand even the small movement upsets your stomach, and you clinch your mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda does her best to keep her hand still while she throws off her queen-sized sheets but you're still bounced around between her fingers, making you feel queasy.  When she stands she takes a moment to stretch, lifting you up above her head while every muscle in her body is briefly lengthened and many of her joints pop.  The hand you're in stops when it bumps against the ceiling  so she opens her fingers, and you find yourself mere inches away from the smooth paint.  She places her fingers and palm firmly against the ceiling and stretches them as well, leaving a small dip in her palm for you while she stands on her toes, pressing her hand against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done she brings her arms back down, clamping her fingers around you again before her hands rush down to her sides.  The sudden acceleration makes your stomach jump up into your throat and you feel certain that you're going to puke, but after heaving a few times it's clear that you simply have nothing to eject.  \"Oh, sorry,\" Fulda says, cognizant of the g-forces she just subjected you to.  \"You're probably in just as bad of a state as I am this morning, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda begins walking, her steps slower and much clumsier than they had been the day before.  You are able to see between her fingertips that you're being held down by her thighs, the toned muscle evident on her naked flesh.  Quickly you poke your head forward, risking vertigo to look up at her panties pulled taut around her tight butt, then down at her bare feet slapping against the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches the stairs and you pull your head back in, securing yourself inside her hand.  Her descent is slow and measured, the pounding from each footfall on a step reverberating through the air and shaking you against her fingers.  You do your best to find cushioning whenever possible, and soon enough Fulda is back on flat hardwood instead of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your ride is fairly close to what you have become accustomed to, and you watch her muscular thighs pass by like indomitable columns with each step.  When Fulda reaches the table she sets you down on the edge, allowing you to see three other women already seated - one has her forehead resting on her palm while another is slouching deeply in her chair, and only one seems capable of functioning right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Fulda!\" the last one says, and you recognize the voice as Mariam's.  Fulda merely rolls her eyes in response and takes a bowl from the center of the table, then places it just behind you.  She sits, dropping her massive frame into a solid wooden chair, and leans over you, the skin-tight white chemise covering her towering torso coming close enough to rustle your hair as she looms over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thud comes from both sides as Fulda slams down a milk jug and box of cereal.  You watch her domineering form flip open the box and pour its contents into the bowl, making a series of loud pings while the grains rush into the ceramic, followed shortly after by the milk.  She sets them back down in the middle and picks up her spoon, then looks down at you on the edge of the table.  Her eyes go wide and she exclaims, \"Whoops, forgot something!\"</span></div></div>",

Out of curiosity you tilt your head back, looking up her monumental torso, until you are looking directly into her eyes.  A feeling of discomfort strikes when you realize that Fulda is looking down at you, her gaze unwavering.  With a smile she says, \"Protein!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can bolt away her hand is already upon you, Fulda's fingers slapping into the table top in front of you with a loud crack.  Her fingers swing inward and knock you off your feet, lifting you up until you are pressed against her palm.  She picks you up from the table in a rush, and your head spins as you're subjected to sudden and extreme acceleration in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fulda's fingers open you find yourself over a vast pond of milk filled rafts of square processed wheat stacked upon each other until they break the waterline.  Your brief fall ends with you atop one of these rafts which quickly capsizes under your impact, dumping you into the near-freezing milk.  The cold attacks every millimeter of your skin, sending you into agony as you sink beneath the surface and making even the slightest of movements a Herculean effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of struggling and grasping with nearby wheat rafts you manage to fight your way to the surface and hold on firmly enough to a grain strand to float.  You surface just in time to see Fulda plunging downward with her spoon, piercing the milk only a centimeter to your side.  Ripples buffet you as she scoops up some food then reach an even higher intensity when her spoon emerges, a small flotilla of rafts stacked upon the basin.  She carries the pallet of food up to her mouth and shoves it between her lips, depositing a granary's worth of wheat onto her tongue.  Fulda chews for a couple seconds then swallows, a lump visibly moving down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout pause Fulda sends the spoon back into the bowl, this time breaking the surface directly behind you.  The metal handle rests gently in Fulda's fingers a mere few inches above you, and the waves from its submergence force you to bob up and down.  You relinquish your grip on the grain raft and try to sink as quickly as possible to escape the pull of Fulda's latest implement of destruction.</span></div></div>",

In no time at all you're swept up in the path of Fulda's mighty spoon, gathering all of the cereal in its way into its curved surface.  As it drives forward you're pushed back into the soggy grains accumulated inside the spoon already, and in turn you're covered by the saturated cereal that you're forcibly pushed into, the wet fibers breaking up and forming to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's spoon breaks the surface, allowing you to see and breathe once more as the excess milk spills out of it.  The sudden onrush of warm air hits you, in deep contrast with the chilly milk you have been immersed in, and you begin shivering.  It still feels like pins have been shoved into every pore on your body from the cold, sapping your strength and making your already restricted movement sluggish.  You are firmly trapped between two masses of water-logged cereal, your weakened limbs barely able to move within the thick mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy sheer dumb luck your head remains free of the soggy squares, allowing you to breathe without issue and, more importantly, plead with Fulda.  \"Hey, don't eat me!\" you shout, trying to wiggle a little bit in the restrictive sludge.  \"I'm in your spoon!  It's your little drinking buddy, remember?\"  If Fulda heard you begging she shows no sign, and your swift journey to her lips continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the spoon comes to a complete stop, and some of the indiscernible mass slides down off you. Fulda grins mischievously and booms, \"Sorry little guy, that's life!\"  She turns the spoon around with a giggle, sliding you along the curve while the mush formed around your body deforms even more.  The spoon's rotation stops with you pointed at a white skyscraper-sized box of cereal, and when your eyes finish scanning the enormous letters you finally catch Fulda's pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly the spoon rotates back, whipping you along the inside curve and loosening the wet cereal around you even more when you come face to face with Fulda's lips again.  She draws you toward her mouth again, pausing once more  when you're able to look right up her nostrils.  \"Don't take it personally,\" Fulda says, her voice an explosive rumble this close to her lips.  \"I've shrank a few boyfriends while making out so that I could eat them, it's fun.  This doesn't make what we had any less special, it really is me, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily Fulda chuckles at her own joke then opens her mouth wide, and you find yourself looking straight into the deep, dark cave behind her lips.  She jabs the spoon forward just when you scramble for the side, trying to roll over the edge of the spoon and escape from becoming part of Fulda's breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately you bounce off, the fatty tissue inside her lip projecting you away from her mouth as it slams closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop from her mouth past her chin down to her chest, where you land on the exposed part on the top of her breast.  Fulda's skin indents under you then quickly snaps back, pushing you up and onto the smooth fabric of her white chemise.

She crosses her leg over the one that you are currently laying on, turning the vast expanse of her hamstring into your whole view.  You realize you would never be able to get clear before she sets it down and decide to remain on your back so that her thousand-pound thigh won't land on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Fulda's leg comes down quickly, hitting you hard across your entire body and pinning you between her thighs.  You try to move your arms but find them held fast between the flesh, and you're able to do little more than wiggle your fingers.  Breathing becomes difficult but not impossible as Fulda leaves a small crack so that you won't suffocate.  Clearly she has done this before and it is just another of her games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough breathing is possible, it is not pleasant.  The enormous weight from Fulda's thigh on your chest makes it so you can only expand your lungs with much effort, and the small amount of air getting to you is warmed enough by her body heat so that it is unpleasant for you to inhale.  In short order you begin sweating as well: the space between her thighs is like a convection oven, and her body heat swiftly becomes unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVibrations wrack your body when Fulda speaks, minute waves traveling down from her vocal cords to her legs.  \"How's everyone feeling this morning?\" she asks as if she doesn't have you trapped between her legs.  Fortunately for you the conversation is a no-go, since the other women only respond with groans or nothing at all.  After a brief pause the distorted sound of metal on porcelain reaches your ears when Fulda begins eating again upon realizing that socialization is not going to happen right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you Fulda takes her time with this meal, and your position becomes even more uncomfortable.  Your arms begin to feel strained from being held in place for so long, and the heat truly gets to you.  Sweat pours out of your body and mingles with the meager amount of milk that splashed out when you landed on her thigh, creating a runny white mixture laden with salt.  However, once Fulda finishes her meal she does not hang around for long.</span></div></div>",

She uncrosses her legs, lifting the one over you high in the air so that it can clear her knee, and you sigh with relief when the pressure around you dissipates.  To your surprise however your view remains dominated entirely by her thigh, and you feel yourself being moved much more than expected.  Through the huge build-up of sweat you've become stuck to her skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets her foot back on the ground with a resounding thud, shaking you as her taut skin vibrates with the impact.  She stands, tipping you upside down so that blood rushes to your head, and takes a step.  Her bare foot slapping against the tile floor is very distinct, and you weather the resulting vibrations as best you can.  There's a loud clatter when she sets her bowl down on the counter, then she turns to head upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain glued to the back of Fulda's thigh while she walks, unable to see anything outside of a very small patch of tanned skin in front of your eyes.  Each time she takes a step you feel yourself get swung upward, then brought back down, followed by the tremor of her footfall running up her leg.  Despite this you don't dare try to move or readjust out of fear of breaking the tenuous seal that holds you against her leg and plummeting down to the floor below.  Your situation is far from pleasant, but it could be much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip upstairs is mercifully short, with Fulda's long legs taking the steps three at a time during the ascent.  Her skin pulls tight each time the leg you're on lifts, threatening the weak bond of sweat keeping you on her skin.  Lucky for you the sweat moves easily enough with her stride, and not even the powerful shocks from her feet slamming down are enough to dislodge you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you're back upstairs, and you hear the click of her door when she pushes it closed.  You endure a few more steps, and expect to be freed at any moment as she flops herself down on her bed.  Instead you hear her feet slapping against tile again, and another door close.  A handle squeaks as Fulda turns it, and you hear water pouring out of a faucet and splashing against a smooth surface.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A wall of yellow fabric rushes past when Fulda slides her panties off, the whole for her leg wide enough to avoid hitting you.  She steps out of her undergarments and kicks them off the bath mat, then drops her chemise atop them.  Fully naked now, Fulda swings her luscious legs over the side of the tub and steps into the stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up Fulda's thigh to her round, bare butt above you, with rivulets of water running down her body toward you.  She stoops over and steps under the shower head, too tall to stand under it normally, and begins soaking her thick locks of red hair.  Water continues streaming down her body, and in a few seconds more it reaches your legs.  In no time the fresh water dissolves the bond created by sweat and the current swings your legs over, wrenching you off her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing holding you up anymore you swiftly plummet down the length of her leg, racing toward the ceramic at her feet.  Near the bottom you hit her Achilles tendon and ramp off her heel, which sends you skipping along the thin layer of water that's gathered on the base of the tub.  You roll along the base, getting thoroughly soaked in the process, until you come to a stop several inches away.  With a groan you stand back up in the ankle-deep water and turn back toward Fulda, only to see her gathering her hair around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou creep closer to her, your feet sloshing in the water that continues to build up, until you're standing against her heel again.  Briefly you stare up the tremendous length of her body and watch her rub shampoo into her hair then place a hand against her wet skin for support.  Cautiously you walk along her heel to get between her feet, reaching the instep of her massive foot in about half a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling this is good enough you look up Fulda's tremendous body again, and spot a shock of red hair on her vagina at the top of her towering legs.  Your gaze continues past that and her sculpted abs to see her ample breasts hanging down, angled forward slightly from her posture.  Her eyes are closed while her hands run through her hair, and she pays you no mind while you gawk at her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's precious little time to enjoy the view though, since a torrential downpour of water splashes around you as she rinses out her hair.  Soap suds slide down her glistening body, and the water around you gets murky as the chemicals mix with water pooling up to your knees now.  You fight your way through the bubbles forming in the froth toward the front of her foot while large water droplets continue their bombardment, their ceaseless stream splashing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrenched with second-hand shampoo, you're able to carefully wade up to Fulda's big toe and look up at the ledge created by her toenail.  You hop up and place your hands firmly on the slick toenail, seeking some small imperfection you can use as a hand-hold, and brace your feet against her skin.  With a quick scramble you manage to get atop her toe, finally out of the rising pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda grabs a loofah and begins saturating it with soap, causing more clouds of suds to drop down and splash off her foot so that they can pool in the water around it.  Continuing to pay you no mind Fulda scrubs herself down, rubbing the loofah all over her chest and arms so that soap streaks down her towering body.  You begin to be pelted by water flowing out of the shower head with enough force to stagger you forward, driving you up her foot.  Briefly you think about how even a gentle shower stream is now enough to toss you around like nothing while you fight to remain standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finishes with her upper body Fulda moves on to her legs, scrubbing her immaculate thighs deeply all around.  You look up in hope that she is able to spot you, but find her focused solely on the task of cleaning herself.  Your attention is drawn upward for so long you fail to notice a cluster of bubbles slide off her shin and onto her foot, directly on a course for you.  Before you can move to get away the suds engulf you in their white cleaning bubbles, hiding you inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can escape you're roughly shoved backward, sliding down her foot and back into the water when Fulda begins scrubbing the top of her foot.  The bubbles quickly dissipate into the water around you, and you find yourself treading water while you look up at her.  You stand back up in the waist-high water and fight the current pulling you back to struggle toward her foot again while the water buffets you as it pours off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lifts up her heel and scrubs the underside of her foot, creating a resounding clang that upsets your stomach when she sets it back down.  You reach her toes right when she turns her attention to them, cleaning in between each one to generate a tremendous pool of runny soap around you.  Desperately you begin waving your arms and splashing in the water, hopeful that you can make yourself visible enough in the churning waters that she can pick you out.  Her blue eyes flash forward just as she finishes cleaning her feet, and you hope she spotted you.</span></div></div>",

The cloud of bubbles continues to swell as she finishes cleaning herself, burying your head in the white foam.  You sputter in an attempt to force the bitter soap out of your mouth, and find yourself unable to breathe without inhaling a mouthful of runoff from Fulda's shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately before you begin suffocating two enormous fingers close around your arms, and you're lifted out of the miasma on the bathtub's floor.  You rocket upward when Fulda stands, causing you to become lightheaded before you even reach her pussy.  It is a struggle to remain conscious during your ascent up her chest, but the acceleration lessens and you find yourself able to focus by the time you're at her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda holds you still in front of her face, looking your tiny, soap-streaked body over with a bemused look.  \"Showering together is a big step in a relationship,\" she finally says with a grin.  Hot water runs down her fingers and onto you, washing away some of the soap that has accumulated on you, and she continues.  \"Especially when one of the people can slip down the drain or get lost in the bubbles.\"  She turns off the shower with a loud squeak, and water finally stops raining down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Fulda stands there, just as drenched as you are, so that water can run off her body and go down the drain.  She continues looking at you with that same grin on her face, her motives inscrutable behind her cold eyes.  \"Don't worry, my bite-sized buddy,\" she booms, breaking the awkward silence, \"we'll have more fun later.  I promise.\"  With that she throws open the curtain and lifts up her leg, stepping over the edge of the tub and onto her waiting bathmat..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick movement Fulda stretches her arm out, places you atop the skin's counter, and opens her fingers before reaching for a white towel off the rack.  She wraps it around her torso, though because of her immense height it's barely wide enough to simultaneously cover her bulging breasts and her pussy.  Once the towel is secure she steps forward and leans against the sink, her legs long enough that there's a small gap between the top of the counter and bottom of the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you stare up at Fulda towering over you she reaches into the cabinet high above you and gets ready to brush her teeth.  It seems as though she is paying you no mind, and you could easily climb up beneath the towel if you wanted.  If you do though she probably won't like it, and you might be better off on the outside, waiting for her to finish.</span></div></div>",

Her arms wave about above you while she puts toothpaste on her toothbrush, and you remain in place, looking up at her from your position on the sink.  A stream of water briefly rushes down and is swiftly cut off, and you are left looking up in the sudden confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not left to guess what is happening for very long, since Fulda immediately shoves the moistened toothbrush into her mouth.  As she rotates it up and down along her teeth you cannot help but be transfixed, looking up at her while she goes about her daily business.  For the moment you stare up the tremendous length of her body, watching her brush her teeth as you have thousands of times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour position remains static as the titaness goes about her daily ritual, seemingly paying you no mind as she does so.  Her exposed, tanned thighs present tempting targets as she does so, easy vectors for you to find your way up her makeshift skirt.  For the moment however you resist the urge to climb up the interior of her towel, awestruck by her mere presence as she looms over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand transfixed while she goes about her daily chore, realizing just how much goes into this basic activity that you had not even thought about before.  For a couple minutes she goes about it, thoroughly cleaning every crevice within her mouth.  For a moment you stand relieved.  At least you were not forced into Fulda's mouth before she cleaned it, you tell yourself, and she is going about starting her day the proper way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda decides she has spent enough time doing this and removes the toothbrush from her mouth.  The titaness leans over the sink, her enormous frame having to bunch up considerably to accommodate the limited room provided for her.  A shadow falls over you as she does so, accompanied by the harsh impact of a single drop that slips out of her mouth.  Quickly you step out of the way, barely avoiding the giantess's saliva as it spreads around its splash zone as it spreads around where it lands.  You remain in her shadow while Fulda expels her saliva and rinses her mouth, the enormous torso above you more than enough to serve as your makeshift ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Fulda stands back up, and you are left looking back up at her, hopeful that she remembers you.  Briefly she rinses out her toothbrush with another torrent of water, then hangs it back above the sink.  Again you look up at her, curious what she will do - and, more importantly to you, if she will pay some mind to you.</span></div></div>",

Gingerly she removes her hair dryer from its mount and pulls it back toward her, then looks down at you and suppresses a giggle.  \"What's the matter down there, little buddy?\" she asks, pressing herself into the sink hard enough that her thigh skin begins pressing over the edge.  You back up as she encroaches against you, the edge of her towel nearly over your head.  She snorts and adds, \"Worried that I'm too much woman for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud roar emits from the blow dryer after she presses the switch with her thumb, and she continues by shouting over the racket, \"You're right about that, at least.\"  Fulda's damp hair is buffeted by the strong breeze, whipping across her face and shedding water in a fine mist.  \"I'm not here for you to treat me like a jungle gym unless it's for my amusement.  If you understand that maybe there's some hope for you after all.\"  You shout a reply back up to her, but you can not even hear your own voice over the whirring motor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that she has made her message clear Fulda backs off from the sink, leaving two faint red lines across her legs, and turns her attention up to the mirror.  As her hair dries out it gets whipped more forcefully by the hot winds blowing out of the cylinder until it's nearly free of all dampness, flapping freely behind her with the breeze.  You are struck with the impression of her as a majestic titaness standing astride a mountain, wind currents tussling her hair while she regards the Earth for hundreds of miles at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour illusion is broken by two loud clicks, turning the deafening roar into a low groan so she can do some touch-ups.  While her bountiful dark red locks bounce in the gentle breeze she begins speaking again, treating you as the captive audience that you are.  \"You don't know how luck you are,\" she starts.  \"So many men on this campus would kill to come to one of our sorority parties, we spread word that they're absolutely to die for.\"  Fulda lets out a loud chuckle, then continues, \"But they can't.  They're too tall.  We only invite the puniest men so that they can look up in awe at us before we make them even punier.  And you, being the puniest of them all, got to be my date.\"  With one final click the roaring stops, and she looks down at you again.  \"And since you didn't disappoint, I decided not to smash you last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fulda busts out into laughter, doubling over and leaning against the sink so that she nearly topples over you like a downed sequoia.  Her warm breath batters you repeatedly as the laughs belt out until she is finally able to catch her breath.  \"Oh shit, I forgot!\" she shouts with enough force to blow your hair back.  \"You're soaking wet too!  Let me fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands back up and points the blow dryer at you, the barred barrel centered around your tiny form.  You look up into the opening and see the coils inside still glowing red.  She flicks her thumb and hot gale-force winds pour out and lift you off your feet, throwing you against the sink's porcelain basin.  The wind is strong enough to hold you aloft while the air batters you, making your skin ripple from the force.  Then, as suddenly as it started, she turns it off, allowing you to slide down the rounded surface to come to a stop against the drain.  To her credit, your skin and clothes are now bone dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay crumpled against the metal stopper, your ears ringing from the noise, spots in your vision from the impact, and sore all over.  With great effort you push yourself onto your back and force your eyes open.  It is impossible to make your eyes focus, but you see the clear outline of an enormous hand descending toward you.  Barely able to move you lay still as the hand overtakes you, blocking out all light from the fixtures above.</span></div></div>",

The pressure on your chest is relieved shortly after, to be replaced almost immediately when you are squeezed on both sides by her thumb and forefinger.  Once her grip is solid Fulda pulls you out of the sink and rushes you to her eye level so that she can look you over.  A critical blue iris scans you for several seconds before you are slowly moved away, Fulda apparently finding you to her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud billowing sound when she removes her towel, the terrycloth fabric thrown about by her free arm.  Quickly she slides the towel onto its rack so that the sopping wet rectangle can dry - it's difficult to find towels that both look cute and can effectively dry off someone of Fulda's size after a shower.  Her bare foot slaps against the tile then she stoops over slightly to avoid hitting her head on the door frame.  You look down at Fulda's naked body and find that you're unable to see anything beyond her full bosom directly below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in her room Fulda deposits you onto her desk, allowing you to slip between her fingers near the edge.  While you fight to stop sliding and kick your way back from the edge she walks over to her enormous dresser, opens a drawer, and pulls out a pair of white panties and a white sports bra.  She quickly slides the panties on, pulling them up her long legs to her waist, where the fabric strains to contain her enormous round butt.  Just as easily she slips her arms into the bra and secures it around herself, gathering up and supporting her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her underwear secured Fulda heads into the closet and closes the door behind her, so you take the opportunity to survey the area around you.  The desk itself is very wide, being able to serve multiple purposes.  Behind you is an enormous black disc that comes up to about your waist, and between you and the rest of the desk is a series of black cylinders three times your height.  Beyond that you can see a line of pencils and odd brushes arranged in a row, and you notice that the ground here is covered in a fine powder that sticks to your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet door opens again, the sound of the doorknob turning interrupting your cursory inspection.  Fulda steps over the threshold fully dressed, wearing a black knee-length skirt that billows slightly as she walks and a tight three-quarters sleeve shirt with horizontal orange and white stripes.  Her enormous feet, sheathed in bright white ankle socks, stride across the carpet toward the desk until she stands directly before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of my outfit, little guy?\" she asks, staring down at you.  Quickly you look from the black cloth in front of you up her imposing torso until you can look her in the eyes, and give her a quick thumbs up.  Fulda smiles and says, \"Oh, you're just saying that because I could pound you into dust right now.  Good choice!\"  She lingers a moment longer, trying to decide how to proceed.</span></div></div>",

Luckily they wrap around the black disc behind you and lift it off the desk, barely missing your head as she pulls it back toward herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly Fulda's powerful fingers manipulate the object, easily prying it open in her hands.  She withdraws a small circle covered in powder, and you realize that this enormous object is a simple compact, able to fit into any purse or handbag.  Fulda regards herself in the mirror while applying foundation over her face, adding an even more bronzed appearance to her complexion.  As she does this excess powder falls away in a cloud, with flakes of it getting caught in your hair or landing on your clothes.  You try to brush it off as it lands, but after a few seconds realize the futility of doing so and decide to simply endure it until she is finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally finishes you are sputtering from flakes of foundation that landed on your lips, and she closes it with a loud snap.  Fulda replaces it where it had previously been resting, nearly bowling you over in the process, and grabs one of the towering black cylinders in front of her.  In a simple motion she pulls the top half off, revealing a metallic pole underneath.  With a quick twist of her hand a narrow pink rod extends from the inside, and it dawns on you that those indomitable cylinders are just lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda begins to set the lid back down on the desk, but after an askew glance in your direction seems to change her mind.  She rotates it in her hand so that it is totally vertical and raises her arm as though she's rearing back to throw it.  However, with a sudden burst of movement she brings it down on top of you, the opening perfectly centered to land with you in the middle.  The plastic lid slams down with an echoing crack, stunning you from its sheer volume, and you are plunged into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you recover from the horrendous racket you begin trying to get out from under it.  It is difficult to orient yourself in the dark, but you tell yourself that no matter which direction you go you are going to run into the wall.  You place your hands on the rounded interior and begin pushing in an attempt to topple it over, but succeed only in scooting it along the desk's surface.  Each time you push on it the lid moves a little bit more, but does not even begin to topple over.  You resolve to keep pushing it, sure that you will eventually reach the edge, until Fulda places a finger atop it, holding it firmly in place with you quite unable to overpower her finger.  Absent anything you can do you lean up against a curved wall and wait to be released from your plastic prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to wait several minutes, but at last you feel the impact of fingertips on either side of you.  Before you can push yourself away from the wall Fulda tears it away, leaving you to stagger backward and fall down onto the hard wood surface.  Her face hovers a mere few inches away with you centered between her eyes and flowing red locks gathered in pools on either side of you.  \"Oh little buddy,\" she begins in a sing-song voice, \"do you still think I'm pretty?\"  You nod in the affirmative, and she grins.  \"You've been making all sorts of good decisions this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sits back up and pinches you in between her fingers, lifting you from the desk once again.  \"But now it's time for me to make a decision.\"  She stands and continues holding you at chest level, just out of arm's reach of her heaving bosom.  \"It's time for me to head out, and I can't leave you here all alone in a house full of giant women.  Something horrible might happen to you without my protection!  So I'm going to put you somewhere so that you'll be away from prying eyes.\"</span></div></div>",

She pinches it as firmly as she is you and drags it off the table, letting it dangle from waist level.  Slowly she begins lowering you down as well, holding you against her body while you eye the hem of her skirt with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the perfect place for you,\" Fulda declares when you pass the top of her skirt.  \"It'll be cozy and warm, with plenty of fresh air... so long as you behave yourself.\"  Her eyes peek over her chest to watch you descend, and you sense a precocious joy in them.  When you are halfway down the waterfall of fabric her other hand seizes the base, hiking it up to the top of her leg.  She sets you against the smooth skin on the inside of her thigh and lifts her foot to plant it on the chair, turning you sideways as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her skirt up with her wrist Fulda moves her other hand inward, planting her middle finger on your chest and releasing the pinch from your sides.  Delicately she tosses the two ends of the ribbon around her thigh, pulling it taut so that it firmly holds you against the thigh and covers the entirety of your chest up to your armpits.  Working fast she ties the two ends into a knot on the opposite side of her leg, keeping the narrow strip of cloth tight enough to secure you and slightly presses into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is satisfied Fulda pulls her hands away, allowing her skirt to slightly unfurl along her leg, and lifts her foot from the chair.  Immediately she stomps it on the ground, throwing you downward against the ribbon with the boom of her foot's impact, but you are firmly held in place.  She lifts her foot again until you are level with her heel and slams it down once more, shaking you with the intense force but still not budging you.  \"Tap me two times if you're still there!\" she demands, and you quickly comply.  She twiddles her toes inside her socks in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down the length of her leg and get the impression of it as a towering spire, with you hanging off the observation deck of a great monument.  Just when it begins to sink in however Fulda sits, turning you sideways again, and you see her hand flash past when she reaches to the floor.  Shortly it returns, bringing her two enormous Converse up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda places her heel back on the chair, turning you upside down when her thigh rises upward.  Blood rushes to your head while you watch from above as she works her foot into the shoe's opening, wiggling it back and forth so that it incrementally slides in.  She grips the back with two fingers and stretches it over her enormous foot, finally pulling her shoe on, and ties it before dropping it back to the floor, a loud thud accompanying your abrupt stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can re-acclimate to being sideways there's another loud thump and you find yourself close enough to her pure white sock to see the details of each thread and every stray puff of lint.  She briefly lifts and it slams her other shoe down in its place, then begins working her foot into that one.  You are able to see each minute bit of progress she makes as the tight canvas is pushed out and forms against her foot until it also is entirely inside.  Quickly she ties the laces and sets it on the carpet with a scraping sound as it leaves the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands and takes a step, and you hear the rustling of cloth accompanied by a grunt as she hoists her bag.  Quickly she exits her room, swinging you back and forth as though on a pendulum with every step she takes.  Being tied to her thigh is much more pleasant than held in her hand and much better than being stuffed in her shoe, you realize, and take a look up at her white panties illuminated by dim light going up her skirt.  Yes, this is definitely preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solid thuds of Fulda's feet hitting carpet turn to the loud slaps of her Converse against concrete, and you realize that while you were looking up her skirt she made it outside.  The impacts of her footfalls now feel more like you are leaning against a jackhammer, but the narrow strip of silk continues to keep you in place between her legs.  You can clearly see the sun shining on the ground, and you hope that Fulda does not take advantage of the nice day to go for a long walk.</span></div></div>",

Each step causes you to bob up and down with her quad, your armpits catching on the edge of the ribbon holding you to her leg.  It isn't terribly uncomfortable right now, but who knows how long this walk will last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the length of Fulda's shadow below you it's about noon, and the bright mid-Spring day is fairly warm.  The air's temperature mixes with the heat radiating between Fulda's thighs, ramping up your own body heat in a matter of minutes.  You begin to sweat, dampening the clothes that had so recently been blown dry, but you are simply not large enough that this affects your situation.  Around you the skin remains bone dry, aided by the breezy environment beneath the skirt, and you continue being bounced up and down with each pounding step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud.  Thud.  Thud.  The ribbon holds you tightly against Fulda's thigh, but each time she swings her foot down with a resounding thwack you feel it inside you and get jostled slightly, only to return to your previous position.  The only reprieve you are able to get is the brief moment after you recover when the titanic thigh opposite you swings past to plant its own enormous foot on the ground.  Even those short breaks are marred by the fear that any time it goes past she may accidentally bump her thighs together and smear you across both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon you lose track of time, unable to think beyond the interminable pounding and inescapable heat.  Has Fulda been walking for half an hour?  An hour?  Her shadow doesn't look much longer, but you have a fairly limited perspective from where you are.  You tap her leg to get her attention during one of your short respites, but Fulda either doesn't feel your hand or chooses to ignore it.  During the next respite you make another attempt, but surmise that you are simply too puny to get her attention right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement spikes when you cross over a metal threshold that turns into dark brown tiles, but sinks again when you realize this isn't the library.  Fulda plants her foot behind someone else in line - you can only make out a pair of brown leather boots at the edge of your vision - and then brings her feet together.  You can barely inhale before your world goes black, eclipsed by the gargantuan thigh in front of you.  As soon as it comes into place Fulda slides it onto you, blotting out what little input from the outside world you had been able to get until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several minutes you alternate between nearly suffocating or being crushed between her thighs and gasping for breath, never spending too long at either extreme.  Finally after several instances of this, while deprived of any outside stimuli, you hear - or rather feel - Fulda say, \"Large mocha, no cream.\"  Great, she stopped for coffee.  Who knows how long you'll be here now?</span></div></div>",

The click of her soles on tile is actually a little soothing, since it means that her legs are going to be in motion.  The legs of a chair encroach on the edge of your vision, and there's a loud thud when Fulda drops her bag on the floor beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista calls out Fulda's name, and you are spun around as she pivots to collect her drink.  You get turned the other way, making you disoriented when she comes back around, and feel relief when she steps over her bag with a single long stride.  There is a marked drop in temperature now that her legs are more than an inch apart, and you bask in the short break of your torment.  When you hear the chair scraping against the tile and see her foot resting on one of the chair's bars, however, you understand that it will not last long at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's calf muscle pops as she takes her seat, and you are lifted up along with her.  You are turned sideways when she settles onto the chair and the skin you are bound to spreads under the pressure, and you begin to feel as though her thigh is just a very firm mattress.  Your impression is shattered when her other leg shifts and begins to rise off the surface, presaging a very bad time for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower portion of her leg lifts high enough to cross over the one you are tied to and promptly does so, bringing her hamstring to dominate every aspect of your view.  You desperately kick at Fulda's skin in an attempt to free yourself, but the closer it gets the clearer it becomes that the ribbon is tied well enough to keep you in place no matter how hard you try.  Her skin's fine lines close in, looking like the dried brush strokes of a painting, and you reflexively raise your arms.  As expected the sheer weight of her leg overcomes your meager strength, and her thigh comes to rest atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you the temperature quickly spikes, and you are unable to breathe under the mountain of flesh.  You try to scream and get a mouthful of skin for your trouble, unable to make even a squeak in response.  Desperately you struggle under several tons of muscle but find yourself barely able to wiggle, pinned in place by a gigantic leg.  After a minute you feel light-headed, and your movements slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by divine intervention, just before you lose consciousness the enormous weight lifts from atop you.  Red-faced and teary-eyed you are unable to stop a smile spreading across your face when you are pulled from the brink of death, even if only temporarily.  Fulda sets her leg down, spreading it so that it nearly comes in contact with you again, but for now you focus on the fact that you can breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several moments you gasp for breath, trying to recover from your brush with death.  Lithe fingers appear at the edge of Fulda's skirt clutching a scrap of paper between them, and they slowly being heading up toward you.  Much to your surprise they simply deposit the paper and then retreat, not molesting you any further than you have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the low light it's a struggle, but you manage to make out some writing on it.  \"Text me,\" Fulda has written on the scrap in very neat handwriting, with what looks like her phone number written below it.  Once you finish reading the road sign-sized scrap you reach into your pocket and check your phone.  It looks functional despite several large cracks in the screen from Fulda's abuse, and the battery is decently charged.  This is also the first time you notice you have many unread messages, all of which must have come in overnight.</span></div></div>",

Quickly you snap off a photo of yourself, showing the broad blue band pressing you so hard into her thigh that you are pressed into the skin, your pale face in stark contrast with the tanned bronze backdrop.  Seemingly fifty feet behind you Fulda's white panties are brightly lit by the flash, and the outline of her labia is faintly visible with the shadows.  Unable to look at it for long you quickly hit send.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a minute passes and you receive a thumbs up from Fulda, soon followed by a longer message.  \"Holy shit you're small!

It seems as though all those unread messages will have to wait for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor rapidly comes into view when Fulda shoves herself down from the chair, both of her feet landing with a loud crash as you're stood up again.  You feel your vertebrae pop and compress from the impact, and you are suddenly much more appreciative of how comfortable it was lying on her thigh.  With a loud but staccato scrape she picks her bag back up and slings it over her shoulder then heads toward the door.  Each pounding step she takes gets you back into the rhythm of her gait, and in no time you are bracing yourself for impact each time she lifts up her foot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda passes over the coffee shop's threshold again with no one becoming even the least bit suspicious of her, returning you to the familiar slap of each step on hard concrete.  You know that she has more grace than this, and you figure she gets a perverse joy her huge feet making as loud an impact as possible over and over.  Briefly you glance upward, following her imposing leg all the way to the top, and see a small spot of moisture on her panties in the ethereal lighting, about as big around as you are.  With a gulp you notice that it is fairly fresh, and surmise that this may have been her reaction to that picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimly you endure the rest of your trip with the awareness that Fulda probably gets aroused by having this much power over you - maybe from simply being this much bigger than someone.  The rest of her walk is clouded by this possibility lurking in the back of your mind and you get lost dwelling on the possibility of it, the steady movement of her steps lulling you into complacency.  You barely even register when she enters the library door, a vast landscape of white stone replacing the familiar gray concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA turnstile beeps when Fulda taps her ID, followed by grinding gears resonating throughout your ear canal loud enough to drown out her footsteps.  Quickly she proceeds down some stairs, and each time the leg you're tied to steps down you feel it like a hammer through your spine.  The rapid bending and straightening of her leg gives you the impression that the room is spinning, and you feel as though you have had too much to drink again.  Mercifully after a score of steps the descent is finished and Fulda is back on flat ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late,\" a feminine voice calls out as though challenging Fulda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's not like you can start without me,\" Fulda replies, blowing off the accusation.  Her bag clatters against a wooden table top, and a zipper rings out as she opens it.  Looking down you see the thick base of a table you spent dozens of hours at over the years with study groups of your own, and you feel even more nostalgic for the times you could sit in a chair and not worry about someone sitting on you.  Metal thuds against wood when Fulda sets her laptop down, and she remarks, \"I always have the best notes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, can we just get started?\" asks another voice, much more nasal than the first.  \"I have another group at four.\"  Fulda appears to assent, taking a bounding step towards a chair, then turning back to face the table.</span></div></div>",

As before you are held tightly against her thigh, not allowed to drop even a millimeter from were she has trapped you.  Your descent is brief, but you still feel a powerful rush to your head from the velocity of your fall.  Fortunately your landing is cushioned by Fulda's large, well-toned buttocks, and you find yourself nestled between her thighs, resting right above where they meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Fulda's skirt you see two pairs of legs on the other side of the table, all you can view of the rest of her study group.  On the left it appears someone had a black pair of jeans sewn around their legs with white espadrilles barely touching the floor at her toes, and to the right a pair of white and beige Mary Janes rest firmly on the floor at the base of some bright red stockings.  Your survey is interrupted by your head getting thrown back and forth into Fulda's solid quads as she adjusts herself in the chair, grinding her butt into the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two actually read the stuff this time, right?\" Fulda asks, gently shaking your insides as her body vibrates with her voice.  \"I didn't appreciate having to cover for your laziness before the midterm and I don't want to do it again.\"  It seems Fulda's scathing tongue is not just reserved for people who can fit inside her shoe, and you have to wonder why these two are working with her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was one chapter, and you've been going on about it for the past eight weeks,\" replies the one wearing Mary Janes.  \"Now, are we going to get to work or are you going to keep being a bitch?\"  This one has some fight in her, at least.  Maybe these are just the three meanest girls enrolled in the same course?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever Edna,\" Fulda replies.  \"Are you good too Eva, or did you lose your notes again?\"  An audible scoff comes from the other partner, followed by fingers hammering on the keyboard.  \"Let's take it from the top.\"  You get slightly nudged upward then dropped back down, and down near the skirt's opening you see Fulda's other leg start to rise up.  When it clears her impossibly long leg her knee crosses over, and your view is quickly consumed by the underside of her thigh.  You take a deep breath before she sets it down atop you, the enormous weight compressing you between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour preservation instincts kick in and you try to push the crushing mass off of you, but your efforts are futile.  Her leg must weigh tens of thousands of pounds to you, much more than your puny arms could ever hope to move - even if you were normal sized you would probably struggle to lift one of her legs.  The pitch black between her legs makes you start panicking, which is not helped when you finally notice the heat starting to rise.  You can barely move but you do your best to thrash about, trying to open some sort of airway to your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passes with you trapped firmly between Fulda's thighs, and your lungs begin to burn.  You lie there covered in sweat, both from the extreme temperature and your own pathetic efforts to do more than wiggle your limbs within your fleshy prison, now thoroughly exhausted.  Thirty more seconds pass and you have to exhale, no longer able to keep the spent air inside you.  Suffocation looms in your near future, and you wish Fulda would just crush you between her thighs and put you out of your misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you pass out an immense weight lifts off your chest and sudden light, though dim, stings your eyes.  You gasp for breath the instant your chest can expand, and Fulda's pervasive scent fills your nostrils along with the hot air.  For several seconds you do nothing but breathe, enamored by the novelty of air for now, and don't even mind the pool of sweat you're lying in.  In the back of your mind you are even grateful to Fulda for sparing your life, though you quickly suppress that sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her other leg is firmly situated Fulda lifts the one you're tied to, causing blood to rush to your head as her thigh tilts upward.  You groan but do not have the energy to protest beyond that, and simply get carried along for the ride while she crosses her legs.  Your sweat flows up her thigh to the imposing white wall of her panties, and you occupy yourself by watching the droplets slowly flow in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it that you don't understand?\" Fulda says sharply, her voice like a boulder on your rib cage.  \"And how aren't you getting it?  We went to the same lectures, read the same books... did you just not pay attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna groans in an exasperated fashion and answers, \"If I say you're smarter than me will you help instead of berate us for a change?  I was tired of this know-it-all thing months ago and you've only gotten worse with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sighs loudly and says just loud enough for you to hear, \"It's not a thing when I actually do know it all.\"  A beat passes and she decides to address the group.  \"Fine, but you have to keep up with me.\"  With that she goes silent while she scrolls through her notes.</span></div></div>",

You try pressing down on the ribbon holding you against her leg to ease yourself out, but find that the fabric is much too pliable to provide any real counterforce for your efforts.  However the material is damp against your palms, and inspiration for a sure-fire way to extricate yourself strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirmly you plant your feet flat against Fulda's thigh and take a deep breath to mentally prepare yourself for the struggle ahead.  You push as hard as you can, digging your feet into her skin in hopes of pushing yourself upward.  At first you are unable to even nudge yourself - Fulda's flesh gives too much under the pressure, and your feet slide on the accumulated sweat.  Perseverance pays off though, and with a couple more solid pushes you feel yourself slide along her leg.  Once you begin moving it is trivial to get the rest of yourself free, and after a few more kicks you entirely escape the ribbon that had been restraining you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately freedom does not equal control, and you find yourself sliding up her thigh along a path lubricated by your own sweat.  You do your best not to panic while gravity drags you down and try to stop your descent before you bump up against an obstacle, but to no avail.  After several seconds of uncontrolled slipping you land on your back on Fulda's panties, rolling until you come to a stop centered on her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not have time to be embarrassed by your new predicament, and it isn't like Fulda would be ashamed in the first place.  After taking a moment to meditate on your situation you roll over onto your side and place a hand against the white cotton floor so you can push yourself up.  While you get to your feet Fulda pauses in her explanation - you hadn't even realized she was speaking this whole time.  Bad news: playing around on her panties got her attention something fierce, and she knows you've gotten free.  Your phone vibrates and, since the jig is already up, you decide to check it.  She simply texted you a question mark.  If you're getting cold feet, this is the point of no return.</span></div></div>",

You take a step forward and find the footing atop her panties uneasy, but with careful maneuvering you are able to make it to the top of her leg.  Briefly you survey the course ahead of you.  Immediately before you is the steady upward slope of her leg, and you know beyond that is a long, sharp drop to her dangling foot, and then to the floor, all of which you only have a few seconds to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour daring escape does not get off to a promising start.  Immediately your shoe slips on the slick surface that ferried you down, forcing you onto your hands and knees so that you don't faceplant against Fulda's leg.  In order to save time you briefly bear crawl up the incline, moving a bit more slowly than you would otherwise but with some stability.  With each short advance however your hands sink into Fulda's supple skin, creating light dimples and causing you to take longer between each crawling motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get back upright you continue to have issues making your way down to the bottom of Fulda's skirt.  Her leg is slanted more than you expected, a result of the incredible length of her legs, and you have to lean much farther forward to keep from falling back.  Additionally the softness of her skin continues to be a problem, and you are forced to wobble between each step in order to maintain your balance.  In the timetable you had set for yourself to crest her knee and begin sliding down her shin you have made it a third of the way down the length of her thigh, and that is if you're being generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour estimate for your escape time turns out to be accurate in one way though, and that is Fulda's patience.  With a simple movement she unhooks her knees, slamming the leg you are standing on against the chair and throwing you onto your face.  You can hardly register the change before she swings her other leg up and over, bringing her other thigh down on top of you again and pinning you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that this is the end of the line the instant darkness overtakes you.  Pressure builds from the already immense force squeezing you on both sides and you struggle to breathe, the wind having been knocked out of you by your landing.  As your situation deteriorates from impossible to hopeless you don't even try to struggle, knowing that you could never overcome Fulda's considerable strength no matter the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure continues to build while Fulda gradually tenses her thighs with you unable to even groan in response, your lungs empty and your mouth held firmly shut.  Though she is clearly getting pleasure from your agony Fulda finally decides to grant your wish and flexes all the muscles in her legs, instantly crushing you between her taut, sculpted thighs.  Euphoria floods through her body when your pitiful form gives way, reduced to a tiny splatter between her thighs, and she bites her lip while kicking her dangling leg back and forth in celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, got distracted.  Where was I?\"</span></div></div>",

All she sent was a simple \"?\" for what the hell happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't give her a good explanation, she wouldn't hesitate to crush you for your escape attempt, so you sent back <i>\"I'm Sorry, Fulda. I couldn't breath, but I push the ribbon too hard and I slipped out because of all the sweat.\"</i> You sent this message to Fulda, which you felt rather than heard, an angry sigh from above as she returned your text with the message,<i> \"Fine. I get that, but you better stay put or else your gonna regret it later.\"</i> To further prove this point, Fulda's thigh slam together, trapping you between with unbearable pressure for a few moments before they parted and you could breath again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Fulda relaxed her thighs, you collapsed on your butt in relief and sat there for a few moments, before you felt your phone vibrate again. It was one last message from Fulda, but it was a bit...cryptic, <i>\"I have an itch down there, I want you to find it and take care of it.\"</i> You scratched your head in confusion, \"An itch, seriously. Where am I supposed to find the itch in here.\" You looked around futilely inside of Fulda's skirt, wondering where she could possible be having an itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no leads and no point in waiting around for her to crush you, you start randomly scratching various spots inside her skirt. You tried scratching her thighs and around her panties, but Fulda had little to no reaction to your action. After some minutes of trying to find it, your phone buzzed again and you saw Fulda had sent a message,<i> \"You serious can't take a hint, I spell it out for you then. I want YOU to pleasure me or I might get bored and crush your useless body.\"</i> Her thighs closed in again, but she didn't squeeze you like before and you sent, <i>Ok,Ok</i> on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda hummed with contentment and you heard her resume her discussion with the group. You thought she couldn't be serious, but knowing Fulda, she had no shame with you so far and a tiny man crawling around in her panties would definitely be more of a turn on than embarrassment. So you approached the white wall of her panties and gave the elastic band a few tugs, but the material barely budged and your next job just got a lot harder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With nothing but her skirt covering you the atmosphere is somewhat breezy, allowing you to breathe as freely as the ribbon around you allows, and your body temperature quickly returns to normal.  With how comfortable you are now, aside from the blood pooling in your head, you can definitely understand the desire to wear skirts aside from showing off legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, why don't you just come over and see how I did it?\" Fulda demands, and following an annoyed grunt Edna and Eva's shoes begin moving to either side of the table.  Shortly after they get in motion Fulda slides her raised leg back so that it slams into the seat, leveling you out and causing you to bounce with the rippling muscle.  The moment you land she lifts up her other leg, moving the knee in a high arc to cross it over the leg that you're bound to and positioning her thigh over you.  She gingerly lowers it toward you, and as it grows closer you have to actively resist hyperventilating.  Finally, when her skin bumps against your nose and the temperature around you begins to spike again you manage to suck in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how slowly she places it on you, the immense weight of Fulda's thigh feels as though it could crush you all by itself.  With several hundred tons of flesh, bone, and muscle resting atop you it's impossible to so much as lift your arm, let alone try to get out from under it.  Her legs keep you in total darkness, your eyes unable to see even a crack of light as they dart back and forth inside your immobile head.  Despite the futility you try to adjust yourself, and find that you are only able to brush your fingers against her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's thigh begins gently rocking back and forth, grinding you between her legs while she idly kicks her foot in the air.  You grit your teeth from the pain, careful not to let any air escape your lungs, and continue trying to inch your arms toward your body under the crushing weight.  Briefly she tenses her muscles, stopping her foot but wracking your body with pain when you get squeezed between her quad and hamstring.  Fortunately it subsides as soon as it started, and you remain in agony but two dimensional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can relax her thigh resumes rocking, grinding against you once more while you're pushed and pulled by the indomitable mass.  Your lungs start to burn from the stale air inside them, and the heat reaches unbearable levels once again due to the convection oven between her thighs.  Fulda's absolute control over you through her idle movements continues and finally you have to exhale in one large burst, your hot breath dissipating over a small area on the underside of her thigh.  Unfortunately the seal around you remains airtight, and when you realize you are unable to draw another breath you begin to panic, thrashing about in your tiny pocket of flesh as you feel yourself on the verge of aspirating.</span></div></div>",

Reflexively you try to breathe in, only to find that you can open your jaw just a few degrees, and your lips immediately get filled with flesh.  You try to spit it back out but find that once it has filled an open volume you are powerless against it and it remains in place, keeping your mouth propped open.  After struggling so hard you start to feel light-headed, and you are sure that your seconds are numbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you resign yourself to death the enormous weight pinning you down relents, and a warm breeze hits you from all sides when air rushes in to fill the newly vacated space above you.  Though the air filling your lungs dries your throat on the way down you do not mind, and you continue your frenzied breathing while you can.  Fulda's thigh never lifts more than half an inch away from you, reminding you of how precarious your position is, and making it so you are never allowed to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you are finished gorging yourself on air Fulda decides that you have had enough and brings her thigh back down.  Though you saw this coming that does not make it any more pleasant, and the intense weight feels again as though it is going to crush you on its own.  It's eerily similar to being in Fulda's shoe: each time the pressure comes back it feels like this time it will be lethal, but it's just short of enough to crush you.  That said it is still tremendously unpleasant, and the possibility of being smashed never leaves your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda begins kicking her foot back and forth again as soon as her leg gets settled, taking you along for the ride while you get ground down into the leg under you again.  Every few pumps she pauses and shakes her foot, the vibrations causing the skin around you to jiggle briefly but violently.  Her taut skin bounces off your body in a series of rapid strikes, pummeling your helpless body and pushing you toward the edge of sanity.  You are unable to do anything about this since you are held firmly in place, unable to escape from the monstrous weight crushing your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably the burning in your lungs returns, and you find yourself without a ready source of oxygen again.  You look around but see darkness in every direction, Fulda's enormous thigh eclipsing every bit of light and filling even the tiniest of crevices that could reach you.  Out of reflex you try to get free, sure that if you can lift up the skin on the edge you will be able to breathe just fine.  Unfortunately Fulda's thigh is a platform nearly the size of a football field, and you aren't even strong enough to lift one of her toes, let alone her whole leg.  The knowledge of how pathetic you are doesn't stop your frenzied thrashing, even as the air is forced out of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light-headed feeling intensifies the longer you struggle, and you make exactly zero progress despite your efforts.  Before you fall unconscious though Fulda lifts her leg slightly again, allowing air to rush back to you.  At last you understand that this is another one of her games, and she can use her thighs to torment you endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you get a few seconds to recover hundreds of tuns of flesh land on you again, sending you back into a world of pain.  Each time she rests her thigh on you she leaves it there for several minutes, doing otherwise harmless movements with her legs that consistently send you deeper into agony.  After a while your mouth and throat are completely dry and you lack the ability to even sweat, your body completely dehydrated.  Fulda does this to you at least a dozen times, making your torment last well over an hour, until you wish she would just let you die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, during one of your short breaks, you hear Fulda say, \"I think we should just split, we're not getting anything else done today.\"  She sets her thigh back onto you before you can hear the answer, and you are plunged back into your sensory deprivation pouch while silently pleading that the other two agree.</span></div></div>",

Your arms are weak and your palms covered in sweat, and you feel that even if you could move them you would be unable to raise them from your side due to the weakness that has overcome you.  Stars begin to overtake your vision, and even if you are released from your prison between Fulda's thighs it may be too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you don't have to find out, as she lifts her leg from its suffocating position after just a few more moments.  Your vision quickly returns to normal, and when she sets her leg down on the chair you take in some deep, ponderous breaths.  You are still uncomfortably hot even with prolonged exposure to fresh air, and the heat radiating off the thigh you're tied to shows no sign of that letting up.  Still, your situation has improved immensely, and when you hear her laptop get slammed shut you allow yourself to breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles beneath you tense when Fulda pushes back on the chair, and your stomach drops rapidly as she unfolds her legs to stand.  Soreness floods your body, a strange relief from the pain that you had gotten used to, and you adjust to being upright instead of laying down.  For now it is all you can do to hang limply from the ribbon, still held too tightly to fall to the floor, and revel in the fact that your legs are dangling instead of being squeezed in a garbage compactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Edna, one sec,\" Fulda calls out, your ears stunned by the clarity.  For the past hour or so you had only been able to hear her through indistinct rumbles that made it through the skin engulfing you, and her booming voice comes as a surprise.  A loud scoff answers her, so she continues, \"You're what, six-one or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm six-foot-three,\" comes a very annoyed answer as the huge Mary Janes below turn to face Fulda's Converse.  \"What, are you reminding me that you're smarter, stronger, prettier, <i>and</i> bigger than me?  Don't bother, because you sure as shit never let me forget.  Eva's like five foot nothing anyway, why don't you go bully her instead?  Listen, I got a ninety-five on that midterm, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut the fuck up and let me finish?\" Fulda interjects, cutting off Edna's rant.  \"You'll be a sophomore next year, meaning you can join my sorority.  You'll fit right in, and you surpass our standards and then some.  If you're interested you can come by the house tomorrow and I'll show you around, let you know what we're about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Eva?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll see why she isn't a good fit when you see the other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm about to go to the gym.\"  Fulda shifts her weight, tossing your limp body against the ribbon so hard that your legs kick into the air.  \"Unless you're really, truly desperate to see it right now, just come by tomorrow and ask for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Fulda lingers for a moment, allowing you to remain still while you dangle along the inside of her leg.  Your phone buzzes inside your pocket, and you fight through the soreness all over your body to reach in and grab it.  Though it is a bit of a process you manage to fish it out and see that you have a new message from Fulda, so you let out a sigh and what she has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good time between my legs? ;)\" it reads.  Great, the taunting has resumed.  Before you can respond however Fulda takes a step, causing you to bounce up and down against the ribbon and get jostled by her thigh.  When she slams her foot down you nearly drop your phone from the impact's shock, so while the other titanic pillar passes by you slide it back into your pocket and prepare yourself for the journey ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move and unwilling to upset your sore muscles you simply hang limply from the ribbon, looking down as her gigantic Converse repeatedly slap against the ground.  When Fulda hits the stairs she takes them three at a time, her splendidly long legs easily covering the distance.  Each step turns you horizontal again, and every time she ascends the muscles on her legs subtly pop as they push her huge frame up, creating a solid wall behind you that adds a slight feeling of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the view changes from carpet to tile, and then again to white concrete when Fulda passes over the threshold and gets onto the sidewalk.  You feel slightly dizzy - possibly vertigo, possibly heat stroke - and look up in an attempt to rectify it.  The sight of Fulda's massive panties over your head swiftly makes you rethink that however as the image of it looming over you in that picture comes flooding into memory.  For now you turn your head back down, occupying yourself mentally by counting her thunderous steps on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before the ground far below turns back to carpet, this time the hard blue at the entrance to the gym.  Briefly your journey stops and you hear a soft beep followed by Fulda saying, \"Yeah, have a good day,\" before the interminable swinging of her legs returns.  In another minute your view turns to dingy white tile of a locker room floor and hope swells within your chest.  Soon, at the very least, you will be free from the ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening thud sounds when she drops her bag on the hard tile followed by the buzz of a zipper's teeth being pulled apart.  The fabric curtain around you falls when Fulda shakes her hips, dropping her skirt to the floor, and allowing you to see everything in the brightly lit locker room.  You are just able to process that you're alone when Fulda's gigantic hand approaches and seizes one end of the ribbon, and you brace yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single pull Fulda unties the ribbon, removing the force that had been keeping you aloft this whole time.  Immediately you slide down the impressive length of her leg until you ramp off the slope of her kneecap, at which point you begin tumbling through the air.  You land hard on the bow of Fulda's shoe laces and continue rolling down, scraping your arms and legs on the canvas of her shoe until you roll off the rubber toe and slide onto the floor.  Thankfully you run into the soft material of her skirt and come to a stop before any more harm comes to you.</span></div></div>",

You look up at Fulda and marvel at how absolutely enormous she is compared to you, and realize that you haven't had a chance to simply look up at her from the ground in a while.  Even the toe of her shoe is towering, the white rubber wall looming well above you in your prone position.  Her bare legs are more like the support beams of a high rise with how long and solid they are, and while you watch she pulls up her shirt, revealing the billboard of abs on her stomach.  She pulls her shirt the rest of the way off and drops it onto the ground beside her, showing no concern for you at her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive Converse beside you lifts off the ground and Fulda slams it onto the bench with a resounding crash.  Quickly she goes to work untying the knotted laces and soon pulls her foot free, letting the shoe drop to the floor with a bang.  After a brief wobble while standing on one foot Fulda sets her socked foot back down, wiggling her toes against her skirt now that they're free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda takes a short break to crack her knuckles before lifting up her other shoe.  When the gigantic footwear before you rises it passes over your tiny form lying on the ground without a second thought.  The rubber diamonds blur as they move over you at incredible speeds, soon clearing the sky above you to smash against the bench with another boom.  She works the laces loose on this one in just a few seconds, letting them dangle on either side while she pulls out her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarelessly Fulda drops this shoe as well, sending it to the floor in a split second.  It lands on the tile with a thud toe first and bounces, sprung backward by the angle of impact and rubber where it hit.  The monumental All-Star barrels toward you, flipping end over end during its approach.  Your eyes widen when it flips over once more with you well in range, only to have it land upside down.  You see the blue star and worn letters on the sole before it rolls off to the side, coming to rest in an upright position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to breathe a sigh of relief at your close call when you remember she still has to set her foot down.</span></div></div>",

Carelessly she brings it back to the floor, setting the ball of her foot down less than an inch away from you and slamming her heel to the ground.  Heat radiates off her foot through the clean white sock and thin strands of cotton tickle you, threatening to entangle you in them.  For now you are simply glad that she didn't smash you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps unknowingly she has trapped you between her feet, with you safely in the clearing left by her insteps.  Past your head the balls of her feet rest against each other, and beyond your feet her heels come together.  The fine threading of her socks warps while she wiggles her toes and slightly adjusts her stance, and you know that it would not take much for this peaceful sliver to become your tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your position in the eye of the storm your eyes are drawn up the considerable distance of Fulda's long, powerful legs.  You contemplate the considerable definition of her calves and thighs in an effort to distract yourself from the crushing death on either side.  Your gaze is stopped by the white ceiling of her panties, pulled just the right amount of tight by her bodybuilder frame to not give her a visible camel toe.  The white band of fabric shifts back and forth while she twists her torso back and forth, and you follow the movements almost hypnotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are torn out of your reverie quite literally when Fulda jerks her right foot up and stray strands from her sock lift you along with it.  The strands are weak however and break easily, allowing you to fly free while flipping end over end through the air.  Your arc reaches its apex just above Fulda's knee, and you are able to look down and see the long drop to the concrete with Fulda's foot straining to maintain balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fall seems to transition into slow motion before your descent begins, and you are able to look around and see the situation you are in.  The foot which yanked you into the air points downward like a white dagger, and a pair of black spandex shorts wider than the top of a water tower get positioned under you.  Faster than you can fall Fulda's leg shoots through the opposite leg hole, pulling the shorts up her thigh.  Through the hole you are falling toward however you can see the opening of her upturned shoe and her enormous socked foot back on the floor.  It's strange to say, but getting caught by the crotch of Fulda's shorts might be your safest bet.</span></div></div>",

You flip end over end on your way down until you land softly on your back, captured by the stretchy fabric of Fulda's spandex shorts.  Air rushes out of your lungs in a sigh of relief, and you come to a rest when the springy material comes to a rest under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relief is short lived when you are suddenly jerked to the side and Fulda lifts up her other foot.  A glance to the side confirms that her foot is poised to plunge through the hole beside you, and with a mere moment she sends it through.  You are rocked back and forth while her shorts are shaken from the impact until you come to rest, two towering thighs on either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the magnificent thighs flanking you, your gaze is locked upward on the bottom of Fulda's panties directly above.  Her taint looms large, a magnificent ceiling that curves upward on each end, covered with a thin white cloth.  The small amount of light that makes it into the gap over her shorts casts a dire shadow over the scene, and you begin to feel unease fill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling lasts only a moment, and it is quickly replaced by real terror.  Fulda grabs both sides of her shorts and pulls up, yanking them to her waistline.  Along with them you are rocketed upward, pressed into the crotch of her shorts, until you are pressed hard against Fulda's taint.  Your stomach takes a bit to catch up, and you avoid puking onto her panties solely because you have nothing to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisorientation hits you hard after you get slammed against her taint.  Not only does the concussive force set your brain spinning, but the sheer enormity of Fulda in comparison to you is still difficult to comprehend.  Once your wits catch up however you begin thrashing against your bonds, the stretchy fabric beneath you allowing for some movement.  Your desperate movements are still limited though, and the sum total of your fervent attempts at freedom accomplish little more than brushing against Fulda's body, unable to progress toward her ass or pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath you the spandex subtly tightens and loosens, nudging you to the left then the right while Fulda puts on her shoes.  Her body heat begins to wash over you, much more intense than you had previously experienced, and you make one more effort to get her attention from inside her shorts.  You move as wildly as you can with your limited range, not so much trying to get free, more hoping she will notice you.</span></div></div>",

Sweat begins to lubricate your skin, making a visible stain on Fulda's panties above you.  The air is overwhelmed with her scent, and you make one final thrash to get her attention.  With the last of your energy spent you lie still, buoyed by the springy, skin-tight material under you, and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach breath fills your nostrils with Fulda's musk until it nearly overpowers you, and the hot air inside her shorts dries out your mouth.  The possibility of escaping dies in your mind, and you accept that you will spend this entire workout imprisoned in spandex.  Shortly after you lose hope though a pillar of light shines down in the front of her shorts, edging you forward when the spandex shifts.  The light is accompanied by one of Fulda's enormous hands, and her fingers probe inside her pants.  A fingertip presses against your foot, shoving your knee up to be cushioned within her panties, and you feel her powerful fingers seize your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda presses down with the rest of her fingers to loosen the spandex, opening a way out for you without tearing off your leg.  Moving quickly she dislodges you from beneath her, pulling you up along the covered lips of her pussy until you are pulled free of her shorts entirely.  She releases her grip on her shorts, making them snap back with an overpowering crack as the elastic forms back against her skin.  You wince and look up, only to find the vast majority of your field of view blocked by Fulda's gigantic hand and the towering wall of her abs, with the underside of her amply filled sports bra impeding the rest of your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Fulda lifts you upward, dangling you upside down and brushing you against her firm washboard abs, running you along the valley between them so that you bump against the inside of her navel.  The slight disruption sets you swinging, bumping you intermittently against her muscled stomach while you wince in pain from your ankle being held in a vice grip.  As you near the top she pulls you away from her chest, allowing you to bump against her left breast on your way up toward her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lifts you past her substantial breasts, cresting her collar bone and going the length of her neck until her face looms over you like a billboard whose builder got a bit overzealous.  Below you is the soft landing pad of her bosom, covered by her black sports bra with a white swoosh on the shoulder strap, and in front of you her pink lips turn down in a grimace.  You look toward your feet and see her piercing blue eyes on either side bearing down on you, her well-plucked eyebrows slanting inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, looks like someone keeps trying to get in my pants,\" Fulda scolds, her booming voice laden with contempt.  \"Are you telling me you want to be more than friends, or maybe just friends with benefits?\"  It dawns on you that she may not have simply been drunkenly rambling last night, and she really does think you're friends now.  Whatever she thinks your relationship is, there is no doubt that it is the result of her twisted opinions of human interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to respond, but her voice overwhelms yours by several dozen decibels.  \"I'm not outright opposed to the idea, you know.  I've shrunk plenty of my boyfriends over the years, though they ended up absolutely crushed when it ended up not working out.\"  She grins, and continues, \"Why don't you think on what you want while I blast my abs, and if you get the courage to actually ask me I'll give you a straight answer, okay?\"  You answer her with stunned silence - she is absolutely delusional.  \"But you are coming to work out with me regardless, as soon as I decide where to put you.\"</span></div></div>",

The closer you get the easier it is to notice small blemishes and minute freckles on her face, normally invisible under her makeup from a foot away.  You cringe as you approach with a tongue's distance of her lips, then she suddenly veers you away so that you glide beneath her unadorned ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets you down gently enough, allowing your back to come to a rest on her broad shoulders before releasing her hold on your ankle so that your legs swing down onto her skin.  Quickly you stand up, your hands and feet barely dimpling her taut skin as you do so, and peek over the edge.  You thought you would be used to it from being held so far up, but without her fingers acting as a harness vertigo fills your head the instant you glance at the floor.  For safety you step back to the middle of her shoulder, losing the view of her magnificent butt from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing okay over there, my little friend?\" Fulda asks, her booming voice rippling through her skin beneath your feet.  Fulda turns her head so that she can glance at you standing unsteadily on her shoulder, and you can feel her blue eyes bearing down on you with judgment.  Your close proximity to her voice renders you speechless, though it is doubtful she is interested in your response in the first place.  She takes your silence to mean that everything is fine and turns back forward, freeing you from her oppressive gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath you shudders, dropping you onto your rear, and the loud slap of rubber on concrete immediately follows.  You rush to turn yourself over, staying as close to her shoulder's center as you can, and right when you get onto your chest you are assaulted by intense vibrations from another footstep.  Cautiously you crawl along the fleshy floor, dragging yourself over her skin until you reach the black strap of her sports bra.  After a moment of rest clutching the stretched fabric you continue onward, weathering the tremors until you come to a rest at the base of her neck.  Scrambling you move to a sitting position against it, resting your back on the sloped surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother half minute of shaking follows each time her feet slap against the ground, but you feel secure in your new position underneath Fulda's ear.  A quiet grunt emanation from her throat gets your attention, and you peek over the crest to see her hoisting a large, round weight in one hand.  The world spins back to the expansive, mostly abandoned weight room, and Fulda goes to get started.</span></div></div>",

You get subtly nudged back and forth while she locks her feet under a bar, causing you to push yourself against her supple skin.  Fulda takes a deep breath and raises the weight to her chest, clutching the massive disc against her and crushing her breasts under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the floor drops out from under you when Fulda sits, throwing you against the underside of her ear.  Her earlobe keeps you firmly in place, and when her butt slams against the floor you get thrown back onto her shoulder.  You land hard and bounce off her soft skin with the breath knocked out of you, then begin to slide downward.  Desperately you claw for any sort of traction but her smooth skin provides none, and in your current state you would be unable to grab on even if it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cliff becomes too steep for friction alone to hold you, and you begin tumbling down Fulda's chest.  You roll onto her breasts and get bumped up onto her sports bra, momentarily flinging you into the air.  Before you can land Fulda lowers her back to the ground, catching you mid-flight with the unforgiving metal plate.  It stops your forward momentum and drops you back onto her compressed breast, providing you with some measure of cushion for your battered and bruised body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you would like to lay on the gigantic boob beneath you and collect yourself, fortune is not so kind.  You can not even settle in place before Fulda sits back up, bouncing you back against the metal plate as though her tits are a trampoline.  The cold metal stings your skin, and you swiftly drop down until you get wedged between Fulda's chest and the plate atop it.  Your body is simultaneously assaulted by her body heat and the metal's cold surface, making you alternately sweat and shiver.  It does not help that you are being smushed by Fulda's gargantuan breast, and getting the air back into your lungs requires herculean effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda slams her back to the floor again, and you are pushed into her bountiful bosom once more.  Just as before however she sits back up, tossing you against the metal plate, and throwing you back into herself when she goes down.  The constant battery disorients you and makes it impossible to focus on anything beyond the physical punishment and hot air in this crevice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty reps you find your arm dangling into freedom, the incessant bouncing having moved you slightly to the side each time.  You try to grasp the elastic material pulled tight over Fulda's chest, but you find that you are still too weak to properly grasp anything - not that you could with the constant movement, anyway.  Ten more reps and over half your body is dangling in the air, and you are looking at the straight drop down her abs and into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you are freed from the smothering hold of her breast, but when she goes back down you are not thrown into the plate again.  Instead you slide down her bare midriff, your journey hastened by the sweat starting to form on it, and come to a rolling stop beside her top abs.  When she rockets back upright you are launched off her tummy and into her raised thighs, imprinting yourself subtly before rolling upwards from momentum.  Then you roll back down her bulging quad until you slide into the trench where her legs meet, and from there you go tumbling down the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to tuck your limbs in on your way down to minimize any damage, and before you know it you are dropped onto the black spandex covering her pussy and butt.  You bound until you come to a rest just below her waistband and extend your arms and legs, finally able to recuperate a little.  Fulda continues her sit-ups apparently oblivious to your new position, her torso rising high like an indomitable wall while she grips a metal disc large enough to dam a river.  Flicks of sweat rain down onto you, joining the pools of it gathering on both sides of her tiny shorts, and all you can do is gasp for air now that your chest is unobstructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda seems to have unending stamina, and you lose track of how many more reps she does once you get situated just above her vagina.  At last she stops - not from exhausting from what you can tell, she had just reached an arbitrary number - and sets the weight aside with a resonating thud.  She lays back on her palms to rest, and you can just see her face past her titanic bosom.  Though she is looking up into the distance you act as though you are making a snow angel on her shorts to try and get her attention before she moves on.</span></div></div>",

She takes out her phone and idly scrolls through whatever app she has open, and it becomes clear that all you have done is get your back drenched in her sweat.  With a heave you force yourself back up and run onto the bottom of her stomach, digging your feet into her skin to help you climb up toward her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can hook your hands into the shallow knot of her belly button Fulda sets her phone down and sits back up.  The incline of her torso increases and you struggle against gravity to keep from sliding back down her sweaty abs, clinging tightly to her supple flesh.  In a surge of energy you launch yourself upward and barely manage to grab onto the ledge above, dangling from the indent in her tummy by one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda leans over to heft the weight again, swinging you into her springy skin.  You grunt when your body crashes against her, but the situation could be worse: with how her torso is twisting your free arm is easily in reach of the ledge, and you quickly take advantage by grabbing on.  Right when your have your grip secured she pulls the weight up to her chest, causing you to start swinging so that you lightly bump into her repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your swinging comes to a stop Fulda launches into the next exercise, wrenching her entire torso to the left.  Her movement violently throws you up so that you collide with the concrete wall of her abs, then she twists back the other way.  Again you are thrown against the solid wall you are tenuously hanging from, and when she reverses again you are sent back so hard one hand slips free from its grip.  On the return, with only one hand barely holding on, your fingers slip and you go tumbling down the incline of her flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe direction reverses again before you slide off onto the floor, and her hip bone slams into you with great force.  You get launched into the air, tumbling head over feet while airborne, and do your best to focus on something so you do not become too dizzy.  Fulda twists back again ahead of your landing, and your arms and legs splay out when you land hard on her hip.  A combination of your momentum and the layer of sweat on her midsection sends you sliding off, where you bounce off her butt before landing on the mat with a light thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground you are finally allowed a reprieve from the punishment of Fulda's workout.  For the moment you simply lie still, catching your breath while kept warm by the heat radiating off her behind.  Droplets of sweat get shaken off her titanic body in the course of her exercise and fall around you like rain, creating a constant patter as they splash against the rubber cushion.  One drop lands directly on your head, and though you close your mouth in time the sweat still stings your eyes from what remains on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's blurry body continues to twist back and forth for several minutes, never seeming to get tired while you lay on the floor panting.  Finally however she stops, remaining mostly upright and clutching the weight against her chest.  You scramble to get back up and start jumping against her tight behind, hoping to get noticed.  The mat creaks beneath her, and she begins to move.</span></div></div>",

She easily snatches you up, the tip of her middle finger striking you in the back and pushing you into the center of her hand.  Once she has you in place she shifts her finger, pinning you with its center and closing the rest in a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have come to know the darkness with a single ray of light inside her fist all too well by now, as well as the rush pushing you even harder into her hand while she moves it.  She opens her fist, revealing that she is holding you above her lap, looking down at you in her hand.  Fulda gives you a wry grin and booms, \"What's the matter, little guy?  Couldn't keep up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer she stands, lifting you up to her chest when she does so.  You remain focused on her face while she navigates the room, noting her lightly flushed cheeks from her exertion.  She sways back and forth with each step, and the rhythmic pounding of her titanic Converse on the rubber makes you appreciate being held in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly Fulda comes to a stop, and you turn around to see what is next.  A simple metal frame is on either side, with a worn bar about eight feet off the ground.  You wince at a loud clang when Fulda drops her weight against the side, and you realize she had been carrying it as effortlessly as she carries you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo enormous digits rush at you, barely giving you time to register before they secure around your chest like a pincer.  Your stomach jumps to your throat as she rapidly lowers you down to her waist, where you come to a stop before her belly button.  \"Grab on,\" she commands icily.  Once your fingers grip the scarred navel tissue she releases you, allowing your feet to swing against her solid abs.  Briefly you scramble to set your feet inside her belly button and Fulda picks up the weight again.  You brace for whatever she is doing next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Desperately clinging to Fulda's belly button makes you feel more exposed and vulnerable than ever, with nothing shielding your tiny body from the rest of the world.  Two dull thuds resonate from above, and you look up the cliff of Fulda's abs past her eclipsing breasts to see her holding onto the bar above her head.  You breathe a sigh of relief: if she's just doing pull-ups it won't be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour impression is broken when Fulda explodes off the ground, forcing your feet to slip out of their holds and leaving you dangling by the grip of a couple fingertips.  Her body swings upward, and the violent rotation breaks what remaining grip you had on her body.  Centrifugal force rockets you along her body until you slam into her thigh, the wall of muscle bringing your slide to an abrupt stop.  A deep boom rings out at the same time, the result of Fulda planting her foot against the wall, and she brings herself horizontal.  The muscles you're pressed into bulge and you begin to slide downward when there's a crash from her other foot, bringing her legs above her head just when you leveled out with her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree of any hold or obstruction you fall, sliding in the furrow of Fulda's sculpted midsection towards her head.  The metal frame rattles when her feet land atop the bar, the cacophony accompanying your transition into free fall.  For the brief drop you splay your arms, and the black fabric of Fulda's sports bra rapidly fills your vision.  You slam into her left breast at what feels like great speed, pushing you into it until the indentation's walls are larger than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe springy fabric and vibrant body within react swiftly to your intrusion, pushing you back out.  Briefly you hang in the air, your nostrils saturated by the smell of her sweat, before you fall back down onto her boob.  You bounce a few more times before finally coming to a stop.  Not one second too soon, you note, since if you had kept skipping along her rack you would have slipped over the crest and fallen onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the cushion you look up at Fulda's titanic Converse locked in place on the bar, her legs straining to put a stop to her swaying.  Her relatively tiny shorts look as though they were painted on and do nothing to hide each twitch of a muscle to correct her position.  Lazily you wonder what she is even going to do here, and more importantly how it will affect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fulda's abs ripple and you're pressed back into the underside of her breast when she rockets upward, bending at the waist.  Her movement stops just as suddenly, tossing you out from your impression and sending you flying once more.  You land on her belly button, your fall cushioned by the soft skin beneath, and continue skidding until you reach the waistband of her shorts.  By then she has begun lowering her torso again, and you scramble to grab hold of the elastic material beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas it is not to be, and you slide back down her midriff, your path lubricated by her sweat.  Once more you sink into her boob only to get pushed out again, this time while she is raising herself up.  At the terminus you are launched once more with slightly more force this time, landing just short of her waistband and bounding onto her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the terrain dropping and sink your fingers into anything you can to keep from getting stuck in this loop.  Relief washes over you when you stay in place during her descent, and you take stock of where you are.  On each side of you black-clad hills begin their ascents, and not very far above the black turns to bronze skin with a slight indentation.  There is no doubt about it: you are clinging to Fulda's crotch for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow you the terrain continues to rise and fall, trapping you in between the bands of black elastic when Fulda comes to a stop.  Beyond her breasts you are able to see her face grimacing in effort, a manic look in her eyes each time you see them.  Finally, after about a dozen more of these she comes to a stop and allows herself to dangle from the bar.  From your perch on her crotch you look down the slick surface of her tanned skin with trepidation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You cling to the shorts pulled tight around Fulda's crotch with all your might, not daring to drop and bounce among her breasts again.  While you hang helplessly from her spandex she looks around for you, checking the floor first before examining her own body.  When she spots you on your precarious perch her eyes light up, and she extends a hand up toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda pinches your right leg, and wanting to keep it connected to your body you let go of her booty shorts.  Briefly you drop before her hold stops you, jerking your leg but keeping you firmly within her grip.  She brings you to her face, continuing to dangle you upside down so that you both appeared to be upright.  \"You're getting awfully intimate with me, my little friend,\" she says.  \"I'm starting to think you want to be my boyfriend and you're just too shy to tell me.\"  To your consternation she grins, and bats you with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can stop swinging she dislodges her feet from the bar, swinging herself down so that she is standing once more.  Her feet land on the mat with a tremendous crash, and she clenches you in a fist briefly.  You are thankful that she kept your leg from being torn off, but the hungry look in her face when she opens her fingers takes you aback.  \"Why don't we fool around a bit when we get back to my room, see where it goes, hmm?\" she asks, making the blood drain out of your face.  Though you want to say no, shout at her, anything, your tongue feels massive in your dehydrated mouth, and the only thing that comes out of your mouth is a rush of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're a lunatic</i>, you want to scream at her.  <i>You're a sadist and I don't want to be anywhere near you.  Just grow me back and I'll never bump into you again.</i>  Nothing comes out of your parched mouth though.  You aren't sure if it's because you're too tired, or you fear her retribution so much that you stay silent, but whatever reason you sit quietly fuming in Fulda's palm while she calmly walks into the next room, an oblivious smile plastered across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're getting a pretty good workout today too,\" she coos, prodding you gently with a fingertip.  \"It'll take you years to get sculpted like me, of course, but if you keep at it you'll be in great shape!\"  You have no idea what she's talking about.  All you've done is get tossed around like a ragdoll until she stopped moving, praying for it to end much earlier than it did.  Fulda leans in close and whispers, \"You're lucky.  I have a thing for fit guys, and you're coming to the gym with me until you die.\"  Your blood runs cold, and you aren't sure which statement did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully Fulda leaves you in silence for the remainder of her walk, allowing you to ponder the situation you've been thrust into.  Why is she coming on so hard?  Does she really want you to be her boyfriend, but she needs to convince herself it's your idea?  What would the two of you even <i>do</i>?  You look up at her, blissfully unaware of the gears turning within your head.  Her lips could easily engulf you - no, had easily engulfed you - and she towered over you even when you first met.  Now she held you in the palm of your hand and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get up, I need this machine,\" Fulda barked, breaking your train of thought.  You turn around and see a man sitting on what looks like a bike seat with levers on either side.  A water bottle stands beside the machine, and he looks surprised to see Fulda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I just have one more set,\" he replies non-plussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait a minute, you'll get your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got three seconds.\"  The man rolls his eyes, and Fulda steps in closer.  While you watch he rapidly diminishes in size, growing smaller until he is standing in the middle of the seat.  After a moment of shock high-pitched squeaks reach you high above in Fulda's hand, and you have to strain your ears to make out any of what he's saying.  Paying him no mind Fulda turns around and plops down on the seat, crushing the man under the unstoppable force of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must be what it's like when you beg Fulda for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter finishing my second set I decided to take a quick break before ending the workout entirely.  I took a quick sip of water and changed the song, picking something more intense to push me for the last set.  When I looked back up again a redhead, tall enough that she nearly touched the ceiling, was walking toward me.  Quickly I pulled one of my earbuds out: she looked like she lifted, and was in amazing shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe demanded I give her the machine, but I wasn't done yet.  I told her as much, and after some back and forth she gave me an ultimatum.  Clearly she wasn't going to listen, and nothing I said was going to change her mind, so I just rolled my eyes and resolved to let her have it when I was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could go back to ignoring her she stepped forward, getting in my face.  I went to push her away, but found myself unable to move.  Wait a second.  Sure she was tall, but was she <i>this</i> tall?  She seemed to be getting taller by the instant, and after a few seconds I felt downright puny before her.  When I was eye level with the waistband of her shorts I started to move, but it was too late.  By the time I got to my feet I was looking up at her knees, and standing on the seat I had been sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there in disbelief at what just happened.  This strange redhead towered over me, larger than most buildings, and I felt like a tiny doll on this machine.  She must have shrank me!  But how?  That can't really happen, can it?  Trying to process what happened I looked around at my surroundings, then back to the woman looming over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what the hell?\" I shouted up at her.  \"What's going on?  Grow me back!\"  She stepped closer and turned around, moving so that she straddled the seat.  \"What, no!  What are you doing!\"  Her knees bent, dropping her butt towards me.  \"Hey, no!  Please, don't sit on me!\"  While I screamed her ass drew closer, blocking out more of my view.  \"Please, don't!  Don't kill me!\"  My pleas fell on deaf or uncaring ears while her butt continued to lower, growing more massive in my view.  I screamed in terror when it hit me, knocking me down onto my back.  Vainly I pushed against the enormous ass on top of me, but the tremendous redhead weighed several thousand tons compared to me now.  She came to a rest and pain surged throughout my body for an instant then ceased, my form crushed underneath her.<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda looks around, cradling you in her hand still.  She works her butt into the seat, grinding the poor bystander into it and getting more comfortable.  Gently she carries you in front of her and lays back, then places her hand against her abs.  Carefully she tilts her hand, letting you slide down until your feet land against her rock hard abs.  A moment passes while she looks around, possibly looking to see if there were any witnesses.  Suddenly she declares, \"Hey, free water bottle!\" instantly dissipating any idea that she felt empathy for that man.</span></div></div>",

That's when you see someone begin to walk by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only see her abdomen, the rest of her blocked out by Fludas massive form, and noticed she was wearing short leggings and a black sports bra.  Apparently this gym had a lot of people that just wanted to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in front of you and turned towards you. \"Um,\" she started, \"you have something on your shorts.\". The blood rushed from your face, she had seen you.

Her fingers, larger than tree trunks, wrapped around you and carried you away from the only person that could get you out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl brought you to her face and studied you, her massive eye like an emerald pool.

One more solid slam into the soft flesh, and you fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke some time later, a headache that could ruin, well, a giant.   The light was blinding, and the ground was coarse.  Your vision slowly faded back, and you took a good look around.  You were in an enourmous cage. The ceiling high above you, and above that the ceiling for the room it was located.  To your left was a large hamster wheel, and your right was a water bottle, attached to the side with a drop just begging to come out.  You ran up to the bars to get a better look at the surrounding room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cage you were on was on a shelf, you guessed about hip high on an average person.  A nightstand was to the right of you, with a lamp and an alarm clock situated on it, and a bed farther than that.  Across from you was a closet, and a dresser next to that.  A Landry hamper lay over by the door.  As your examining the various clothes littering the floor, the massive door swung open, and you saw your new captor in all her glory.  She walked in, wearing nothing but a bra and panties, her long, brunette hair wet as if she had just came from the shower.  She was definitely well endowed, and she didn't seems to care to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captress tossed some clothes into the hamper, and began to walk towards her dresser when she looked over at you.  Her eyes meet your tiny body and a smile formed on her face.  She walked towards you, and stood over you for a second.  She was tall, the table you were on just barely below her hips.  She watched you from above intently before leaning down and watching you. She smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little guy\" she said, a hint of sweetness in her voice. \"I don't know what happened to you but your lucky I found you!  My name's Rachel.  It's funny, I had an ex-boyfriend that had a fetish for this kind of thing, so I know exact what to do about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part worried you, you had no idea who she was or how she would treat you.</span></div></div>",

She tries to put her foot back where it had been, but she doesn't want to step on her fairly new shoes and risk scuffing them yet.  Besides, rubbing her toes against the soft material of her skirt felt good even through her socks, so she puts her foot down so that half of it will be over the nice fabric.  Under the ball of her foot however is a small lump, so without thinking she lifts up her foot and stomps it out until it goes flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour perspective of the situation is quite different.

It would have done no good anyway, since there's no way you could have gotten out from under the foot before Fulda smushes you between it and her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out in shock when the enormous foot lands on you, covering you with the clean white cotton of her sock.  Vainly you try to push it off, but the foot alone weighs several tons, and your only wish is that Fulda doesn't shift her weight.  Just when you are about to give up hope Fulda picks up her foot, freeing you from the crushing weight.  Unfortunately she brings it back down immediately and much harder this time, smashing you in one blow with her titanic foot.  For good measure she lifts up her foot, bringing your squished body up with it, and stomps it on the ground again and again until there is nothing left of you but a fine paste.

If you think that I\u2019m pretty, shouldn\u2019t that include things like my feet as well? You shouldn\u2019t try to pick and choose what you like in a girl, you know.

That\u2019s not a problem, is it shorty?\u201d You decide to ask her, \u201cWhy the sock?

And you\u2019ll feel the same way, eventually, I\u2019m sure.\u201d You\u2019re a bit concerned that she just referred to you as a \u2018pebble\u2019 but you can\u2019t really complain. You only hope that Fulda eventually begins to treat you like a real person again, and not just as a pet or small plaything, even if she\u2019s been a lot more gentle recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watch as Fulda shakes out her right sock, and then she hovers you over its open end, and you look down and are a bit frightened that you can\u2019t even see the bottom. She notices you apprehension, and says \u201cOh don\u2019t be a wuss little guy! It\u2019s just a sock!\u201d She then tilts her hand so you start tumbling right into the sock and down into the dark bottom, and as you fall, Fulda teases you by saying \u201cSee you later! Don\u2019t have too much fun down there, shorty!\u201d When you land, you expect to be overwhelmed by a putrid stench, but you\u2019re surprised that it doesn\u2019t smell all that bad down here. There is a noticeable scent of feet, which is a bit uncomfortable to you, but you can also smell a nice fragrance of flowers, which was probably from her detergent. And while Fulda held the sock upright, you take the time to make a trek to the toe section, because you\u2019d rather not be flattened by her heel or sole today. And Fulda did have a point about having an open mind, but you thought it would be best to take what a woman who regularly shrinks and torments people says with a grain of salt. You wanted to like Fulda\u2019s feet and toes, because if you determined that you definitely didn\u2019t like them, then you\u2019d have a pretty lame day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you reached the toe section, where the scent of feet started to overpower the scent of flowers and the cotton walls were a bit damper, Fulda started to put the sock back on. Even in the darkened environment, you could still see the massive form of her right foot, and it seemed like her toes were larger than busses to you right now. Once her foot settled into the sock, you found yourself knocked into the outer edge of the toe section, and you thought that it might be better to just avoid Fulda\u2019s insanely gigantic toes for now. But then the whole thing started to shake, as Fulda tapped her foot, and she said \u201cHow odd. I don\u2019t feel anything in-between my toes. I could have sworn that I dropped a tiny pebble into that sock. I\u2019d better feel something between my lovely toes soon, or that pebble might regret its life choices!\u201d You realized that you\u2019d have to bite the bullet, and squeeze amongst Fulda\u2019s toes, before you angered her. So you walk to her 2nd and 3rd toes, and squeeze your body between them, and once you feel like you\u2019re thoroughly stuck, they start to wiggle and rub into you. While it was slightly uncomfortable, it wasn\u2019t painful, and you were glad that Fulda kept her word this time. After a few more minutes of Fulda wiggling her toes lazily, she grabbed her boot again, and shoved her foot inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ugg boot caused her toes to get a bit more squished together, which caused your body to be tightly pressed between her sweaty 2nd and 3rd toes. Another thing that the ugg boot caused was a general increase in the heat level and amount of sweat that Fulda\u2019s toes produced, which was starting to feel oppressive. But luckily, there was a large enough air pocket in-between the fleshy sandwich that kept you from passing out, so you could focus on trying to enjoy yourself. And truth be told, you weren\u2019t miserable right now, even though you didn\u2019t love it either, especially now that Fulda\u2019s toes were sweating in earnest. But then Fulda stands up, which caused her toes to squish even more under her impressive height and weight, and you were crammed even more into her sweat covered and strong smelling toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Fulda leaves her sorority house and heads to her next destination. Where was Fulda going?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fulda had a class in about 10 minutes, so she made her way there so she wouldn\u2019t be late, and she was looking forward to using you like a pebble for her entertainment. As Fulda walked across campus to get to her class, you were repeatedly rubbed by her oppressive and powerful toes. And once Fulda made it to class, she confidently walked to the back of the room, and sat down to take out her laptop. She was more interested in sorting through all of her messages and sorority business than in whatever was going on today for class, especially since she already knew enough to get a good grade in the class. As Fulda sorted through messages and emails, she started to manipulate you more forcefully, until you were directly under her 2nd toe, and you looked up to see your entire view taken up by her mighty toe. You were frozen in anticipation, as Fulda\u2019s toe hovered menacingly over you, and you had a feeling that she could practically picture your terror filled face, and that was why she was waiting. You look at either side of you, and see that her big toe and her 3rd toe were both planted next to you, and they looked more like insanely huge tanned flesh walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the moment of truth finally happened, and Fulda\u2019s 2nd toe slammed down to you, and it harshly pushed into you. Then it started rolling you back and forth, covering you in sweat and damp cotton, permeating deeply into your clothes. And as she roughly kneaded you with her toe, an action that Fulda viewed as gentle and generous, she also started to tap her foot rhythmically. As her foot went up, your body was almost pulled into her vast and sweaty toe flesh due to the G-force. And when she brought her foot back down, you would get completely enveloped by the soft yet unyielding flesh. And then Fulda decided to start transferring you to her other toes as well, so you could get just as much love and affection from those toes too. She effortlessly scrapped you off of her 2nd toe into the imprint left by her 3rd toe, and used that toe to press down into you harshly. But as she was playing with you with her 3rd toe, you actually felt yourself growing, until your face was roughly the same size as the toe that was pinning you down. And once you stopped growing, the 3 toes that were surrounding you, her 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, ones, slammed into you and went to town on your face. And as you were being brutally smothered by these still massive appendages, you could only be amazed, and intimidated, by how skillful Fulda was with her size changing ability. But as much as you didn\u2019t want to admit it, you were actually enjoying yourself somewhat. And while you still didn\u2019t think that you liked feet, you felt like you at least didn\u2019t dislike them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed like class went by pretty quickly, and Fulda was glad that she had a nice toy to mess with to pass the time, and once it was over, she got up and went back to her room. On the way, she got some lunch at a food truck, while kneading you lazily with her powerful and domineering toes. Once she got back to her room, she put her food down, and took of her uggs and socks, freeing you from your toe trap. She placed you on her palm, and said \u201cI hope you enjoyed yourself, little guy! Now you should wash yourself off, since you probably aren\u2019t clean.\u201d Fulda giggled as she said that to you, and then she turned on the faucet and let the sink fill with a bit of warm and soapy water. You nervously stood there, and Fulda said to you, in an annoyed tone, \u201cWell, take off your clothes! How else will you wash off? I don\u2019t care how you look, so I\u2019ll wait a few minutes outside the door.\u201d And with that, Fulda walked off, and her booming footfalls still shook you heavily. So you get yourself washed off, but you don\u2019t look forward to wearing those dirty clothes again, but before you finish up, you hear the door swing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like a different member of Fulda\u2019s sorority needed to use the restroom, and he looked up to see a Middle Eastern like woman with light brown skin and long black hair walk over to the sink. \u201cHuh,\u201d you hear the mystery woman mumble \u201cI wonder why Fulda wanted to leave that water in the sink? Whatever.\u201d She then started to wash her hands, turning the faucet back on, which created a crazy maelstrom of rushing water. You were glad that Fulda left the drain sealed, or you\u2019d be washed down the drain quickly, and you hoped that this mystery woman didn\u2019t spend too much time washing her hands. She then brought her hands under the water, allowing the warm water to wash over them, which created a warm rainstorm to shower you. And once she started to use some soap, you were buffeted by a combination of soap particles and more water. And after a few minutes of washing, where you were pretty impressed by her level of personal hygiene, she finally stopped. And you waded over to a section with a lot more suds, so you could hopefully remain hidden, and you carefully watched her to see what would happen next. The mystery woman took off her thick rimmed glasses, and then started to rub her face next with her wet hands, until she felt that it was nicely cleaned off. You noticed her breathtaking facial features, with her smooth light brown skin, her pearly while teeth, and her beautiful teal colored eyes. And as she dried off her face, she made a few funny faces to herself, which you were lucky enough to see, and then she simply walked out, and you made a mental note to ask Fulda about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Fulda felt that enough time passed, she walked in and hoisted you out of the sink. She dropped a pre-shrunk towel for you, and you used it to dry off quickly before covering yourself, so you weren\u2019t exposed to Fulda. Then she said, in a playful but still possessive tone, \u201cOh are you embarrassed, shrimpy? Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff!\u201d And then she dropped a set of accurately sized clothes, and she said \u201cWhat? I can get whatever clothes I need, and you look like you could use some new digs! You don\u2019t need to thank me!\u201d So you put them on, and then she carries you over to her personal lunch table in her room, and she offers you a bit of her Chinese food lunch. You nod at her, and she shrinks down a small chunk so it\u2019s still fairly large for you, so you can get back some energy. As you both silently eat, you think about how Fulda\u2019s been a lot nicer to you now, and you hope that this trend continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you both finish eating, you decide to ask Fulda about the mystery woman, and ask \u201cHey Fulda, who was that girl in the bathroom earlier?\u201d Then she says, \u201cWhat? Have a crush?\u201d You look down, embarrassingly, and she says \u201cOh take it easy! It was a joke!\u201d And she pokes you, which to her was like a simply elbow nudge, but you felt like you were hit by a truck, but you figured that she was trying to be funny. She then explains, \u201cWell, that was Nisha Dwivedi. She\u2019s a Political Science major and a junior. She\u2019s another member of the sorority, and she\u2019s a pretty nice person. We don\u2019t tell her about any of the shrinking stuff that I do, because it\u2019d probably break her heart. She might just be one of the kindest people I know. Want to meet her?\u201d You\u2019re taken aback, because you thought that Fulda would never let you go, and you nod and say \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, that would be awesome! Thank you Fulda!\u201d You want to sound as gracious as you can, but she says, \u201cNow hold on, little guy. I\u2019m not gonna make it easy to you and just introduce you to her. You\u2019re gonna do that.\u201d Now you\u2019re confused, and you ask, \u201cWait, what do you mean?\u201d Fulda explains, \u201cIf I just handed you to Nisha, she\u2019d probably adore you, but I think we should make it a challenge! I\u2019ll place you somewhere near her, probably a shoe or something, and you\u2019ll need to gain her attention. I\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re highly durable and a reasonable size, say about half an inch, and you\u2019ll do whatever you can to prove to her that you\u2019re not an annoying bug or pebble. I\u2019ll put you in her shoe, so you\u2019ll really need to climb to reach her. Oh, and I\u2019ll give you my number, just in case you don\u2019t think you can do it and you want to call it quits.\u201d She then gives you her phone number, and you text her so she knows which number is yours. And then she adds, \u201cOh, and she\u2019s has a night class tonight, so you\u2019ll be in for the long haul. And one last thing, she doesn\u2019t actually live at the sorority house. She always liked to be a bit more independent, which I can respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda gave you some time to process all of this, and after a few minutes, Fulda says, \u201cOh, if you don\u2019t want to do all of this, you can always stick with me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to spend more time with your generous and gorgeous goddess, right?\u201d And with that fairly pompous statement, Fulda let out a booming laugh. You think for a bit, and you really feel completely smitten by Nisha\u2019s perfect appearance, and you\u2019re also enticed by how much nicer she seems to be. You know that Nisha\u2019d treat you better than Fulda ever would, even if she has been a lot kinder lately. But it would be a massive challenge, and it might be smarter to just stay with Fulda, and hope that you impress her enough so she\u2019ll let you go at some point, or maybe actually become her boyfriend or something. And if you make the attempt, and chicken out later, you\u2019re sure that Fulda would go back to treating you sadistically and cruelly. And eventually, you come to a decision. What do you choose to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You realize that you need to take your life in your own hands, and not depend and hope on Fulda being as nice as she\u2019s been. You say to Fulda, \u201cI\u2019d like to meet Nisha! I\u2019m ready for the challenge!\u201d Fulda merely giggles, saying \u201cWow! You\u2019ve made a big change from the wimp I saw in class the other day. You\u2019ve still got a long way to go before you completely earn my respect, but you\u2019re on the right track. Now let me set this all up for you. Good luck buddy!\u201d She then waves her free hand over your body, and you feel yourself grow a little bit, until you\u2019re about \u00bd of an inch. Fulda says, \u201cAlright! Now you\u2019ll be as durable as you\u2019ll need to be. I could probably even sit on you right now, and you\u2019d be no worse for wear!\u201d Fulda laughs again, and you just try and focus on the positives, and not her constant teasing. Fulda then started to walk over to where Nisha was sitting down, and you could see that she was wearing a pair of short green shorts and a black T-shirt, and she was looking closely at her laptop. There was also a pair of brown moccasins on the floor next to her light brown bare feet, and she was had them raised slightly on the balls of her feet, showing off her smooth soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Fulda sits down next to Nisha, while hiding you in her closed fist, and starts to chat with her. Nisha starts the conversation, saying \u201cOh hi Fulda! How are you? You look great today!\u201d Fulda replies, \u201cI\u2019m doing alright; just getting through a few boring classes. How have you been?\u201d They chat for a few more minutes, where you struggle to hear the rest, because Fulda has decided to start squeezing you like a stress ball. At some point, Nisha says \u201cAre you thirsty Fulda? I was about to grab myself a bottle of water.\u201d Fulda say, happily, \u201cThat would be great! Thanks!\u201d Nisha walks over to the kitchen, while being barefoot, and once she was out of sight, Fulda prepared you for your journey to gain Nisha\u2019s attention. She kneels down over Nisha\u2019s moccasins, and drops you into the left one, and she whispers to you, \u201cGood luck in there! And if you decide to chicken out, you know who to text!\u201d And then she gave you a playful wink, and sat back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look around, and realize that the slightly fluffy walls towered over you a few times over, and the ground was both sticky and highly fluffy. And the smell was very strong, and it was even worse than Fulda\u2019s boot was, probably because she at least had the sense to wear socks. But for some reason, you didn\u2019t think of that as a negative, and you think that it was either because Fulda had already predisposed you to like feet more than you did before or because of how smitten you already were with Nisha. And as you marveled at the interior of her moccasin, you heard the tell-tale earthquakes of her walking, and you eventually saw her sit down in her seat. She crossed her legs, at her ankles, and her soles hovered above the moccasin you were inside of, and her massive feet covered almost half of the shoe. You could see that she had incredibly long and slender toes, as well as fairly largely sized soles. You look back up at the information listed on the shoe, and you notice a big 13 printed on the tag, which told you that Nisha had large feet, but they were still smaller than Fulda\u2019s were. Although that wasn\u2019t a huge shocker, since she was one of the biggest people you\u2019ve ever seen, both before and after she started to toy with your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of Fulda and Nisha chatting, which you can no longer hear at all, Fulda gets up and walks away. Up above, she says to Nisha, \u201cOh dear. I\u2019m sorry, but I need to head out. Later! And don\u2019t forget your sorority duties!\u201d Fulda smiles at her, and Nisha knew that as kind as that smile looked, that was much closer to an order than a reminder. As much as Nisha liked the sorority, she wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of how totalitarian Fulda could be. And as she thought about these things, while looking over her class notes, she absent-mindedly rubbed her toes and soles together, which gave you an unexpected but, not unwanted, personal show. You decide to take this moment to wade through the sticky and fluffy ground towards the toe section, because you were well aware that your increased durability did not include immunity to pain. And once you make it there, the smell only intensified, although at this point, you were aware of how these things worked, so it wasn\u2019t as much of a surprise for you. You do see a bunch of massive craters that you assume are the imprints made by Nisha\u2019s long and massive toes, and you try to fit yourself into the imprint made by her 2nd toe. You figure that avoiding her big toe would be smart, but you sort of want to see what it\u2019s like to grinded under Nisha without even realizing you\u2019re there or even exist. But then you hear, and see, Nisha\u2019s feet shift around and from her sudden movements, you had a feeling that she was about to leave to go somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you brace yourself, you hear that you received a new text, so you check it and find out that it was from Fulda. You take a look, and she wrote \u201cGood luck! \uf04a You know who to call if you give up! ;)\u201d You feel like she\u2019s taunting you, and it inspires you to try even harder to gain Nisha\u2019s attention at some point. You see Nisha grip the back of her moccasin with her left foot\u2019s toes, casually dragging it a bit closer to her seat, which causes you to tumble onto your back, and the fluffy and sticky pieces of fabric actually prevent you from moving very well. You hope that you picked a good spot, because you\u2019ll be stuck there for awhile at least. Once the moccasin stops moving, you see her left foot angled down and hovering right over the shoe, which blocked out a majority of the light available. And once you heard the snapping noise of Nisha closing her laptop, you saw her left foot reenter the moccasin. First, she slammed the ball of her foot onto the shoe, which would have knocked you into the air if the ground around you was less sticky and grabby. Then she raised her toes as she pushed her foot further in, dragging her toes on the \u2018roof\u2019 of the moccasin. And then, finally, her foot made it all the way into the moccasin, and her massive and slightly dirty 2nd toe plummeted down into the imprint that you chose to hide away in. And as her toe started to rub back and forth into you, you wonder if she noticed your presence, but your hopes of a quick and easy discovery were dashed when she said \u201cOh dear! Is there a pebble in my shoe? That\u2019s lame! Oh well, it\u2019s not bothering me that much. And it actually feels kinda good!\u201d She starts to rub a bit more forcefully while giggling, covering you in her unique foot sweat and junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she stands up, flattening you slightly more than before, and then she starts to walk out of the sorority house. Since it was fairly warm at this point, Nisha\u2019s feet were beginning to sweat a lot more, which was in turn covering you in even more of it as well. But you didn\u2019t mind all that much, and you wonder just how much your tastes and interests have changed since you\u2019ve been forced to live this tiny life. But then Nisha got a text, and she stopped to check it out, and while she did that, she messed with her toes absentmindedly. She started to knead her toes into the moccasin, completely smothering you in her massive and sweaty toe flesh. Nisha really liked how that pebble felt under her toe, and it seemed to be an effective stress reliever for her, and she knew that it would be a nice distracter for while she needed to focus today. And then Nisha started to walk again, and as her foot would rise in the air, you felt like your body was being forced into her light brown toe flesh. And when her foot would slam back down, you are totally engulfed and crammed into the sweaty flesh. And even though Nisha knew exactly where she was heading next, you were out of the loop, so you just wonder where you\u2019ll both be going. And where was Nisha going next?</span></div></div>",

Holding the spoon, with her dark eyes locked onto you, is Li.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can move she lunges forward, slamming the spoon down into the table behind you.  Li flicks the spoon forward, catching you in the basin and picking you up off your feet so that you're launched toward her.  You land hard and keep rolling, and Li sits back down in her chair with a grin. Desperately you cry out for help, but no one seems to notice or care.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're standing in front of an open locker at the end of a school day, eager to go home and relax for a couple hours before you have to go to your after school job.  You set your books down on the bottom of the locker, arranging them to be most convenient for you on Monday.  Quickly you rack your brain to remember whether you have any homework you need to get done before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slams shut in your face, and you follow the arm pressing against it to find a white tank top pulled tight over a pair of large breasts.  You look up, craning your neck way back, and see Fulda looking down at you with a grin across her face.  \"Hi, small fry!\" she says with a bubbly voice.  In response you try to run but she seizes you by the front of your shirt, stopping you in your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slams you against the locker with a single motion from her toned arm, then presses you into the metal until your back is flat against it.  Fulda steps around until she's in front of you, pressing her body into yours as much as she can.  Under normal circumstances you would be glad to have your face full of breasts, but this is far from ordinary.  \"I heard you've been talking shit about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  N-no, I-\"  Your muffled response is cut short by her slamming her hand against the locker, the great metal thud causing you to yelp.  You feel her stand up on her toes, probably trying to appear even more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare lie to me!\" she yells, her voice getting a bit louder throughout the sentence..  \"I've heard everything you've been saying to your little idiot friends.  If you fess up I might be lenient and leave you with what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fulda, I really have no idea wh-\"  This time you're interrupted by your own involuntary groans of pain from Fulda leaning heavily against you, pushing you even harder into the locker.  She's big, you think, but she really doesn't look this heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should jog your memory then,\" she says, sliding a hand behind your head.  Her hand is large enough to pin both your ears against your skull.  Fulda pulls you into her, driving your nose into her bare midriff while your cranium buoys her breasts.  \"My boyfriend left me because he felt too intimidated by me, I'm only cheer captain and on the honor roll because people are so afraid of me and - this is particularly rich, coming from a pipsqueak you - that I'm freakishly tall.  That about cover it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose slides into her belly button, causing you to whimper.  \"F-Fulda, w-what are you doing to me?\" you finally manage to stammer, your lips struggling against the fabric of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you don't deserve,\" Fulda replies, stepping forward to place her Converse on top of your shoes.  She jabs her knees forward, bashing them against the locker and forcing your arms out of the way.  Pain shoots up from your sides as when squeezes her knees together, jamming them into your ribs.  You cry out from the pressure, and she laughs in response as your eyes meet the waist of her shorts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I actually liked you until today.\"  Her hand is large enough to cradle the back of your head in her palm, which she uses to jam your face into her crotch.  \"You were always funny, helped me if I needed it, and didn't seem too scared of me.  You treated me like a person.\"  Your back strains as your body is pulled in two separate directions, and you try to get your feet out from under hers.  \"I actually thought, now that I'm single we might... but no, you're just like all the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda moves her shoes from on top of yours, relieving the feeling that you're about to be torn in two at the waist.  At the same time she lets go of your head, letting you drop to the floor.  Immediately you try to run between her legs and get as far away from her as you can, but a quick slap to the back of your head sends you tumbling down.  You slide across the floor until you crash into the other wall of lockers and Fulda quickly pursues, standing between you and the rest of the hallway again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her from the floor, astonished by how large she appears from this perspective.  \"Get up,\" she commands, crossing her arms under her chest.  Reluctantly you get to your feet, and your jaw drops when you stand.  Your eye level has dropped below her shorts, and her entire leg is now longer than you.  \"That's how I know you're lying, shrimp.  If you hadn't been talking behind my back you wouldn't have tried to run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fulda I'm telling you, I didn't-\"  A knee the size of your face slams into your nose, knocking your head back into the metal door behind you.  Your head bounces off the locker right back into her knee, where she holds you in place.  Gradually you feel your feet lift off the ground while she holds you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I <i>was</i> thinking about letting you go,\" she says, \"let you see how you deal with everyone being 'freakishly tall' like me compared to your tiny ass.  Maybe even forgive you after you learn your lesson when your girlfriend dumps <i>you</i> for being freakishly small.  She would be quite gigantic to you now.\"  Your feet have entirely left the floor and you feel the strain in your neck from it having to hold your whole body up while she pins your head with her knee.  \"But you keep lying to me, and I don't think you're going to learn your lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets her foot back down, letting you fall back to the floor.  From down at her knees you look up at her towering over you, a smug grin on her face.  Strangely no one has walked by the whole time this has been going on - if someone saw this happening they'd try to stop it, wouldn't they?  You open your mouth to shout for help but she swiftly kicks the locker beside your head, and the thud from her huge shoe so close makes you flinch away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze continues to drift down her shins, and you resolve to do whatever it takes to stop this.  \"Okay, I said those things!\" you shout up to her.  \"I know they were mean and I shouldn't have said them, I just got caught up in the moment, you know?\"  Fulda grins down at you and you force a smile back up to her, expecting the shrinking to stop at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your chagrin you continue sinking towards the floor, Fulda becoming larger and more powerful to you each second.  \"You think I'm not used to hearing that by now?\" she asks.  \"I've been hearing it all my life.  You get used to it when you hit five feet in first grade.  I'm more upset that you turned against me so easily.  Your friends may not be around to lead you into it again, but I just can't trust you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and back away from her, immediately running into the metal wall behind you.  The top of your head slips past her ankle, and you yell up, \"What did you do to my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda laughs in response, chilling you to the bone.  \"I wouldn't worry about them right now, you're in enough trouble as it is.\"  She begins tapping her foot, the pounding thuds driving their way into your skull. With each thud she grows significantly until the rubber around the base of her Converse is taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry it has to be this way,\" she says, lifting up her shoe, \"but you're too much of a little shit.\"  The underside of her sole is covered with what looks like dried blood, turning the usually brown rubber dark red.  You try to run but it feels like you're stuck in syrup, effectively keeping you in place.  Fulda brings her shoe down directly atop you, crushing you immediately and ending the dream.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You find yourself sitting in the front row of a lecture hall, blue book on your desk, pencils out and waiting for the exams to be distributed.  Seeing this class on your finals schedule had been quite a shock, since you were only put into it during enrollment as a temporary thing and you were sure you had dropped it.  At no point in the semester had you attended a lecture for this course, got any of the books, or even knew what the course material was.  Still, they made it very clear that if you don't at least sit the final you'll end up in a serious meeting with the dean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stack of exams and bubble sheets makes its way to you and you take what you need before passing it on.  This is going to be worse than you expected: the answer sheet is three times as wide as normal, and the letters go all the way out to L.  Who would even design something like this, and more importantly, what professor or teacher's assistant has enough time to come up with all those answers?  You sigh loudly.  Getting a quarter of the multiple choice answers correct is a pipe dream now, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the observer tells the room to begin you crack the seal on the exam, and find that you're more screwed than you could have imagined.  The exam isn't in English, or really any language at all - it seems to use a random mish-mash of characters from every language you've seen.  You look around, sure that there must be some mistake, but everyone else is furiously scribbling away.  Oddly enough, this is the first time you notice that everyone else in this exam is a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to look stupid you pick up a pencil and begin bubbling in answers.  It doesn't matter what they are, you tell yourself, they're going to be wrong anyway, so you go straight down one of the columns in hopes of randomly hitting something.  As you go down the column you find yourself adjusting the grip on your pencil between every two or three bubbles.  Not only is this whole test bogus, but even the pencils you brought are shoddy?  What a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first ten answers you realize there's something amiss.  Your answer sheet no longer fits on the desk, and the pencil no longer fits in your grip.  You look to either side, and see that while sitting you barely come up to the shoulders of the women on either side.  Panicking you raise your hand.  \"Um, something's wrong,\" you say.  \"I need some help.\"  No answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to comprehend the exam, or what is happening at all, you return to merely filling in the bubbles.  Your pencil becomes harder to hold, and more of your sheet slips off the side of the desk, but you do your best to persevere.  By the time you're unable to hold your pencil in anything but a monkey grip and only a few bubbles fit on your desk at a time your nose becomes irritated, and you turn your head to sneeze.  Upon opening your eyes again you notice that you're roughly level with their butts, and you're looking up at the bottoms of their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy, thudding footsteps approach from behind, and you look up from the exam.  One of the observers is walking down the aisle, a woman with dark brown hair held to the back of her head by a clip and glasses.  When she gets close you raise your hand again and say, \"Excuse me, I really need some help.  Something's happening and I don't know what it is.\"  You turn to get her attention and find yourself eye to knee with her.  Quickly you crane your neck back to look up at her, but she continues walking past, showing no signs that she even registered you were making noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do you go back to the exam, filling in each bubble as meticulously as you can.  In very short order you have to hold your pencil in both hands, and the sides of your answer sheet are touching the floor.  \"Someone help!\" you shout, finding yourself looking up at everyone's knees.  \"I keep getting smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your answer sheet slides off your desk entirely, floating into the aisle, and you are entirely unable to lift anything you brought.  You spend several minutes working with the graphite tip in the pencil before you manage to chip it off, still large enough that you have to palm it.  Desperately you grab the edge of your answer sheet and try to drag it back to your desk, but you can't get a firm enough hold on it.  The test observer is coming back down this aisle so you double your efforts, but for nothing.  You jump out of the way of her shoe coming down on your skull just in time, leaving a massive shoe print on your sheet.  \"Hey, I'm down here!\" you yell up from her ankle.  \"Please!\"  Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to finish you run into the aisle and start filling in answers there.  With each answer you fill in the sheet grows a bit wider until you could mistake it for being the floor on its own, and the answers take longer to fill in.  The student next to you has begun tapping her foot, shaking the floor each time her toes hit, which doesn't make filling in these huge bubbles any easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the test you're about the size of one of the bubbles, and it's starting to take several minutes to fill them in.  Loud thuds come down the aisle toward you, and you turn to see someone who must be five hundred feet tall barreling in your direction.  She moves quickly, her shoes sending out shock waves with every footfall, and you dive back out of the aisle.  You narrowly avoid getting crushed while she's on the way to turn her test in.  How is she already done, anyway?  This test is impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to work, doing your best to fill in the answers before time runs out.  There are still over two hundred to go, however, and you're standing in the middle of an enormous D.  Before you can reflect on that too much your attention is drawn by a great racket as your neighbor slightly moves her desk while standing.  In awe you look up at her ankle, then follow her leg up for what must be thousands of feet.  \"Hey, down here!  Look down here!  Please, someone!  Anyone!\"  She doesn't hear you either, and it's not certain she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time you try to fill in another answer someone else walks up the aisle, making you jump back to your desk.  Even were it not for them the observer has begun circling around your desk non-stop, looking down at you as you try to desperately complete an answer.  The constant quakes from her steps make it impossible to actually do anything with your hands, and her omnipresent gaze is unnerving.  Whenever someone walks past you do your best to scream for help, but no one ever acknowledges your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the time limit for the test is up, and everyone else has left the room save the one unobservant observer.  She reaches down to grab the answer sheet and test so you start jumping up and down, waving your arms, yelling bloody murder, anything to get her to notice you.  However she simply grabs the sheet you're standing on and picks it up, dumping you off the page and onto the ground.  You land painlessly, and while she carries your unfinished answer sheet and empty essay book away you get back into your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise she comes back to you, shaking her head ruefully.  She squats and reaches a hand down for your desk, carefully picking it up between the thumb and forefinger of her hand the size of a baseball field.  \"So you do know I'm here!\" you shout up at her enormous blue eyes, magnified even further by her glasses.  \"Why won't you help me?\"  The observer continues to pay you no mind while she lifts you off the floor, treating it like a totally normal tiny desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow you a normal sized desk appears, and the observer silently lowers you back down onto it.  \"Get me out of here!\" you shout desperately.  \"This shouldn't be happening!\"  Your pleas continue to fall on deaf ears as your desk is set down atop this new desk.  She stands and turns away, leaving you alone in the room, but that doesn't stop you from crying out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door closes someone throws it open again, accompanied by violent shock waves from footsteps.  You look to the door and gasp.  In walks the familiar 6'7\" bronzed, jacked, auburn-haired titaness Fulda wearing her white tank top, black short shorts and Converse.  Each step she takes seems like it should shake the room apart, and she sets a course directly for your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda slides into the desk and sets her exam materials to the side, conspicuously missing you entirely.  You turn and look up at her, larger than some mountains from the chest up.  She sets her elbow on the desk and rests her chin on her palm, shaking you so hard you fall out of your seat.  Incensed you stand and start yelling at her, confident that she can't hear you either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this seat's already taken!  I'm sitting here, go find your own, I still need to finish my exam!\"  To your surprise Fulda tilts her head slightly to look down at you, her eyes as large in the sky as the sun is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you're rather bossy for a dust mite,\" she says with a laugh.  Strangely her voice sounds like it did before you shrank, not like she's several miles tall.  You gulp, and she continues.  \"You're much too small to be giving me orders.  Maybe I should remind you of your place!\"  Fulda raises a hand with her fingers out, palm down, ready to swat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's okay, you don't have to!\" you plead, but she proceeds winding up her arm while cackling.  \"Please, I just want some help!\"  Fulda's hand stops rising, and she goes silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what, where, or when, you will always be an insignificant little speck to me, got it?\"  You nod your head, and she grins.  \"Good.  Then she brings her hand down, swatting you into the desk as hard as she can.  Her hand strikes you with the force of a multi-megaton bomb and everything goes black, the only sensation reaching you her persistent cackle.</span></div></div>",

With a groan you look around the room, bleary-eyed from a hangover and curse the bright morning sunlight pouring in through the windows.  A thin strand of red hair lays over you, the only sign that Fulda has moved at all throughout the night.  For now she is still sleeping soundly, the covers moving gently up and down as she breathes in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaks on its hinges, and you turn to see who is entering.  It opens slowly, only a crack at a time, as if someone is trying to sneak into Fulda's room without waking her.  With trepidation you watch, the opening getting a little larger each second, your head pounding from last night and the bright inescapable lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head of straight black hair tousled by a restless night peeks through the door and a drop of adrenaline hits your system, flooding out the lethargy from your hangover.  Li tiptoes in, wearing a plain white pajama top and fleece pink bottoms, her socked feet silent as she steps across the carpet.  Once she's wholly in the room she looks around and immediately spots you on Fulda's face, and her lips spread into a cruel grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi approaches the bed, taking large, exaggerated steps so that she can better control her footfalls.  Even as sensitive as you are in your current state you can't hear or feel her approaching, and you know that there is no chance of her intrusion rousing Fulda.  You slap Fulda's cheek and shout, \"Hey, wake up!\" while Li stealthily moves closer, your hand barely making an impact on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon Li looms over you, the grin still plastered on her face and her eyes brimming with more energy than you would expect for the time of day.  You push against Fulda again, hoping you can shock her awake, but in response all she does is let out a low moan and push her head into the pillow.  You're jostled but stay in place, still in plain view for the giantess above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's hand begins coming toward you, fingers poised to snatch you up, and you begin to frantically beat on the enormous cheek.  \"Fulda, help, wake up!\" you shout as Li's fingers encroach closer.  \"Please, save me!\"  The soft skin you're on bobs up and down as you push on it, and Fulda lets out another grunt at your efforts.  You look up and see the fingers mere inches away, and as a last ditch you look directly at the opening into her ear canal and yell \"Fulda!\"</span></div></div>",

Her fingers spread open and begin wildly flailing to try and grab you while Fulda's eyes open wide.  She turns her head sharply to regard the interloper, throwing you down onto the pillow, and grimaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck do you think you're doing?\" Fulda asks, pain visible on Li's face from her iron grip.  Li stammers for an answer and Fulda tightens her hold, making the Asian cry out from the shock.  You stand up and press yourself against the cartilage of Fulda's ear, keeping your distance from Li's flailing fingers.  It might just be a trick of the light, but it looks like her fingers are slowly getting further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi seems to have noticed it too and moves her other hand in to help, trying to pry Fulda's fingers off of her wrist.  Fulda however maintains a solid grip, and Li's efforts to break her hold are in vain.  In desperation she places her foot on Fulda's knuckles and presses as hard as she can, but finds herself unable to even make Fulda budge.  Her foot does provide a nice visual aid though, and you watch it steadily get smaller the longer Fulda maintains her hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me go!\" Li pleads, her other foot slamming into the bed frame when she's no longer tall enough to maintain contact with the floor.  Fulda simply chuckles in response, and before long you can see her other foot as well when it rises above the mattress.  The smaller she gets the more ferociously Li tries to free herself, but none of her efforts are the least bit successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not much longer before Li disappears from your view, having shrunk entirely into Fulda's hand.  Fulda loosens her grip to avoid immediately crushing the former giantess, and you can her sobbing coming from inside the enormous hand.  \"What's wrong?\" Fulda coos, her booming voice temporarily drowning out the sobs.  \"Did your little break in not go as planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so small,\" Li manages to choke out between sobs.  Fulda laughs and her fingers twitch, and you wait to see what happens next.</span></div></div>",

The soft surface dimples under her weight and you take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's fingers swing open, revealing the visibly distressed woman inside and allowing her to slide the rest of the way down onto the pillow.  Despite her height being drastically reduced Li is still over a head taller than you, and could be very dangerous.  For the moment however she does not do anything, instead only standing where Fulda had set her down, tears running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cacophony of rustling erupts as Fulda turns her head, her thick hair rubbing against the pillow.  Her nose looms just behind you, and one watchful blue eye is level and open behind you.

Look how small she is!  She's puny!\"  You turn back and see Fulda grinning, clearly enjoying seeing Li in this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi begins crying harder at this and lets out a sorrowful wail, which only makes Fulda smile more.

She continues crying, keeping her face hidden behind her hands, so you take one more step forward and wrap your arms around her until you've fully wrapped her in a hug.  Almost involuntarily she drops her hands from her face and places them around your shoulders, allowing her chin to rest atop your head.  With your face on her collar bone you can feel her body being wracked with sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry,\" you tell her, running a hand up and down her back.  \"You're small, but you're not small alone, and I'll do what I can to help you.\"  Li seems taken aback by this, and even stops crying for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" she asks, lifting her chin off of you.  \"You want to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do,\" you reply.  \"When Fulda shrank me no one knew but her, and she wasn't the most comforting person.  I know you're scared, and you're going to need some human contact aside from Fulda's threats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are you being so nice to me?\" Li asks, blinking rapidly to stop more tears.  \"I tried to eat you twice last night, and I thought about swatting you before Fulda could pick you up.  I was up all night thinking about how great it would be when I finally got my revenge.  If she hadn't stopped me you'd be in my stomach right now!  What gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do any of that anymore, though,\" you begin, \"and I don't want to alarm you, but everyone else can, to either of us.  It's different now.  And I think you'll be different too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved being tall though,\" Li replies, then drops her chin back onto your head as she trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I liked not being an inch tall,\" you say, \"but here we are.\"  You tell her your name, then crane your neck back to look up at her, and to your surprise she's looking back down at you.  Your eyes meet, and she wipes the last few tears out of her dark, velvety eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you two just cute as a button!\" Fulda bellows, absolutely ruining the moment.  You and Li clutch each other tighter, and Fulda continues, \"And you're the size of one, too!\"  Fulda sits up and swings her magnificently long legs over the side, creating a deep impression in the mattress that you and Li fall into.  You roll down the slope on her smooth sheets until ramming into Fulda's panties-covered buttock at full force.  Li looks mortified while Fulda laughs, then looks down at the two of you.  \"I'll even take you somewhere for your first date!\"</span></div></div>",

When you can see every line on her palm in deep detail however she stops and delicately uses her thumb and forefinger to pluck Li up by the collar of her shirt.  The shrunken woman lets out a shriek as she's lifted, her socked feet kicking wildly in the air to no avail.  With her other hand Fulda gives Li a quick bat with her index finger, sending her swinging back and forth like a pendulum while she emits a high-pitched shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda looks down at you with a jovial grin on her face, delighting in the torment she's inflicting on her shrunken sorority sister.  She engulfs your tiny body with her free hand then pinches the collar of your shirt as well, dragging you along the sheets before lifting you into the air.  You refuse to give her the satisfaction of a futile struggle though, opting instead to hang limply while she raises you up beside Li.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery-haired giantess holds you beside Li with her hands level once she stops swinging, demonstrating how much longer her lithe body is than yours even in this state.  To her credit Li has stopped crying now, her face frozen in shock instead now that she has seen Fulda from a new angle.  Fulda shakes her back and forth, eliciting a new wave of screams that are quickly drowned out by her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you get lifted further into the air when Fulda stands up from her bed, sending Li back into silence with a few hysterical squeaks escaping from her throat.  Fulda takes a step toward her closet, bouncing you in her grip as you hang helplessly, and your eyes are caught by her breasts bouncing under her chemise.  \"It's a little soon for you two to be shacking up,\" she booms, her voice seeming louder than it had previously.  Is she shrinking you even more, or does she get more powerful the more people she shrinks?  \"I think you'll have a lot in common though!\"  Her grin does little to reassure you, and Li clutches her ears under the sonic assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few steps she crosses the room to her closet and throws the door open, and with one more step she is inside.  Below you is the house she gave you, still in disarray from when you tried to hide from her earlier.  Fulda quickly squats down, causing your stomach to leap and your legs to kick into the air, then holds you and Li against each other.  She lets go of her grip, setting Li down gently and letting you drop the extra distance so that you fall into her when you land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she squatted Fulda stands again, her imposing height dwarfing your house.  Light from her bedroom silhouettes her, making her appear like an invincible titan while Li stares up at Fulda with her mouth agape.  After posing for a moment Fulda bellows, \"Li, you have so many cute outfits, it won't do to let you move in with your new little boyfriend in only your jammies!  I'll go get you some clothes, okay?\"  Li answers her with silence, so Fulda proceeds, \"I'll be right back!  And don't try to eat him while I'm gone!\"  She turns and walks for the bedroom door, her heavy footfalls making earthquakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fulda is out of view you put your hand on Li's back, trying to comfort her, though she remains nearly catatonic.  \"Don't feel too bad. You're still a lot taller than me, right?\"  She doesn't respond to your attempt at levity, so you continue.  \"I mean, if it helps I can consider you a giantess.\"  Slowly Li turns her head and looks down at you, her mouth curling into a weak grin, but before she can say anything the house shudders again with a series of heavy footsteps.</span></div></div>",

A shadow falls over you, and the two of you look up to see Fulda's enormous form blocking the light once more.  Despite her being back lit you can see the smug grin on her face while she looks down at you, huddling against each other for safety against her raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda extends a fist, holding it over the space where the roof should be on the house.  Her clasped fingers swing open and a small bundle drops out of her palm, dropping into the house with all the grace of a rock.  The bundle slams into the faux wood floor at the foot of the bed, causing you both to wince from the crash.  Cautiously Li leaves your side to investigate it while you are left covering your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Fulda does not drop anything else and Li makes it over to the package without any complication.  She pulls back the outer layer to find a plaid skirt underneath, and within that is a pair of white Keds with balled up black socks inside of them.  It does not take much to deduce that the white cloth around them is her linen shirt.  Both of you flinch when Fulda booms, \"I went ahead and shrank your clothes from last night.  You looked absolutely <i>adorable</i> in that outfit, and I think your new friend didn't mind it either.\"  She chuckles, then adds, \"Go ahead, put them on!  Or were you going to stay in your pajamas all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi folds the bundle back up and looks to you.  \"Could I get some privacy?\" she asks.  \"I mean, we just met, and...\"  She trails off, but you can hear the hint of shame in her voice.  In response you simply nod and move for the stairway beside you, sure that she'll let you know when she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous fist slams into the stairs before you even hit the first step, the impact knocking you and Li off your feet.  \"And just <i>where</i> do you think you're going?\" she bellows, turning her fist into a wall in front of you.  \"Trying to hide from me downstairs, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just-\" you begin to explain, but Fulda cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think she's attractive?\" she continues.  \"Pretty, lean, leggy, and plenty tall - to you that is; what's not to like?  Oh wait - are you gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.  \"No, I just think it's disrespec-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make you a deal,\" Fulda interrupts again.  \"Either you're going to watch her change, or I'm going to smash her into paste while you watch.  Sound good?\"  You gulp and realize that sparing Li's modesty is pointless if she gets murdered over it, and turn from the stairs toward her.  You give her a helpless look, and she understands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi tears off her oversized shirt, revealing her flat belly and black bra underneath, then drops it on the ground beside her.  With one more motion she drops her fleece pants that covered her toned legs and black panties, then kicks them away to land at your feet.  As quickly as she can she throws her new shirt on and buttons it up, then pulls up her skirt and zips it.  She pulls the black socks up to her knees as swiftly as she can without tearing them, then slips on her shoes and ties them in a blur.  You admit that she looks like the stereotypical Japanese school girl fantasy, and realize that she chose this outfit for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Fulda's rumbling voice complains.  \"No show?  Not even a striptease for your tiny boyfriend?  Nothing for me, either?\"  You keep practically gawking at Li, while she looks up at Fulda, annoyance plain on her face.</span></div></div>",

She had definitely noticed even before you said anything, \"I would severely doubt it,\" she replies, \"which only means one thing: you're getting smaller still.\"  Something about the finality and confidence Li said that with, leaving no wiggle room for alternate explanations, makes you uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" you ask, though your question gets drowned out by the boom of Fulda's bare foot no more than three inches away from the house.  Another deafening footstep follows, and you realize that you have been cast into her shadow once again.  Li may be a little larger now, but it is nothing compared to the titaness currently looming over you.  The house does not even come halfway up her shapely calves, and her bare legs are like monumental towers all the way up to her yellow lace panties.  She peeks over the sizable mound of her breasts under her white chemise at you and squats down, pushing her knee out to where the ceiling should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you losers are talking about,\" Fulda bellows while she lowers her hand into the middle of the room, \"but I also don't care.\"  She opens her hand, pushing your new bed and nightstand along the wall, and deposits a small bundle of clothing in the middle of the floor.  \"I'll be back in a few minutes, and when I do I expect you to be dressed like an adorable schoolgirl, got it?\"  With that Fulda stands and leaves, allowing light to fill the house the house once again.  Li continues watching her, mouth open in shock, until she turns the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's footsteps recede and become less domineering, and you turn to Li.  She pulls off her large shirt and quickly slips on the white shirt dropped in by Fulda, and you remark, \"Don't worry, I don't think she'll hurt you.  You're her friend, after all.\"  Li ignores you and continues changing, pulling the skirt up her legs and tightening her socks.  \"And it's not like anything can really hurt a giantess like you.\"  She pauses at that remark in the middle of tying a shoe.  You can't tell, but her grin makes you think she isn't annoyed at least.  However you do feel a bit lightheaded, and everything looks like it might be a little... off.</span></div></div>",

She holds you firmly between her digits and lifts you off of Fulda's cheek while you flail with your arms and legs to futilely try to escape.  Sadistically she squeezes her fingers together, breaking your two bottom ribs, and you scream soundlessly into your fleshy gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ascent is slow so that Li can maintain absolute silence, allowing pain to radiate from your broken bones the whole time.  You struggle and manage to free enough of your mouth so that you can breathe, but the pressure on your abdomen keeps you from inhaling more than brief gasps.  Struggling becomes too painful and exhausting to try anymore, and you resign yourself to what is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgony shoots through your body when Li changes her grip, allowing you to finally see past her fingers.  Before you is a massive, dark iris, about half your size, with a pupil only a few shades darker inside it.  She blinks, her eyelashes tickling you as they run down then up your body, then you're slowly lifted away from the enormous eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi tilts her head back to follow your ascent until she has you centered over her mouth.  The tip of her tongue slides out and flirtatiously runs along her top lip, moistening it with her saliva.  She opens her mouth, revealing the gaping, tooth-lined cavern before you, and winks.  Without saying a word she opens her fingers, dropping you from her grip and down into the waiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly between her lips easily, having been directly centered above them, and miss her teeth as well.  The instant you enter her lips snap shut, plunging you into darkness for your last moments, and you begin sliding down the length of her tongue.  Li bucks it at the last moment and throws you up against her palate before you continue your way down, coming to rest on her gullet.  Before you can even move the muscle opens, dropping you into her esophagus to be ferried down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unceremoniously dropped into the pool of her stomach acid, causing your skin to burn upon contact.  Weakly you swim toward a wall and begin pushing, unable to see if your efforts are even dimpling her stomach.  Li feels your struggle and grins before turning to leave the room, allowing Fulda to continue sleeping while you slowly get broken down in her digestive system.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if drawn by the sound of the glass hitting the counter top two other women come stand next to Fulda, each with their own glass and shrunken man in hand.  To her right you recognize Mariam, the blond who had recently helped get you out of a jam, and on the other side is an unfamiliar but powerfully built brunette with a very wide mouth.  She looks at both of them and slaps her hand on the counter, indicating for them to set down what they're holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set their glasses down rim to rim with Fulda's, then drop their men in front of them.  Slowly they get up from their rough landings and look around, their minds most likely agog to see the world at this scale.  Both of them appear terrified and confused, and were it not for the open counter top with nothing to hide behind they would probably try to escape.  You do your best to remain calm, trying to present a good example for the two newcomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariam, where did you already get another?\" Fulda asks, looking down at the blond.  \"Your last one got smashed, like, ten minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I got it from Helen,\" she replies, closing her emerald eyes while she thinks.  \"She had a cage full of them, so I offered her five bucks for one.  I hope that's okay!\"  Apparently your life has a monetary value now, and it's no more than five dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" Fulda says, hefting the gigantic bottle with her right hand.  She tips it spout down, allowing the clear liquor to rush out into their shot glasses, filling each one in turn.  The smell from the alcohol burns your nostrils, and you can tell that it's vodka, probably fairly high-quality too.  Fulda slide's each woman's shot glass back to its owner, the grinding of glass against the tile cutting into your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda takes a second to address you and the other shrunken men on the counter.  \"Don't move.  I'm serious.\"  She then picks up her glass and waits for the other two to follow her lead.  You don't move a muscle, standing perfectly straight while they go about their ritual.  Though you're not sure what will happen if you do, you decide not to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the other two have lifted their glasses they pound them back onto the tile, making a piercing crash that echoes throughout the kitchen.  In one swift movement they raise the alcohol to their lips and tip the shots back, causing enough liquid for you to swim in to rush into their mouths.  In an instant Fulda has finished hers, and she turns her glass upside down so that she can hold it above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings it down atop you, trapping you inside the upturned glass.  The resulting cacophony overwhelms your ears, and your vision swims with stars from the concussive force of the impact.  Inside the glass the scent of alcohol overwhelms you, causing your eyes to water and your nose to run.  Not that there's much to see anyway.  Due to the frosted walls of the shot glass the only thing you'd be able to see are the fuzzy outlines of the giantesses, and possibly some of the residual alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're still reeling the glass begins to move, pushing you along with it.  You're moved along the counter top in a broad curve, the loud click each time the glass passes over a space between the tiles echoing within the glass.  Suddenly the direction reverses, throwing you up against the opposite wall until you drop back down to the tile.  Your glass passes over the trail left by the others, making you sure the others are going through the same thing.  Briefly your glass stops, only to resume moving mere moments later, forcing you along the ground, practically dragged along by the shot glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the glass stops for good, throwing you against the opposite wall one last time, though your body still feels like it's moving.  When you land you remain on the floor, thankful for even a momentary break that you know won't last.  Your suspicions are confirmed when a finger sets down heavily on the base of the glass, making the glass click against the tile.  The hand tilts the glass back, lifting the rim slightly off the ground before tearing your roof away entirely.  You look up from your prone position to see which giantess it is who revealed you - and likely gets to keep you.</span></div></div>",

The ground whizzes by under you as Fulda carries you several feet to your new arena, accompanied by the other spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery-haired titaness gently sets you down atop the carpet and the others fan out, forming a square arena with their feet.

Her white canvas shoes complement her black hose and skirt, and her tight red long-sleeved shirt nicely shows off her figure even under a black vest.  \"Where are you, oh mighty champion?\" she asks, whipping her blond ponytail back and forth as she feigns searching for you.  Gray eyes lock onto you and she adds, \"Oh, there you are!\"  She spreads her feet shoulder-width apart and sets her hands on her hips, a smile still gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you just need to hit her hard enough to make her wince,\" Fulda explains, and you cradle your improvised spear.  \"No one else can intervene as long as you stay in the arena.  The fight ends when either you're dead, or Olga flinches from pain.\"  Wow, these stakes are uneven.  \"Good luck down there!  And... fight!\"</span></div></div>",

For her part she simply watches you approach, amused by the slight trouble you have traversing the carpet.  She opens her mouth and her voice booms \"Fee fi fo fum-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, she's doing it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell the blood of a champion.  A victory for him's a must, or else I'll grind him into dust.\"  When she finishes her taunting Olga steps toward you, closing the gap much more quickly than you would on your own.  Her steps are clumsy you notice, with much more force slammed into the floor than necessary with each.  It could merely be another of her intimidation tactics, but you hope it's the alcohol starting to have an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third stride brings Olga within striking range and you stop moving forward, electing instead to raise your sewing needle upward.  She suddenly changes her gait's pace, quickly bringing her foot forward while barely off the ground and moving it directly towards you.  Reflexively you jump out of the way and barely avoid being stepped on, though you lean against her shoe to keep from falling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite canvas in front, you look behind you to plan your escape.  Before you can push off your present barrier Olga begins sliding her foot forward, dragging the toe of her shoe along the top of the carpet.  You watch it bounce off the floor during its approach, and while it's still moving slowly prepare your evasion.  She pitches her shoe up and slams it forward, while at the same time you run along the front of the shoe blocking you.  Your plan works, and she ends up only stepping on her own shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the opposite side you feel the tables have turned.  You plunge your needle into the white canvas, expecting to hear her yelp in pain, but instead you face no resistance once you're past the material.  Damn, you hit the very tip of her shoe and ended up doing nothing at all!  Desperately you step against the side of her shoe and try to yank your needle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stab may not have harmed Olga, but she did notice it.  From above you hear \"Bye bye!\" and you put all your strength into one last pull.  The needle slides out right when she lifts her foot so it can dart a half-inch over and crush you.  Fortunately the inertia sends you backpedaling and you soundly avoid her stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly Olga stumbles sideways, her long legs working against her for once.  She staggers uncontrollably toward the side of the ring, looking like she'll bowl over Mariam.  Just before she hits Mariam roughly shoves her away, tossing her backward.  Olga falls over her heels and splays out on the floor, sending strong tremors through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you weather the shaking you focus on Olga, and realize you'll not get a better opportunity to win this.  Her bare hand landed half a foot away, and she's rather slow getting up from her spill.  With one charge you can come out the victor.</span></div></div>",

Her thumb close you raise the spear and prepare to drive it down with all your might.  When the tip is just above her knuckle you close your eyes and stab it down, throwing what little you have left into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo yelp follows, no tug from her flinching, not even the feeling of your spear breaking skin.  Instead you drive the sewing needle deep into the carpet, piercing a fiber straight in the middle and penetrating down to the bottom layer.  Olga sets her hand back down beside her and begins pushing herself up, laughing at how easily you fell for her trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically you pull at the needle to get it free, sliding your hands into the eye for a better grip.  No matter how hard you tug it doesn't budge from its spot, driven too deeply down for someone with your meager strength to remove on their own.  A thud rumbles behind you as Olga steps forward, then one comes in front from her other foot, trapping you under her while she stands astride you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you lose the spear you have no chance, so you have no choice but to keep pulling at it.  Olga makes the same assessment and bends down slowly, her hand carefully sneaking toward you.  She pinches you between her thumb and forefinger and lifts you from the ground, pulling your needle out with it!  Before you can celebrate she holds it in place with her other hand and slightly pulls you upward, forcing you to break your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga continues the slow rate of your ascent, relishing her complete domination over you.  Not only is she much stronger than you, she had outwitted you too.  When you pass her waist she lifts you even slower, allowing you to observe her well-toned and developed body.  Far above you see jubilation in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she comes to a stop with you just above her chest, allowing her to look down at you.  \"Well, what do we have here?\" she says, her voice making your ears ring.  \"Some tiny foolish man who thought he could slay a titaness?  Your arrogance has earned you naught but death, hero, and I'm glad to give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she's getting into the role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga ignores the peanut gallery and focuses on you, her lips set in concentration.  \"But how should I finish you off, hm?\"</span></div></div>",

She pushes her red lips together, drawing your attention to her mouth, then puckers them outward toward you.  One of her gigantic gray eyes winks downward at you, and you get a sense of where this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other hand approaches from the side, fingers outstretched, and threatens to engulf you entirely.  You try to flinch away instinctively but there's no way you can escape Olga's grip, and even if you could where would you go?  Instead of wrapping around you her fingers delicately grab the collar of your shirt and she releases her grip around your chest, batting you playfully with her finger before lowering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you swing back and forth like a pendulum Olga lifts you further into the air, holding you above her head.  As you look down at the vast field of blond hair she tilts her head back until it's nearly horizontal.  She parts her lips and opens her mouth wide, revealing her pearly whites again, but with much more malicious intent this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour swinging slows down as you dangle helplessly above her open mouth, able to do little more than dread what's coming.  Her tongue extends to moisten her lips, giving you a silent promise of your fate.  Once you stop swinging entirely Olga's fingers let go, and you rapidly drop toward her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you don't fall straight into her mouth.  Just when your legs pass her lips she closes them around you, stopping your descent at your armpits.  A powerful tentacle slams into your legs, knocking them up, then hits the again on the return.  Olga's tongue slowly circles you until it comes to a rest behind your lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press on her lips to try to extract yourself but Olga tightens them in response, forming a seal around you.  Suction pulls you downward and you do your best to stay out of her mouth, but it's a losing battle.  After only a few seconds your arms slide between her lips and you're sucked into her maw, where you slam against the hard ridges on the roof of her mouth.  Her tongue tenses and tosses you onto her gullet, and a river of saliva ushers you down her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's throat muscles force you down to her stomach, dropping you into a dank chamber full of stagnant air.  You land with a splash in a pool of hydrochloric acid, burning the skin all over your body.  It's over now, you tell yourself.  There's no escape.  The air inside Olga's stomach is thin and musty, and if you don't drown first you'll suffocate before you pass her duodenum.  Finally you can get some rest before Olga digests you.</span></div></div>",

She rests it atop your head then runs it down the length of your body, tapping your feet, then runs it back up, the whole process giving you chills.  A low rumble emits from her throat as she laughs sinisterly, then she curls her finger to her thumb.  \"Let's say we end this fight the same way we started, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can blink Olga's finger shoots forward again, slamming into your chest the same time she opens her grip.  The impact sends you flying across the arena, the ceiling and faces blurs as you speed past them.  As soon as you realize what's happening you crash into something, spared now only because of how ample and soft it is.  Fulda's breasts have, for now, saved your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin pushes back when your forward momentum stops, and you're forced back into the open air.  You fall rapidly toward the ground with a slight arc away from her, dropping you onto the carpet.  Soft fibers give under your impact, cushioning your landing and keeping you intact - again, for the time being.  A booming footfall lets you know Olga is coming, and you scramble to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud thuds inform you of Olga's pace, her feet inexorably moving forward.  As she approaches you turn to desperate measures, spinning around to face Fulda.  Her enormous feet, given a light sheen by her stockings, stand immovable before you, the only thing that can shield you from Olga.  You can feel her eyes on you, and decide to try it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the side of Fulda's feet, hoping to get past her toes before Olga gets within stomping distance.  Fulda slides her foot to block your path and lifts her heel slightly, digging her big toe into the carpet before you.  You're unable to stop yourself, and with a swift twitch Fulda's toe bursts from the carpet, striking your legs and lifting you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour short arc carries you back into Olga's path, and you land much nearer to her.  One of her canvas shoes sets down beside you, followed by the second on the other side.  For a moment Olga stands astride you, looking down in silent mockery and relishing her victory.  As you look up at her stockings in despair, unable to look her in the face, you tell yourself that mistakenly believing Fulda would save you didn't cost you anything: you were dead the moment you stepped in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word Olga lifts up her right foot, holding her thigh level while she aims her step.  Slowly at first she brings it toward you, allowing tension to build, or maybe expecting you to run.  Suddenly her leg shoots downward and her foot connects, smashing you into a carpet stain instantly.  For good measure she raises her heel and grinds the ball of her foot into you, pulverizing your flattened remains.  Then she walks off to get another drink.</span></div></div>",

When your toes touch down she releases the fingers pinched around you, allowing you to drop and land on her soft flesh.  Her fingers remain curled behind you and she keeps her gaze upon you, her intentions inscrutable behind her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for anything that could inspire hope.  Before you, grinning placidly, is Olga, the beautiful titaness who quite literally has you in the palm of her hand.  If you tried to climb on this living mountain you don't expect you'd make it very far; she is, after all, in total control.  Around you, if you could make it to the floor, are five other women, each larger than Olga, who would crush you with glee if she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platform you're on lifts you much closer to Olga's face, holding you less than an inch from her eye.  An enormous gray iris fills your vision, and you can do nothing but stand in awe.  She blinks, causing her eyelashes to tickle any exposed skin, and you flinch away.  In response she giggles, making the platform you're on rapidly shake, then lowers you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops you at her chin, allowing you to take in the majesty of her masterfully chiseled features.  \"Oh, you little hero,\" she says, placing a finger from her unoccupied hand in front of you.  She deliberately circles it around you while she continues, \"We didn't have to fight, you know.  Us titanesses and you tiny men can live in peace together.  We all know you admire our beauty, strength, and intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully she pokes you with her finger, then sets it back down before you.  \"That must be why you come to us, season after season, already small to be made smaller so that you can better bask in our majesty.  Why, then, do you always scream, and try to fight back or escape?\"  She pokes you again, harder this time and pushing you backward.  \"None of us want to step on you, smash you flat, eat you, or grind you into the carpet.  If you want, you can be the first to repent and live peacefully at our feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to reply but Olga's voice booms forth, scrambling the words before they come out.  \"Ha!  Gotcha!\"  She strikes you with her finger again, much harder, sending you stumbling backwards onto her fingers.  They immediately snap shut, throwing you against her palm.  Her fingers squeeze you tightly, and your bones crack under the pressure.  Olga squeezes her hand and your body collapses, crushed in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regards your remains, little more than a small pool of blood in her palm, and smiles.  That live in peace speech was really something, she tells herself, then she wipes her hand off on her shirt.  Smashing tiny people always made her parched.</span></div></div>",

The other giantesses have stopped their grumbling and accepted that, through all their interference, you managed to survive through the end of the tournament.  Now all you have to do is wait for Fulda to pick you up and take you away from the makeshift arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl rumbles from your right, and Li shoots up from where she's seated.  \"You little shit!\" she yells down at you, flecks of spittle landing around you.  \"I'll fucking kill you!\"  She raises a hand high above her head and begins swinging it downward, the center of her palm aimed dead center at you.  It's moving too fast for you to get out of the way in time, and you brace for this last blow to finish you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a tremendous slapping sound, but to your surprise you aren't flattened by her hand.  You look up and see that Fulda has grabbed hold of her wrist, again stopping her from killing you.  \"Let it go, Li,\" she says, tightening her grip.  \"He won fair and square, now quit trying to kill him and go back to the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi struggles to get her wrist free, but Fulda holds fast.  \"No way, that little fucker stabbed me twice!\" she bellows in protest.  \"None of them has ever managed to hurt one of us, I need to put it in its place!\"  She starts to swing her other arm but Fulda shoves her, pushing her away from the ottoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shouldn't have tried to kill him when he had a weapon,\" she explains through gritted teeth.  \"He got away from Olga too, but do you see her clamoring to crush him after the fact?\"  You briefly turn your head away from the spectacle and watch Olga down a shot, then look back to the struggle.  \"Now do yourself a favor and walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's face turns red and she shouts, \"No, fuck him and fuck you too!\"  She raises a foot and swings it wildly in your direction, but Fulda firmly tugs back on her, pulling her even further away and lifting her off the ground.  For a moment she sputters incoherently while thrashing to get free of Fulda's grip, set on finishing you off.  Fulda narrows her eyes, clearly fed up with Li.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you watch the spectacle you can't help but be struck by how much Fulda towers even over another giantess.  Li, no doubt thousands of times your size, looks absolutely pathetic being held up by her, the tips of her feet only dangling down to Fulda's knees.  You watch entranced while Li fruitlessly struggles to get out of Fulda's trip, her kicks bouncing off her thighs as if they were made of stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that doesn't seem right.  You focus on the big picture again, and see that Fulda looks even more enormous holding Li, at least twice her size.  Unbelievable - Fulda is shrinking her!  Li's incoherent screaming gradually gets more high-pitched and directed at her, and you expect that even people her size can't understand a word she's saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi continues to dwindle into Fulda's grasp while the other giantesses merely watch, either out of bemusement or shock at what's happening.  When she's about a foot tall she changers her tune and begins yelling more legibly, pleading for Fulda to stop.  Unsurprisingly she doesn't, and the Asian woman continues to shrink until she disappears into Fulda's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda spreads her fingers, revealing Li standing in the middle of her palm, only about an inch tall.  She looks between you and her shrunken sorority sister, considering what to do with the woman in her hand.  Li falls down to her knees, no doubt begging Fulda to give back her size, but from what you can see her voice falls on deaf ears.  </span></div></div>",

If you lose, well...\"  She looks at the now faint stain from the tournament's first loser before continuing.  \"You know what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lowers Li down to the ottoman and sets her hand down in front of you, allowing her to step off from the platform-sized palm.

You doubt it was difficult for her to entice a victim earlier tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Fulda pulls her hand away and takes her seat again Li walks toward the center until she's practically on top of you, and you find yourself craning your neck back to look her in the eyes.  She may have been shrunk but she's still at least a head taller than you, the most significant fraction of an inch height difference you've ever seen.

Looks like the only thing you've ever competed in is Halo.\"  She scoffs and continues staring you down.  \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready!\" Fulda declares, and Li takes a step back.  Your sensibilities about hitting women have to take a back seat now.

Your vision blurs from the simultaneous temple strikes and your knees give out, dropping you at once to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel capable of doing anything but curling up into a ball, which Li takes full advantage of.  She rears back and kicks you in the kidney with the tip of her shoe, shocking you out of your reflexive defense and opening you up.  Now that you're exposed she kicks you again, this time in the ribs, making you squirm from the shock of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a slight reprieve as Li decides not to beat you bloody in the first thirty seconds, electing instead to walk around to your feet.  She extends a hand down to you and says, \"Come on, get up.  This is boring.\"  Simply glad to not be kicked for a bit you take her offer, her long fingers easily wrapping around your hand, and she pulls you to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of deja vu overcomes you when you get back up and slam face first into Li's stomach, reminding you of that morning.  You try to step back in surprise but she keeps her grip strong, holding you tight against her.  She strikes you in the gut with her knee and simultaneously lifts your arm up, keeping you from bending over.  Her knee slams into you again and your heels lift off the ground, pulled upward by her iron hold.  One last knee to the gut and your feet leave the ground entirely, dangling several inches above hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi plants her other hand on your back and spins, throwing you as hard as she can.  You fly through the air and come down hard, bouncing when you land and rolling several more feet.  Through the pain you force yourself to stand, not willing to give up just yet.  Calmly Li walks toward you, not seeing to be in any sort of hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense her overconfidence and charge at her, thinking you can tie her up and run down the clock some more.  As you approach it becomes apparent how bad of an idea this is.  At present you stand just short of her waist, and her confidence is well-founded.  Still, you've already committed, and you leap at her, hoping your blitz might be able to take her by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't.  Once you commit to a pounce she simply extends a hand, planting it on your head and stopping your forward movement.  She shoves back and your legs swing forward, your body turning in the air with your head as a pivot.  Before you know what's happening your back's on the ground, with dull pressure on your chest from Li planting her shoe atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're small,\" she says, firmly holding you down.  She lifts the front of her shoe and sets it back down, and you feel it expand.  \"And look, you're getting smaller.\"  Again she taps her foot, and more of you slides under her shoe.  \"Oops,\" she teases.  Another tap and you watch her stretch higher, growing even more powerful than you.  \"I just keep doing it.\"  Between every word she briefly pauses and taps you.  Li allows a dramatic pause to let the reality of your situation set in, then taps her foot again. \"I wonder just how small you can get.\"  Again she taps with every word, with extra emphasis on \"small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the space of a few seconds Li took away what must have been over half of what little height you had left, her shoe now covering half your body.  Surprisingly her shoe doesn't feel any heavier, just larger, and you surmise she must not be pressing down.  Her shoe lifts up and sets down atop you again, growing a bit more dramatically this time.  If this goes on much longer, you realize, you'll fit entirely under her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are disrupted by yet another tap, the force ringing throughout your body.  It doesn't matter that she isn't pressing down, these are starting to hurt just from repetition.  Another tap and you get smaller again, with just barely more than your head and feet sticking out from under her shoe.  If she wanted to crush you, you realize she could simply press down now and flatten most of you.  Her persistent tapping means she must have another plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tap, and yet more of your height slips away.  You can't believe this is happening - first Fulda shrinks you to an inch, then she shrinks Li too, and now she's shrinking you even more!  As if to reinforce your thoughts the toe of her shoe slams into most of the length of your body again, reducing you even more.  Li's tormenting question resonates - just how small CAN you get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot lifts up and then sets back down again, making you just a little bit smaller.  You push up with your hands, trying to free yourself from under her foot, but even without any weight pushing down it's too much for you to move.  Li giggles at your attempt and lightly taps you again, causing your eyes to slide beneath the tip of her shoe.  If you don't move soon she very well may shrink you down to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another effort to push her foot off, putting all of the force you can manage behind it, but you can barely even budge it.  Li must have felt your minute effort and responds in kind, increasing the tempo of her imaginary song.  One tap, two, and your entire body fits underneath her shoe with room to spare.  Another and you reduce even more, on a fast track to nothing.  One more tap and you dwindle more.  There really doesn't seem to be a limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi taps you again, and you resolve that it will be the last.  Her hold on you has become loose, and you roll sideways to get out from under her foot pressing down.  You escape just before she presses it down again, your rapidly reducing body no longer there to hold it up.  Quickly you get back up, your body numb from being tapped so much, and put up your dukes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bursts out laughing, and you understand why at once.  You don't even reach halfway up to her knees.  On either side her black socks stretch upward like columns before giving way to flesh, which then leads into a skirt large enough to be a tent.  Li continues laughing down at you, taking on a malicious tone, as you still stand ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not even be a foot tall compared to her, but you don't have to take this.  With a yell you run at her ankle, leaping up to grab on to her sock.  Unfortunately she counters you with a quick flick of her foot, knocking you back down.  Fortunately she doesn't place you back under her shoe.  Instead she reaches down and grabs you by the chest with one hand, her fingers sliding around your limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffortlessly she lifts you up and holds you in front of her face so that she can look you over like an action figure.  Her smooth features and soft eyes make her exceedingly beautiful, especially at this scale - a shame that she's so cruel.  She giggles again and raises her other hand, setting it against the one you're in, index finger poised for many rapid hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead then,\" you say, admitting defeat.  \"Make me small so that you can eat me.  Just get it over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi lets out a splitting cackle, and begins tapping away.  \"No, I don't want to eat you anymore,\" she explains through a dozen quick pokes from her finger.  Her grip adjusts around you as you shrink into her hand, with her grabbing you around the legs.  \"See, you're mine now, and you're much stronger than my last loser.\"  A dozen more taps assault you, and Li resorts to holding you between two fingers.  \"I can have a lot more fun with you.\"  A smile spreads across her face, becoming wider than you are with another barrage of taps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you in front of her mouth, letting you linger for a moment.  Teasingly she licks her lips and moves you toward them, then abruptly stops.  Her fingers around you release, dropping you to slide down the length of her body.  Surprisingly you land lightly enough on the leather to be intact, but that's the best that can be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi is now even larger to you than she was before, her body stretching for what seems like miles.  You look past her head and see something even more daunting.  An enormous icy blue eye on a scale you can scarcely comprehend fills the sky, a pupil large enough to fit a house in the middle.  The leather under you depresses and you look to find the source, followed by your heart sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a mile away is a thumb larger than any building you've ever seen, each minute whorl in the fingerprint or irregularity in skin pattern plainly visible.  You follow the thumb to a colossal hand and then up an arm, miles long to the crook in the elbow, and longer yet to the shoulder.  A torrential downpour of red hair bursts over a dress strap.  It's a person, so large you can barely recognize them, and more than that it's Fulda.  And you thought she was big before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep rumble overtakes you, followed by a warm breeze.  Li bends down to pick you up, still shocked by how enormous every single thing is compared to you now, making you an easy target.  She slides a shoe off and carries you over the top, then drops you in.  You land on the insole with a soft bounce, the walls of your new shelter several times your height.  It finally sinks in: you're less than an inch to an inch.  Not even a third of a millimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumble, it occurs, was Fulda announcing one minute left.  Li's toes appear above the shoe and start sliding in, and you run the length of the insole, just staying ahead of them.  She moves them fast enough to keep the pressure on, but not enough to crush you.  When you reach the toe they ram up against you, holding you in place.  You hadn't even been out of Fulda's shoes for 30 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, he's stuck in my shoe,\" Li shouts up to Fulda, \"he's defeated.  Will you make me big again?  Please?\"  A deep thunder rolls over you, possibly laughter, followed by another series of rumbles.  It's not until whatever Fulda said starts to take effect that your brain can really piece together what her answer was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A familiar feeling hits you when Li starts walking, the rhythm of motion from inside someone's shoe still fresh in your memory.  On the plus side she isn't wearing high heels, so her toe isn't threatening to shatter your back every time she sets her foot down.  You resign yourself to this uncomfortable an humiliating situation, reassured that not only will you probably make it out alive, Li has to be small too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thrown against the front of the shoe and away from her toes, for once held in place by gravity than being wedged against a foot.  The space is still fairly cramped though, and you press yourself against the shoe's inside, trying to get some distance away from the enormous toes.  It's only a matter of time before she hops down from whatever she's dangling her legs from anyway, and you want to be prepared for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch the toes grow larger, expanding before your very eyes.  You expect to be crushed by them momentarily but to your surprise they don't come any closer; if anything, the space between you and them is getting larger, too.  Li's toes continue to grow, along with the rest of her you expect, pushing the boundaries of what you could have ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think they will never stop growing they finally stabilize, and you remember the quaint time a mere few seconds ago that you thought they were enormous.  Li's big toe alone absolutely dwarfs you, to the point where you could spend all day climbing it before you reached the top.  Her socks grew with her as well, and what was previously a fine black weave now looks like a rough net, with threads wider than you and spaces large enough you could easily climb through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during her growth Li's feet touched back on the ground, setting you down on the insole.  The pattern, barely visible to the naked eye previously, now forms tall walls around you that you'll have to scale if you want to get anywhere.  You're glad that at least her toe isn't directly over you, allowing you to appreciate that you at least have some room to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour appreciation for this only lasts until Li takes her first step.  Her foot lifts off the ground with enough intensity to knock you off your feet and press you down into the padded insole.  The sensation only lasts a moment, then you're thrown into the air, flying well clear of the pattern atop the insole and drifting toward her toes.  When she brings her foot down the top of her shoe hits you in the back, throwing you back down to the floor.  Vibrations shake you when she sets her foot back down on the ground and the thunder from her footfall bounces around inside your chamber, echoing for a short time.  Thankfully you didn't end up under her toe, but you may be small enough that even getting incidentally crushed is a low risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking subsides and you remind yourself that was just one step.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Li groans and the pressure on your back relents as she pulls her foot back out, allowing you to drop onto the insole.  She upturns her shoe, tilting it forty five degrees and sending you rolling down the whole length until you're stopped by her heel.  The look on her face does not appear pleased, and she sets her hand across the hole.  With one motion she turns it upside down, spilling you into her palm, then she pulls the shoe away and closes her fingers around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're no stranger to being carried in a hand by now, but it seems as though Li is even less careful with you than Fulda was.  She holds her fist loosely, allowing you to bounce around within her palm, and the constant turmoil scatters your concentration.  Mercifully the ride is short and Li releases her grip on you, leaving you laying in the center of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would be mine,\" she says, her face dangerously close.  Past her head you can see that the sky is still filled with one of Fulda's blue eyes, the light slightly distorted by a magnifying glass.  \"If I didn't think she'd smash me for it I'd eat you right now.\"  She licks her lips and winks, then starts moving you away from her.  \"I might be seeing you later... if you're lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi sets her palm against the highest part of the fingertip on Fulda's middle finger, then turns her hand sideways.  You slide down and land softly atop the ridge of one of her whorls amid a landscape of trenches about five feet deep colored peach hundreds of feet in all directions.  Cautiously Li backs away and Fulda flicks her finger inward, catapulting you onto her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you wanted to stand up right now, you couldn't.  Fulda is simultaneously lifting her hand and standing back up, with the reactive forces from this pushing down and practically pinning you in the middle of her palm.  Around you the world whirs by, but now instead of being disoriented by this it feels more like looking out the window of an airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour platform rushes upward toward Fulda's face, and as you get closer you realize you hadn't considered how different she would appear now.  Previously her face was the size of a billboard model's and just as striking, and you could take it all in at once.  Now it's over a mile tall, and her lips alone would be a trek to walk over.  Your eyes shift between her facial features, and it takes a moment to fully understand that this is what faces look like for you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's eyes dart back and forth, scanning the surface of her palm for you.  When they light upon you they widen and her lips curl upward into a smile, revealing an indomitable white wall behind them.  A low rumble hits you while her lips move, and you're buffeted by a hot breeze.  \"There you are!\" she exclaims, presumably in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears have by now mostly adjusted to the immense size difference between you and everyone else.  Though their voices mostly sound like booming thunder and the vibrations shake your bones you are at least able to understand what they're saying.  \"I was worried I'd lost you,\" Fulda continues.  \"Mmm.  You're the smallest I've ever seen.  I'll have to thank Li for doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue a waterfall of black hair rises past Fulda's palm, the red-haired giantess keeping her word.  Li finishes growing back to her original height and looks down, scanning Fulda's palm.  \"Where is he?\" she asks impatiently.  A peach-colored building sets down beside you, curved outward in such a - oh, it's her fingertip.  \"Oh my God he's so tiny!\" she says, her voice crackling with excitement.  Fulda pulls her finger away and both titanesses lock eyes on you while you remain frozen, aware that running won't help you anymore.</span></div></div>",

The two pairs of humongous eyes silently watch you, their pupils in the dim room large enough to devour you if they could slip you past the cornea.  Finally Li speaks, her booming voice nearly blowing out your eardrums.  \"I'm glad you like it.  I'm going to go get another one, seeya sky-high!\"  With that she turns, her straight black hair whirling up and knocking you over from the minute amount of wind produced by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gone Fulda moves her finger back in, the whorls of her fingerprint creating a looping pattern in the sky above you.  Gently she lowers it down and taps you with it, wedging you in between two of the deep, fleshy trenches on the bottom of her fingertip.  Your vision dims as the blood rushes out of your head while she raises her hand.  Fulda's face goes from monumental to terrifyingly huge as you race towards it, each individual feature larger than any building you had ever seen before.  Now the pores of her skin, flawless even at your previous size, could house you quite comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's finger heads for her mouth, and you accept that at least you are not going to have to live at this size for much longer.  Instead of sticking you inside however she diverts you toward her bottom lip, the broad, soft pink surface ample enough to accommodate a village for you.  She taps her finger on her lip and the sticky gloss seizes you, holding you fast to the sensitive skin.  Her lips spread in a grin, revealing the white wall of teeth above you and pulling the skin under you tight.  Before her smile settles it feels like your limbs are going to be torn off as the skin stretches in each direction, and you remain in agony until her smile fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her lips return to normal you are able to turn yourself over on her soft lip, though you quickly get caught in her lip gloss again.  Much to your surprise when everything is at a distance the world is not absolutely terrifying, and for a brief moment you actually feel tall!  You look down and see Olga's sea of blond hair far below you, giving the impression that for once you tower over her.  The illusion does not last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVibrations rip through your body, her lip moves so that the stretching and contracting skin pulls you in every which direction, and a blaring sonic assault hits your body as Fulda speaks, a mere few words exhausting you.  \"Nothing, my tiny man's dead,\" comes Olga's booming reply, downright pleasant compared to Fulda's voice now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother short sentence from Fulda wracks your body followed by a massive wall of plastic setting down atop you, pushing you down into Fulda's full lip.  Quite unpleasantly you're tipped backward before getting pitched forward again while Fulda takes a sip of her drink.  Before you chafe under it too long Fulda pulls it away again and you're able to see Olga looking up at you - or rather, past you into Fulda's eyes.  \"Yeah, sure!\"  Whatever is about to come Olga certainly looks enthusiastic about it.</span></div></div>",

One of Fulda's gargantuan hands is already resting beneath her chin, angling her face up to hers.  Olga's face rapidly grows larger as you are forced toward it, swiftly becoming a rugged plain in your view.  To think, just moments ago if you forgot your situation you would have thought her short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's red lips fill your view until you are directly held in front of one, her crimson lipstick filling each deep crevice before you completely.  Fulda presses her lips against Olga's, shoving you into the soft flesh of her lip and pushing you into her own.  The entire front of your body is immediately painted by her lipstick, sealing you more fully onto Fulda's lip while also bonding you to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature between their lips quickly becomes unbearable and you are unable to draw breath from the pressure of Olga's lips pressing against your whole body.  Loud smacks hammer your ears as their lips separate and come back together, and you're able to get brief glimpses of their faces, eyes closed, each time they momentarily pull apart.  Every time they do you feel as if you're about to be pulled off onto Olga's lip before being snapped back onto Fulda's, your body straining in whole new ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do nothing against this as your hands are firmly bound by Fulda's lip gloss.  Even if they weren't, you realize, you have absolutely no chance of pushing Olga's lip back even a micrometer - it's just too heavy.  Olga lets out a moan, the rumble causing your entire body to shake, and finally you feel yourself about to pass out. With your last moment of light-headed thought you try to kiss her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you may have lost consciousness neither of the city-sized women have lost their vigor.  They continue for some time, their kisses growing in intensity, until your body no longer has any air to maintain even autonomic functions and asphyxiates.  Fulda carries out one more vigorous assault and Olga responds in kind, pressing you between their lips until your already dead body is crushed between them.  Not long after Fulda bites Olga's lip and stands, leaving a tiny speck of you on each of their mouths.</span></div></div>",

You land hard on the leather with a resounding thud and Li quickly changes her grip, snaking an arm in front of your neck.  She drops you to your butt and puts you in a choke hold, pulling her forearm inward to tighten her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough gagging from her hold you do your best to remain calm and find a way out of this situation.  She clearly has you outclassed in every way, but you're confident you can make it the rest of the 175 seconds if you're smart.  You start throwing elbows backwards, catching her in the ribs but not making her grip even waiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi lifts you off the ground, allowing you to get your feet under you in some measure.  You try to leverage the added stability to add some power to your strikes, but your attempts to break her hold continue to be ineffective.  If anything her grip has become even more solid, and she seems to be getting stronger as the fight goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack spots appear on the edges of your vision, and you stomp downward at her toes, driving your heel into them.  The sudden pain makes Li release her hold, freeing you from her arms and allowing you to stand on your own two feet.  Light-headed from lack of oxygen you turn around to face her, and realize that oxygen deprivation must be seriously affecting your perception.  It looks like Li's grown a foot compared to you, the base of her shirt's opening a bit above the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi takes advantage of your temporary stupefaction and coils up her right leg, lining it up for a kick.  She sends it forward, striking you in the forehead with the heel of her white Ked and staggering you backwards.  Before you fall down she closes in and strikes you in the chest with the heel of her palm, throwing you even further back with her concentrated strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant you hit the ground Li pounces on you, straddling your stomach and leaning back heavily so you can't get back up.  You try to push her off but again you're unable to budge her, your hands uselessly cupping the top of her knees.  Li brings a hand down in a firm slap, involuntarily turning your face to the side, then brings around again for a backhand, this one even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManic glee fills Li's face while she proceeds to slap you over and over, each strike feeling just a bit harder, her butt getting just a bit heavier following each hit.  There's no doubt about it; each time Li hits you either she grows or you shrink a little, and she's decided to game the system.  The slaps continue, making her stronger with each passing second, and you know you have to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start wiggling yourself out from under her, pushing as hard as you can with your feet, but she has a large portion of her substantial weight atop you.  Each push barely budges you, and by this point Li's hand is large enough to engulf your head and only getting larger.  Her eyes widen when she feels you rub against her, and she pauses momentarily to bite her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one more firm push you free yourself, sliding out from under her.  You kick another time to get your legs clear of her skirt and stand up, ready to finally go on the offensive, but instead of throwing a hit you gasp.  Even while she's sitting like this you only come up to her shoulders, if that.  Li grins at your shock and hits you before getting up, karate chopping her hands into both sides of your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're doubled over from pain she stands, and looks down at you while you recover your composure.  When you stand all the way back up you see that her sock, pulled tightly the whole length of her calf, is now several inches taller than you.  If her reprieve was a calculated psychological play it worked - you can't see a way to subdue her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't mean you won't try though!  You run at Li's shin, ready to hold on for the duration of the fight, but get the toe of a large shoe in your gut.  While you're doubled over she taps you several times, further increasing her advantage, before she shoves you over.  She takes the opportunity while you're prone, bending down to prod you in the stomach.  Each hit feels like a baseball bat at full force, and you get no reprieve until her fingertip is hitting the entirety of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get up despite the pain, and realize it's over.  Li towers over you as much as she did before, the top of her shoe's toe slightly above your head.  A low rumble fills the air, calling your attention away from Li momentarily.  The distance to the edge looks like miles now, and you can scarcely comprehend how large Fulda must be now compared to you.  It's official, you're an inch tall to an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumble, it turns out, is a human voice, calling out \"One minute left!\"  Li lifts up her shoe and you watch transfixed while she positions it over you.  An instant later stomps it down, the ball of her foot crushing you immediately.  With your last thought you reflect on how, after all you've been through, this is the most appropriate end.  She grinds her shoe into the speck you leave behind, hardly enough to concern even the most observant housekeeper.</span></div></div>",

You watch her lips move subtly as she whispers something to him but you're unable to make out even a peep, though you assume it's some kind of instruction.  Then she moves him to the center of the arena, sets him down, and quickly withdraws her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly picks up the sewing needle, by far the most popular choice tonight, and levels it toward you.  You'd bypassed this improvised spear multiple times tonight, but each of those times you didn't have every other giantess out for your blood.  From their eager expressions and tensed muscles you expect they'll be more than able to compensate for your less than impressive opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga calls for the fight to start, and sure enough before she can even enunciate the t her hand is already coming down.  You disregard your opponent and roll forward, just avoiding her swat, and find yourself in another shadow.  Thinking quickly you kick yourself to the side, causing Brit's follow-up to slap against the leather.  The two cheer and go to high-five before they realize you're still on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou square up with your opponent who looks as though he has absolutely no clue what to do.  The tip of his spear has drooped to the ground and he seems more like he's waiting for his shift as a guard to end than involved in gladiatorial combat.  Hoping to take advantage of their overconfidence you step close, less than a forearm's length away, and get ready to gut him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your wind-up fingers seize him from behind, yanking him swiftly backward so that you have nothing but empty space to stab.  Simultaneously Olga's finger points down at your head and jabs, causing you to throw yourself out of the way.  Her finger presses into the leather a moment too late, disappointing the giantess again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get up another hand raises above you.  Allison doesn't intend to miss and wastes no time with intimidation, bringing her slap down as hard as she can.  You roll along the floor to get out of the way, just barely clearing her fingers but still getting lifted up by the air rushing out.  The gust carries you several inches before you come to a complete stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smirks when she sees that she missed, not perturbed in the least.  In a natural follow-up she slides her hand along the leather ground until it slams into you, pushing you along as it rapidly moves across the ottoman.  She abruptly stops and sends you careening the rest of the distance until your rolling comes to a stop.  Banged up but having nothing to worry about from your opponent you lie still for a moment before trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head before trying to push yourself into a kneeling position, and see a white button-up shirt the size of a film projector screen in front of you.  You audibly gulp before craning your neck back farther to see the straight black hair in a bob and the coal-colored eyes looking down at you.  Li grins triumphantly and plucks you up with a waiting hand, snagging you by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises you toward her face at an agonizingly slow pace, hoping to build up the fear in your mind.  It works.  When you pass her collarbone you start wobbling back and forth.  At her chin you begin frantically squirming, trying to get free of her grip.  Li's pinch holds tight through all your attempts, and she lets out a low, sadistic laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I get my revenge after all,\" she says, taking a second to exaggeratedly lick her lips.  She chuckles and adds, \"You won't be needing those where you're going.\"  Li reaches up with her other hand and snags the splinter you had been using as a sword, tearing it so forcefully out of your hand it scrapes your skin, then carelessly tosses it over her shoulder.  Then she grabs your cardboard circle of a shield and rips it off your arm, almost dislocating your shoulder with the violent motion, then drops it down to the top of her skirt, over a hundred feet to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to get free this time?\" she asks, raising you above eye level.  \"My little meal.\"  She tilts her head back and positions you over her mouth.  \"My little morsel.\"  Her lips part, revealing the gaping cavern you had been face to face with just a few minutes ago.  Li's tongue, a humongous pink tentacle, writhes to and fro inside her mouth.  \"I don't.  Think.  You can.\"  With each pause she drops you a little lower, bring you to a jerking stop after an inch, and snaps her jaw shut as a finale.  The maw curves into a smile as you get closer, Li's teeth peeking out from under her top lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plant a foot on each lip, standing astride her mouth to prolong the inevitable.  Li gradually opens her mouth, spreading your legs wider little by little until you feel your feet sliding along her slicked lips.  Gravity does the rest of the work, and one failed grab later you plummet into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi's lips promptly seal behind you, plunging you into absolute darkness.  You land on her tongue, which promptly slams you against the roof of her mouth.  She runs her tongue along your body, slathering you with her saliva, and gently sucks on you as if trying to get a taste.  Her tongue's tip presses into your chest while the rest depresses, and she runs you along the ridges of her palate, grinding you into it like a washboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Li decides she's done with you, and a simple flick of her tongue tosses you into a stream of saliva heading for her esophagus.  The muscle easily relaxes enough to grant you passage and the strong throat muscles force you down into her stomach.  With a splash you land in a pool of hydrochloric acid, eyes closed, and quickly kick your way to the surface.  You listen for any signs of the man she ate mere minutes before, but hear nothing.  No doubt he's dead, and you'll join him very soon.</span></div></div>",

She winds up her arm as though she's going to smash him into the arena, ending the fight before it starts, but pulls short just before splattering him on the leather.  He drops from her palm, surprisingly looking no worse for the wear, already wielding a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new opponent holds a short, thin length of a necklace in his hands, furiously spinning it around in a display that you have to admit is pretty neat.  It would be a nice change of pace from having to keep your distance from a spear, you tell yourself, and assume a ready stance.  The chain-wielding maniac doesn't stop and merely continues whooping while he winds up his weapon.  Mariam goes ahead and calls for the fight to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything with Fulda's advice he whips the chain at you, wrapping the links around your ankle.  You hop on one leg while trying to get free, which only emboldens him to give it a firm tug.  The force makes you do half of a back-flip, landing hard on your butt and splaying your limbs on the landing.  He takes the opportunity to bash you with it a couple times, leaving welts on your chest that will surely develop into bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow appears above you and you roll forward, narrowly avoiding a swat from Brit that would have left more than a bruise.  There's not even time to get up before Olga's hand follows up by trying to smash you with a karate chop.  By the skin of your teeth you roll out of her way, the tip of her ring finger hanging over your chest.  You push against her finger to escape from under it and help yourself to your feet, ready to get back into the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Olga's hand clears the path he tosses the chain, this time binding your arms and wrapping it around your chest.  You consider the possibility that Li brought a ringer as he pulls the chain tight around you, straining your muscles while you try to escape.  He runs around you, pulling you along despite your desires to stay.  There's no way someone would shrink a friend of theirs down to an inch so that she could rig something like this, is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent stops and firmly tugs the chain, pulling you toward him.  You use the momentum to jump and try to land a dropkick on his chest, hitting nothing but air when he ducks long before you reach him.  The chain acts as a leash, stopping you short before you can slide too far away from him.  Quickly you get back to your feet and turn around, unaware of just how close you are to Allison's imposing form.</span></div></div>",

You run into him and rear back your head in preparation for slamming it into his, but again he's able to preempt you.  He slams his forehead into your chin before you can bring yours forward, interrupting you attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed and unsure of what else to do you begin straining against the chain binding you.  You know that you won't be able to break it, but if you can make this fight go on a bit longer he might end up getting a hand across his whole body.  In response to your ineffective straining he pulls the chain tighter, digging it into your skin and making you cry out in pain while you maintain a death grip on your weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he hops back and drops the chain, making it unwind a little.  Unable to believe your fortune you start to wiggle your way out of it, unraveling yourself a little bit at a time.  A moment later the reason he broke off so abruptly becomes clear when a gigantic hand slams down, fingers cupped to form a shell above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's fingertips are close enough to keep you from stumbling to your knees, and you're able to see small slivers of the world between her fingers.  Then her hand snaps shut, pressing you into the center of her palm.  With you secured she sharply raises her hand, the sudden acceleration making it feel as if your insides are about to drop out of you.  She tightens her grip, rapidly cracking all your bones and crushing you to death inside her hand.  After letting your blood run through her fingers she drops your mutilated corpse back onto the ottoman with a satisfied smile.</span></div></div>",

Before you can make contact he raises a knee and, unable to slow down, you ram yourself into it.  You double over in pain as the air is knocked out of you, your weakened legs dropping you to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chain around you tightens with another tug from your opponent, the links pressing sharply into your skin through your clothes.  Your grip weakens and with another constriction you drop your weapons, and with them your last hope of pulling a victory from the jaws of defeat. A smug look from your opponent tells you that he's realized the same thing, and the links around you edge tighter.  There's no way this is some random guy who showed up; you're sure that this is someone Li knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA titanic hand descends from above and sets down between you and your opponent, fingertips down.  This is it, you tell yourself.  All Allison has to do is slam her palm down and snuff you out.  To your surprise she points a finger toward your opponent and jabs him in the chest, pushing him away with such force he drops the chain.  \"Okay buddy, that's enough,\" Allison says in a husky voice.  \"You kicked his ass, now back off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor good measure she pokes him again, sending him into full retreat.  You can't help but be amazed at the power of these giantesses: someone who had been throwing you around is utterly helpless against just a single finger.  From beneath her index finger you watch him back away, relieved that you'll get to live a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison grabs the loose end of the chain with two fingers and picks it up, turning you upside down and bringing you with it.  The chain digs deeper, threatening to cut into your flesh as she lifts you higher until you're level with her bright blue eyes.  She places you gently against the palm of her hand and unwinds the chain, freeing you so that you drop into her open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor thirty seconds all you can do is gasp for breath and feel as though the links are still pressing into your skin.  \"Hey dude, you gonna be okay?\" Allison asks, the breeze from her words soothing your welts.  You nod yes, but there's no emotional reaction on her freckled face.  \"Good.  I'd hate for you to be broken before I can do it.\"  Her thin lips press together in what you think is a smile.  Maybe you should have just died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand moves you toward the opening of her low-cut floral patterned shirt, positioning you just above her cleavage.  She tips her hand upward and you scramble for something else to grab onto, not even thinking about the futility of such an action.  In any case there's nothing to stop you, and you slide head first in between Allison's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stopped part of the way down when you're wedged between her breasts, though you're not sure how far you fell.  The fleshy walls press around you as Allison pushes her boobs together, squeezing you between them.  You feel more than hear her chuckle then her grip releases, allowing you to be suspended by their natural contact point.</span></div></div>",

She slams it down in front of you, making you take a step back, then opens her fingers to drop her shrunken man.  When her hand withdraws you see him crouching, hand on a small length of chain, poised and ready to go.  Caught off guard, Fulda simply goes \"Uh, fight?\" to begin the round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent is more aggressive than your previous one, but now that the punishment for running has been made clear you should have expected that.  He swings his chain at your waist, making contact hard enough that it's going to leave a bruise but not getting it to wrap around you.  In response you swipe your shield at him, disrupting his follow-up when he has to duck away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the arena a skinny, strawberry blond giantess with delicate features stands and leans over you.  The shadow she casts makes fighting difficult and you're concerned about what she might do, but you can't risk giving her the attention she deserves.  Your opponent swings his chain overhead, winding it up for another strike, and you prepare to move your shield to block it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when he lets it go she brings her hand down between the two of you, forming an impenetrable barrier with her long, slender fingers.  His chain bounces harmlessly off her skin and she flashes him a withering look with her vivid green eyes.  He backs off, and she turns her attention back to you, along with a look of playful curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her hand toward you, her fingers flapping back and forth as it goes.  You're unable to avoid them as the pale skin gently smacks into you, pushing you back through their sheer size.  You try to push back but they're constantly in motion, rendering you unable to even brace yourself for long.  Briefly you manage to maintain contact, but you're so much smaller than her she simply continues battering you toward the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she's brushed you along five or six times she withdraws her hand, revealing your opponent again who has become no less eager to win.  He rushes through the previously blocked space the moment it's open, bringing his chain down in a downward throw.  You're taken off-guard and it wraps around your arm, binding you to him for the moment.  The two of you struggle for control, with you trying to wrest the chain out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the giantess remains poised over the arena, continuing to cast you in her shadow.  She reaches into her pocket to retrieve a small, hand-held item: her phone.  A spotlight illuminates you and your opponent, shining into your eyes as she begins filming.  No doubt she's planning something, and for some reason she wants this fight recorded.</span></div></div>",

You find it difficult to concentrate with the sudden illumination, and the ever-present threat from her simply standing over you is impossible to ignore.  Your opponent takes advantage of the distraction and yanks hard on the chain, making you drop your makeshift sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariam, you're fucking up the fight,\" Fulda says.  \"Either do something or sit back down, you'll have to delete the video anyway.\"  The towering silhouette turns to look at Fulda, its long ponytail dropping far enough down to brush against the arena's floor.  \"Because it's evidence,\" Fulda elaborates to her, as though talking to a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her hands around and the stoplight goes away, throwing you back into the darkness of her shadow.  Your eyes were in the process of adjusting to the harsh light, and its sudden removal throws your vision into disarray again.  Fortunately your opponent is similarly afflicted, and during your undeclared truce you manage to unwind your arm from his chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the bright spots recede from your vision, allowing you to see again, and Fulda clears her throat at Mariam.  At the top of your field of vision you see her massive hand begin to descend toward you and you jump backward, hoping to escape her long fingers.  Your opponent does the same, but nothing comes down between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her feint Mariam winds her hand back up and redirects it.  You've yet to regain your balance after your first dodge and stay in place like a sitting duck, right in the path of her fingers.  The tip of her middle finger strikes you right on the head, knocking you down and fracturing your skull, but not immediately killing you.  You crumple to the floor in agony, unable to do anything else but cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?  Finish him off!\" Fulda demands.  \"He's suffering!\"  Mariam complies, raising her hand up again.  She swings it down atop you once more, her middle finger running three times the length of your body.  This time her slap strikes hard against the leather, flattening you under her finger.  The pop from her hand hitting drowned out the sound of your bones cracking, and your brief yet debilitating pain is over.</span></div></div>",

You unwind your arm from the chain, rapidly rotating your arm so that the taut chain grows more lax in his hands.  Before he realizes what's happening you've freed all but your wrist, and by then it's too late.  His reactive jerk on the chain pulls the loose end to him just as your hand slips out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Fulda asks the giantess filming you.  \"You know that what we're doing is super fun, but also <i>super</i> illegal, right?\"  The gigantic silhouette shrugs her shoulders and keeps the light on you while you square up against your opponent once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" she says, her soft voice given a velvety quality by her size.  \"I'm not going to film a person dying.\"  Her choice of words hardly reassures you, since in just the past ten minutes you've seen plenty of evidence that they don't consider shrunken men to be people.  You'll have to remain conscious of what she's doing throughout the fight, something your opponent is free from by dint of facing away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to circle around him, trying to get the light in his eyes and shake her unspoken threat from your mind.  Just when you have her at your back she decides to strike, and the tips of her enormous thumb and forefinger clamp around the metal splinter you've been using as a sword.  Effortlessly she yanks it out of your hand, pulling you hard to the side.  You watch her carelessly toss it over her shoulder and giggle while you stumble out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can recover for that she uses the same digits to grab hold of your shield and pull on it, lifting you off the ground.  You struggle to free your arm from it while she drags you upward, only managing to slide your arm out when you're an inch off the ground.  With a thud you land in a heap, lacking any of your weapons and easy prey for your opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees that you're helpless and begins spinning his chain, building momentum before throwing it at you.  You raise your hands and stay moving, ready to get out of the way and try to salvage some dignity from this situation.  Fortunately you don't have to; when he throws it another gigantic hand blocks it, and the chain harmlessly bounces off the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly the hand belongs to Olga, whose champion you just defeated.  \"He's dead to rights,\" she declares, \"so I'm claiming him.\"  Before anyone can object her fingers engulf you, closing you inside her fist.  Quickly you're picked up from the ottoman, your stomach trying to stay where it was while you rapidly ascend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga holds you in front of her crimson lips while her light gray eyes examine you.  \"Hey there little guy!\" she yells excitedly, the volume of her voice straining your ears.  \"You're mine now!  Easy come easy go, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm uncomfortably in her grip, but find that it's too tight to even wiggle.  \"Two wins isn't bad, you did pretty well for someone weaker than my little finger!\"  She seems positively giddy, probably not a good sign for your survival.  \"You mostly lost to Mariam anyway, don't sweat it.  You're definitely stronger than my last guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves you over to the side of her face, holding you level with the temples of her glasses and loosens a finger, allowing you to move your arms.  \"That's why I'm sure you're up for this.  If you can hold onto my glasses for the rest of the tournament, you'll get to see more of the party.  If not, splat!\"  Fearfully you reach your arms up and latch on with your hands, gripping the metal for dear life, and she releases her grip.

Another dull thud sounds when it hits his chest again and you feel the tension on your arm dissipate as he lets go of the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this one's feisty!\" the filming titaness exclaims as she lowers her face to your floor, the light making even you cast a long shadow.

Fulda lets out another sigh, clearly not pleased with her actions but accepting that it's better than what she had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your opponents' eyes adjust to the darkness and you resume fighting in earnest.  Viciously you stab at him, making him dodge to the side, then follow up with a shield bash to knock him off-balance.  Mariam's attentive emerald eyes watch you intently, and a satisfied moan escapes from her throat as a low roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp thud of something setting down on leather behind you grabs your attention, making you break off what might have been the killing blow.  Before you can dodge a powerful gust of warm air rushes into your back, blowing you across the arena.  You drop your weapons from the sudden shock and skip across the leather in a low trajectory, propelled by Olga's powerful breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll the last foot until you come into contact with the bare flesh of an absolutely monumental thigh that stops your skid.  Unable to get up you simply push yourself onto your back and look up, your dizzy vision just able to distinguish what's practically a denim miniskirt atop the thigh.  Mariam shoots up, her full height making your vision spin even more, and exclaims, \"Hey, I got one!  Thanks Olga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, not yet,\" Fulda says, \"he still has a chance at this.  It's not over until he's threat-\"  Your opponent's run comes to a stop with him pointing the tip of your makeshift sword down at you.  \"Okay, now he's yours.\"  Fulda sighs one last time and sinks into her chair, resting her forehead on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you already have one?\" the Asian next to her asks.  \"If you don't you shouldn't be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh.  Well, I do,\" Mariam begins as she plucks you up from her thigh, \"I just like this one more.  He's got more spirit.\"  She raises you up the considerable length of her body until you're dangling in front of her face.  Though you're still too dizzy to see straight, she is more than able to look you over in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he can't fight again, don't you?\" asks the black-haired woman across from her.  \"He already lost, he's out, you have to use the one you already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine!\" Mariam answers, much too loudly for your tastes.  Your vision blurry and your ears ringing all you have to go on now is your sense of feel, and the realization that you're effectively dangling hundreds of feet in the air suspended only by your shirt and Mariam's fingers creeps into your mind.  \"This one looks like he'll be fun to have around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put him away and let's move on,\" Fulda says, clearly annoyed with the whole situation.  \"We still have one more round - that is, if you have one to put into the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure just gimme a sec.\"  You feel yourself being gently lowered while Mariam sits, your rate of descent surprisingly considerate of your size - especially because she doesn't seem to care about the shrunken man she already has.  Your blurry vision goes from light to dark when you cross the threshold into her skirt, Mariam's hand guiding you up between her thighs.  She sets you down close enough to her crotch that you can feel the heat coming off it then crosses her legs, smushing you between her panties and her thigh.  How the rest of your night goes depends on how well her champion does, you figure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intense heat radiating from inside Mariam's panties is trapped and intensified by her thigh, making the small pocket where you're trapped unbearably hot.  In less than a minute you feel sweat beads forming on your forehead, and the air is so warm it dries out your throat when you inhale.  You wipe off some sweat with her panties and her leg involuntarily twitches inward, pushing your whole body against the white cotton wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes you indistinct screaming coming from her and the other giantesses, the sound dispersed as it goes over and around her thigh.  Every time Mariam shouts you get shaken up by the waves travelling through her as well, shaking you up and nearly turning you into a vibrator.  As the fight goes on you notice she's screaming more and more frequently, kicking the vibration into action, and her panties are soaked beyond where you've been wiping your sweat.  She's getting off on this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to be used by her like this you push yourself into her thigh, pressing into her supple skin as much as you can.  Very soon after however she clenches her legs together, ramming you up against her panties and holding you against them.  You inhale as deeply as you can before you hit, getting a strong smell of her juices before your face is forced up against a wet spot.  After that whiff you decide to hold your breath as long as possible, if you can even breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully Mariam unclenches her legs after only a few seconds, allowing you to get away from her panties.  Her thigh continues to spread open, allowing you to see out her skirt, and you turn around to see what has happened.  Unfortunately Mariam's skirt follows her legs upward enough to block your view, but judging from the noise you'd guess that Mariam's fighter lost, and he probably lost bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand passes between her knees and into the skirt, and Mariam probes blindly with her fingers trying to find you.  To make it easier you walk up and stand in front of her middle finger, taking a firm nudge to your chest from her.  Once she's found you she hooks her index finger around and throws you against her thumb with it, pinning you between her digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Mariam pulls you out, and you're glad to finally be getting back into the fresh air.  Your vision has been clear for a few minutes, though it was difficult to tell in the dark, so now you are able to get a better look at her during your ascent.  She is incredibly thin though not unhealthily so, the impression aided by how naturally tall she is.  Her green eyes are shaded by thin, arched eyebrows, and she has high cheekbones and thin lips.  There's something almost elfin about her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn due time she gets you where she wants to hold you and stops, smiling shyly down at you.  \"So, um, that was a thing,\" she says, her rosy cheeks blushing.  What does she have to be nervous about?  She's literally holding you in her hand!  \"I hope I didn't make you too uncomfortable in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was, uh, it was fine,\" you manage to squeak back, averting your eyes from her face.  \"I had a good time, and you clearly did too.\"  She blushes even more and looks down.  What is with her?  All the other women you've met here are not only all super-aggressive and uncaring, they're also extremely physically fit.  It's like Mariam is the odd woman out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she looks back to you and says, \"So, um, let's go do something together you... tiny little bug?\"  Her heart clearly isn't in it.  Maybe you've finally caught a break with her.</span></div></div>",

Unlike the other times you've been lifted though you don't feel dizzy, and Mariam may actually be showing the slightest bit of concern for you stuck in her hand.  You grin up at her and she taps your head with her free hand, rustling your hair with nothing more than her fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins walking with you, supporting your legs with her other hand to keep from shaking you up too severely.  You definitely appreciate the extra support, keeping you from swaying too much with each step or feeling the impact from every footfall.  Mariam holds you so steady the only way you know you are moving is the world flying by you at a hundred miles per hour, and luckily no one else pays much attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going up the stairs as you expected she goes through the kitchen, sliding past several women grabbing more drinks on her way.  The clicking of her heels reverberates against the tile, reminding you that while she is being considerate toward you now that could change at any time.  Her finger drops away from your feet, allowing you to swing wildly when she leans into a door, the force from her running into it rattling your bones momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside the cool night air washes over your face, a welcome reprieve from the blistering hot air of the party.  Mariam sits down on the front step, dropping you suddenly and making your stomach leap up to your throat.  Upon seeing your discomfort she looks embarrassed and quickly lowers you down to the concrete, gently setting your feet down on the rough surface.  She opens her fingers, freeing you from being pinned in her hand, and quickly withdraws it to rest by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam's long legs stretch out on either side of you, seeming as if they're hundreds of feet long from just her knees to her feet.  She has clamped her knees together, putting the point of confluence just before you, creating the illusion that her shins stretch toward the horizon.  Her shoes shift uncomfortably against the concrete, creating a cacophonous scraping and irregular thudding that makes you focus on the size of her legs alone.  You focus on her, peeking out from above her knees, to keep you focused on the situation at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, small huh?\" she finally says after an awkward silence.  \"And I'm big, I guess.\"  You suppress the urge to be sarcastic, knowing that by merely dragging her foot back she could she could flatten you.  Instead you merely look up at her from the ground, waiting for her to say something substantial while you bide your time between her legs.</span></div></div>",

She places her hands on the step where she's sitting, fingers hanging over the edge, and arches her back, closing her eyes and raising her head upward.  A small, satisfied moan escapes her lips before she snaps back, her feet slamming back to the concrete with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like being so small?\" she asks, lounging back so that her eyes are barely visible past her knees.  \"I've always been really tall, so I can't imagine what it's like.  Joining the Gammas was the first time I was ever in a room full of people taller than me.  We must all be absolutely enormous to you, like you stepped into a magical realm of giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't exactly say magical,\" you reply, looking away from her massive shoes and back toward her, \"but yeah, you do.\"  Your eyes follow her leg, starting at her ankle and moving up her slender calf to her knees a hundred feet above you.  \"Every moment is terrifying, and there's no escape.  Just being on a table is enough to be a constant reminder of how small I am, but one of you is always there to make me feel absolutely puny.  And there's always the fear of getting crushed.\"  You pause, then bluntly ask, \"Have you ever killed a shrunken man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits up straight and drags her feet back to her, the grinding of her soles against the concrete grating against your ears.  When her feet come together she points her toes inward and lifts her heels, leaning forward slightly.  After a moment of looming over you she finally says, \"Yes, I have.  I didn't want to, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you didn't want to, then why'd you do it?\"  You do your best not to get intimidated by her poised over you, as if ready to strike.  \"And that doesn't even bring up the guy you got killed by Fulda earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the initiation!\" Mariam says, her voice wavering.  \"In order to become full members we have to crush a tiny man within a week.  By the time they tell you about it, it's too late to back out, and if you don't go through with it... they do it to you.  They don't want anyone outside the sorority knowing about it.  If I didn't kill him, they would've killed me, and then him anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to save you,\" she says after a second, her eyelids fluttering rapidly.  \"Li enjoys killing shrunken men way too much - they all do, really, but I hate how she does it.  Watching her drop one of you into her mouth and swallow is horrifying, and her smile afterwards is absolutely depraved.  If I hadn't, you'd be in her stomach right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards her cautiously and place a hand against the toe of her shoe.  She spreads her knees, allowing her to look down at you by her feet.  \"I guess I hadn't considered that you saved my life,\" you say.  \"Thanks... but I'm not sure I have much of a life left to save anymore.  \"I give it a week, tops, before you or one of your sisters steps on me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do that though!\" she protests, slapping her knees back together with a fleshy pop.  \"And I'll do what I can to keep them from doing it too, at least to you.\"  The conversation drops, with you looking up at Mariam's shin while leaning against her shoe, and her peering down at you from high above.</span></div></div>",

She scrapes her shoe along the concrete ground, placing you right in the middle of her instep.  You turn to run away from her and hit the exact middle of her instep's curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're trying to climb up the side of Mariam's shoe you feel a firm tug on your shirt when her fingers seize your collar.  For a moment you kick fruitlessly at the air and try to grab onto her shoe while she lifts you away, carrying you back toward her.  You stop your vain kicking by the time she pulls you up to her knees, and since you have nothing left to grab onto you allow your hands to fall to your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mariam has you over her skirt she opens up her other hand, then drops you into the middle of her broad palm.  Your feet sink into the soft skin between the wrinkles and you're glad to have your feet touching the ground again, even in such a risky position.  She withdraws her other hand, leaving you stranded in the middle of her outstretched mitt, an attempt at a seductive grin on her lips as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam's hand moves you up her chest and toward her face, keeping the pace incredibly slow so that you can remain standing.  \"No need to be embarrassed,\" she coos, her voice's intense volume overriding what could have been a seductive tone.  \"I mean, we already kind of banged, right?  This is a few steps back from that.\"  She must be referring to when she used you as a vibrator, quite against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of pink lips loom ever larger above you, getting closer each second as you're lifted by Mariam's hand.  Her tongue slides out from her mouth and runs along them, moistening them with saliva in anticipation for your arrival.  Instinctively you back away, sure that Mariam is about to drop you into her mouth, but you're stopped when you run into her fingertip.  You are helpless as you're lifted the rest of the way until you stand in front of her lips, long purses of pink skin stretching far on both sides from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and Mariam puckers her lips, pushing them out far enough to place them across your entire upper body.  She pushes you into them with her finger and you feel yourself engulfed by the warm, soft tissue, your head pushed into the tiny hole leading into her mouth.  Mariam minutely opens and closes her lips, the closest thing she can think of to making out with someone much smaller than her but feels like you're weakly being gummed to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds she opens her lips, allowing you to fall back into her palm while she pulls her head back.  \"So, uh, how about it?\" she asks.  \"Want to be my tiny boyfriend?  Or maybe just my little piece on the side?\"  Mariam looks very satisfied with herself after that dime-store pun, and you wipe some of the saliva off your eyes before answering.</span></div></div>",

Heat from Mariam's hand builds quickly and you begin to sweat, but she is holding you so tightly you can't wipe it from your brow.  She swings her hand wildly as she walks, no doubt exaggerating it to make your time more uncomfortable, so that blood is constantly rushing between your head and feet and your stomach never gets to sit still.  For the whole ride's duration you are never sure which way is up, and your persistent confusion exacerbates your physical unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the walk stops, and you no longer feel your organs thrown about inside your body.  \"Hey, text me tomorrow,\" she says, her voice easily reaching you through her hand.  \"Let me know how it goes.  Maybe I'll feel bad and come get you.\"  She rattles off her number and loosens her grip, giving you a few moments to get it programmed into your phone.  Your reprieve is brief though, and just when you finish she tightens her grip again and lifts you.  Mariam knocks on the door with the hand holding you, three reverberating thuds travelling through her fingers and shaking your organs up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several seconds nothing happens, and you consider that maybe Alyssa went out tonight.  What would Mariam do if no one's home, you wonder?  Would she leave you in front of the door alone, or would she take you back home with her?  Mariam raises her hand and gets ready to knock again when you hear the door unlock and slowly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're Alyssa, right?\" Mariam asks when the door is open wide enough to see her.  You hear your girlfriend's tired acknowledgment, followed by her wondering what's going on.  The fingers wrapped around you lift away, leaving you on the enormous plain of her palm for a second until she plucks you up with her other hand, pinching you by the shirt collar and lifting you up.  She moves you over to dangle in front of Alyssa's face, and her tired, half-closed gray eyes widen when she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your boyfriend,\" Mariam explains cheerily, and Alyssa's mouth goes wide.  \"He spent all night at a Gamma Tau Sigma sorority party, where he drank too much and got shrank down to an inch tall.  Not sure what he was doing there if he has a girlfriend though, especially one as pretty as you.  Anyway, just think you should know he climbed up my skirt at one point, and I'm not sure if he was trying to dump you or cheat on you but he definitely asked to be my boyfriend and wanted to go up to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam's introduction and story is met by a long silence from Alyssa while she stands there trying to process what she is hearing.  \"I'm sorry, this is a lot to take in at once,\" she explains.  \"First you show him to me like this, then you tell me all the crazy shit he's been up to tonight?\"  Mariam nods.  \"And this inch-tall thing, is it reversible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Wait, she thinks it's good?!  Even more to your surprise a smile starts to spread across Alyssa's face while she looks at you, suddenly with quite a predatory gaze.  Briefly she looks from you up to Mariam and opens her mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

Mariam releases her grip on your collar, letting you plummet into Alyssa's waiting hands.  You land with bent knees on the side of her palm, immediately falling against her soft skin and rolling down toward the middle.  After a rough tumble you come to rest where her hands meet under Alyssa's withering gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for bringing him to me,\" Alyssa tells Mariam as she goes back into the apartment.  \"And for telling me... all that.\"  Without waiting for a reply she closes the door behind her, then uses her pinkie finger to turn the latch on the deadbolt.  A single lamp casts dark shadows over her face while she looks down at you with a glimmer in her eyes.  \"And thank <i>you</i> for getting shrunk like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can scarcely believe your ears.  Not only does she not seem to care about all that other stuff, but she seems overjoyed that you fit in the palm of her hand now.  \"Hold up a sec,\" you say, wanting to address this before anything else.  \"Why are you acting like it's a good thing that I'm an inch tall now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is!\" she replies, her voice assaulting you with her excitement.  \"You've always been tiny in your soul, and I thought you were way too tall.  Hell, you might still be a smidge big.\"  How can she even joke about that when she is literally looking down at you in her hand?  \"But now that you're, like, ankle-height?  The outer you reflects the inner you, Tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter trying to find a reply.  This is not at all the reaction you expected.  \"Aren't you even a little bit upset?\" you finally ask, her beaming face continuing to perplex you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would know about little bits!\" she exclaims, almost involuntarily, and laughs at her own joke.  Alyssa takes a second to compose herself before giving a more serious answer.  \"Tiny, I just got woken up in the dead of night by a giant tart presenting me with my shrunken boyfriend and telling me that he was out all night partying and trying to climb in their pants, I'm a bit in shock.  Right now I need to get back to sleep and mull this over, and you should too.  We can talk about this in the morning, okay?\"  You nod, fully aware that you're in no position to call the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be too much of a pest-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are the size of one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but where am I going to sleep?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa looks up in contemplation and pulls a hand away, nearly dropping you to the floor as half the surface slides out from under you.  While you scramble to get into the center of her remaining hand she taps a finger on her chin to exaggerate her thought process.  Suddenly she snaps back down to looking at you, eyes and mouth wide, and declares \"I know!\"</span></div></div>",

In the morning when I'm ready to talk about this I'll come get you... and if it turns out I'm mad I'll just step on you.\"  She cracks a wry grin, but you don't share her appreciation for that joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa steps into the middle of the room, keeping her hand cupped to cradle you in her palm.  She lowers you down towards the carpet, and when you pass her waist you realize she hasn't been wearing pants this whole time, just a shirt several sizes too large for her.  When her hand reaches the floor she tips it sideways, causing you to slide out of her palm and land on the floor.  Inertia forces you to your knees, and Alyssa withdraws her hand to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariam was right earlier: you are definitely re-evaluating the meaning of average height now.  Alyssa towers over you like a spire, her shapely legs two pillars that look to be chiseled out of marble hundreds of feet high.  She steps over you, her bare foot easily clearing your head, causing you to feel some trepidation about her bringing it down on you right then.  Her foot lands with a soft thud, but her weight alone is sufficient to generate a light vibration through the floor and make your teeth chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud crash when Alyssa dumps out a bag and dice scatter all over the table, with one boulder-sized polyhedron falling to the ground.  She turns around and comes back toward you, each step generating small quakes that get more intense as they get closer.  When she reaches you she tosses the dice bag down next to you and places her bare feet on either side of you, then rests her hands on her hips.  Briefly she looks down at you sternly, doing her best to make you nervous, and you worry that she might be too enthusiastic about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she breaks the silence, saying, \"That should work as a sleeping bag or something, just try to get comfortable.  Sleep tight, I'll see you in the morning! ...hopefully.\"  With that she leaves, stepping over you again as if to demonstrate that she can.  She continues down the hall, the vibrations from her footfalls getting less intense until they stop reaching you entirely.  Before going into her room she turns off the lamp, plunging you into darkness, then closes the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dice bag is more the size of a tent than a sleeping bag, and the rough felt is heavy and coarse to your skin.  Still it's better than nothing, and you slide yourself into the pouch until it comes up to your chin.  You lay your head down on a fluffy carpet fiber and close your eyes, hoping that when you wake up you'll discover this whole day has just been a horrible nightmare.</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes when you feel a massive presence over you and the air's temperature raise several degrees to find an enormous outstretched palm over you.  Before you can get out a pair of log-sized fingers seize the top of the bag and yank it up, dropping you into the sack's cloth depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pitch black you can only feel yourself being lifted, your stomach pressed against your spine as you get dragged upward.  The ascent is brief, followed by violent shaking as the pouch is roughly handled.  Narrow beams of light stream in when fingers poke their way through the top of the cinched bag, revealing the texture on the black felt walls surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's in this bag?\" Alyssa asks loudly while her fingers fumble with the opening.  She always did like putting on a big show, you remember, and this is clearly no different.  Her fingers throw the bag open, revealing a pair of light gray eyes peering into the bag, widened in faux shock.  Alyssa lets out a fake gasp and declares, \"Why, it's my tiny boyfriend!  Small enough to get lost in my dice bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost carelessly she upturns the bag, dumping you out into her waiting palm.  You land face-first in the middle of her hand and blink rapidly, trying to get your eyes to adjust to the light.  \"The very same tiny boyfriend who disappeared all day yesterday until some spindly strumpet woke me up with him!  Lucky for him her story didn't quite add up or he'd be a stain on the carpet right now.  So, Tiny, what did happen yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you begin you take a deep breath knowing that this is going to sound outlandish, but she can hardly dispute you getting shrunk down - she is, after all, holding you in her hand right now.  You launch into an explanation of how you bumped into Fulda on the way to class, causing her to shrink and then kidnap you.  Alyssa appears to be getting bored with your step by step, so you skip ahead to being stuffed into her shoe and the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, why didn't you text me during this?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the time I could barely move,\" you tell her, \"and if she caught me texting for help I'd probably be a smear on her sole right now.\"  Alyssa nods and you continue, telling her about the mortal combat tournament you were forced to participate in.  When you get to the part about Mariam claiming you, you place special emphasis on her shoving you up her skirt and pressing you into her underwear with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't crawl up in there on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no.  Frankly it made me feel violated, like when she started kissing me and trying to make me her boyfriend.  I told her I already have a girlfriend, she got really upset, and that's how I ended up back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell a pretty good story, Tiny,\" she says when you're finished.  \"I'm not sure if I believe you though.  You have a pretty strong incentive to lie right now.  I mean, I could just clap my hands together and smash you at any time, that's gotta be scary, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa, I-\" you start, but she cuts you off.  She's made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

You manage to hop backwards out of his weapon's reach, but he's able to recover and get back in a ready stance much sooner than you foresaw.  Another swift jab, this time for your chest, gets dodged, but before you can move to counter he has again already covered the ground you gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour retreat continues, though you do what you can to reverse your fortunes.  Each time you bat at the tip of his needle with your own weapon it barely even budges, and he's able to keep it pointed at your chest.  You look behind you to see if any of those women want to spice up the fight and get you out of the predicament, but they seem content enough to just watch.  To the right you see the dark-headed giantess start to reach out, but Olga stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of backing up you run out of space to fall back, your heels hanging off the leather plateau.  To your right Olga looks down, watching with glee as your situation gets more hopeless, and on your left you can see Fulda getting annoyed, clearly wanting to intervene and at least make the fight interesting.  All of the giantesses peek in, waiting for the final blow to be delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis needle darts forward once more, and you decide to do something about it this time.  You deflect the point with your shield and crouch down, letting inertia bring him closer.  Your hand grabs him by the collar and in one motion you turn your whole body, throwing him over your shoulder.  He goes over the edge, but just before he falls he manages to latch on to your wrist, pulling you over with him.  Unavoidably you fall over the edge, dragged down by your opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land next to him on the soft carpet, unharmed but not in a great situation and with all of your weapons scattered.  Luckily neither of you wants to continue the fight: you don't particularly feel compelled to fight for the honor of women who have shrunk and enslaved you, and the two of you silently agree to make a break for it.  You push yourself up and start looking for ways out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even get standing you feel two pairs of eyes on you and Fulda's voice rings out, shouting \"Disqualified!\"  You hear the ominous thud of her foot on the floor behind you, and past your former opponent you see two large white canvas shoes trod out from behind the ottoman when Olga stands, her black stockings like impossibly tall onyx pillars.  If ever, now's the time to break for it.</span></div></div>",

While you still have your hands to your face he strikes you with the base of his sewing needle, knocking you backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're able to steady yourself you get ready to counterattack, but your opponent keeps the momentum going.  He plants the tip of his spear into the ottoman and jumps, kicking for your chest.  You manage to raise your shield in time but still take the brunt of the force, getting pushed back some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fist slams down right where you had been standing, making you glad you at least hadn't been smashed.  \"Dammit!\" bursts out from behind you.  \"I almost had him!\"  You look up and follow the arm stretching above you and see the black-haired giantess, her mouth curled in anger.  Surprisingly she doesn't make a grab for you, and simply withdraws her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the path opens up your opponent charges through, hoping to take you off guard.  You manage to duck under his stab and bash him in the stomach, driving him away and opening up an opportunity to strike.  With a dash you close the gap and stab your makeshift sword forward, confident that you'll catch him in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you're right on target, it's not to be.  During your wind-up the blond grabs your opponent, and lifts him up when you start your attack, making you strike at empty air.  She carries him above your head, well out of your reach, and sets him down on the other side.  You turn around when he passes over you, grumbling about the interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can rejoin the fight something slams into your back, throwing you forward.  You scream in pain, the blond's flick striking you right where Fulda's toe had been pushing between your shoulder blades and bringing the pain back.  Your trajectory takes you right into your opponent, throwing you into him and knocking you both down, though you continue on your path for several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back in there!\" Fulda yells across the ottoman.  \"You're embarrassing me!\"  You try to get back to your feet, but all that time spent in her shoe has made your muscles tight and sore.  Your opponent however has already gotten back up and is moving toward you, sewing needle pointed at you.  Beside you the excitement from the giantesses is palpable, and you feel that it's only a matter of time before they strike now.</span></div></div>",

He raises his sewing needle spear and prepares to plunge it into your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last effort you reach your arm around with your small metal splinter, hooking it around his ankle.  You pull back before he strikes, sweeping his leg and knocking him to the ground.  Adrenaline surges through your body, and with one last burst of energy you manage to get back up to your feet.  Before he can get up you poise to strike him, knowing it's now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo fingers close around you, pinning your shield arm to your side and holding your sword arm in place.

A devilish grin spreads across her face and you try to at least get your elbows under you, but to no avail.  Time slows down, and you can hear the air being forced out of the path of her hand as it rushes downward.

Your opponent's rough outline moves away, and you stagger forward in pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tumultuous slapping sound comes from behind you when a gigantic hand slams down, and the air rushing out knocks your feet out from under you.  Your opponent steps forward, spear raised and ready to bring it down.  Weakly you raise your shield and manage to block the blow, but with one swift motion he tears it out of your hand.  He eyes your other hand and kicks your fingers, making you lose your grip, and prepares to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" a booming voice above you shouts.  The black-haired giantess lays a hand across you, finger cocked back ready to flick your opponent away.  \"This one's mine now.  Just back away.\"  He complies, moving far away from you.  The giantess smiles and pinches you between her fingers, then helps you to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately fall back down to your knees, unable to stand on your own right now.  She eagerly helps you, grabbing your collar with her thumb and forefinger and picking you up off the ottoman.  Her hand carries you up to her face, where she holds you in front of one of her monumental turquoise eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little guy!\" she says, brimming with energy.  \"I'm Brittany!

She begins moving you to the side of her slender frame, sending you around the back.  You can see where this is going.  Her hand pulls back the waistband of her pink shorts, opening a hole just large enough for you.  When you're over the opening she drops you in, then lets it snap shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties close around you, sealing you against her bare butt cheek.  The fabric is very rough and tight, and each small twitch of her butt rubs you against it.  You feel each small movement she makes, every involuntary twitch of her buttock as her panties push you against it.  With some effort you manage to turn yourself around so that you're facing her butt, arms spread wide in a weird sort of hug.

Whatever the case, you'll be doing it on your own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond reaches her arm forward and spreads her hand, holding it in place.  A few seconds later she brings it down, slamming you with as much force as she can muster with her palm.  You're flattened immediately, reduced to little more than a smear which she wipes from her palm  on the edge.  You had hoped you could get further than this.</span></div></div>",

Each step she takes presses her big toe into your back again, spreading your shoulder blades and driving you into her stocking before the pressure relents, only to begin anew.  Fortunately this trek is much shorter than the previous one, and you soon return to merely being uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside her shoe you gather that she's talking to someone, but their voice is unable to penetrate the leather all around you.  However, possibly because you're on her body still, you have no problem hearing Fulda perfectly.  \"I hope you two are ready to get crushed,\" she says.  \"Helen and I are kind of pros at this.\"  There's a pause while the other person speaks.  \"Yes of course ladies first.  The home team starts regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about fifteen amazing seconds you're completely unmolested, either by vibrations or the agony caused by her toe, the stillness broken only by a celebratory whoop.  Then you feel it again, the pain of Fulda starting to take a step only much slower.  Little by little her toe presses against you, spreading you much more painfully than before.  The nylon forms around your face, and the threads creak from the gradually increasing strain.  Suddenly she jolts forward, jabbing her toe into your spine and wracking your body with agony.  As suddenly as it spiked it relents entirely, and she returns to her neutral standing position with you on the tip of her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's both, roll them back!\" she shouts, followed soon by another quick jab by her toe.  \"My elbow was <i>not</i> over the line, are you calling me a cheater?\"  A few seconds of silence ensue, broken by, \"Look, it's at eye level for you, so you shouldn't have any trouble paying attention to it.  Now are you going to keep whining, or can we shoot again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another brief period of blissful stillness, until you realize your back is beginning to get moist.  These shoes don't breathe well, you realize, and all the bodies around, the alcohol, and the game's tension are all starting to take their toll, causing Fulda to begin lightly sweating.  What would normally be an imperceptible dampness turns the inside of her shoe into a sweltering jungle, and you find it difficult to breathe from the humidity.  Not that you'd want to breathe too deeply; the sweat is causing her foot to reek so bad you can taste it when you inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that weren't bad enough the pressure begins to steadily increase again, her sweaty toe roughly shoving you against her stocking.  You grit your teeth and try to breathe only in small gasps when you can get any breath at all, the humidity, pain, and constriction all coming together to practically suffocate you.  Again there's a quick spike, sending a jab of pain to the tips of your limbs, then it relents again.  For another minute, you can almost relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair, huh?\" Fulda asks her anonymous partner.  \"And why's that?\"  You're not sure how much time passes during this answer while you endure the sweltering air inside her shoe, but Fulda lightly grinds her toe against you while it goes on like she's tapping her toe impatiently.  \"So it's not fair because I'm tall?  Is that it?\"  A second passes, and you hear her slam her hands on the table.  \"I'm not sure what the fuck you want me to do about it!  These aren't idiotic platform shoes, do you really think it'll make a difference if I've got a foot and  a half on you rather than two?\"  Yes!  She might take her shoes off!  You would still be trapped, but at least your situation would improve somewhat.</span></div></div>",

It's still our turn though.\"  Finally, something today is going your way!  You're not sure if this could be called a lucky break, but it's the first time your situation has gotten better since Fulda shrank you in that lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly you're pulled backward while Fulda removes her foot from the shoe, the air already getting easier to breathe before you're even withdrawn.  Fulda's foot escapes the high heel entirely, bringing you with it as the stocking still clings tightly around her whole leg.  You wouldn't call this comfortable since you still have her toe wedged into your spine, but compared to her weight leaning down on you it's paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes sting with the sudden exposure to light, even the small amount reaching you under the table.  You blink your eyes several times to get them to adjust, and you have to consciously remind yourself that Fulda's stockings are giving everything a peach hue.  The fine mesh stitching doesn't help your vision either, but for now you're just glad you can see anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix feet away, a distance that seems to stretch forever, you see two pairs of nice but comfortable shoes at the bottom of slacks, presumably the people Fulda has been playing against.  You look to your right, straining through the discomfort of moving at all, and look past Fulda's humongous toes to see a pair of enormous white hi-top Converse and pale, freshly shaven legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sets her foot down beside the gigantic high heels, your feet not quite resting on the carpet as you're firmly suspended by the nylon.  Sound comes rushing to you, the blaring music hitting you in full force after your recent sensory deprivation along with several dozen voices all speaking at once.  It nearly overwhelms you until you're able to pick out the crisp sound of a ping pong ball bouncing across a table, and you have something familiar to center yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point just above the floor you have very little to look at.  Turning your head is a serious pain, and the lighting is just enough to allow you some awareness.  You can't even look up at Fulda, since her toe won't let you crane your head back that far.  Plastic slams against plastic and the Converse beside you jump for joy, thumping harder than the bass and shaking you up and down in your cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three in a row!\" she shouts in jubilation.  \"See if you can do it too Fulda!\"  Your captor doesn't respond, and simply leans back.  Her movements are much less torturous to you now, and while her toe certainly doesn't feel good it no longer feels like you're on the verge of being pressed flat between it and her stocking.  Fulda's foot shifts forward slightly, but you hear no impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direct hit!\" Fulda declares, hopping up.  You hop with her too, and you fear for your life as the ground rushes back up to you, then away again, several times.  The crashes from her titanic feet slamming into the ground assail your ears, and you worry that the impacts alone will break you apart even without her landing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening chime sounds, and Fulda stops jumping.  The air is filled with the cacophony of dozens of cheering voices, followed shortly after by confused, high-pitched screams intermingled with the cheers.  You can't move your arms to cover your ears, but you reflexively close your eyes and wince backwards, ramming your face into one of the whorls on Fulda's toe.  When you open your eyes again, something seems amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the table there no longer rest two pairs of giant dress shoes - in fact there's no sign of anyone there at all.  Suspicious, you look closer and see two men, each about an inch tall, standing beside the table looking very scared and confused.  A series of thuds sound out, followed by another round of cheers from the women.  Fulda's toe digs into you once more and you're pitched upward as she takes a step around the table and forward.  The night is not about to get better at all.</span></div></div>",

Every time her foot pitches back upward you're thrown back to have your body spread out along the front of her toe again, her stocking pushing you against her flesh.  When her foot comes crashing back down you wiggle inside your tight pocket while your bones rattle from the impact, sliding down a bit each time.  You're concerned that if this goes on too long you'll wind up under her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns the corner and stops at the end of the table, standing with her feet spread so that she stands astride of the shrunken pair.  \"What do you think now?\" she asks, her voice like thunder from on high.  \"Is it still not fair that I'm so tall?  Maybe you're just jealous of me?\"  The two men stand frozen looking up at her, their mouths open in shock.  You doubt they can possibly answer her, this must seem like a dream to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run away!  Hide!\" you yell from inside the stocking.  \"Don't let her catch you, she's a monster, they all are!  She'll-\"  You're cut off by Fulda rolling her toe forward, pushing your face into the carpet and muffling your voice.  While it seems like she can hear you the two make no indication that they did.  Instead the last you saw they were still gaping up at Fulda, stunned by the sight of a gigantic woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing between Fulda's big toe and the carpet is an extremely precarious position, and you worry that she's going to squish you at any moment.  You wince with each minute increase in pressure, sure that this is going to be the one that finally does it.  Even when it steadies out you're concerned, aware that it would take naught but a wobble for her to overcompensate and grind you into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure relents and Fulda pulls her toe back, allowing you to breathe freely again.  When you can see again you see no sign of the pair Fulda had been intimidating, not even red stains on the carpet.  You look up and see her hand open, palm upward, staring intently into it.  Presumably she picked them up and is menacing them in her own way.  At any moment you expect her to toss them into her mouth, but for now she only stares at them while they likely cower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's foot kicks back into the air and you're moving again, now with two more passengers.  She leaves the room and heads into a hallway with a wooden floor, her footfalls generating loud, resonating thuds in addition to the shaking you had been subjected to already.  You're subjected to this until she sets foot onto a worn navy blue rug which her feet slightly sink into with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks around a long, wooden table to the end against a wall and kneels down, then lowers her hand to the rug.  Fulda tilts her hand, dumping the passengers out of her palm to land softly on the ground.  While they get oriented Fulda looks at you struggling inside her stocking and says, \"What, did you think you were going to get out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda sits down and lifts her leg, her butt making a loud thump when it sets down.  You watch down the length of her leg while she slowly and deliberately rolls her stocking down her thigh and over her knee.  She pulls her knee to her chest and continues, rolling it the length of her well developed calf until it reaches her ankle.  Once there she grabs the toe beside you and pulls, carefully dragging it off her leg and creating an expanding sack of nylon for you to sink toward the floor in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her whole leg is free of the stocking Fulda opens it up, peering down at you with one eye open.  She inserts her hand into the opening, pressing her arm deeper until her hand reaches the heel and you're nearly within reach of her fingers.  Instead of grabbing you Fulda turns her arm upward suddenly, dropping you from the still moist toe into her open palm.  Fulda's fist snaps shut around you, and she quickly pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before her hand opens again, dropping you roughly onto the carpet along with the others.  The crowd of shrunken men has expanded to about a dozen and every so often a giantess comes to drop off another, their thunderous footfalls precipitating the arrival of a new unfortunate soul.  Apparently unconcerned with the crowd Fulda puts her stocking back on, rolling it up the same way she rolled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she's done Fulda decides that the wait has gone on long enough and stands, sliding her feet back into her heels.  By now the crowd has grown to just over twenty, including yourself, with the giantesses coming and going as they please.  One man had been wailing particularly loudly until a giantess in knee-high socks came and picked him up.  Shortly after he disappeared from view there was a loud clap, and the crowd calmed down after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high heel stomping against hard wood pierces the calm, shaking the floor and drawing everyone's attention.  Fulda assumes her favorite pose standing astride the crowd and looks down, smiling.  \"Hello down there, tiny guests!\" she bellows with excitement.  \"You're probably wondering why we've brought you into our dining room.  No, we're not going to eat you - yet.\"  She laughs, but no one else does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to race for our amusement,\" she explains.  \"We've laid out an obstacle course covering three rooms.  Do not leave the course, or you <i>will</i> die.  We've positioned guides to help you along the course, so just follow them.  The woman who brought you here will watch your progress, and collect you at the end if you live.\"  She pauses a second after that.  \"And, go!\"  At the word go she stomps her foot again, signalling for everyone to start the race.</span></div></div>",

There's no way you're going to play any more of her games, and from the sound of it this whole thing is a death trap anyway.  She may have taken your life away from you, but she's not going to take your dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lingers behind while the rest of the giantesses disperse, looking down at you standing your ground.  \"Better get moving, little guy,\" she says, trying to encourage you to move.  \"If you don't start soon you're never going to finish.\"  You look up at her blankly, unwilling to give her the satisfaction of caving to her demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get moving!\" Fulda implores, raising her heel off the ground.  She moves her foot forward and prods you in the chest, forcing you back and towards the table.  Once she withdraws her foot you stay where you are and continue looking up at her.  Fulda's eyebrows furrow in frustration, and she starts tapping her foot impatiently.  \"You have until the count of three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\"  She continues looking down at you, expecting her intimidation to work.  \"Two!\"  She draws the word out, lifting up her foot the whole time.  When her knee is as far up as she can get it she stops, and waits another second before continuing.  \"Three!\"  As soon as she calls it out she brings her foot down, toes positioned directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole of Fulda's high heel smashes into you with the force of a meteorite, shattering your skull at the moment of impact.  Before that can affect you her foot pounds the rest of you into the ground, liquefying your body.  She walks away to watch the race, leaving you a stain on the rug.  </span></div></div>",

On both sides giantesses sit in chairs, idly tapping or kicking their feet while waiting for the runners to exit on the other side.  Every type of footwear is on display here, from elegant ballet flats and high heels to leather boots and Converse, each the size of a cargo trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne contestant decides he doesn't want to participate in the obstacle course and veers off to the side, running for some type of freedom.  As soon as he gets back into the light a feminine voice loudly shouts, \"Get back to the course you little twerp!\"  He continues along his route, and a second later a light brown boot lifts up from the ground.  It comes back down hard on the person trying to get away, crushing him immediately, with the sound of the stomp drowning out the cracking of his bones.  You gulp and continue forward, having seen what happens to men who do not want to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the table the rug is very soft, practically like new, and your legs sink in between the fibers as you go.  At the very least you can see that the other runners are all having more trouble with it than you, since they didn't have any time to get acclimated to carpet running beforehand.  Though you doubt you're the fastest person in this group you steadily pull ahead until you're several inches ahead of the next closest person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the table you pass under a chair, its occupant wearing a pair of suede six inch heels with stockings - Fulda.  Surprisingly you had not heard her walking over here, probably due to your amount of focus and the muffling from the carpet.  She sits with one leg crossed over the other, her raised foot gently kicking back and forth while she slides her heel in and out of the shoe.  You pass under her foot and run past the one on the ground, soon getting out from under the chair and back into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out from under Fulda's chair you have only a few more inches of carpet left until you're onto the hard wood floor.  Though the going is faster here, further increasing your lead, you have to be careful not to twist your ankle in the wood grain or pockmarks.  With careful stepping you manage to avoid all of the hazards, and quickly reach the threshold to the next room and the first obstacle: a woman lying sideways across the door frame.</span></div></div>",

Climbing over her bare legs would be risky, and you know from earlier that smooth legs present some very unique challenges to get up.  Similarly going straight up her back would be the longest climb, unacceptable in what seems to be a race, even if you would get to bounce off her breasts on the way down.  The obvious answer, of course, is to climb her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly you position yourself at the base of her buttock and raise your arms, grabbing onto the fabric of her skirt.  You hop and pull yourself upwards, beginning your climb along her rear.  Several of the giantesses watching giggle when you mount up and begin pressing yourself into the fabric while you shore up your grip, rubbing yourself against her buttock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour climb is not as swift as you would like, the curved surface providing several challenges you hadn't anticipated when you started up her butt.  Every advance makes it a little bit easier though, until you find yourself able to stand in the small crevice created by the tightness of her skirt between her cheeks.  While you prepare for the next half of your climb you see a couple other contestants sliding down her legs, and one even passing you on his way up her back.  So much for your lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second half proceeds much as the first had, with it becoming easier as the climb progresses until you're able to stand unassisted, this time on her hip.  Not wanting to waste any time you turn around and crouch, grabbing onto her skirt again while your legs hang off the side.  You climb down her crotch as swiftly as you can, not wanting to linger too long, and drop down the last couple of inches to the tiled floor on the other side.  Out of the corner of your eye you can see the giantess you just climbed over, a dimpled brunette, smiling quite broadly as she appears to be laughing at all the tiny men climbing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around from your landing to see where to go next, not wanting to deviate from the course and end up getting crushed.  A positively enormous blond in all white must have noticed your hesitation and stomps her hi-top Converse at you, then yells, \"The course is that way, pipsqueak!\"  When you recover from the shock of her stomp you look to where she's pointing and see a woman sitting against the counter looking bored.  Several other racers area already running up her legs or climbing her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to fall too far behind you run across the tile toward her, heading for her ankle.  Before you can begin your climb you hear a rumbling from behind you, and you turn to look over your shoulder.  The giantess you had just climbed is rolling over.  You watch as someone who had just got on her side is knocked over, still clinging to her skirt.  She finishes turning the other direction, crushing him and anyone who was still in the process of climbing.  Then you turn back forward, and prepare yourself for the second obstacle.</span></div></div>",

One of the contestants, no doubt trying to rush his way through the course, is trying to futilely jump and grab on to her Achilles' tendon, his grip slipping off each time.  You decide instead to wedge your fingers between her shoe and foot and climb up the side, allowing you to sort of walk up the shoe's leather exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have gotten past her ankle you swing over onto her foot and unwedge your hand, allowing yourself to slide down her foot until you rest atop her ankle.  You look over the side and see the same man still jumping up trying in vain to grab onto her smooth, taut skin, oblivious to your example.  Realizing that he's just more competition in this race you try to put it out of your mind and run up her shin, your feet finding sure footing on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon cresting her knee you're buffeted by a strong breeze from her hand doing a near pass, her fingers slapping against the tile repeatedly.  While running up her thigh towards her flame orange dress you glance back and see the poor, clueless soul from her ankle running towards her outstretched hand.  You want to shout to him that it is an obvious trap, but you have no idea how the giantess would view intervention on your part.  Ultimately, you have to look out for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time you pass from skin to polyester, your rate sped by previous experience with walking on thighs.  Soon after you reach the top of her leg and look up, the flat climb up her stomach capped by her large, rounded breasts.  You grab on to her dress and hop up, beginning the ascent of her abdomen.  The flat surface and well-made fabric make your climb easy, and in no time you have neared the top, and prepare yourself for the inverse climb up her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time on her breast, and not just because you happen to enjoy the area.  This part of the climb is particularly hazardous, as discovered by one less careful person who lost his grip, falling down to land on her thigh.  Her ample bosom takes several minutes to climb, only your hands able to help propel you forward until you start going up the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers slide into the low-cut neck of her dress and you kick against her breast, helping you get up to the top.  The giantess's pale skin is a stark contrast to her bright orange dress, and her crimson lipstick outlines the pearly whites of her beaming smile.  Her blue eyes shine with glee while she chases someone who made the climb ahead of you around with her finger, toying with him as she lightly bats him around.  Finally she shoves him, pushing him into her cleavage where he disappears down her dress, and she begins laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to avoid the same fate you sprint up her breast, cresting the hill in only a couple seconds as your feet dimple her immaculate skin.  When you near her clavicle she brings an open hand up to her chest, the clueless person from her ankle standing in her palm.  He starts running to the side, looking like he's about to jump off her hand onto her chest, but before he can make the leap she closes her fingers in a fist.  Briefly you hear the rapid fire snapping of his bones, followed by her moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short climb up to her collar bone poses no challenge, and from there you walk up the bone until you're standing on her shoulder.  Two white strings hang down from the counter top, easily visible against her fire truck red hair, and you seize one in your hand.  You shimmy up the rope, using her ear for support when necessary, and plant your hands on the counter soon enough.  Ahead of you is a wide open space with a section cut out, replaced with a tub of punch that has a metal rod suspended over it, strings hanging off.</span></div></div>",

There are only a few contestants ahead of you still and who knows how many more obstacles so you take it slow for now, jogging along the hard surface.  Someone blazes past you, running all-out as far as you can tell, as he runs along the grout between tiles, but you simply stay the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow falls over you while you pass in front of a rack of wine glasses, half of the glasses that could be used to trap you removed.  You turn your head to see who is casting the shadow and have to crane your neck way up the black satin dress to see Fulda's tanned face looking down at you.  Out of habit you begin to slow your pace until she calls out, \"No, keep going!  If you don't win you're going to wish you had fallen down Jackie's dress!\"  That's all the motivation you need, and you hurry to get back up to speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to the tub full of red punch you see a couple people floating on the top, struggling to do anything more than stay buoyant in the sticky liquid.  The surface is a few inches from the top, rendering escape impossible, leaving the people who have fallen in trapped.  They call out for help, but you know by now that none of these women will lift them out, and helping them would be your own demise.  At least, that's how you and everyone else justifies it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who whizzed by you earlier goes up for his jump, throwing his arms as high as they can go at the string.  He misses by half an inch and lands in the punch with a resounding plop.  As soon as he resurfaces an Asian wearing a spot-on schoolgirl outfit walks up, red plastic cup in hand, and dips it into the punch.  When she withdraws her cup there is no longer any sign of him inside the basin.  She lifts the cup to her lips and takes a long drink, and you think you can hear a scream from inside that is suddenly cut short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's your turn to jump, and you know it has to count.  You coil your legs to build energy and explode upward, raising your arms toward the lower tip of the string.  Your fingers wrap around the white thread and you hold on tight, pulling it to your chest as much as you can.  The string swings you over the punch and you let go, the arc taking you the rest of the way.  Words can't express how relieved you feel when your feet land on the tile, safely out of the refreshments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you is a great white box pulled up to the counter's corner with a wad of towels shoved under it, blocking a path under the microwave.  You turn to your left and see a row of five red-seated stools set in front of the next length of counter, only one of them occupied.  Now it looks like they're going to make you hop over a row of stools, all of which could be used at any time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a running start you leap off the counter and onto the stool, landing just short of the single metal button in the center.  To soften the landing you roll on impact, hitting the cold metal semicircle which has for some reason been left without upholstery.  You slide along the button until you run into the leather on the other side, and it occurs that probably the only people who ever notice this bare metal disc are shrunken men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get up someone else lands where you had, only much more gracefully.  They don't even miss a beat before getting back up to a full run, hopping over to the next seat, this one occupied by a titanic ass encased in hot pink short shorts.  He lands on the edge and pushes against the giantess to stop himself without being bounced off the edge by her butt.  Then he runs along the stool's rim, using the pressure on the seat from the giant butt to ensure he doesn't fall off.  When he disappears from view behind her buttock you make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn preparation you take two steps back then run forward, leaping into the air at the last possible moment.  You land by the tip of your toe and quickly bring your feet together, momentum causing you to run headlong into the enormous buttock in front of you.  Luckily you stay on your feet and don't get bounced off the side, and take a moment to regain your footing.  Slowly you ease your way around the giantess, running your hands along her butt for peace of mind while you do your best not to look down.  Her weight works in your favor and you have a sort of rim of the bowl to walk along, and you reach the other side safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you take a couple preparatory steps back before launching yourself onto the next seat, pushing off the butt to help your distance.  The spring from her posterior helps you immensely and you land on the other side with plenty of room to spare.  You continue running across the stool seat, your feet dimpling the red leather with each step and pinging when they hit the metal button in the middle.  Ahead of you is the expert jumper, nearly in the middle, and you feel as though you're about to catch up to him when you see something out of the corner of your eye: someone walking toward the row of seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of extremely long, slender legs topped by an equally extremely short denim skirt approaches the stool, and a hand reaches under the seat's rim.  \"Look out!\" you yell to the man ahead of you, but your warning comes too late.  She pulls out the stool, toppling him to the ground, and steps around the side.  Oblivious to his presence she sits, crushing him into a smear under her weight.  Now there's another giantess in your path, and to make matters worse you'll never make the jump to the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option you decide to try something absolutely crazy.  At the edge of the stool you leap off, aiming for the peach-colored kneecap in front of you before she gets situated.  You splay your arms and legs out in flight and land perfectly, your body curving along her knee when you land.  Quickly you scramble to get back up and moving again, running up her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her hand and holds it up beside her face, palm down.  You've been felt, you think, and now she's going to swat like a bug.  You stop and look up, wanting to at least face your destruction, and to your surprise she smiles and gives you a little wave by twiddling her fingers down at you.  Relieved that you're not dead you wave back up with a weak grin and continue up her thigh until you pass the hem of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you run along the denim you steady yourself when the world you're standing on starts turning.  The giantess you're on rotates the seat to face the final stool and raises her leg, setting it down in the middle of the stool.  Suspecting a trap but knowing you'll never make the jump otherwise you run back down her leg, sprinting as hard as you can before she changes her mind.  When you pass her knee she bends her leg, raising her shin and sending you sliding down the slope.  Past her ankle you slide up her foot, nearly running into the studded red band buckled across the toe of her black flat until you slide back down, falling off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess withdraws her foot, swinging back around to ferry the next contestant if he had the patience to wait.  You waste no time in heading for the string dangling from the next counter top, grabbing on and starting your climb yet again.  She watches you with curious emerald eyes, apparently fascinated by you as if she had never seen a tiny person before.  By now you're getting tired and the climb is tougher than the previous one, but you still crest the top, unwilling to show weakness to her.  As you clamber to the top she grins, then looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to the open counter top from earlier, this one looks like one big hors d'vores plate, with a smattering of finger foods all about.  The competition is thinning out now as well as slowing down, and you see several people darting between food they're using as cover.  You are in no way eager to enter this field, but short of having that sitting giantess carry you to the end you don't think you have any other choice, and you would definitely not outlive that.</span></div></div>",

You dash out among the little bites of food, pressing your back against a tiny (to a normal person) sandwich with a toothpick running through it.  Some moisture from the turkey drips off onto your shirt, and you quickly run to the next sandwich for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you conceal yourself with the food someone else comes barreling past, darting between the finger foods like a madman.  He runs like you've never seen anyone run before, moving with energy he must have been saving up until now.  The shrunken man runs through the food like a slalom, cutting close between the bite-sized bits in hopes of avoiding detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow falls over your section of the counter top, and you peek around your sandwich to see what the deal is.  A colossal, powerfully-built brunette in a green dress has walked up to the food trays looking for something to eat.  Her eyes immediately fall upon the desperate man blazing a trail, her gaze following his erratic path.  She holds a hand above him, fingers shaped like a claw ready to snatch him up.  After a second more she explodes into actions, her fingers ensnaring the man easily.  You turn away, but you can hear his screams until he gets dropped into her wide mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow disappears and you make your move, darting over to the next triangle sandwich.  You plan your moves carefully, peeking around the food before moving to make sure there are no giantesses looking in your direction.  Soon enough you escape the sandwich tray and make it to the shrimp.  As you take cover behind the seafood you reflect on how you had been called shrimp all throughout school; you never thought that they would compare favorably in size to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can move past the rack of shrimp another long shadow is cast over the tray, and you immediately duck out of sight.  Curiosity gets the better of you though and you take a peek, your eyes just barely going past the food.  Two giantesses lean against the counter: One, the Asian you saw grabbing a drink earlier, and the other is a slightly shorter blond with glasses in a red shirt.  Each of them reaches down and pulls a shrimp off the rack, then pops it into their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you have that organic chemistry final on Tuesday, right?\" the blond asks once she swallows.  The Asian nods, still chewing her food, and the other reaches to pick up another bite, this one just off to your left.  They don't seem to be paying attention to you but you decide to stay in cover rather than risk drawing their attention.  \"I aced it pretty handily with the same professor, if you want I still have my notes.\"  She shoves the second shrimp into her mouth and reaches for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian's fingers settle on the shrimp to your right, taking it away from your cover.  \"I'm doing pretty well in it,\" she says, \"but I'll check out your notes all the same.  When can I come by?\"  She pops this one in her mouth and begins chewing, her jaw moving rhythmically up and down as she grinds her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just stop by my room anytime,\" the blond says, reaching down again.  \"I don't really get out a lot these days, no time you know?\"  She picks up another bite-sized bit, this one right in front of you.  They've blown your cover, leaving you exposed, and they immediately turn to face you.  You've definitely been spotted, and you start running.  \"You want this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, by all means he's yours,\" the Asian says.  \"As a thanks for letting me use your notes.\"  She pops the shrimp in her mouth and walks away, leaving the blond to deal with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess eagerly watches you as you run through the food, waiting for the time to strike.  As you saw earlier there's nowhere to hide once they've seen you, and you can scarcely hope to outrun her.  You run for your life, bobbing and weaving in an S-pattern while she watches, a predator's grin on her face.  Any time you expect her to strike, and then it will all be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're joined by another shrunken man running, probably spooked by the two, and he runs along to your left.  Both of you keep pace with each other due to equal parts exhaustion and desperation, hoping to get out of this with your lives.  Suddenly a hand snaps down and fingers clamp around him, towering fingers lifting him off the counter.  The blond looks at her catch, watching him squirm futilely in her grip, while you make haste for the edge.  \"I was going for the other one,\" she says, then giggles and adds, \"but you'll do fine too.\"  You hop over the edge of the last tray just when she drops him into her mouth, and you hope you're safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the edge of the counter is a sign that reads \"TINIES GO DOWN HERE\" above what looks like the top of a slide.  With no better ideas and not wanting to be near the hors d'vores any longer than you have to you dash for the slide, going down feet first.  It loops around many times during its four foot descent, allowing you to gain much more velocity than you should.  At the bottom you're unceremoniously spit out and go bouncing through the field of cotton balls set up at the exit.  You groan and look at what's up next: a hallway bustling with foot traffic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You push yourself up and struggle to get your feet back under you, though you feel more exhausted than you ever have before in your life.  Your shirt is drenched with sweat and a smattering of juices from the sandwich meats and shrimp you took cover behind, as well as some stray condiments.  Your arms burn from overuse, and your legs have sharp pains in every muscle you know about, and some that you didn't before.  For however long this obstacle course has been going the slide was your first opportunity to take a rest, and you didn't realize how out of breath you were before that.  Reluctantly however you press on, sure that this can't continue much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can make it to the threshold the rhythmic clack and boom of high heels on tile draws your attention, growing louder and more intense with each instance.  Another shadow falls over you and you begin to feel the shock waves, and you turn to face the giantess that finally caught you.  Two final thuds.  You see the suede heels and look up a pair of monolithic legs and a black dress until you're looking Fulda in the face yet again.  This has been going on so long you had forgotten how much she towers over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand how truly tiny you are?\" she asks, her booming voice reverberating in the corner.  Well, that's another way to phrase it.  \"You just narrowly escaped becoming finger food.  Nice job, by the way, sacrificing one of the other runners to spare your life.  I like seeing cowardice in my shrunken men.\"  You want to shout up and tell her that's not what happened, but you simply don't have the breath.  \"Shows that you have what it takes to win, and you're <i>going</i> to win.  Now hurry up, you're almost done.\"  With that she turns away, her thundering footsteps growing fainter as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take several deep breaths and gather what's left of your strength as you approach the threshold to the hallway.  Slowly you inch through the frame, huddling against the wall for safety.  Four or five tiny partial corpses litter the floor, the rest of them stuck to a gigantic shoe, and you can barely see anything coming or going in the dimly-lit hallway.  Footsteps constantly thunder along, their impact amplified by the wood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tentatively step out into the hallway to see if the coast is clear, and immediately you're greeted by a familiar rubber diamond pattern.  In a panic you jump back just before the shoe slams down with the crack of thunder, and you look up to see a circled ALL STAR on a white canvas background.  If you're going to get through this you'll have to be more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next thirty seconds you watch as enormous shoes and boots stomp by, each generating massive amounts of energy that nearly knock you off your feet.  There doesn't seem to be a pattern, as though this is simply something they thought would be fun without having to plan anything.  Knowing that the casual coming and going of these giantesses can lead to your accidental crushing just drives home even more how minuscule you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you decide to just go for it.  You peek your head out into the hallway and make sure no one is coming on your side, then dash out into the middle.  Footsteps thunder toward you and you dash forward, heading for the opposite doorway.  There's a loud pounding to your right, and you turn to see a pair of red ballet flats directly on course for you, much too fast for you to dart in front of.  With a spin you turn around, only to see a monumental legs barely covered by a denim skirt with black flats rushing toward you.  With a glance out the corner of your eye you see the ballet flats are still coming, leaving you nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess in the black flats sets her heel down before you, and you hear the air rushing out from underneath her foot as it swings down.  Desperately you dodge, just barely getting clear before it slams down so hard that your teeth chatter.  Immediately after that the red shoe impacts, its thunderous roar overtaking the the first.  You look up and see the giantess in black flat's other shoe hanging over you, waiting for the other one to pass.  While it dangles there is the longest second of your life until finally she steps forward, clearing the way for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's gone you waste no time getting back up to your feet, following her trail into the deep carpet of the room where this party began.  To your left you see the outline of a woman standing extremely tall, indication that's the likely route to continue along.  You turn and get ready for the next challenge.</span></div></div>",

There are only two people ahead of you, both practically limping forward while they drag their feet through the soft carpet fibers.  It's all you can do to keep from joining them while you fight your way through the terrain, struggling to remain on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you round the corner you see that the colossus standing astride your path to the finish is none other than Fulda.  She stands with her feed spread apart, hands on her hips, looking down balefully at the remaining contestants.  \"Either hurry and finish or get smashed, I don't care which!\" she bellows.  \"The sooner this is done the sooner I can go start drinking!\"  Her eyes light upon you as you round the corner, and though she doesn't say anything a brief flash on her face indicates she is pleased you made it through the gauntlet.  However that doesn't stop her from laughing cruelly at you and the other two struggling to make it to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass under Fulda doing her best Colossus of Rhodes impression, too fatigued to even try to look up as you do so.  It's likely for the best anyway; since you're the last to pass between her ankles she watches you intently.  \"Hurry up,\" she mutters, \"I don't keep losers around for long.\"  With a gulp you gasp for another breath and press forward, though your feet sink deeper into the carpet as you no longer have the energy to lift them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast Fulda you enter a corridor between a TV and a couch, where all the giantesses who have harassed you throughout the course seem to have gathered.  Each of them has their phone out and is holding it up sideways, filming the three of you fighting to make your way through their carpet.  Scattered giggling had broken out when you passed Fulda's ankles, as well as commentary: \"So small!\"  \"He's tiny!\"  \"They're so weak!\"  You glance up at the TV screen and see that they're streaming the footage from their phones, and you see just how bad of shape you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how bad you feel, you're quickly reminded that the others are in worse shape.  One of them collapses to the ground and can't even roll himself over, and the other can do little more than shuffle his feet toward the finish line.  You do what you can to tap into any last reserves of energy, surging forward through the giantess corridor toward the finish line.  They even put little black and white checker flags on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a shout breaks through the air, overwhelming the titters and taunts from the peanut gallery: \"Timber!\"  You turn your head and see Fulda leaning backward, forcing herself off balance.  What energy you have left is about to be sucked dry, but it's the last bit you need.  For the next few seconds you do what you can to maintain your pace, hoping to avoid Fulda landing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're covered in shadow, and you know this is it, you weren't fast enough.  An unbearable thud sounds out behind you, accompanied by a quake so strong you're thrown face-first into the carpet and it feels as though your heart skips a beat.  A pile of red hair engulfs you, and you expect the next instant to be smashed flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda giggles, and you realize that you weren't killed immediately.  The hair around you is soft, and isn't pressing down with enough force to crush you - it's not even though to tangle you up.  You crawl forward, still unable to stand up under Fulda's head, desperate for this to just be over.</span></div></div>",

All the giantesses that had been sitting down watching you go by suddenly stand up and start jumping up and down, generating a minor earthquake each time they land.  Getting through the last twenty feet was already a daunting enough task without the feeling that your organs were about to shake out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I get any?\" Fulda asks, and you lift your head just enough to look at the TV screen.  The footage zooms in on her butt, where where's a very fresh red splotch centered around what looks like it used to be a person.  Fulda sticks her rear out and shapes her mouth into a circle, then covers it with a hand in feigned shock.  Once her false reaction is recorded she starts laughing again and shouts, \"That bit always gets one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter him than me, you tell yourself as you continue to force your way through the carpet.  You've nearly caught up to the only other person left, who can barely even move his arms and legs to navigate his way along the floor.  Just a little bit longer and you'll be there.  You're not sure what prize there is at the end of this race, but being out of it is reward enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you little bugs, look up at the screen,\" says a booming voice from almost directly above.  You turn around and nearly jump out of your skin: less than an inch away is the flat sole of a shoe, featureless aside from the number 14 and poised to press down and grind you into the carpet.  Thankfully the giantess shows some restraint, and once you're clear from under her shoe you're able to see the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see yourself and the only other remaining runner slowly making progress through the carpet a few inches at a time.  For the first time you're able to see yourself in comparison to other objects, and it's readily apparent that the bow on this woman's shoe is at least twice as large as you are, if not more.  The camerawoman follows you, keeping her steps close so that you're always in the frame with her, making it apparent how big she is in comparison.  As if her blocking out the lights wasn't enough of an indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere inches from the finish line you come side by side with the other remaining runner.  The screen zooms in on the two of you, trying to get a photo finish of the race, but you don't intend for it to be that close.  With your last bit of strength you slam into him, making him fall backwards over the carpet.  You pass over the string of dental floss stretched across the finish line and turn around to see how the other guy is doing, only to see the white bow of her shoe moving back and forth while she grinds the ball of her foot into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter him than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately collapse, the last man standing at the end of the race.  A series of thuds approaches, followed by more low-grade earthquakes as the woman hops up and down.  At first you try to ignore them, having grown accustomed to them over what must have been the last several hours, but they persist long enough that you manage to pry your eyes open and lift your head.  In your limited vision a single black high heel repeatedly lifts into the air and comes back down, making the ground shake ever more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thumb and forefinger settle around your chest and squeeze just enough to hold you, then you're lifted up from the carpet.  When next you open your eyes you're being held in front of Fulda's face, and she is positively beaming.  \"See?  I knew you could do it!\" she shouts, her voice mostly a wall of sound that rushes over you.  \"It must have been my pep talks that helped you.\"  Yeah, threats of being murdered are what got you over the last wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that you're the champion, let's go spend some time together!  I think you should...</span></div></div>",

You barely have enough energy to narrow your eyes, let alone put in any sort of real protest, at the sudden outburst from her voice.  \"Let's go back to the table and play another game, mixed teams this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let me go get another,\" the blond in all white replies, whom you presume to be Helen.  Fulda grins at you, excited for the next game in a way you can't possibly fathom.  How are you going to play, anyway?  The ball is going to be your size, for crying out loud!  However you're still too tired to voice any of this to her, not that you would expect her to care about your concerns anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the beer pong table is nearby, only a few of Fulda's long strides from the obstacle course's finish line.  Though brief the journey is not pleasant for you.  With how giddy she is Fulda does not temper her movements at all, and you're thrown back and forth in her fingers so hard you almost get whiplash from the force.  Your chest is rammed up against her thumb, causing you to cry out in pain with energy and breath you can scarcely afford to use right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brief yet bumpy ride stops, and Fulda turns her hand to let you see something else besides her.  Below and in front of you is a sprawling platform, with enormous, mostly empty red plastic cups arranged in triangles at each end.  You're familiar with how the game works, of course, but you're not sure how useful you'll be for your team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're at least somewhat competent at this,\" Fulda says, canting her head slightly down toward you.  Her blue eyes stand out in stark contrast with her tanned skin, and she continues, \"I'm good, but I'm not sure if I can cover for both of us.  You've at least played before, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head in response.  \"Of course, I'm a senior,\" you tell her.  \"I cant think of anyone who hasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then maybe-\" thudding footfalls from behind her cut her off, and Helen walks past her toward the other end of the table.  \"Oh, looks like she's ready.  Better get you into position!\"</span></div></div>",

Fulda leans over the table and holds you forward, carrying you over the cavernous red plastic pits roughly arranged in a triangle in front of her toward the small table.  She sets you down and releases you, and you stumble forward against the new table while she withdraws her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table looks like an exact replica of the one you're standing on, complete with the same arrangement of very tiny cups.  Clearly this is not the first time they've done this, and it certainly won't be the last.  You pick up the tiny pellet provided to stand in for the ball and look between the two giantesses on either side of the table.  Before you can do anything else Helen sets her teammate down in front of you, a bewildered-looking man who must have somehow avoided the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear-piercing hiss sounds from both sides of the table as they crack open two enormous beer cans, spraying small droplets far enough out to moisten your back.  They pour it out to partially fill their cups, then each woman leans over and holds the can just over their teammate's head.  You duck away from Fulda's as she tips it up, pouring out a few drops of beer to fill your cups.  She and Helen both drastically overfill, causing beer to spill onto and over your tiny table.  \"Oops, sorry!\" Helen says and covers her mouth, her voice almost sweet if not for the booming resonance in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to avoid the growing puddle of beer as you get ready, and your opponent does the same.  As soon as the ball leaves your hand Fulda slams her palm down on the table with a bang, knocking you onto your back.  \"Who told you to start?\" she asks.  \"We're the ones who decide that, you two just follow along.\"  With a groan you get back to your feet and recover the pellet, then wait to be allowed to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda and Helen start throwing the balls back and forth, the hollow white spheres soaring above your heads.  There's a loud crash when the balls slam into their plastic targets, and Fulda lets out a loud \"Woo!\"  At least your team gets to go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for Fulda to begin, not wanting to risk angering her again.  Her first throw sails through the air beautifully, landing right on target with a thundering crack, and you take your throw as well which, much to your surprise, lands well on target too.  Helen and your opponent grumble and throw back their drinks then return the balls to your side, the hollow skipping of the balls pounding into your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one the giantesses use bumps into your table on the way back, pushing it forward and coming to a dead stop.  You and your opponent work together to get it rolling again, pushing with all your might to get the ping pong ball back towards Fulda.  It slowly rolls toward her, your tiny arms barely strong enough to propel it forward.  Soon after it's free Fulda snatches it up and gets ready to throw again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda throws with a much flatter trajectory this time and the ball slams into the front of a cup with a loud bang, sending the ball rebounding towards you.  Hurriedly you break off your throw as the light plastic ball bounces toward you, ready to dodge out of the way.  It hits your opponent on the shoulder, knocking him down so hard it looks like he might need help getting back up, and begins rolling toward you.  The ball gets closer, and Helen and Fulda both lunge for it.</span></div></div>",

Two enormous hands converge mere inches from where you are standing, their fingers intertwining over the ball as they fight for it.  In the melee their hands bump into the table, scooting it over so that it hits you in the side and knocks all the cups over, spilling beer into the already large puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda is just a bit faster than Helen is and manages to wrestle the ball away, yanking it back to her chest with a loud laugh.  Helen slams her hand on the table in frustration, the force making you go weak in the knees from how hard it shakes you.  Your opponent remains on the ground, still groaning, and from the look of his arm he won't be playing any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin Fulda winds up with the recovered ball, preparing to spike it against the table for a trick shot.  She releases it in an overhand throw, sending it hurtling toward the miniature table they set up for you to play on.  You dive out of the way as it approaches, just clearing the impact area as it slams into the table, breaking the flimsy thing in two and snapping all of the supports.  Beer splashes from the puddle when it hits, spraying you from the waist up with alcohol.  The far side of the broken table falls on your prone opponent, hitting him in the head.  Today really is not his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball bounces back up and continues its path toward Fulda's target.  Helen puts a hand in front of it, easily blocking it and sending it back your way.  With another splash the ball lands in the small pool of beer and keeps moving directly toward you.  Your eyes widen as it bears down on you, and you can scarcely muster the energy to move out of its path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately it bounces one more time, hitting the part of the table that fell on your opponent and then rolling back towards Helen.  You feel as though you should help him, but the situation is dangerous enough for you already, and it's not like there is anything you can even do.  Helen grabs the white ball and says, \"Fulda, look at what you did!  You wrecked their table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda laughs while Helen prepares her next shot.  \"Oh, like it's a big deal,\" she replies.  \"They're tiny, nothing about them matters!\"  Helen grins and looses the ball, sending it sailing over your head again.</span></div></div>",

You do your best to stay out of the way, trying not to get bowled over by it the same way your opponent did.  For his part he remains lying down where he is under the broken table, hoping that the balls flying and rolling do not hit him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Helen and Fulda are quite good at the game, no doubt having gotten their share of practice while tormenting shrunken people.  You rarely have to dodge any of the boulders rolling past you, and Fulda doesn't even try to spike it into you again.  In only a few minutes including ample banter between the two female towers each side is down to only one cup each, and Helen's aim has been getting progressively worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda ends up with the ball and sends it in a beautiful arc far above your head at the final remaining cup.  It disappears over the lip and is followed shortly after by a faint splash when it lands in the beer without hitting the cup at all.  Helen winces and pulls the ball out.  \"Looks like you win again,\" she says, placing the damp ball in the center of the table.  In her victory, Fulda looks quite smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bang draws your attention, and you turn to see Helen's fingers flipping over the broken table.  Her fingers wrap around the man who had been hiding beneath it, dragging him along the dark green surface with his dislocated arm hanging loose.  She lifts him up above her drink and lets go, dropping him into the beer with a plop.  His tiny screams are amplified by the cup as she raises it to her mouth then tips it back, pouring all of its contents down her throat.  Helen tips the cup's opening forward, showing that it's clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the game over you cross the table back to Fulda and stand in the gulf between her and the great red cup behind you now.  The two of you exchange pensive glances until finally you break the silence.  \"Did you mean that?\" you ask her.  \"That since we're small we don't matter?\"  She laughs down at you derisively before answering.</span></div></div>",

Her outstretched fingers snap shut around you, pressing you against her waiting palm, before lifting you up from the table.  Momentum brings her hand through the end of its arc, and your stomach lurches to the side when she suddenly stops her arm's movements.  The familiar sensation of being slowly lifted up the length of Fulda's body returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long she is holding you in front of her face again, with only your head sticking out from within her closed hand.  Your arms are pinned against your body by her tight grip, but you still struggle in her hand regardless of knowing it's futile, causing her to grin.  \"Does that mean,\" you begin, breaking it with a grunt as you fight her overpowering grip, \"that I'll live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda starts laughing again, large flecks of spittle landing on and around you as she belts out laughs from her cavernous maw.  \"Not by a long shot!\" she replies once she is able to control herself again.  \"You're still a tiny little pipsqueak, and a mouthy one at that.  If you get too far out of line, mess up one of my games, or just I just get bored of you, I have no problem ending you.  Like this!\"  She tightens her fingers around you, pressing your ribs inward from the force.  The pressure increases and she narrows her eyes, and asks, \"Isn't that right Helen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic blond appears next to Fulda and vigorously nods, tossing her loose hair back and forth as she looms over you.  \"Oh, absolutely!\" she exclaims as stars appear in your vision.  \"This twerp gets in my way I'll step on him, no questions.  I probably wouldn't even know it!\"  Both titanesses exchange an amused look while you try to struggle inside Fulda's hand, unable to do more than wiggle your head as your bones compress under her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully she loosens her grip, relieving the crushing force around you while still holding you firmly.  \"Lucky for you, I'm not bored yet.  Now c'mon, let's go have some more fun.\"  Fulda leaves the edge of the table and takes you back out to the rest of the party.</span></div></div>",

Besides, the heat from her hand is really starting to get to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strong hand keeps you from moving around too much, but the ride is far from pleasant.  Once you stop struggling Fulda ceases looking amused, and she just made it clear that if she's not amused it's very bad for you.  Helen does little to ease your nerves: the whole time the pair is walking she eyes you creepily, as though the only thing that keeps her from striking now is Fulda's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long until Fulda reaches the couch and stops.  Fulda takes a second to kick off her heels, dropping you half a foot with a quick surge from the fall, then turns around.  Your stomach jumps to your throat when she sits down, her crushing grip unable to keep the g-forces from affecting you.  She lands hard, bouncing up and down on the soft cushion, and pulls her statuesque legs up next to her, feet beside her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda loosens her grip to just two fingers and dangles you in front of an eye, swinging you back and forth while her pupil follows you.  Her glossy lips spread into a smile while your arms and legs swing wildly at her whims, apparently amused by her idle torment.  When you come to a stop she lifts her other hand and bats you with a finger, starting you swinging again like a pendulum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly Fulda stops playing with you and looks up, and you follow her gaze.  Towering above you is Helen, close enough that you can't even see her face past her tight white T-shirt clinging to her breasts.  Helen sits down next to Fulda, her long legs kicking into the air when her butt hits the cushion.  In her lap she places a wire insect cage about the size of a breadbox housing ten or so shrunken men.  She opens the door and the shrunken men scatter, but since they have nowhere to run Helen is easily able to wrap her fingers around one.  Quickly she pulls him out and turns the opening toward Fulda.  \"Want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's eyes dart over to the cage and she drops you down to her lap, making your stomach jump again.  \"Yeah, sure,\" she replies, \"just let me set this one down real quick.\"  You gulp while waiting to see where she puts you.</span></div></div>",

She moves you down to around the middle of her incredibly long feet and moves you toward the center, then lowers you until your feet touch down.  Once she's satisfied she releases you, and you lean backward to compensate for the slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's feet reek by now, their time stuck in her high heels having done a number on their scent which her nylons have done an excellent job absorbing.  You try not to cough while your feet get settled, the damp mesh forming to your feet above her skin.  Briefly you wobble but manage to stay standing out of sheer desire to not have your nose directly against her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two giantesses you feel immensely small, their torsos rising up hundreds of feet on either side of you.  Helen sits with her legs crossed, cage still on her lap, holding the man she just grabbed in a loose fist atop her white shorts.  Her gaze darts between him and you, her blue eyes showing an unhealthy interest in you now.  Fulda wiggles her feet, making you teeter again and causing her enormous butt looming over you to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment her hand is free she moves it to the cage, her hand loitering inside the door a moment.  She extends a finger and rotates her wrist, pointing at all of the shrunken men in turn as she tries to decide which to take.  Finally she settles on one on the far side and sticks her arm all the way in, slowly advancing at one stuck in the corner.  He tries a last-ditch effort to escape but Fulda quickly knocks him over with her fingers, then grabs him by the leg and starts dragging him back out while he claws at the floor, unable to get a grip that can match Fulda's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda pulls him out of the cage with him screaming and trying to grab on for anything the whole way, then lets him dangle upside down.  She carries him so that he can hang above her cleavage, letting him get a good view of the soft, ample landing area should she drop him.  However she maintains her grip and lifts a finger, then playfully bats him as she did to you, starting him screaming all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up!\" Helen says, and they both throw their heads back and open their mouths while lifting their small captives up.  Helen quickly pops hers into her mouth and swallows as though she were starving, while Fulda is more meticulous.  She slowly lifts hers up and lets him hang above her mouth, allowing him to see all the way back to her gullet.  When it becomes clear his screaming won't stop anytime soon she lets go, dropping him into her waiting mouth and closing her lips behind him.  Fulda holds him in her mouth, knocking him around with her tongue for a while, before tossing her head back and swallowing with a tell-tale lump moving down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I thought he'd never stop screaming!\" Fulda says with a laugh.  \"Mind if I have another?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just give me a min,\" Helen answers, tapping on the cage.  \"I need to get them good and scared.\"  Fulda nods and looks away, checking out what's happening on the other side of the party.</span></div></div>",

A couple of the people inside the cage come to help you up but quickly disperse when Helen slams her hand onto the top, causing all the wires to rattle.  You push yourself off the floor, your hands touching a mixture of the cold metal and Helen's skin poking through, and prepare for the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen puts her hands on either side of the cage and picks it up, her hand covering the open door.  Violently she begins shaking it, knocking you and the other people trapped inside to the ground and throwing you into each other.  She lifts the cage up to her face and looks in, her eyes shining brighter from the heavy mascara around them, her face dominating the view of everyone inside.  As she lowers it back down she subtly licks her lips, looking at what you hope is the person on the floor next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she sets the cage back down her hand shoots in, seemingly on a straight course for you against the back wall now.  Luckily she stops short and her fingers grab the chest of the person to your left, dragging him screaming toward the door.  He tries to grab on to your ankle but you kick him free, and can only watch as he tries to save himself, his fingers hooking around the cage wires and sliding out as he goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you're ready,\" Helen says to Fulda, rattling the cage some more from her voice.  The titanic redhead turns to look at the cage and leans forward, reaching her hand in.  Before you know it her hand has reached you, palm open wide in your face with her fingers stretched up and ready to strike.  At the last moment she turns her wrist, unexpectedly grabbing someone who had let his guard down.  Her hand muffles any screams that could be coming from him, and she quickly withdraws him from the enclosure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses nod to each other and tilt their heads back, getting ready to devour their choices.  Helen is more deliberate this time, holding hers over the cage so that his pleas for help filter down from her hand looming over the cage.  Nevertheless she unceremoniously slides him between her lips, tilting her head down so that you can watch him disappear into her mouth.  A second later, she swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda on the other hand is more playful, batting at the snack she's chosen a couple times before even lifting him to her lips.  She runs him along the edge a few times, dropping him a bit lower into her mouth with each revolution.  When he's waist-deep into her mouth she closes her lips, forming a seal around him.  He struggles to push himself out, but with a bit of suction Fulda draws him down up to his armpits.  Fruitlessly he continues trying to get out until she sucks again, pulling him into her mouth.  A lump moves down her throat soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want another one?\" Helen asks, beckoning toward the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty full, but I could smash one,\" Fulda replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I have plenty.\"  Helen sets her hand back down atop the cage and raps her fingers on it, the pounding from her fingertips like jackhammers, while she prepares to pick her next snack.</span></div></div>",

You're starting to wonder why you even bother to get back up.  She holds it in front of her chest and turns the entrance to face her, causing everyone to roll along the ground, then tilts it so the door is toward her face.  Everyone inside the cage either grabs onto the mesh or falls toward the back, landing hard.  Fortunately everyone misses you but one unlucky person lands on his head, breaking his neck with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen licks her lips and shoves her arm into the cage, running her fingers along the floor.  She moves them back and forth, knocking off anyone who was still clinging to the wires and making a hideous racket.  As her fingers advance through the cage she begins humming, and you find yourself unable to look away from the digits gradually approaching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so focused on Helen's hand, in fact, that you didn't notice all the surviving people huddle into the opposite corner, leaving you alone.  Helen singles you out and walks her fingers toward you, stopping about an inch away.  She runs a finger up and down your body as you press yourself vainly into the corner, the smell of her nail polish burning your nostrils as it descends from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done toying with you Helen sets her fingers against the wall beside you, forming a barrier with her fingers.  She tips the cage, and you fall into her fingers amid the cries of panic from the others stuck in here with you.  Helen quickly curls her fingers to hold you in, then withdraws her hand once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're out of the cage Helen tosses you into the air and then catches you again, holding you between two of her long, delicate fingers.  Gradually she adjusts her grip until she's holding you up by the collar of her shirt then lifts you up, allowing you to dangle in front of her mouth.  Helen's thin lips part in a smile, then pucker up before a strong gust of wind buffets you.  You swing back and forth, hanging helplessly in her grip, while she smiles at your predicament.</span></div></div>",

Hot breath hits you as you pass between her lips, and once you're past her teeth saliva begins to drip down from her palate onto your head.  Her fingers open, dropping you onto her frenulum where you sink in deeply before pulling her fingers back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her fingers are gone her lips close, casting her mouth into total darkness.  You're drenched by saliva built up at the bottom of her mouth, holding you in place at the base of her tongue.  Helen slams her tongue down atop you, the great pink beast pinning you down in the soft tissue below.  Desperately you thrash about to get free, but while you are more than able to move you can't make any progress: everything around you is simply too malleable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue lifts up, giving you some relief, but the tip quickly slides under your body.  You slide back along it as she tilts her head, drawing you toward her gullet.  Just before you fall off you reach up in a last-ditch attempt to hang from her uvula, but a surprise flick from her tongue tosses you forward onto her throat's opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's gullet opens, dragging you into her esophagus.  Her strong throat muscles automatically convey you down the pipe and into her stomach, dropping you into a vast pool of hydrochloric acid.  Your eyes and skin burn, and you can half-heartedly hear someone thrashing about in the pool.  The air is already thin, the other two having breathed most of the oxygen, and you settle in.

Your stay is brief while she sets the cage down on the couch, and once it settles against her thigh she lowers you the rest of the way.  She sets you down on the rug next to her enormous white Chuck Taylors and lets you go, pulling her hand back up.  The top of her head peeks over the couch cushion, allowing you to keep you in her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe beside you lifts up and Helen holds it over you, revealing the familiar rubber Converse tread pattern.  Seeing no other choice you turn and run for the table, but the plush rug is surprisingly different from the carpet you're accustomed to and you become bogged down.  Not that it would have mattered anyway: Helen's size 15 shoe easily overtakes you when she stomps it down long before you get out of the open.  When it hits you you're instantaneously flattened as all your bones are turned to dust, and you're reduced to a red spot on her shoe and the carpet.  At least they'll have to clean you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen feels your body burst under her shoe, and she grins at the sound of your bones crunching.  \"Okay, your turn!\"</span></div></div>",

She foregoes the pageantry of scaring her captives again and simply reaches in, her pale fingers searching for a victim.  Everyone scatters and you press yourself up against the wall, trying to hide in the far corner.  Her wrist turns and her fingers point at a corner by the door, where two other people fight for who gets to be in the corner.  Quickly she raises her index finger and shoves it down between them, wedging them apart.  When they're fully separated she pins the one in the corner with her finger and slides another behind him, trapping him in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's too surprised to shout as Helen pulls him out of the cage, and the person who had been jockeying for position with him doesn't even get up off the floor to help.  When he's out Helen moves him to her palm and forms her hand into a fist, leaving nothing but his head poking out.  \"You're a weak little coward,\" she says, her voice making the cage shake.  \"I don't even want to eat you now, you'd probably taste terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone can get excited about a possible means of escaping Helen tightens her fist around her captive.  You watch his face turn red and then purple as the pressure increases until his head rolls forward lifelessly.  Helen opens her hand, dropping the crushed corpse onto the cage's roof with a clang and showing the blood covering her palm.  Casually she wipes her hand on her thigh, smearing the blood against it, and asks, \"Can I get a mulligan on that one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's my turn,\" Fulda answers, setting her fingers at the base of the cage's door.  She raps her fingertips on the metal while she looks the crowd over, trying to pick the best target.  You remain in the corner, watching her hands to see what she'll do, while everyone does their best to remain still.  Even the person who got thrown down doesn't move, instead choosing to curl up into a ball as close to the wall as he can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's fingers cross the threshold, bringing her hand into the cage, and she extends a finger, pointing at each person in turn.  She mouths \"eenie-meenie-miney-mo\" as she goes, every time her finger stops accompanied by a whimper.  Her finger slows down as she goes and tension builds among the caged until she points at the person two over from you, saying \"You.\"  After a beat she moves to the next with \"Are.\"  Once more her finger shifts, pointing directly at you, and she says, \"It.\"  Before you can move her hand shoots forward and her finger pries you away from the corner, pressing you into her thumb.  In a rush she draws you out, making the cage whiz by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly she pulls you toward her until you're directly in front of her, held just above her cleavage.  She looks down at you in her fingers, wiggling with your arms and legs to get free despite the pain moving causes them, and considers what to do with you.  \"Fulda it's me, your champion!\" you shout, hoping to sway her.  \"Please, don't kill me!\"</span></div></div>",

Your bones creak under the pressure and you feel yourself suffocating, but you aren't crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers open a tiny bit, keeping a very firm hold on you but allowing you to breathe again.  \"Oh hey, it's you!\" she says, her voice rumbling inside your sensitive ears.  \"Why the hell did you get in the cage?  Like, what did you think was going to happen when you went in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer Fulda whips her hand to the side and slides you into her palm, closing her fingers around you.  Her fist squeezes tightly around you as leans hard to that side when she swings her legs off the couch and onto the ground, and you hold on to the tip of her middle finger for safety.  \"I think I'll take this one to go,\" she tells Helen, her voice making your bones chatter as the vibrations course through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda stands, the sudden acceleration making you feel as if your stomach is about to fall out your back, but you keep holding on tightly to her finger.  \"Aw, so soon?\" Helen asks, her booming voice muffled by Fulda's fingers.  \"I still have five left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll get rid of them,\" Fulda replies, trying to shake you off her finger.  \"Maybe go make sure Mariam finished her initiation, I saw her over by the window earlier.  Seeya!\"  The gentle arm swing of Fulda's stride is soon joined by loud thuds from her feet hitting the stairs, and she quickly makes her exit from the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her fingers you hear the creak of the door opening followed by the clatter of her high heels being dropped onto the floor.  Slowly Fulda lifts you up to her face, the rate gentle enough that you feel like it's merely a long elevator ride.  When her hand stops she spreads her fingers, lifting you up out of her palm.  You quickly let go of her fingertip and fall back down into her hand, landing hard on your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you're overwhelmed by her billboard-sized face staring down at you with an amused grin.  \"Hey, you almost died tonight!\" she chides, speaking quietly.  \"I won't get into why you got into the cage, I've seen shrunken people do all sorts of dumb stuff.  You wouldn't believe how many of them crawl into my shoes trying to hide.\"  Briefly Fulda suppresses a giggle and steps toward the center of the room.  \"But now it's just the two of us.

There's no air to breathe, not that you could with the weight of her leg resting on your chest, and heat quickly builds up until you begin sweating out what little water you still have.  Blood rushes into Fulda's quads, and the temperature increases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles you're stuck between tense, and you're unable to even move your fingers under the pressure.

I have no interest in keeping around some little twerp with no self-preservation just because he asks me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can explain her fingers open wide, dropping you from her face down to the chasm between her breasts.  You land softly on one and slide down to where they meet, your legs driving into her cleavage until you're up to your waist.  Fulda sets a hand down on one of her breasts and positions a finger over your head, then jabs it downward and pushes you into her cleavage until you're fully submerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're plunged deep into darkness and find yourself suspended between Fulda's two warm mounds of flesh.  You try to \"swim\" upward, using the breast stroke to separate the skin and clear a path for you, but your plan is quickly stopped when she pushes her breasts together around you.  Fulda's breasts hold you fast, keeping you from moving your arms or legs, and as the pressure builds you're barely able to wiggle a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the pressure the temperature increases, Fulda's body heat overwhelming you.

All the captives shake as her outstretched fingers come closer, terrified of what will happen when they're chosen.  She lifts a finger, pointing it at the people in front including you, and starts swiping it at people.  There's no room to dodge as it smacks you in the torso, throwing you from your feet as it does the others.  You start to get back up when another blow shakes the cage.  \"Stay down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palm centers over you and you close your eyes as her finger hooks forward.  A firm kick to your ankle convinces you to open them again, and you watch as the man behind you is dragged through the opening.  Helen opens her mouth and tosses him into the air, and you watch him flip head over feet as he arcs toward her.  He bounces off her bottom lip then skips into her maw, sealed inside right after as her lips close to be inevitably swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you see the deed done Fulda's hand bursts through the doorway, hell-bent on taking one by surprise.  Her finger curls around the person lying next to you and she drags him back toward her, pinching him between her digits.  She roughly drags him out of the cage before he can even scream and flings him onto the table where he slides along the glass for several inches, some part of him no doubt broken.  Fulda raises her hand and leans forward, the brings her hand down atop the shrunken man with a bang.  When she pulls her hand back his mangled body is plainly visible on the glass in a pool of blood, as well as assorted bits on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda turns and high-fives Helen with a deafening clap, then says, \"I think that's it for me, though, it's been a long day.  Hand out the leftovers to anyone who wants them, maybe use one to make sure Mariam finally went through with it.  I'll see you tomorrow.\"  She turns to look at her foot where she had set you down and finds nothing, but instead of asking Helen about it she simply shrugs, picks up her shoes, and gets up to walk out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen slams the cage door shut and latches it, sealing you and the others in.  She grips the cage in both hands and stands, tossing its inhabitants about as she draws up to her full height.  With each step she takes the door bounces back and forth against the cage with a metallic clang, and you're tossed up and down as the floor rises and drops.  Through the mesh floor you watch each long stride of her Converse along the ground, far away from the threat they pose for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty seconds of being jostled around Helen reaches a table where two other women are sitting and chatting quietly, drinks in hand.  She sets the cage down in the middle, then turns and calls, \"Hey Mariam, come here!  I've got a boyfriend for you!\"  Thudding footsteps sound from behind Helen, and you see a head of blond hair poking out from behind her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three crowd around the cage, nearly pressing their faces into the mesh.  You recognize the one with bright red hair that you climbed earlier - you think Fulda called her Jackie - and Mariam seems to be the same woman whose legs you crawled on, standing on either side.  The third - you can tell from her unusually wide mouth and green dress is the woman who ate someone ahead of you on the course earlier - looks down into the cage from above, her hazel eyes darting between each person in turn.  There's nowhere to hide from their gazes, and each time they exhale you're blasted by a cloud of hot breath.  Never before had you felt so much like you're in a zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone, be sure to not smash them when you reach in, there's no need to hurry,\" Helen says, resting a finger beneath the latch.  \"There's enough for all of us if everybody takes one.\"  She flicks her finger up, hitting the latch and throwing the door open.  \"Go!\"  Simultaneously all three giantesses reach in to grab someone, trying to force all their hands through the entrance.  But whose hand will you end up in?</span></div></div>",

The ball has a surprising amount of force and you're pushed to the ground while the ball teeters on the table's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's hand slams against the table and the thud knocks the ball off where it promptly falls onto your chest.

The slide at least had been an opportunity to not struggle for your life for a minute, and your arms and legs are very thankful for the rest.  For a moment you simply lay on the cool tile, giving yourself more time to catch your breath and lower your body temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll good things must come to an end however, and if you don't get moving soon you're going to attract the ire of one of the women.  You push yourself up, leaving a wet outline on the white tile from your clothes, and walk over to the threshold into the hallway.  It is difficult for you to find a comfortable way to move with your clothes drenched, not only from sweat but also from juices from the various sandwich meats, condiments, and shrimp, but you do your best to abide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the doorway's threshold and peek around the corner into the dimly-lit hallway.  Dispersed over the route through the hallway are four or five partial tiny corpses, smashed as they tried to run through with parts of them getting stuck to a shoe.  Footsteps thud against the hardwood floor, starting loud and getting louder as they pass through the route.  Two women engrossed in conversation walk past side by side, their conversation inaudible due to the pounding of their feet.  Patiently you wait for them to pass, not wanting to be stuck with nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're behind them you jump out into the hallway and immediately regret it.  A rumbling thump to your right draws your attention, and you spin to see a shoe poised over you, the brown diamond pattern of a Converse dominating your limited visibility.  Your legs still tensed you jump back, just clearing out of the way before the titanic shoe slams down.  You fall backwards and find yourself looking up at the rubber lining along the base of her shoe, and the ALL STAR logo dozens of feet above you against a white canvas background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to your feet you approach the hallway again, much more cautiously this time.  So far as you can tell the coast is clear so you burst out into the hall, making a beeline for the carpet on the other side.  Your exhausted legs surge forward and your already taxed lungs gasp for breath, pushing you forward through the most unpredictable obstacle yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reach the door a shoe slams down in front of you, the very same bright red ballet flat you had previously gone around.  You fall forward onto it and catch yourself with your arms, stopping you from sliding halfway onto her foot.  With a quick glance you check to see whether her other shoe is on course for you.  Satisfied that it isn't you take several steps back, content to give her a bit of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud clicks against tile draw your attention behind you, and you spin around to see a pair of slender legs in black flats walking toward you. With each step she takes the shaking grows more intense, and you turn back to see if the path has opened up yet.  The red shoe is still completely blocking your path, with no sign that she'll be moving any time soon.  You look up the length of the titaness and see that she's gotten out her phone and appears to be texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a sudden crash only a few inches behind you, and you turn your head slightly to see how close she is now.  The metal studs in the band across her toes are almost close enough for you to reach out and touch, and as soon as you look a plain flat sole soars overhead.  You watch it with trepidation while it goes over you, her foot much too wide for you to escape if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses bump into each other, making a loud thud when their bodies collide.  The shoe above you takes a step back, planting its toe between you and the red ones.  Very shortly after the rest of her shoe comes down, pinning you between it and the floor, and in an instant you're crushed under her, the sound of you being squished drowned out by the ambient party sounds.  </span></div></div>",

As soon as you settle there she swings her shoe back down, violently slapping it against the carpet.  Her toe drives further into your back, curving your spine and legs beyond any position they've ever been in before.  When stretched this far, her pedicured toenail acts as an awning for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fulda lifts her foot, making you dizzy from the rapid ascent.  You gain a small degree of movement, about enough to wiggle your fingers, as you bounce back against her stocking, but you're unable to take advantage of it.  Fulda slightly tilts her foot downward and blood rushes to your head for the moment you hang there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe of Fulda's shoe hits the ground first, and her toe presses you against the inside of her shoe.  Your body, already at its breaking point, explodes all over her big and second toe, staining her stockings as she crushes you into a puddle.  At least you're killed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda grins when your body pops and she feels your blood between her toes.  She had barely lifted up her foot three inches and set it back down what she thought was fairly gently, and it was enough to squish you.

By the time the vibrations stop and you stop covering your head she's already stood back up to her monumental height and turned around to sashay back to her bed.  You watch her taut butt, eye level with your perch on her table, shakes back and forth as she walks across the open floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches her destination Fulda bends down to untie her Converse, pushing out her butt even more as if she knew where your gaze was focused.  She stands back up and unzips her shorts, letting them fall to the ground, then steps out of them.  Briefly she wiggles her toes inside her socks, then uses one of her big toes to slowly strip away the sock on the other foot.  As she does this she pulls off her shirt, revealing a cream-colored bra that matches her panties, and tosses it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda turns around, showing off her toned muscles and washboard abs to you, before she sits and takes the pair of stockings in one hand.  Gingerly she eases herself into them one leg at a time, pulling the skin-tight material as far up as it can go.  Each time she gets a foot settled in she twiddles her toes in your direction, almost at you, before setting it back on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she grabs her dress and stands up, then steps into the dress to pull it over her body.  Though it comes down below her knees you'd say it's far from modest as it reveals a generous amount of cleavage and fits tightly enough to leave very little to the imagination.  She zips it up all the way to the middle of her back, then steps into her huge black high heels, fitting perfectly into what would be like clown shoes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully dressed once more, Fulda takes a moment to adjust the dress before turning her attention back to you.  She strides back to your table and stands there for a moment, looking down at you as you gaze up the monolith before you.  While you expect her to make some snide remark she simply reaches out her hand and plucks you up by the back of your shirt, then lifts you up to her chest.  For a moment she lets you dangle over her cleavage, then the releases her pinched grip and lets you drop, settling in between her breasts with your head and torso poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your position Fulda leaves the room while you struggle to get free from Fulda's mountainous boobs.  Every time you think you're making progress she takes a step, making her chest bounce and dropping you back to where you started.  By the time she starts descending the stairs you've given up any hope of escape and try to just maintain your position amid the fleshy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the base of the stairs Fulda reaches in with two fingers to dig you out from being firmly entrenched in her cleavage.  She easily frees you and secures her grip, then pulls you up toward her face.  Briefly she presses you to her lips in a mocking kiss then pulls you away so that she can wink at you.  \"Have fun,\" she teases as she looks for somewhere to set you down.</span></div></div>",

She quickly jerks her hand to the side, her strong fingers guiding you from above her breasts to being held over the carpet.  As soon as you're clear she opens her fingers, letting you drop all the way to the ground.  Briefly she brushes her fingers clean of you while you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour impact on the ground is gentler than you expected thanks to the soft carpeting, but you still bend your knees and roll on landing to help dissipate the force.  You end up in a crouch next to a monumental high heel, able to see each wrinkle and crease of the white leather, and look up the titanic Fulda.  From your estimation she doesn't even remember where she dropped you, and she carelessly steps away.  Her single step covers more ground than you could in ten minutes, and you don't entertain any thoughts of running after her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize it may be a good idea to find a place to hide before this party gets in full swing.  Fortuitously Fulda dropped you a mere foot from a chair and not too far from a couch, both of which have small gaps underneath under which you could easily hide, and three feet in front of the chair is a simple glass table with a metal frame.  The prospect of insects and cobwebs under the couch and chair deter you, and you resolve to make for the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rhythmic thundering makes you stall as the repetitive thud of footfalls grows louder and the vibrations more intense.  You break your focus from the table to see two sets of legs coming your way, one wearing elegant black heels and the other a pair of dark red boots.  The heels come to a stop right next to you with the boots opposite them, the former dwarfing you much as Fulda's had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even get a view of the woman wearing heels she leans her hip against the chair, forming a roof above you with her legs and butt.  That's not to say you can't see any of her, since her legs are uncovered and her black dress barely comes halfway down her thighs.  The woman opposite her is similarly dressed but seems to be about three inches shorter, lighter skinned and definitely blond.  While the blond contemplates her drink you decide how you're going to survive this party.</span></div></div>",

Absent any obvious way of climbing up on to something you figure the next best thing is to get someone to pick you up.  You know it's risky, but the odds of whoever finds you being as much of a sadist as Fulda are low.  With this in mind, you decide to focus on the nearby pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think the tremendous pair of heels next to you begins to fidget, and the woman starts tapping her toe.  As she gets increasingly animated you dash forward, your steps slowed by your feet sinking into the carpet fibers.  Suddenly the woman lifts up her foot, swinging it out and above you!  Momentarily you flinch until it passes from above you, moving in a short semicircle to the opposite side of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably won't change stances for a while, you think, and with the way clear you make up your mind: instead of going in between them and hollering up ineffectually, you're going to climb atop her shoe and try to get the attention of one of them.  You change course and head for her shoe at a steady pace, not wanting to tire yourself out in case you have to do some climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the shoe without incident, the nearest never so much as shifting her feet and the blond never noticing your steady progress when she pauses to look at her drink.  For a moment you stand at the toe, psyching yourself up to climb atop.  Finally you close your eyes, place your hands on top and wedge your foot into the nook between the sole and the rest of the shoe, then push yourself upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon landing you open your eyes and see the broad, raised foot in front of you, its toes hidden within the leather beneath you.  Tentatively you push yourself up to your feet and begin cautiously walking away from the toe, suddenly very aware of minute movements you hadn't seen from a foot away.  Before you can step onto her skin and begin ascending however their conversation suddenly grabs your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that?\" the blond asks, then after a second adds, \"You've got something on your shoe.\"  You stop immediately and turn your head to see her pointing directly at you.  The woman you're on looks down with a quizzical expression, her dark brown bangs waving back and forth.</span></div></div>",

She holds you tightly, covering your entire torso and your legs down to your knees, as she picks you up from her friend's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she crouched she stands back up, the rush making you dizzy.  She holds you close to her face, investigating her catch with her light brown eyes.  You say nothing, but you wiggle your arms and what you can of your legs to try to send some sort of signal to her.  In response she merely grins and adjusts the accessory in her hair piled atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's this?\" she asks rhetorically, her booming voice making your bones rumble.  \"It's the size of a bug, but it's only got four limbs and looks a whole lot like a person.\"  The brunette leans in to see as well, her green eyes peering at you suspiciously.  \"But it can't be that, the guys aren't supposed to be here for another few minutes, and they're supposed to have an hour of fun before they shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, who cares?\" the brunette replies as she withdraws.  \"It's just some crap that got on my shoe, toss it.

Briefly her fingers tighten on your chest as she cocks you backward, then you're freed when she pitches you forward, her fingers opening as you're tossed into her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale deeply before you crash through the surface of the syrupy liquid, the impact stinging your face and nearly making you cry out as you're immersed in the room temperature fluid.  Momentum carries you several inches through the thick substance, and you become concerned that the pressure will overcome you before anything else.

Keeping your eyes closed, you propel yourself upward until you break the surface again with your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipples break the formerly placid surface of the red liquid, and you rapidly shake your head to throw it off your eyes.

She places her lips on the rim of her cup and begins tipping the bottom upwards.  You're pulled toward the edge of the cup as the punch sloshes upward to her mouth, bumping against the plastic wall.

You're washed into Bela's mouth with the red river and land on the tip of her tongue, the soft, fleshy point softening your landing.  As soon as you land she closes her lips, cutting off any light source that would otherwise illuminate this damp cave.  In a way you're thankful you can't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of alcohol is even heavier here, making your eyes water whenever you open them.

Despite their amplified voices you have difficulty hearing what they're saying, so you do your best to just maintain spatial awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral times you consider slinking away from the two women, but the blond has a habit of looking down at her drink while talking.

You watch her shapely leg bend slightly at the knee as she adjusts her stance, turning her foot outwards.  The toe of her shoe casts you into shadow as you wordlessly look up the sole, hoping that it's going to pass over you.  Unfortunately as soon as you're nearly dead center the swing stops and she sets it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoe was barely more than an inch off the ground to begin, and her sole immediately strikes you atop the head.  Instantaneously your body is flattened and your bones broken, making a faint crunch that it's doubtful either of the women heard as you're crushed underneath her shoe.  She idly taps her toe a few times, unknowingly driving your smeared body into the carpet fibers before it comes back to rest on your shattered remains.</span></div></div>",

She was headed for the kitchen, as it'll likely be one of the more populate areas during the party. It was empty, for now the party hadn't begun yet. When she got there, she pondered for a moment. Should she place you right in the middle of the floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, placing you right where a girl would likely crush you right away would be too much of a mercy.\" The sadistic sorority queen noted, as the most terrifying and vicious smirk formed upon her lips. She walked over to the edges of the place and started to bend down. If you were feeling queasy before, now you were on the verge of puking your guts out as the whole world shot past you and you tumbled out of Fulda's hand and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 7-foot tall woman stood up, you gazed in awe. On the floor, next to those stupendous size 15 stilettos, Fulda now looked apocalyptic in scale. Her vast, impossible body looked like it could end the world in one vicious step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta ta! Have fun down there! Just try not to die too early! I kinda hope we stumble into each other again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, her thunderous footsteps kept you unable to stand, she left you alone in the kitchen. An hour of relative quiet passed, allowing you to recover before the next torment came along. The party. As the various girls of the college started to pile in, Fulda's assault upon your senses now seemed like a miniscule thing. Here, a whole army of giantesses were around you. Their footsteps, their voices, the loud pounding music that all parties needed to have. All of those now bombarded you eardrums, making you wonder whether or not you'll become totally deaf at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now trapped between two pairs of feet and the kitchen desk. One pair wore a pair of thigh high flat black boots and the other was in strappy high heel sandals that showed off perfectly pedicured, slightly bronzed feet. You followed them up and up and up to see the two oblivious godesses that had you trapped. You vaguely knew of these two as you shared classes with them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boots belonged to Naomi Sinclair, a cute british girl with a playful personality to match her looks who caught your eye when you first started here. She was wearing opaque stockings as black as the boots on her feet, a pair of daisy dukes that showed off one amazing ass and a t-shirt with some gothy or punk motif underneath a black leather jacket. It was impossible to see her face as her ample breasts obstructed the view but you could make out that her flame-red hair was tied up into a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandals, belonged to Naomi's lesbian lover, Athena Kalivas. She was greek and lived up to her name in every way, right down the attire she chose for this party and her attitude which was as elitist and bitchy as one would expect from a goddess. (You always did wonder how people so polar opposite to each other could hook up like these two did.) The straps of her stiletto sandals spiralled around her bronzed legs up to her knees, where beyond the edges of a white cocktail dress fell loosely around her thighs. The dress was constrained by a belt around the brunette's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were chatting away with each other, giggling at times. You couldn't make out what they were saying over the general cocophony that was a party of giantesses. Now you had no option but to approach one of these two almighty leviathans. But which one? Athena had her luscious feet exposed so she would probably feel you climbing up her but you'd probably be more visible against Naomi's dark and towering leather footwear.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, that didn't come to pass as you hoisted yourself up on to the shiny leather structure. After a bit of a striggle to find footing on the smooth leather with every shift upwars, you were atop her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little time to celebrate or rest however as you dove straight into climbing the shaft of her boot. It was long and hard work, especially as the redhead had a tendancy to jerk her leg back and forth at the most unexpected moments.

Athena, more or less, remained still as you reached the edge of her sandal and climbed up to her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against her pinkie toe as booming laughter rocked the air around you and your ears felt like they were going deaf. Apparently, Naomi had just told Athena how some pathetic guy in her class had the nerve to come and asked her out on a date. Athena laughed just like a stereotypical bitch, all giggly <i>hehehes</i> which grated your ears like nails on a chalkboard. Wanting to get her attention (and end that horrible laughter) as soon as possible, you started slamming your tiny fists into her little toe, but Athena didn't notice your struggles in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I need to go higher,\" You muttered, annoyed. You grabbed onto the toenail above you and with a heave, pulled yourself up and over her toe. You turned your gaze up the slight incline of her foot, towards the tan pillar of her leg, finally gazing up at the hem of her white dress and her sexy white panties peeking out beyond that. You were staring up in awe at the great view you were lucky to get, but you were snapped back to reality as Athena shifted her foot. You dropped to your stomach in a panic and grabbed one of the sandal straps to steady yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled down after a moment, but that brought back the since of urgency for your situation and you army crawl up the incline of her foot. Athena doesn't seem to notice any of your movements, but that just makes you more worried as she may crush you accidently, thinking you're an itch. You crawl up to bend between her foot and ankle, then turned you eyes upwards as you couldn't see Athena's face over the hem of her skirt, or beyond her massive tits. Knowing that you have to go higher, you get up to your feet from your stomach position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the strap of her sandals, you climbed following the spiral over the back of Athena's calf to come around again at the front of her knee, below her fluttery skirt. Now you wondered what to do next. <br>\r\nYou could try to climb outside of Athena's skirt, hoping that the white contrast of her dress would show your small form or you could climb the inside of her skirt, avoiding her from seeing you as a bug and hitching a free ride at the same time.

It was difficult to climb on the inside as every <i>little</i> shift that Athena made had the inside of her skirt rocking about like a sail stuck in a violent storm and it didn't help that your back kept bumping into her massive thigh behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes of tedious climbing, you reached the waist-area inside Athena's skirt, then you remembered the big problem in your decision to go up inside of her skirt. The inside of her dress above you was pressed tightly against her stomach because of the belt you forgot about and you couldn't squeeze pass the skin tight fabric. Feeling a sense of defeat, you looked down and saw the sheer drop to the floor. Your arms were starting to shake with exhaustion and there wasn't any places inside her skirt to stop and rest. Well, there was one place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou down at Athena's giant silk panties and you finally let out your first grin since the whole time that you've been shrunk. Her panties were out of reach, so you waited, timing it when her skirt was the closest and you leaped. Grabbing the waistband of her panties, you pulled yourself inside and slide down the smooth fabric to the bottom. Your jaw dropped at the sight above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a massive pussy that could easily swallow you whole. Her lips and clitoris were a beautiful pink, surrounded by a tan plain. Athena may be a bitch, but she keeps herself immaculate as not a single hair could be seen around her glistening lips. You were starting to pant as her musk surrounded you and your excitement grew with each breath. Touching one of the quivering lips, Athena shivered and any thought you had for caution went out the window. You jumped up and grabbed the soft lips, pulling yourself inside of the Greek giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Let me know what you think.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick jerk you turn the doorknob and push inward, throwing open the door to your room.  As soon as you're clear of it you spin around and force it shut, strongly preferring to be away from prying eyes while you deal with this.  You click the lock into place and turn back to the room again, surveying the floor for your new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally it wasn't where you had left it on the floor.  No doubt it was planning some idiotic escape plan, as if it could even get out the front door in the implausible case of it getting there in the first place.  Still, you think you should give it the benefit of the doubt, and head to your closet to see if maybe it just went to its new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flick on the light and step in, looking down to see the miniature house you've placed on the floor for your pets.  Just in case you take a moment to stand astride it, hoping to intimidate your pet if he's inside.  \"Come on out, pipsqueak!\" you call in a sing-song voice.  \"You can neither hide nor run from me.\"  A few seconds pass, and there's no movement from inside the house.  Time for plan B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you squat down and regard the house before you.  You reach out one of your slender hands and grab the roof easily, pulling it off from the house but not revealing anyone hiding.  To be sure you run a finger through the open floor, turning over all the furniture that it slams into, but still nothing.  Without wasting a moment you tear away the second floor, revealing the ground floor wrecked from earlier, but alas there's nothing to find here either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you suppose it was too much to hope that it did what you wanted it to.  You return to your room and move on to the next logical place for it to hide, underneath your bed.  Excitedly you get down on your chest and scoot forward under the bed, looking right and left for anything unusual.  Sure enough, behind one of the posts you see the distinct outline of a shrunken man quivering with fear.  Immediately you reach out a hand, ensnaring it in your palm, and close your fingers.  While it struggles to get free you can feel its twitching, trying to fight against your fingers in an entirely futile effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your hand in front of your face, with the little shit right in the middle.  It's shaking and probably pleading with you for something, you can't tell - its voice is nothing more than a series of high-pitched squeaks to you.  Not that you'd care, since you definitely have to punish it now.</span></div></div>",

You begin trudging through the thick carpeting towards the door, stepping high with each stride so that you can overcome the waist-high fibers slowing you down.  Every step makes you uneasy, and you worry about toppling over and getting caught in some of the stray strands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long however you're at the base of the door, peeking through the crack to see a well-lit hallway on the other side.  You lay down on your chest and start crawling your way under it, slipping slightly more into the plush carpeting below you until you're fully overtaken by it.  Though unexpected this will help ensure your escape, and your touchdown on the very roots of the carpeting coincides with when you're completely out from under the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue using the carpeting as cover, and stand up only far enough to poke your head out from it.  As you walk forward you spread the thick undergrowth with your arms, forcing your way through with much more difficulty than expected.  Upon reaching the center of the hallway you look down and count four doors on each wall leading to a humongous bay window opposite the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour survey is interrupted by very loud thuds and their accompanying vibrations.  You freeze with naught but your head poking out, hopefully unnoticeable to whomever is about to approach.  From your hopefully safe vantage point you look all around, so you're not surprised when you see what the source is.</span></div></div>",

On the other side you see a slender woman with curly, shoulder-length blond hair with turquoise eyes heavily lined with mascara and pale skin.  It seems she has a fascination with whiteness, since her T-shirt, which is probably two sizes too small for her, is also white, and her denim shorts are also white.  She steps forward, stooping slightly so as to be sure she doesn't hit her head on the door frame, and her white, high top Converse makes a tremendous rumble as it slams down onto the carpet a mere few feet away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other foot is already in motion, and her shoe glides harmlessly over your head with no indication that she even knows you're there.  You look up her pair of slender legs from your position embedded in the carpet, and watch her turn to go down the stairs.  As soon as her back foot clears your head you've already sprung into action, forcing your way through the carpet and into the mystery woman's room - all things considered, she at least didn't shrink you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a minute to cross the threshold with your tiny legs and having to deal with the thick and abundant carpet fibers, but once you're inside you realize it's not much different from Fulda's room.  From what you can see there's a very large bed with a white comforter on it, a desk where you can see the top of a computer monitor, and next to the closet is a bookcase.  One of the books has a strip of masking tape on the spine, and has \"HELEN K.\" written on it with bold black marker.  Presumably, the new woman's name is Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hands atop carpet fibers on either side, and prepare you push yourself out so that you can better move around.  Before you pop yourself out though you hear a loud series of thumps, and you have no doubt that someone's coming up the stairs - from the rhythm of the footfalls, two someones.  While you still have only your head poking out you turn to see, hoping that even in the middle of the room they won't be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up the stairs is Fulda, followed closely by Helen.  You remember seeing Fulda at normal size and how gigantic she was then, so it's surprising that Helen is barely an inch shorter than her, probably 6'6\" from your estimation.  What is this, some sort of sorority for freakishly tall women?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time to think about that, since the two giantesses break away from each other, with the red-headed tormentor going into her room and the titanic blond coming back into hers.  You're shaken ever more violently as her footsteps get closer, and with just a few strides she's back in the room.  Helen pauses to close the door then turns back around, eyes cast downward.  You hope that with only your pin prick of a head sticking out she doesn't see you, or will at the very least dismiss you as a fleck of dust on the carpet.</span></div></div>",

With a gulp you look up from your position in her floor, and sure enough Helen is looking back down at you, a wry grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fee fi fo fum,\" she booms, placing her hands on her waist, \"I spy a pest beside my shoe.  Trapped and stuck he cannot run, so surely he'll be smashed to goo.\"  Helen finishes her taunt and lifts up her right shoe, then lets it dangle over your head.  While it hovers you glance between the familiar diamond pattern and the very serious look in her eyes, until she brings her foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Helen's foot begins its descent you squeeze your eyes shut, unable to face your imminent destruction.  Much to your surprise the tremendous boom when she makes impact isn't accompanied by you being flattened.  You manage to pry your eyes open and see thick, contoured white rubber close enough to scrape your nose.  It's impossible to pull your attention away from the enormous shoe right in front of you, especially since right now you're exactly even with the bottom of her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Helen's powerful voice calls out again.</span></div></div>",

The titaness in white turned around and walked towards her bookcase, not even attempting to care about your existence. And you were right in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are scared stiff as you see a massive white Chuck Taylor smash down, the toe only a few yards away by your measurements. The vibrations shake you to the core.  After all that torture with Fulda, you weren't going to end up a stain on the bottom of another Converse shoe. Helen prepares to take another step, and you can see that her foot is going to be landing exactly where you're standing. You look up to see the brown rubber bottom of her shoe ready to crash down onto you. As the shadow of the massive Converse shoe hovers above you, you book it through the fibers of the carpet to avoid getting crushed by Helen's high tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump at the very last second as Helen completes her step. You look back and see the white rubber trim of her Converse sneaker towering in front of you. You look above to see the Chuck Taylor star on her ankle connected to her slender, pale legs and bleached denim shorts. The pale giantess was a beauty to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter narrowly avoiding death at the feet of her, Helen continues her walk across the room, launching the Converse shoe in front of you yards away. She walks to the bookcase, and starts to fix her make-up. \"Can't look like shit for class\", she mutters to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill catching your breath from that near-death experience, you come with a plan to get you out of this dorm and far away from Fulda. You're going to need to hitch a ride with Helen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her backpack sitting right next to her feet. That's the perfect place to hide and remain unseen by your redhead tormenter next door. You start jogging towards the colossus Helen, not knowing when she's going to leave. You run as fast as your stamina will let you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are only about a football field's distance away from Helen's backpack when you hear the click of Helen closing up her mascara pen. She then bends over, and you see your chance of escape propel into the air. You stop in awe as you try to think of another plan, but you see Helen shift her feet and point herself towards the exit. And you're in the way of her path... again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnticipating it this time, you step to the side and wait for her shoe to come down right in front of you. You're going to have to hitch onto Helen the hard way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white Converse sneaker slams in front of you, and you see her knotted laces bounce as her foot falls. The nearest loose lace is out of your reach. You jump onto the bottom rim of her sneaker, onto the red line between the canvas and rubber. You work fast, as you don't have much time. Everything moves in slow motion as you grab hold of the flat, crossed laces on the bridge of her shoe as you brace for liftoff. Helen takes another step, and you hold on with all your might to the white laces before you touch down again. You take this opportunity to run up the bridge of her shoe and attempt to get to the tongue. It takes a few more of her gigantic steps, but you finally reach the tongue of her high top Converse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hide yourself between tongue of her shoe and her leg, hoping not to be seen by Fulda. You hear Helen open the door to her room and head out.</span></div></div>",

You stagger backwards and realize that, little by little, her shoe is now dropping down atop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight or flight takes over in your brain - flight, in this case, since there's no chance you'd be able to stop the inexorable descent of her shoe - and you turn tail to run.  Since she's bringing it down so slowly and seems to be enjoying herself immensely you reason you'll be able to escape from underneath her sole, likely just outrunning the length of her foot before she brings it down like before.  Each step you take makes you believe this more, and in only a few seconds you estimate you'll be clear enough for her to \"just miss\" you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have about ten more yards from your perspective to cover Fulda suddenly raises up her shoe.  Expecting her to slam it down dramatically you go faster, practically flying over the carpet fibers instead of sinking into them.  A harsh scraping sound assaults your ears, and Fulda's other shoe slides into view, her heel slightly lifted off the ground.  She sets it down, forming a wall of rubber and canvas, and allowing her heel above you to descend yet again.  You're unable to stop in time and slam directly into her instep, knocking yourself onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your back it's clear her shoe isn't stopping any time soon, and worse it's much closer than you had thought.  You roll over to your stomach and push yourself up into a crouch, eyes darting in every direction for an exit.  Two doors are visible despite Fulda's shoe blocking most of your field of view, one with light visible under it and one without.

You crane your head back until you can see her face, and she grins down at you.  \"Boo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swipes her other hand at you and you duck, just barely avoiding her hand as it passes close enough to rustle your shirt.  Before she can send another hand your way you dash the opposite direction, heading for the power strip.  At a sprint you jump, hopping up the wall and swinging yourself around one of the plugs.  You look back at her and see her drop the sock, the small white ball bouncing once off the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda gets down on her hands to pursue you under the desk, so you step backwards off the strip of outlets.  You land amid a tangle of cords of various colors and thickness, and lift up the nearest ones so you can crawl under them.  There's a rough scraping sound from her shoes dragging across the carpet, and the thuds from her hands on the floor increase in volume as she approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour titanic pursuer easily closes the distance, placing her hands on either side of the jungle of wires while you low crawl under them.  She looks down, easily spotting you through the gaps.  \"You're so predictable,\" she says, gingerly placing a hand above you.  Carefully she works her fingers through the cords, and your foot avoids being pinned beneath her by mere millimeters.  Before you can be glad she missed she shoves her fingers in further, turning them on the floor to chase you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed, Fulda watches you slowly escape her grasp, easing her finger forward to keep the pressure on.  \"The only place more obvious would have been under my bed.\"  She sets her other hand down above you, with only a thin layer of wires between you and her palm.  Quickly she slides a finger into the wires in front of you, blocking your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only a few seconds before she closes the trap and envelops you with her hands.  You look for any escape from this, and know you will have to run through the open again.  To your left is her armoire, and to your right, much closer, is the edge of the desk and the wall's baseboard.  Whichever you try, Fulda is closing in.</span></div></div>",

With her fingers mere millimeters away you lift up one of the thin cords to your right, opening the wall of wires just a hair.  Then you roll slightly onto your side and dig into the carpet, scraping out a bit more clearance.  You push your shoulder into it and slide through the gap, just clearing the wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a clatter from behind you while Fulda tries to disentangle her fingers from the mess of wires she's wrapped around them, and you make for the wall.  Pumping your little legs for all that they're worth you avoid tripping on the thick carpet fibers, and hop over a particularly thick power cord in your path.  Fulda growls in frustration, and you hear the mess of wires fall to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the giantess is free you know your time is limited, and you can scarcely afford a mistake.  There's a loud slam and the ground under you shakes, causing you to stumble but not knocking you down.  You risk a glance back and see an enormous manicured fingernail just an inch behind you, as well as a very dissatisfied look on Fulda's face.  Quickly you get your stride back, not wanting to fall into the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great scraping sound assaults your ears as Fulda crawls forward, her flawless knees and low-top Converse sliding over the carpet.  Very close to you is the wide, flat foot of the desk you're under, pushed up to be nearly flush with the wall.  The unearthly scraping rings out again, bringing Fulda forward until she's practically on top of you.  With a quick glance up you can see the crown of her head, and know she's getting ready for another grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slap your hand onto the rounded edge of the desk's foot and use your momentum to swing yourself along the side's arc, bringing you around quicker.  Between the bottom of the desk and the white wall you find a crack just large enough for you to slip into, your head barely lower than the top.  Fulda's fingers clang off the metal, causing you to duck away from it while the sound reverberates throughout the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's finger remains atop you while she tries to pry her way into the crack, but the space is just small enough she can't make any progress.  She leans in and narrows her cold eyes down at you, and you proceed sliding along sideways, a fraction of an inch outside her grasp.  Her head pulls away, leaving you to focus on your task of getting through the canyon.</span></div></div>",

Every few steps you take a shallow breath, not wanting to disturb the thick layer of dust that's built up at the base of the desk, while you keep your focus on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feminine groan filters down from above and the desk is swiftly yanked away from you, leaving only the circular indentations from its stabilizers in the carpet.  With your cover gone the room's glaring light shines on you again, making you fully aware of your now total exposure.  You look around for somewhere else you can take cover but see nothing you'll be able to reach in any reasonable amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lets go of the desk and stands back up, a human tower in her own room.  She quickly sidesteps around the desk's corner and leans against the top, scanning the wall's baseboard for you.  You freeze in place hoping that she'll overlook you, but in mere seconds her eyes come to rest upon you.  Briefly she smiles, then pushes herself off the desk toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe of a massive Converse slams down next to you, followed by another on your other side, each footfall generating a powerful earthquake on its own.  Before you can recover she snaps her heels together with a loud pop of hard rubber slamming together, causing you to wince.  Fearfully you look between the shoes and try to back away, only to find yourself bumping into the plastic baseboard immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win,\" is all Fulda says, snapping you back to your predicament.  She's right: you're trapped between her shoes and the wall, a snare you helped her set up.  The desk was so massive you had considered it part of the landscape, not something she would easily be able to tear away.  Even running is out of the option, since you'd have to climb over her shoes to get anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrepidation fills you as you look up from the impassable canvas and rubber wall hemming you in to the rest of the colossus.  Fulda's legs for hundreds of feet of smooth, taut skin up to her black short shorts, upon which she rests her hands.  Her white tank top is pulled tight against her chest, reminding you of a billboard that has yet to be claimed.  She has a victorious smirk on her face as she looks down at you, a row of white enamel shining behind her pink lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she begins, breaking the silence with one booming syllable.  \"What should I do with the tiny little loser?\"</span></div></div>",

You sigh deeply and turn your attention back to her, ready to accept whatever punishment she has in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unable to see much of her past the sole of her shoe looming over you, her heel digging into the fluffy white carpet fibers.  The brown rubber is pristine, all of the diamonds in the pattern crisp and a circled 16 still visible by her instep.  Fulda holds her foot in place for several seconds, the enormity of her shoe over you making it clear what she plans.  You had hoped for something which would let you live, even if it would be humiliating, but there's nothing you can do about it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda swings her foot down with enough force to crack the earth, one of the diamonds centered directly over your head.

She tries to recover but she moved much too quickly, confident in her imminent victory over you, and is swiftly falling down.  The out of control giantess's body passes over you, and you see her put her arms out to brace her fall.  Her toned legs bend, shins rapidly speeding past you on their way to the floor.  Fulda's enormous shoe pivots on the toe, swinging down towards you like a building that's been knocked over on a direct course to smash you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shakes and there's a booming cacophony when Fulda's massive body slams into the ground, propped up on her elbows and forearms.

Fulda plants the shoe you're grasping on the ground, allowing you to come to rest upon her laces.  She spends a moment brushing herself off and recovering from her fall, cursing herself for being so clumsy in her moment of victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda lifts her heel slightly while peering down at the floor, pitching you forward in a roll.

The moment Fulda puts the car in reverse inertia knocks you on your back, and when she's done backing out it scoots you forward, abruptly stopping your attempt to stand.

Breath is forced from your lungs when you impact on her kneecap, and you feel two ribs break for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no opportunity to move around or even allow gravity to pull you off since Fulda seems to be a very aggressive driver.

You grab on tight as it swings back down and bounces off the floor, making your body flop up and down.  The incessant pounding continues for over a minute while she idly pounds her heel into the ground, oblivious to how much discomfort it's causing you and your presence as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it stops you're able to collect your thoughts again.  This is definitely Julie!  You had a class with her last semester, and you often pass each other on your way out of this lecture, stopping to talk each time you do.  She must have been here early hoping to see you, but never would have expected to see you like this - for that matter, while she is a good deal taller than you normally you never expected to be looking up at her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened by a friendly face you run back up the laces, ready to grab on in case her foot kicks up again, until you reach the top.  You wedge yourself in between her shoe's tongue and her ankle, then begin frantically striking the smooth skin - slapping, poking, drawing patterns with your finger, anything you think will get her attention.  The weight on her leg shifts, and you look up to see her ankle lifting.  The important question, though, is does she notice you?</span></div></div>",

Her foot raises slightly when she leans down, her pretty face blocking out the overhead lights.  Her brown eyes search for the source of her irritation, and quickly lock on to you, still struggling against her leg.  You feel a breeze from her gasp, and you brace for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" she whispers, her voice booming despite her efforts to keep quiet.  \"I was looking all over for you!  Here, let me get you out of there.\"  Her face pulls away and her right hand swings in, her fingers wedging under the tongue of her shoe.  In no time she has you secured, and gently pulls you out from inside the top of her shoe.  Slowly she carries you up to her face level and drops you into her other hand's waiting palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's one thing to play around her ankles, but you hadn't anticipated what she'd look like now.  Each of her eyes were now wide enough for you to curl up inside, and you could hop on her nose as if you were riding her face.  If you wanted to you could easily curl up on her cheeks and take a nap, and her mouth, spread wide in a smile that seemed inappropriate considering, is longer than a canoe.  It's impossible not to be awe-struck by your friend's features at this size, and a little intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you though?\" Julie asks, bringing you closer to her mouth.  \"I remember you being short, but not quite like this.\"  She smirks, showing teeth through her enormous lips, and you try to return it without thinking of how easily you'd fit in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you tell her about your day so far - running into Fulda, shrinking during class, then her leaving you on the floor.  \"I'm really glad you found me,\" you say at the end.  \"I was worried it would be someone less... friendly.  But now you can help me get back to my original size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie gives an exaggerated wince, then answers, \"I'd love to help you, and I am definitely going to as soon as I have some idea how.  But this is the semester review, and I kind of have to be here for it.  Being tiny an extra hour won't kill you, will it?\"  Before you can answer she adds, \"Of course not.  So chill on the desk and bask in my radiance for a bit!\"  She lowers her hand to the desk and tilts her palm, allowing you to step off just as the lights dim.  You gaze up at Julie while she stares intently forward, ready to take notes, and wonder how you'll make it through an hour of this, let alone longer.</span></div></div>",

To be honest you have no clue what this course is or what sort of notes she's taking, and at this scale you can't make out more than two or three letters at a time.  There's not even time to read the slides, as you constantly need to stay moving to avoid an accident.  Plus, Julie is much more pleasant to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour of this passes before Julie sets her pencil down, then sets her elbow next to you.  She rests her cheek atop her palm and looks down, more interested in you than the lecture.  Carefully she sets her hand down on the other side of you, then begins rapping her fingers on the desktop.  The pounding becomes irritating fast as you feel a slight jolt every time a fingertip touches down, and a thin strip of white indicates her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts up her hand and you recoil from a grab that never comes.  Instead she sets her fingers down just next to you and begins tapping her index finger over and over, bringing it up and down like a jackhammer.  After several taps she crosses it over your head and starts tapping there, showing no signs of slowing down.  Julie does this several times until you become visibly annoyed by the incessant hammering, and lifts up her finger one more time.  In one powerful stroke she brings it down, knocking you to your back and pinning you under her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're pinned she leans down, putting her lips just above your head.  \"I'm sorry,\" she says, \"you're just too cute like this, and the review is more boring than I thought.\"  She lifts her finger off you and continues, \"Let's play!\"  Then she rests her head on her hand again and waits for you to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get your footing she brings her finger down again, allowing you to just step out of the way.  Julie giggles and swipes with her finger, making you duck just below as the enormous digit passes where you're standing.  She swipes at you several more times, making you dodge until you stumble over and fall onto her middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself up just as Julie rests her chin on the desk before you, a mischievous grin on her face.  Without saying a word she puckers her lips and blows, the stream of wind catching you in the chest.  You're thrown from your feet and carried six inches away, landing on your back and skidding along the paper.  Julie's thunderous giggles fill the air, and when you open your eyes her palm is stretched out above you.  In a single movement she scoops you up into her hand and lightly closes her fist around you, then lifts you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's fingers open allowing you to stand, nearly close enough to grab the tip of her nose.  Her other hand is poised to continue poking you, but just then the lights come back up, signalling the end of the lecture and sparing you from further games.  \"Guess we better get moving then!\" she declares, closing her fingers around you again before she gathers her things to leave the lecture hall.</span></div></div>",

There's nowhere for the heat to vent and barely any light poking through, just small pinpricks on either side.  Still, you realize that inside her hand is the safest place, since you don't fancy a rough ride in her pocket, and you've seen how much stuff inside her purse could slide and crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie does her best to control her gait, moving quickly without swinging you too hard, and you find the motions at the very least relaxing.  Thick walls of flesh muffle any sounds, and you realize that you're essentially blind, deaf and dumb on this voyage, with a heaping dose of uncomfortably hot on top of that.  Still, you trust Julie to be doing the right thing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're subjected to a series of jerking motions as Julie's hand moves back and forth, making you bounce between her palm and fingers, followed by several minutes of no movement at all.  Finally, you think, you've arrived at the first place Julie's gone for help, and soon you might be back to full size, or at least not small enough to fit inside her palm.  You eagerly await finding out where she thought to even begin with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand opens, letting you gently slide down her palm until you land atop a plastic tray.  She pulls her hand away and places it to the side, letting you see the high ceiling and wide open spaces of where she's taken you.  Hey, this is the cafeteria!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie!\" you shout, startling her while picking up her fork.  \"I thought you were taking me to get help!  What are we doing here?\"  Julie looks down at you and blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really have no idea where to start with this,\" she begins, \"this was all so sudden, and it's not like I can go around asking people 'My friend shrank, what do?' without sounding like a crazy person.  Plus I think better with a full stomach, and I'm sure you could use some food, too.  Now c'mon, is another half hour tiny really going to kill you?\"  You grumble indistinctly in response, but realistically you can't make someone several hundred times your size do anything.  Julie doesn't wait for a response and starts digging in.</span></div></div>",

Maybe someone in a biology or particle physics lab?  I know that it'll be hard to explain, but I'm sure that if you show me to them that'll be all the explanation necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll get you to help,\" Julie replies, her huge warm eyes engulfing you.  \"I just... what if they can't help you?  What if no one can?  What if you're stuck like this and whoever I take you to keeps you for experiments?  Wouldn't you rather hang out with me for a bit longer and have a good time, even if you're itty-bitty?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to reply, but before you can Julie slaps you in the chest with a steamed green bean.  \"There, eat up,\" she says, turning back to her food.  \"You may be small but you still need to eat, right?\"  She shovels forkfuls of food several times your size into her mouth while you watch, taking small bites off the bean in your arms.  By now your clothes have absorbed some moisture from the food, and you find that it's much more difficult to chew when the bean would normally be larger than yourself.  Still you make an effort to eat some of it, doing your best not to choke, so that Julie won't be worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half-dozen bites you're not sure you can take any more, and Julie seems to notice that you're done.  She reaches for you and takes it out of your arms, easily wresting it from you since her fingers have ten times the strength as your body, then plucks you up by the collar.  Julie carefully lifts you over part of the tray and gently sets you down, then withdraws her hand, and you find yourself standing next to a mountain of mashed potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little guy, you try to reach the summit before I start on those potatoes,\" Julie says before starting on her entree.  Before you can protest she finishes \"Ready, go!\" and begins attacking her food.  While she messily shoves heap after heap of food into her mouth you attack the dollop of potatoes, but find yourself unable to make any progress.  The potatoes are too mealy and don't provide any support, even for someone who barely weighs an ounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotatoes continue to pile down around you, coming up to your chest after an avalanche.  Before you can free yourself Julie has finished her portion, and turns to where you're practically buried under mashed potatoes, spoon in hand.  When she doesn't see you at the top she looks around for you somewhere in the mess, ready to dig in with her spoon.</span></div></div>",

When her eyes light upon you she smiles, and you remain where you are helplessly, waist-deep in her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at you down there!\" she whispers, more than loud enough for you to hear.  \"Couldn't even be bothered to climb, huh?\"  She scoops out a bite from the potatoes in front of you, holding the spoon above you.  \"Were you just not strong enough or what?\"  Before you can answer she pops the spoon into her mouth, depositing twice as much as what's holding you in place onto her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallows her bite before continuing with her ribbing.  \"If you aren't, that's fine, you were never really all that strong anyway.\"  After a quick pause she sets the spoon down, placing the handle right next to you.  \"Go ahead, try to pick it up,\" she challenges.  \"See if your muscles really are that puny compared to mighty Julie's!\"  If just to get her to move on you decide to give it a shot, bracing yourself as well as you can and lifting with all your might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon remains unmoved for a second, then begins to wobble slightly while you lift.  To your surprise it even begins to leave the ground!  Before it moves noticeably though Julie sets her index finger down on the very tip, rooting it to the ground with a clang.  \"It was a good effort,\" she says to try to console you, \"but your puny muscles can never compare to my Godzilla-like strength.\"  She picks the spoon back up and declares, \"See?  I can lift this, completely effortlessly, with just one hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how long this will go on, still stuck on her tray by a small portion of her lunch.  \"Fear not though,\" she continues.  \"I, the mighty Julie, will protect you from all threats, like a sudden gust of wind or a sink drain!\"  She giggles and you glower slightly, wishing she would just move on.  Julie seems to notice your annoyance and concludes, \"Okay, I'll get you out of there and cleaned off.\"  With two careful fingers she grabs your collar and picks you up out of the small mound, easily breaking the potatoes apart before finding a way to clean you.</span></div></div>",

While you consider this immense reservoir her hand quickly shoots down, dunking you into the water with a swift strike.  You're shocked by suddenly being dipped into the room temperature water and gasp, the little bit of air in your lungs escaping.  Her fingertips remain pinched around your collar, maintaining their iron grip while you soak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potatoes stuck to you break off and partially dissolve into the clear water, rendering it cloudy with some debris.  For good measure Julie shakes you off, swirling you within her drink to throw off the last small bits of food and get you exceptionally clean.  Then, just as spontaneously as she dropped you in, she pulls you back out, simply retracting her fingers until you're no longer submersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater pours off you back into the cup, and you're absolutely soaked from head to toe.  \"Oh, this won't do either!\" Julie laments upon seeing how soaked you are.  \"Give me a sec, I'll get you dried off.\"  She gives you a quick twist to cast off excess liquid, then lowers you down to an open, flat area of her tray and sets you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there in a growing puddle of water until Julie's fingers return, bringing a stark white napkin to lay over you.  The coarse paper lands around you like a parachute and you feel Julie's fingers tapping against the plastic searching for you, the thumping getting louder and vibrations getting stronger as she zeroes in.  Finally she hits her mark, the soft padding of her fingertip setting down on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie softly taps the napkin over the body, gradually dabbing you dry.  The warmth from her fingertip is comforting, especially after that sudden dip, and her delicate manner soothes your nerves like a full body massage.  When the napkin over you is saturated she slides it up an inch and starts again, dabbing away moisture until there's nothing left to dab out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your delicate state Julie is careful not to press too hard, using just the right amount of force to press the paper onto you.  Her numerous finger taps, dozens per section, put you into a relaxed state, and you barely even notice when they stop.  For her part when you're fully dry Julie simply rubs you up and down playfully through the napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she tears away the napkin and the reality of what was happening sets in.  An enormous fingertip the size of your entire torso looms above you, connected to a finger nearly three times your height on a hand as wide as a decently sized yard.  Off to the side you see Julie's head practically laying on the table, her dark eyes filled with mirth as she idly rubs away.  With one last stroke she ruffles your hair then pulls her hand away, removing the most concerning thing you've seen in some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry about that,\" Julie says with a blush, \"but now you're all cleaned up!  I guess now that you won't make a mess I can go ahead and take you to get help, huh?\"  She bashfully tilts her head and waits for you to make a suggestion.</span></div></div>",

Seeing her up this close, where she fills every aspect of your view and you can spot every pore, makes you start to reconsider your decision, but you stay the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" she whispers in disbelief.  The breath hissing from her lips hits you while it's still warm, helping you get over the chills from being suddenly dipped in a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to take your time getting me some help, it's okay,\" you explain.  You reach up and push on her nose, the cartilage giving a bit to your hand while her head remains totally unmoved.  She narrows her eyes down at you and spends a moment thinking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I get it,\" Julie starts.  \"Do you like being small or something?  I mean you were before but... not like this.\"  To demonstrate she pulls her head away and places a fingertip on you so that it covers you from the neck down.  Without any pressure you only feel the warmth, and you don't even really feel afraid.  \"What if you keep, um, shrinking?  You might end up, uh, ant-sized, or even smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once you're glad you're this small - she can't see you blushing.  \"I don't mind being small with you!  I don't feel like you'll hurt me, and we've been having fun so far, right?  If I get really teensy, like 'need a magnifying glass to see me' small, then I'll start worrying, but for now, I don't see the harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess,\" Julie relents, moving her thumb to your side.  She pinches them together around your chest and picks you up, then holds you in front of her eyes.  \"But only because you're so cute.  We'll talk about this later, though.\"  She stands up to bus her tray and lowers you down to chest level, hoping to avoid drawing too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait!\" you shout.  \"Where are you gonna put me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking down Julie replies, \"In my hand, duh.

You wouldn't even have noticed you were going down the stairs were it not for your college's name across her chest bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shove Julie forces the door open, and the two of you emerge into a bright late Spring day.  You had forgotten how nice it was outside before you went into that lecture, but you also never expected to see it again.  Julie breathes in deep, savoring the fresh air, and you do the same.  Her inhalation kicks up some pollen spores, now about the size of golf balls to you, and you realize one benefit of being this small is you won't have to deal with allergies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looks around to make sure no one's paying attention to her, then asks, \"Are you doing okay down there?  I'm not holding you too tight or hurting you, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" you say, your eyes still focusing on the bouncing ahead of them.  Another benefit of being small, and while it may feel rude to stare it's better than looking down.  \"Wouldn't it be better to put me on your shoulder though, so that you have a free hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd have a free hand,\" she says, continuing straight on her course.  \"I could use it to reach for you when you fall off after someone bumps into me.  Maybe I'd catch you, maybe you'd land in the middle of this very busy sidewalk.\"  Julie widens her eyes in feign horror.  \"Besides, I'd rather keep you where you are.  If you were anywhere else I wouldn't be able to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure whether that last statement should be worrying, but you choose not to dwell on it.  Instead you nestle yourself in comfortably between her fingers, and find some relaxation between the soft padding of the tips.  The gentle swaying and timid shakes from her walking gradually put your mind at ease, and you find that you don't really mind this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie suddenly stops, and the jolt from her halt knocks you out of your relaxed state.  You glance up and see that Julie is no longer looking at you; rather, she's looking off to the side and past you.</span></div></div>",

You're treated to a brief ride while her hand darts back and forth punching in the keys, getting thrown back and forth between her palm and fingers, until the door lets out a loud click.  Julie's fingers tighten around you as she pulls the door open, then they lighten again while she waits for the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time you feel the gentle sway of movement is when she exits and heads towards her apartment door.  You hear the key roar when it enters the lock followed by the click of the tumblers, and in just one more moment you're inside.  Her door slams with a great boom followed by the clatter  of her bag on the ground, then the blood rushes away from your head while she lifts her hand up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opens her fingers, allowing you to see more than then inside of her hand for the first time in what felt like half an hour.  Immediately in front of you is her nose, which quickly scrunches up while she narrows her eyes.  She poises her other hand to the side, one finger extended, while you stand transfixed by how large every part of her is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie!\" she booms, poking you with a finger firmly enough to knock you over.  \"Glad to see you made the trip in one piece!\"  Julie begins lowering her hand to a counter top below, allowing you to see ever more of her as her face grows increasingly distant.  After half a minute of very gentle descent her hand sets down flatly, and you step off her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie places both her palms on the counter so that they flank you on each side and sticks out her butt, allowing her to lean down towards you.  When her face is about a foot above you she stops and says, \"So, we're alone in my apartment.  Is it as magnificent as you always imagined?\"  You look around, and aside from Julie it looks very similar to your own apartment, save for the shelves of manga and rack of video game consoles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I dig it,\" you reply nonchalantly.  Honestly you had sometimes wondered what her place is like, and you're glad to find out it's a lot like yours, just cleaner and with different furniture.  \"Though the most impressive thing about it is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop,\" Julie replies, feigning humility.  \"There'll be plenty of time for that later.  We're gonna have so much fun!\"  She pauses, tilts her head, and takes in a deep breath before continuing.</span></div></div>",

She carefully lowers her thumb and forefinger down, pinching you up between them, and picks you up off the counter.  Julie quickly lifts you up to her eye, close enough for you to touch it were your arms not pinned down to your side, and asks, \"You want to be in the shadow of your mighty, gigantic protector, right?\"  You play along and nod your head, and Julie moves you so she isn't tickling you wish her eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly Julie takes you to her room, grinning the whole time while she watches you constantly adjusting under her grip.  She pauses in the doorway to her bedroom to slip out of her running shoes, then reaches onto a shelf to grab a book thicker than you are tall, all without disturbing you.  When she's situated Julie plops down on the bed with an enormous crash and springs squeaking under her weight, and your organs feel as if they're about to spill out of your feet while Julie harmlessly bounces up and down on her mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie lowers you until your feet touch down upon the thick patchwork quilt and lets go, freeing her hand to hold the book she's studying.  \"If you want to go look around, that's okay,\" Julie suggests, opening the book.  You look up at her chin directly above you and she continues, \"This probably isn't going to be the most exciting time.\"  Her eyes scan the tower of text, marked through with yellow highlighter every so often.  As you're becoming accustomed to, she's probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out from under Julie's nose and walk toward her chest.  She has her forearms running along the mattress forming a solid barrier, with her body propped up on her elbows.  While you walk under her armpit you marvel at how immense everything seems to you now, and you hope Julie remains as protective as she's been letting on.  With some effort you could climb up onto her shoulders, and in the distance you can see her socked feet idly pumping back and forth in the air while she reads, both tantalizing targets for your curiosity.</span></div></div>",

You move out from beneath her armpit, trying to get your balance on the soft surface of her mattress, and start walking down her side.  Her white sheets become looser the further away from her elbows you get, and you find yourself stepping higher to clear the minute wrinkles on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay close to the living terrain while you progress, the chill of her shadow offsetting the warmth radiating from her body.  The mattress dips down from her weight when you get close to where the bottom of her ribs rest on it, creating a steep incline.  Your foot catches on some loose threading in the sheets and you find yourself stumbling the rest of the way, barely able to keep your balance until you crash into Julie's side.  Through her shirt you can feel her firm abs, and she gently rocks back and forth as her legs continue to kick the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you stabilize yourself you resume walking down the length of her body, leaning against her for additional support.  The creases in the sheets from Julie's mass create waist-high obstacles you have to step over, pressing up against her to avoid losing your balance again.  Her body slowly raises and lowers with the rhythm of her breathing, apparently showing you no mind while you trek through her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living terrain beside you dips sharply as you get closer toward your goal, then quickly rises again to form her round butt.  In only a few more minutes of carefully traversing her bed you reach the bottom of her shorts, not much further down her leg than the bottom of her buttocks.  Seeing this as your last opportunity to get up you seize what loose material there is on her shorts and hoist yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of hard climbing you crest her thigh and stand there triumphant.  Behind you her butt slopes upward, and in front of you her bare thighs stretch to her knee, where her shin rises up like a tower.  Julie continues idly kicks her legs back and forth, bringing her feet to rest on her pillow with a muffled crash for a brief second before they shoot back into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a tentative step forward onto the exposed skin and let out a breath you didn't know you were holding when your foot sinks in without incident.  After a few more steps however Julie begins to shudder, and you realize that your cautious strides are tickling her.  Julie's shin races toward you, her calf stopping mere inches from your head when her toned muscles are compressed enough that it can not descend any more.  If you had been further down you would have been caught in the squeeze.  It occurs that this might not be the wisest path, and Julie may be too engrossed in her reading to pay you any mind right now.</span></div></div>",

You take a couple cautious steps forward, your tiny feet making small dimples in her skin as you progress.  Standing close, you reach out and push on her calf muscle, and your hands make barely perceptible indentations on her smooth skin.  As though she's answering a challenge Julie pulls her leg in further, driving you back up her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Julie flings her leg forward, catapulting it away from you as she explosively releases the tension built up in her knee.  Julie's foot slams into the pillow with a thud, and you're knocked on your back from the unexpected shock running up her leg.  In the corner of your vision you see her black ponytail briefly flip to the side when she peeks over her shoulder at you, then she turns back to her reading with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad that you haven't been forgotten you push yourself back to your feet and look down the leg ahead of you.  Without deliberating too long you begin jogging down the middle of Julie's leg, not letting your feet sink too deeply into the supple skin acting as your ground.  You quickly reached the well-creased skin on the back of her knee and pass over it, finding easy traction in the wrinkles, to reach the gentle slope of her calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you're over halfway there fills you with determination, and you embark on the next leg of your journey.  You lean forward while you ascend the toned muscle to keep yourself balanced, and the firm surface provides you with a swift journey.  Before long you crest the top of her muscle and look down the remaining slope to her foot laid out as though it is eagerly awaiting you.  Without hesitating you begin running down the slope, eager to reach your goal at the bottom of Julie's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour downhill run is very quick, but before you can begin ascending Julie's Achilles tendon something blocks your path.  An enormous white wall plops down in front of you and you crash into the cotton surface, stopped cold by the foot within it.  A quiet giggle reaches your ears while you are pushed aside so Julie can orient her foot along the length of her leg.  The enormous mound of her big toe wiggles up and down inside the sock while she scratches her ankle, and you patiently wait, teetering on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like minutes Julie moves her foot away, clearing the path for you once again.  Eagerly you clamber up her ankle, using the creases over her tendon for handholds, until you reach her stark white sock.  Climbing it like a net you ascend the curvature of her heel until you're standing upright again.  Quickly you survey the land before you: Julie's socked foot stretches dozens of feet before you, pressed deeply into the light blue pillow beneath her.  Before you can fully take it in however Julie's foot begins to move, and you crouch down to take action.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The plush field of cotton beneath you begins to stir and you freeze dead in your tracks. Far ahead at the edge of the plateau you see the bundle of toes scrunch together and rise up, followed by your body beginning to feel much heavier. The powerful leg muscles launch the foot up off the pillow for yet another voyage through the heavens, the force of the acceleration bringing you down to your hands and knees. Your feeble arms are just barely strong enough to keep your upper body elevated and prevent your face from being smothered in the soft, damp ground beneath you. Before you even really get a chance to consider whether or not you could survive a fifty-foot drop to a soft round butt (or whether it would be worth it anyways) the ascent comes to a halt, much sooner than you were expecting. With the ability to move freely once again returned to you, you look ahead to see the downwards slope leading to the toes, but are instead greeted by a wall of off-white just a couple of feet before your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning your neck back, you instead look <i>up</i> the great wall, now noticing that it's bespeckled with pieces of lint and dirt that would likely be imperceptible to a normal-sized person. You also realize that the dark sole of the sock is a bit dirtier than you initially thought, made evident only by the area covering the arch which is a shade lighter than the rest from not touching the floor with as much pressure. Finally your eyes are drawn upwards to the group of toes crowning the monolithic appendage, wriggling gleefully behind their white veil every so often as if to laugh at the tiny being prostrated before them. When you hear <i>actual</i> laughter reverberate around you like thunder, it takes you a moment to realize that you haven't gone completely insane yet before turning around to face the source of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar off in the distance you spy Julie's magnificent face now resting about level with your tiny body, half turned to look at you with mirth in her one visible eye and mouth turned up in a toothy smile as her chin rests on her palm, her fingers idly twirling a pen. The sight before you is breathtaking. You look down at the vast valley below you, down the thick pillar of her leg and follow her thigh over her hilly buttocks and up her shapely back, finding the long ponytail leading up to the peak of her head, just above where her gorgeous face is waiting for you. It makes you think of an enormous monument carved out of a mountain in propitiation to an ancient, benevolent deity. Before you get a chance to contemplate the image of tiny tribesman armed with chisels and hammers rappelling down the side of her immaculate face however, her eyes shut tight and her incandescent smile grows ever larger as she brings it down into her fist, a series of trembles rumbling through her body and knocking you down onto your back. At this, you dig your hands and feet underneath the ropes of the thick sock beneath you, bracing yourself to weather the series of small earthquakes that you're apparently responsible for. The fact that her good-spirited giggling is more violent and dangerous than any actual earthquake you've ever had to sit through makes you well aware that the sight before you is more similar to an actual goddess than a mere rendition of one. It also makes you really hope you get back to your normal size before you get to experience a real earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like close to a minute, she raises her head back up to look at you, the last of her laughter trailing off as her eye locks on to your minuscule form. Apparently she found the sight of what appeared to be her tiny friend worshiping her toes to be pretty funny as well. Certainly not what she was expecting at the very least, you're sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to let you down so I can go to the bathroom little guy, and I'm pretty sure you don't wanna be laying there when I stand up\" she bellowed towards you, the beaming smile on her face never so much as weakening. \"I promise you can get back to whatever it is you're trying to do there when I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fair enough,</i> you think. As much as you like standing up here on top of her foot, you imagine it wouldn't be quite as pleasant underneath it. You take in a deep breath and cup your hands around your mouth. \"Okay!\" you shout as loud as you can. \"Just lower me down and I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll only be just a second,\" she boomed back at you, her tremendous voice effortlessly cutting you off mid-sentence as she turned to set her pen down on the book. \"I laughed so hard I'm about to piss my pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How ladylike,</i> you think to yourself, a grin spreading across your face. You were slightly irked at being cut off, but you suppose she probably can't hear your tiny voice all the way down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to do anything else, you feel weightlessness as the foot begins its descent, with the angle shifting ever so slightly on the way down. By the time her toes reach the mattress, it's almost a straight vertical drop. She then presses the pads of her toes down to the mattress and brings her heel down further, and you feel gravity begin to work it's magic once again. You release the ropes on both sides of you and begin to plummet, concentrating on how to land without spraining anything. It wasn't that far down to her soft pillow, but even a five-foot drop could mess up an ankle pretty badly if you don't land right. Granted, that was in a worst-case scenario, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the stars from your eyes and your vision returns as you wonder what the hell just happened. You knew you still had quite a ways to go before hitting the pillow, and you were also pretty sure pillows aren't usually this hard. You look forward and the first thing you see before you is what appears to be the socked wall of Julie's foot. That must be what just hit you like you owe it money, you reason. The next thing you notice is that pain isn't the only thing you feel in your face. All of the blood is rushing to your head and there's also an extremely uncomfortable amount of pressure around your ankle. Looking up to the source of the pain, you see that you are dangling upside-down from your left leg, your ankle caught in the thick tangled threads of Julie's sock like a rabbit in a snare trap. Instantly your blood turns to ice and dread rises in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing into action, you thrash your leg in an attempt to shake yourself free, though you think that if anything all that did was make matters worse. Moving onto your next plan, you attempt to bring your upper body up primarily with your abdominal muscles to reach the knot and untie it yourself. Then you remember that you don't have any abdominal muscles and curse under your breath, realizing it's a lot harder than it looks even though it already looked pretty damn hard. You begin to panic even more as you start feeling light-headed and try to think of another idea. All you can do is look down at the soft, inviting pillow just out of reach below you while your body twirls slightly as it dangles. You're not sure if it was because of all the extra blood in your head, but it's not long before you come up with your next plan and start rhythmically swinging your body back and forth. Once you start getting high enough, you use the added momentum combined with one last burst of strength and a vigorous roar to reach up and grasp onto your pant leg. You begin pulling yourself up one handhold at a time, ignoring the tremendous pain in the many places on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it seems like you might be able to get yourself free from this predicament before things get ugly, your body is whipped back and forth violently and you're sent smashing into the rough flesh hidden beneath the deceptively soft fabric a few more times before returning to your starting position, albeit with the thread hanging down a bit further than it did before. It seems Julie gave her heel a slight (to her) wiggle, no doubt attempting to make sure you landed safely on the pillow, ironically enough. Overwhelmed with despair and almost completely spent of energy, you have little choice left to you other than to scream Julie's name as loud as you can and pound against the socked behemoth in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooh,</i> I better hurry!\" is your response as the foot rises back up to a vertical position and you feel yourself pressed into the cotton wall again. \"Behave yourself while I'm gone\" she booms down towards her pillow playfully, though with a sense of urgency apparent in her voice. Just as you're about to get ready for another round of impotent flailing and screaming, you feel the foot go sideways, right before rocketing towards the edge of the bed with enough G-forces to knock even the most experienced of ace pilots out cold. Thankfully it stops shortly after if begins, just before you lose consciousness and/or that green bean you had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was nothing new at this point, no amount of bracing could prepare you for the impact into her brick wall of a heel. Retaining just enough consciousness to realize you have no time to hang around dazed and contused, you ignore your possible concussion and quickly bring yourself back to your senses, only to be greeted by the sight of the carpeted floor hundreds of feet below you. Spitting out a baseball-sized piece of lint you realized forced its way into your mouth when you tried to scream, you quickly get to work on thinking of a new plan. Surely she must have just felt you slam into her foot with the force of a speeding truck though, right? God knows <i>you</i> did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer your question, the feet lowered themselves down to the floor, the toes coming to rest on the carpet as Julie aligned herself and scooted her butt forward. <i>This girl must either have some really thick socks or a really thick head</i>, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you do, you better do it quickly!</span></div></div>",

You take a couple steps forward and Julie's leg swings away from you and back down, her foot slamming into the pillow with a suppressed bang.  Momentarily you freeze while the impact's shock runs up her leg, shaking you, before the force abates.  This looks like as good a sign as any, you think, and press onward towards her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour progress down her thigh is swift, since your feet create small dimples in her skin to provide extra stability.  In only a minute you reach her knee, almost halfway to your goal, and you pause to survey the broad plain between her tendons before trudging up the slight hill of her calf.  From what you can tell Julie remains oblivious to your trek, and you appreciate the hands-off approach she has to you crawling around on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you step off to the last leg of your journey deep creases suddenly appear across the back of her knee.  One of your feet gets trapped between the skin forming one, and no matter how hard you try your shrunken body does not have the strength to get free.  Julie's leg rises up like a behemoth, towering over you like a skyscraper.  You look up in awe at it as you're nudged backward, kept upright only by your trapped foot, barely able to see her socked foot swinging back and forth past her calf dominating your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie begins waving her leg forward and back, pushing you away each time it contacts you.  After a few seconds of you watching in dread her leg topples over toward you, and you raise your hands in a futile effort to slow or stop it.  Effortlessly the back of Julie's knee folds over you, pinning you into the soft flesh while you struggle to move.  When her leg can go no further it stops with a jerk, and the pressure becomes too much to take.  Your body gets squished in the area behind Julie's kneecap, the sound of your bones being crushed barely loud enough to escape the fleshy prison around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Julie finally puts her leg back down she feels your blood trickling down the side of her leg.  Intrigued at the feeling she looks back, easily spotting the red smear of your corpse against her alabaster skin.  \"I... I killed him!\" she cries, barely holding back tears.  \"Oh my God I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to!\"  Her voice quivers, and for a long time she can do nothing but stare at the spot on her leg where she squashed you, knowing that no matter how sorry she is she still killed you.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes light up with recognition, and you wave your arms as much as you can to make sure she doesn't miss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you down there, cutie!\" she says, moving her spoon behind you.  \"Why, I could just gobble you up!\"  Your eyes widen and she sweeps the spoon forward, kicking your legs up and knocking you back into the basin.  She hurriedly lifts it up to mouth level and holds it in front of her, looking at you trapped under the potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she continues while you struggle to get free, \"you definitely look good enough to eat.\"  With what feels like hundreds of pounds lying atop you, any progress you make will be agonizingly slow - rather, not fast enough, and Julie struck just right so that your head and arms are poking out.  You're able to watch while she draws you closer to her, doing your damnedest to get free but unable to make any real progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're about to pass under her nose Julie parts her lips, revealing a row of enormous, square white teeth waiting for you.  Then suddenly you're pulled away and Julie bursts out laughing, her head facing down so that in front of you is a wall of straight black hair gathered in a ponytail that's cascading back down.  The spoon shakes from Julie's laughter, and you're jostled back and forth while she tries to regain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God you really thought I was going to do it!\" she says when she can regain some composure.  \"You're so credulous!  I'm not going to hurt you, little guy, I'm trying to keep you safe.  Now let's get you out of there and back on your feet.\"  With one finger she scoops you out from the spoon, separating you from the bite of potatoes she had prepared, and eases you back onto the tray.  \"Boy, do you look ridiculous covered in-\"  Before Julie can finish the sentence she's wracked with laughter again, and has to take deep breaths to regain her composure.</span></div></div>",

It seems like the more you fight to get out the more it tumbles down onto you, burying you under a pile of warm starch.  The weight presses down on you and compacts itself, forming a solid layer around you not riddled by fragmentation like it had previously been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt what might be the worst possible time you feel cold metal behind you and your feet are knocked out from under you, tipping you backwards into a curved surface.  There's a thick sheath of potato around you, sealing you into the spoon's reservoir forming a warm, fluffy white tomb.  You claw at the roof, hoping to get out and grab Julie's attention before she shoves you in her mouth.  Handfuls of potato are thrown to the side while you frantically dig upward until you finally break the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if you weren't still thoroughly trapped you'd have a chance, but you free yourself too late.  Directly above you is Julie's rounded nose, and in front you see her lips parted open just wide enough to allow the spoon entrance.  You thrash to escape, but in less than a second you've been carried through her lips into her mouth.  Julie closes her lips, cutting off all light, and pulls the spoon out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her spoon hits her lips you're dragged off, along with the bite you were carried in with.  Saliva separates you from the potatoes, allowing you one last moment of freedom.  It's not enough to do anything though.  Julie flips her tongue up and saliva rushes through her mouth, driving you back onto her gullet.  Without thinking she relaxes her muscles, dropping you down into her esophagus and then to her stomach.  It's a one way trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find you, Julie hopes you got the help you were looking for and stayed safe.</span></div></div>",

You begin sweating around the same time she does, but with no breeze coming in it only contributes to the oppressive environment.  With each second that goes by the air around you gets hotter, drying your throat each time you inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie seems to take note of her palm sweating and loosens her fingers, allowing her hand to vent much better than previously.  Her arms swing less intensely to compensate, now moving back and forth about as much as a porch swing.  You find this much more preferable to before, and once the air around you cools down you're able to breathe normally again, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Julie steps outside you're able to get a much better view of the world around you, the sun providing much more light than the cheap fluorescents indoors.  Through the gaps she's opened on either side you see fresh green grass and clean sidewalks below, and to the side you see Julie's thigh every time you rush past it.  You do what you can to stay in the middle of her palm, not wanting to risk being broken against any of those surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie steps onto the grass and heads for a tree, the softer ground making for a much smoother ride.  When she reaches it she sets down her bag and leans against the trunk, then slides down until she's sitting on the ground.  She sets you atop her knee and opens her hand, judging you out onto her leg, and reaches back into her bag.  Once she retrieves whatever she was looking for she sets it on the ground beside her and turns back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Julie?\" you say, looking up at the giantess's face.  \"Are we meeting someone here who can help me?\"  Julie responds by plucking you up between her fingers and holding you aloft above her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax,\" she answers sweetly.  \"You've already been tiny for a bit, what's being tiny for one afternoon going to hurt?\"  She drops you right where her legs meet, and you land between her thighs.  You slide down the smooth skin, lifting up your legs when you get to her shorts.  Your descent continues until you're stopped just in front of her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie peers over her breasts to spot you, and you look up at her in minor indignation.  Her hand quickly picks you back up and returns you back to the top of the slope, ready to drop you again.  \"I'm worried about accidents,\" you say.  \"A lot more stuff can hurt me now, and I'm not sure if my condition's stable yet, I might still-\"  You're interrupted when Julie lets go again, sending you down the slide of her thighs again.  At least it's a fun ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much!\" she says, pinching you between her fingers again.  \"You may be tiny and weak, but I'm big and strong!  I can keep you safe from a bunch of stuff, and you can be good company.\"  Julie carries you back up to her knees, ready to drop you again.  She's clearly enjoying herself, and her smile is infectious - you can't help but smile back up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Julie can send you down the slide again a silhouette blocks the light from reaching you too, the figure drawing her attention for a moment.  You turn your head, barely able to see past her finger, to see who the figure is, right when they speak.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes dart down to a pair of Converse firmly planted on the ground about shoulder width apart, then up to a pair of black shorts rolled up to the top of her powerful thighs.  You continue looking up, passing her arms crossed over her ample chest, to a pile of red hair braided in the back.  Oh no.  Fulda's found you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Julie asks, scooping you off her knee with a hand.  She lowers you down to the ground, her soft palm cushioning your descent, before continuing.  \"Who are you, and what do you think I stole from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda scoffs.  \"Who I am doesn't matter, but if you don't give me back that thing in your hand you're going to get to know me very well.\"  Julie looks at her empty hand in confusion, then glances at you in her other hand.  Her eyes widen, and her mouth goes wide in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a thing, he's my friend!\" Julie shouts up at Fulda, moving you into her lap.  You feel queasy as you're quickly yanked inward, but you feel safer held against Julie's body.  Suddenly she stands, causing you to go light-headed and feel as though your stomach drops to your feet.  \"You're that monster who shrank him, aren't you!  And then you left him all alone on the floor!  You aren't getting him back, he could have died and you clearly don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie takes a step forward until she's only a few inches from Fulda and looks up to meet her eyes.  You aren't sure what Julie is trying to accomplish: the top of her head barely even reaches Fulda's clavicle, and while she is in decent shape Fulda is a powerhouse.  The two continue their stare down, Julie trying to intimidate Fulda despite being towered over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to ask again,\" Fulda says, glowering down at Julie while you peek out from inside Julie's hand.  \"Give it back, or I'll take it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want him, you'll have to go through me,\" Julie replies, doing her best to stand up against the behemoth before her.  Fulda grins, and your perspective starts to change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The change is gradual at first.  Julie's hand tightens around you, gripping you more firmly than she previously had been, making you uncomfortable.  In excitement you peek out from between her fingers, hoping that for some reason you're being made larger, but your heart sinks when you see the reality.  Even from your perspective against her belly you see she comes up to Fulda's chest at best, and you are able to track your descent past the button at the top of Fulda's shorts.  For her part Julie tries to maintain a stoic demeanor, though she must notice she's half a foot shorter than she was a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break through Julie's close-fingered grip, making her simply wrap her fingers under your arms, as you continue to descend toward Fulda's knees.  Julie's resolve finally fails and she runs, holding you tightly against her chest as she breaks into a sprint.  Fulda anticipated her escape attempt and quickly sidesteps into her path, causing your dwindling savior to run harmlessly face-first into her stomach.  Julie maintains her grip on you as you're thrown forward into Fulda's thigh, then she starts to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's hand is now too small to hold you on its own when you reach Fulda's knees, and she adjusts so that you're protectively cradled in her arms.  \"Don't think you can get out of this,\" Fulda says, taking a powerful step forward.  With a cry Julie backs up into the tree, shaking you in her arms.  \"You're trapped, and now you both are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you gets harder for Julie the smaller she gets until she decides to set you down on the ground.  You look up at your friend and see that she still towers over you, with you only reaching halfway up her knee, but know that it won't last much longer.  Comparatively she comes up to just about Fulda's ankle, and she's rapidly shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go and take me!\" Julie pleads when you can come up to her knees.  \"You didn't even want him before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda smirks down, and Julie's waist reaches your eye level.  You look up and see tears streaming down your friend's face.  \"Not a chance!\" Fulda booms.  \"Do you have any idea how much fun I'm going to have with the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie finally stops shrinking, putting you eye to chin just like you used to be at normal size.  \"I'm sorry,\" she says through tears, wrapping you in a tight hug.  \"I said I would keep you safe, and I didn't.\"  You hug her back, pulling the two of you closer together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" you reassure her, resting your chin on her shoulder.  \"I know you did your best.  Now we're just in this together, and we have to work together if we're going to survive.\"  The two of you continue embracing silently, until the rumble of Fulda clearing her throat draws your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Julie huddle close and turn yourselves toward Fulda, her massive Converse thudding loudly as she taps it on the earth.  The two of you look up at her while she breaks into malicious laughter, and Julie clings tighter to you.  \"Wow.  You're both pathetic, you know.  I hope that was worth it, girl.  I hope you felt big and strong... because you're never going to feel big again.\"</span></div></div>",

Then, slowly, Julie starts to rise against Fulda, the top of her head becoming level with her chin after a few seconds.  You look out and see the top of Fulda's shorts is now several inches below where you are being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think Julie is getting larger, possibly as a result of Fulda trying to even the playing field, but Julie's grip is just as loose around you as it was before.  Fulda must have noticed what is happening and takes a step forward, bumping her chest against Julie's and forcing her to take a step back.  Julie's resolve remains firm however, and soon the two are eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing you bitch?\" Fulda shouts when the bottom of her breasts are level with the hand you are being held in.  Julie's taller than her now!  \"And <i>how</i> are you doing it?  You're too short for this to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel so good, does it?\" Julie asks, almost a full head taller than Fulda by this point.  \"You shrank my friend, and now I'm shrinking you down to his size.  Fair's fair.\"  Incensed, Fulda reaches for you in Julie's hand, but your savior swiftly moves you behind her back, the sudden acceleration throwing you hard into her palm and making your insides lurch.  Fulda lunges for you again but Julie simply holds you up beyond her reach, the change of direction throwing your stomach around yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie pushes Fulda while she's off-balance, knocking her into the tree, and quickly turns to block her escape.  Her grip around you shifts, two fingers pinching you firmly yet safely under your arms, allowing you to look down at Fulda, now level with Julie's chest.  \"This is bullshit!\" she protests, vainly hopping up in an attempt to grab you.  \"I shrunk him, he's mine, you just picked him up off the floor like a piece of trash!\"  Fulda diminishes toward Julie's waist, and adds, \"The trash that he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I would protect him,\" Julie replies sternly, looking down at the furious ex-titaness, \"and that's just what I'm doing.  He's not mine, but it's my duty to keep him safe.  Got it?\"  You look down with bemusement as Fulda shrinks past Julie's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda screams, then shouts, \"This is impossible!  I shrink people, no one shrinks me!  I'd rather die than be small!\"  She lashes out and punches Julie in the thigh, accomplishing nothing as her first bounces harmlessly off Julie's skin.  In retaliation Julie trikes forward with a knee, connecting with Fulda's head and tossing her back into the tree.  Julie steps forward again to corral Fulda, and the realization of just how small she is shows on her face when she looks up from Julie's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda's protests continue, her yelling getting more incoherent the smaller she gets.  When she reaches Julie's ankles Fulda begins impotently pounding on Julie's running shoes with her hands while Julie smiles.  Finally Fulda stops shrinking, and all you can see of her from your vantage point is the small white spot of her tank top contrasted against the ground next to Julie's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie slowly crouches down over Fulda and lowers you down to her chest, allowing a good view of Fulda on the ground.  She looks absolutely furious but her screaming has abated for now, realizing that she would go hoarse before too long.  With a quick swipe of her free hand Julie scoops Fulda up, clasping her fingers around Fulda's body so that only her head pokes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie lifts Fulda up until she's directly across from you, holding the two of you as if she's playing with dolls.  It's strange for you to see Fulda entirely within someone's hand, but you admit she does deserve it.  Fulda struggles fruitlessly inside Julie's hand, even her powerfully-developed muscles unable to budge the fingers of someone so much larger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize to him.\"  Fulda looks quizzically up at Julie as if she had just told her the sun is blue.  \"If you hadn't made him tiny I wouldn't have had to do this, you know.  So say you're sorry and mean it.\"  She bristles under the demands from the enormous Julie, and looks as though she's about to pop a blood vessel in her eye.</span></div></div>",

Though her face is little more than a silhouette you can make out the tall, skinny figure and her off-beat yet fashionable clothing ensemble.  There's no way this is anyone but Lana!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was me,\" Julie says, snapping your attention back to the woman still holding you in her hand.  \"He mentioned working with you on some sort of size changing project a few times, and the last he mentioned it, it sounded like you were almost ready.  I figured if anyone would be able to help it's you.\"  She looks down and blushes before finishing.  \"I'm... honestly surprised you showed up.  It must sound crazy.\"  Julie sets you down atop her knee and moves her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana walks up and stands at Julie's feet to bring herself into the light then squats down, putting her face directly above you.  You turn around again to look at her pale face, and find yourself the focus of her dark blue eyes.  \"He always had a penchant for getting into trouble,\" Lana says, \"just never anything quite like this.  You came to the right person though, I tested it this morning and it works fine.  And now he has a good excuse for missing the test.\"  She rests a hand beneath Julie's knee and cups another one behind you.  \"May I?\" she asks, and Julie nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently Lana brushes you off Julie's knee and onto her fingers, where you slowly roll down to rest in the middle of her open palm.  She looks you over with her humongous eyes while you're stuck in her hand, and she prods you with a finger a couple times, shoving you back and forth.  \"I just- how did this happen?\" she asks.  \"As far as I know we're the only ones working on something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said some giant redhead shrank him during class,\" Julie explains while Lana stands, the force pinning you in her palm.  \"We're not sure how she did it, but well, look.  He's small.  Clearly she did.\"  Julie stands so that she can look at you in Lana's hand, and it's difficult not to feel overwhelmed with two giantesses giving you their undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter, I should be able to help him,\" Lana says, still looking down at you.  You look between the two women, and she continues, \"Thanks for bringing him to me.  We know it can make things smaller, and while it should be able to do the reverse - that is, if he wired it correctly,\" she gives you a quick wink, \"it'll be a flawless test of the system.  I'll let you know how it goes.\"  Lana turns to leave, but Julie places a hand on her shoulder to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'd like to go with you.  I said I'd protect him while he was small, and I intend to see that through.  I want to see him get better first hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if he's comf-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she can come,\" you interrupt, your tiny voice somehow cutting off Lana's.  She's the one who got me help, even though she acted like she didn't.\"  Julie stifles a giggle, and you continue.  \"This is as much hers as it is ours now.  She deserves to be there.\"  Lana looks at you pensively, her car-sized lips canting to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should get moving then,\" Lana declares, and curls her fingers around you, holding you firmly in her fist.  You make yourself cozy against her palm for the several minutes you'll be walking, and the two women set off to Lana's lab with you in hand.</span></div></div>",

The room looks just as you had left it yesterday with one exception: on a table near the front wall there's a small person in a transparent plastic cage who runs to look when you enter the room.  It looks like the test fire this morning was an unqualified success, and the size gun looks ready to fire again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana wastes no time in getting down to business, walking over to the subject area and setting you down in the middle of the blue X.  She squats down, her bony knees poking out over your spot, and picks up a pencil to mark your height.  One inch, just as you thought, significantly below the next lowest mark which presumably belongs to the person from this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can stand you ask, \"Lana, who is that person?\"  You gesture to the caged man on the table, still following Lana as she walks through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some freshman who needed money,\" Lana answers, lowering a hand down to the floor.  She ruffles your hair with a finger and says, \"He signed all the releases, and if this works we'll know that he'll be back to normal size on Tuesday!  Don't worry about it.\"  Lana stands up and turns away, the light clicking of her heels translated into deep thuds for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana quickly gets to work on the size gun, recalibrating it to work in a different mode with a different target.  She types on her laptop for several minutes and flicks several switches before the optics panel flips out and allows her to start searching for a target.  Deftly Lana pinpoints you and the gun rotates down to center you in its beam.  \"Be sure to stay behind me,\" she tells Julie.  \"The last thing we need is you becoming gigantic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, people being gigantic, how terrifying,\" you mutter to yourself, making sure you're still in the center of the X.  You look up at Lana as she silently counts down from 3, waiting for her to fire with nervous anticipation.  Will it hurt?  What if it doesn't work?  What if- before you can finish the thought Lana reaches zero and fires, and a white beam of light engulfs your body.</span></div></div>",

The longer the beam is on you the worse your hearing gets, which may end up being a very good sign.  With each second the beam is on you the more powerful you feel, as though it's transferring its energy directly into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the size gun shuts down on its own, stopping whatever growth was going on.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You instantly slump back down when the hand holding you relinquishes its grip, forcing you to rest your hands on your knees while doubled over.  An enormous log gets pushed against your chest, shoving you against the wall and forcing you to stand up straight.  Your vision begins to clear and you are able to make out the log as being peach colored with a pinkish-white tip on the top.  A finger.  You're still tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, you made it to three inches!\" exclaims an otherwise soft voice directly above you.  \"That's triple what you were when we started!\"  By now you are able to differentiate between voices, and this one is distinctly Lana's.  \"Just a few more blasts from this thing and you'll be back to normal.\"  Lana pulls her finger away and stands, drawing your eyes upward.  The statuesque scientist still towers over you as an indomitable figure, but now you're about as tall as her shoes are.  If you jumped up, you could probably reach her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So give them to him,\" Julie interjects, her velvety words washing over you from above.  You turn to face her, unsurprised to find that she also dominates your view still, and see her on her knees.  Now, if you wanted, you could clamber up her thigh and curl up in her lap unassisted.  \"He's still small enough to be stepped on, it's dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't,\" Lana says, turning away with a single thunderous footstep.  \"I mean I shouldn't.  I mean it's not safe.\"  Quakes continue to ripple out from her footfalls as she crosses the floor back to her machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo loud stomps boom out as Julie slams her feet onto the tiles and stands, her proximity driving home how small you still are.  \"And what does that mean?\" she asks, raising her voice.  \"You must have thought it was safe enough a few minutes ago!  Or were you okay with using him as a guinea pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the energy,\" Lana explains, turning back around with a series of tremendous clicks.  \"It needs a full day to dissipate before I hit him with it again.  If I don't wait he could be converted to pure energy, entirely eradicating him from this world.  It's a significant enough risk that I don't feel comfortable doing it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sighs deeply.  \"Damn near a hundred percent, okay?  Look, just calm down, I'll keep him safe overnight and you can come back same time tomorrow to watch him grow some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie steps back, placing herself between you and Lana.  You lean forward and rest your chin on the back of her shoe, still weakened from the growth, and place your head against her ankle.  \"Who said he's staying with you?  I've been the one keeping him safe all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this is heavy science here,\" Lana retorts.  \"I need him here for observation.  Something might go wrong, and in case you forgot this is still an experiment that he contributed heavily to.  Just because you pledged to protect him in a misguided aim to emulate some anime doesn't mean your words trump necessity.  This is real world stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stiffens at the implied insult.  \"I think we should ask him who he wants to stay with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea!\" Lana replies, stepping toward Julie until their toes are nearly touching.  Lana looms over Julie by half a foot still and she places her hands on her hips, trying to intimidate her.  \"Who do you want looking out for you now, this childish waif or the distinguished scientist you've been working with for years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>think</i> she means your old study buddy who you have a lot of fun with or this dour sadist who treats peoples' lives as a game!\" Julie shoots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison they ask, \"Well?\"</span></div></div>",

Its visual effect is accompanied by a series of loud pops in your ears as well, disrupting your ability to hear anything during the gun's firing.  All you can do is hope that it has the intended effect, and that you'll soon be able to look Julie in the... chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're covered in the beam's light for longer than you expected - after the first few seconds at the very most you should have grown out of it.  The popping dies away though, and you're able to hear what's happening in the room.  Immediately you realize that Julie and Lana are yelling at each other.  Definitely not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why is it doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it switched modes on its own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, once it starts I'm locked out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the power then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless, it has a battery!  We just have to let it finish and see how bad it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the light dissipates, and you look at your surroundings with dread.  The electrical tape marking you're standing on sprawls across the ground as far as the eye can see, and each strip is thicker than you are tall on its own.  Each table is taller than a mountain with an enormous, insurmountable plateau at the top.  Above you the ceiling looks as high up as the actual sky, and is just as unreachable to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement behind the farthest desk catches your eye, and you see Lana physically restrain Julie.  A low roar escapes from Lana's mouth and Julie stops struggling, instead changing to sadly nodding her head.  They each pick up a magnifying glass and walk around the table, their thunderous footsteps growing in intensity as they approach.  Your brain finally pieces together what Lana said: \"You can't run up there, the air displaced by your footsteps will blow him away and we'll never find him!  Grab a magnifying glass and come with me, and let's see how much is left to save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThuds from their footsteps become loud crashes as the two women get closer, and the crashes turn into cracks of thunder when they pass the last table.  Each step, initially generating only a faint vibration through the ground, has become a full-on catastrophic earthquake for you before they even reach your marker.  You give up trying to stand through it and resign yourself to sitting on the floor until they stop walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair doesn't stop until they're both standing with their toes at points of the X, forming a right angle with you in the middle.  They're both impossibly huge: their legs alone are several miles long, and you're surprised you can even see all of them with the naked eye.  Even from two inches - a thousand or so feet by your reckoning - the sole of Lana's shoe looks taller than any building you've ever lived or worked in, and the upward curve on Julie's running shoe may as well be a ski jump now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both crouch down to look for you, and the sheer intimidation from not one but two women being this close makes you feel how small you are now.  Since you haven't moved they find you quickly, and immediately their rumbling, booming voices start bellowing from their mouths.  \"I am so, so, SO sorry,\" Lana says.  \"If I'd known this could've happened I wouldn't have tried.  Don't worry, I'll figure out what went wrong and get you at least where you were as soon as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you done enough already?\" Julie shoots back.  \"I don't think he wants any more of your help, I sure don't!  I didn't see how you could possibly make this worse, if I thought this could happen I wouldn't have bothered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cool it!  Accidents happen, it was just a mis-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accident?  Look at him!\"  Julie points toward you with her hand, sending a finger larger than a sequoia tree in your direction.  \"Oh wait, you can't without a magnifying glass, and barely even then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you coming up with any ideas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll beat you down and take your stupid size gun and make it work this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\"  The last thing you needed right now, two mountains of women fighting over you, less than a foot from where you're standing.  Trying to avoid getting crushed is pointless, so you decide to watch the fight and hope neither of them accidentally crushes you in the melee.</span></div></div>",

She lunges, hitting Lana in the sternum with a meteoric shoulder strike, and knocks her to the ground with a tremor strong enough to make your teeth chatter.  Lana's legs splay out, landing on either side of you so that the impacts act like aftershocks, and Julie sets her feet atop Lana's ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be taller than me,\" Julie says, her voice a rumble that you've now come to associate with basic human speech, \"but I'm in much better shape.  Bet I can take a hit better, too.\"  To punctuate her statement Julie slides her leg up along Lana's, sending her knee straight into the scientist's rib cage.  She lets out a gasp capable of breaking glass, and Julie sets the knee on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lana can recover Julie slides an arm under Lana's armpit from behind, reaching up until she's palming the back of her head.  Lana's face contorts into a sea of pain and quickly taps the floor, each of the three hits ringing out like the peals of great bells.  \"Okay, I give!\" Lana manages to say between gasping for breaths, and Julie quickly gets off her, standing up to her full, enormous height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gets up slowly afterward, taking a brief spell to recover, then walks over to the nearby table, each step making a very audible crash on the floor.  She grabs several items and walks back to you, and you see that she's now holding a pair of tweezers and a small plastic bag.  When she squats down her shins block out the entire ceiling, allowing you to see nothing from your back but her smooth, pale legs and her silver-tinged shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of gigantic blue eyes peers over her knees, followed by a circular lens.  Lana adjusts it up and down, making one of her eyes seem even more enormous as it spreads to fill the lens, until she finds the correct range.  She moves in with the tweezers in her other hand, twin metal plates held in parallel that could on their own form walls to your mansion.  Gently she pinches them together until they settle around you, running the whole length of your body and then some, and picks you up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Lana lifts you up, holding you above her legs for a moment while she inspects you.  Her massive eye twitches back and forth, imperceptible to someone of normal size, while you regard a pupil large as the night sky and just as dark.  Apparently satisfied she moves the tweezers over the opening of the plastic bag and releases you, dropping you hundreds of feet to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana swings the enormous hand holding you toward Julie, whipping the bag up as it rushes through the air and sending you up with it.  \"Here's your little friend,\" Lana says.  \"Real little.  I hope you can find a way to help him without me.\"  Julie takes the bag, jostling it as it changes hands, and looks down at you sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he was your friend, too,\" Julie says, then turns away.  While she walks she holds you up to her eye, a dark abyss that seems to stretch forever in all directions, to make sure you're inside.  You bang on the plastic, unsure if you have enough strength to even budge it from the inside.  She doesn't turn around and take another swing at Lana, so she must have noticed your speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie heads for the door and exits the room.  \"Don't worry,\" she whispers, her breath an overpowering gale that buffets your bag as it blows by.  \"I'll do whatever it takes to get you back to some semblance of normal.\"  Keeping your bag dangling from her fingers she walks down the hall to get to work.</span></div></div>",

When she stops sliding Lana slams her feet on the ground, generating a booming clap that echoes inside your ears and a quake that could level your house, then leaps at Julie.  Lana's shoulder connects with Julie's collar and pushes her over, the sudden serious attack taking her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two colossi clash with a speed you never would have attributed to creatures so large.  When Julie hits the floor she makes a thud like nothing you've ever heard before, a sound like someone throwing a thousand pound wad of dough at the wall, accompanied by another tremor.  Lana tries to mount Julie to push her advantage but Julie quickly swings her legs to the side, her shoes coming down just beyond you.  With all the monstrous quakes happening you haven't bothered standing from your prone position, so the only thing you can see is Julie's Achilles' tendon, longer than any bridge and twice as wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ankle doesn't dominate your view for long.  Before Lana can even get settled Julie grabs her by the shoulders and twists with all her weight, throwing Lana off and onto the floor, the shockwave accompanied by a rumbling grunt.  Julie's legs roll out from above you and slide several thousand feet across the floor as she moves to straddle Lana, holding her down with all her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's running shoes are replaced by Lana's elegant kitten heels to loom over you, the dusty black soles so large you don't think you could even climb up them.  They loom over you for only a brief moment though.  Lana lithely pulls her legs up to her chest, sliding them between Julie's thighs, and places them on Julie's stomach.  With one fierce push she pushes her off, throwing her up and backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Julie get launched into the air and know that the fight will soon be over for you.  Her butt is pushed out by the kick, changing her center of gravity to be much further back and lower than it should be.  She falls along the trajectory decided by it, sending her directly on a collision course for you.  A butt the size of several city blocks falls toward you and there's nothing you can do but look as it rapidly drops.  Julie lands, crushing you the instant her butt sets down when all of her weight is set down atop you, turning you into nothing more than an unnoticeable speck.</span></div></div>",

You carefully climb down the desk, making sure not to alert Julie to what you were doing. You knew she would never approve of you doing something so reckless and dangerous. But you had no desire to just sit around for an hour as this class went on. You gave one more look up at your giantess savior, who was focused on the presentation at the front of the room, and you began your descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reach the bottom, and you are treated to an amazing sight. Those green socked feet that you saw from the desk were even larger and imposing from up close. You could clearly hear the scratching and rubbing those toes were doing to each other. Each toe was probably 2 to 3 times your size, and it was terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. She was obviously a bit bored and she was trying to stave off her boredom by playing around with her feet. The way her toes moved and flexed against each other was almost as if her toes were welcoming you into their rubdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking closer and closer to the toes, almost entranced by their massive scale. You could also smell a very distinct odor coming from her toes. They were not bad necessarily, but it was still a strong smell either way. If you reached out, could probably touch these cotton covered monsters. Up this close, you felt like you could jump in the middle of this toe madness and play around to your heart\u2019s content, no matter how dangerous it could be. Maybe the smell was affecting your head at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you even considered touching them, they made the decision for you. Julie lurched her feet forward just slightly, but to you, it was enough to cover you whole. The toes you were admiring had pinned you down, and you struggled in vain against them. They started rubbing you, as Julie thought that, in the back of her mind, she felt a pebble under her toes. You were directly under her 2nd toe, and it ran down you entire body, giving you the most up close and personal massage you\u2019ve ever had. There were times where you were totally enveloped by her sock-covered toe flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to grasp it with her slender toes, and you were claimed by these titanic cotton covered monsters. They started squeezing you, as Julie wanted to figure out what got stuck in her toes. She would have never guessed that you would be down there, because it would be a suicidal action to take. The strong smell from earlier felt completely different right now, now that he was completely covered by her green socks. You were also shifted from toe to toe, as Julie thought that whatever was currently stuck to her toes felt good at least. It would be a nice distraction for her right now. She also wondered how you were doing, hoping you weren\u2019t too bored right now. It was hard to see you in the dark room, but Julie thought that you were probably on the other end of her notebook, away from her scribbling hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fight, but the toes did not let go. But your struggling made Julie more aware of the tiny annoyance, and she took steps to alleviate that annoyance. She decided to pull off her socks and shake them out. You could see her titanic hand reach down, and you hoped that she realized your predicament, but you soon realized that you would not be saved. The sock that you were stuck to was removed from her slender foot and was shaken about. You were flung from one dangerous situation to another. The question was, where did you land?</span></div></div>",

It starts hard and only gets worse as the cushion's contours change from low obstacles to hurdles that you have to jump over, slowing the progress of your already miniscule legs considerably.  You glance towards Fulda who is by now practically leaning over you and see that you've barely even moved away from her center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a huge, browned tree crashes down in front of you - wait, that's just her finger.  Fulda laughs at her complete domination of you, though it sounds more like a long series of low rumbles at your size.  \"Going somewhere?\" she asks, her voice booming.  \"I really can't let you get away.  You're too small, it would be irresponsible for me to let you.  Someone could crush you with much less than a finger.\"  For effect she lifts up the finger she has blocking you and lowers it until the whorls of her fingertip are brushing against your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect her to pick you up now, but she decides you're too small even for that.  Instead she tears out one of the half-filled pages from your notebook and places it on the cushion, then slides it toward you.  As the paper rushes in you try to duck, but it's coming in too fast.  Before you can so much as squat it slams into your legs, knocking you forward and laying you out, the low friction keeping you rolling until the middle of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze you stand and find yourself in the middle of a capital D you had written with your own hand just minutes before.  Fulda curls the page inwards, causing you to slide to a stop in the very middle.  \"Now that you're here,\" she begins, \"I think you'd be perfect...\"</span></div></div>",

From your dim, round prison you look out at her, only to find her focus turned away from you for once.  Her eyes are directed some distance below you, and from the way you're being subtly jerked about it seemed as if she's fiddling with something using her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the shaking stops, and Fulda quickly glances into your tube as if confirming you hadn't slipped out.  Then the whole thing begins to slant downwards, and you turn towards that end with trepidation.  Your limited view is directed at the toe of her shoe, and the view port is slowly moving up her laces.  You begin sliding, and though you desperately seek some way to slow yourself down the smooth paper offers none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube rests against the top of the inside of her shoe, and you come spilling out.  With a thud you land on her insole, a much softer landing than you expected considering how fast you were falling.  Fulda moves the tube away, but before you can feel any sort of relief its position is taken up by two of her fingers gripping the edge of the pit you've been dumped in.  Menacingly she looks at you, trapped in her shoe, with a gleeful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up the shoe, doing her best to keep it level so that you don't slide around.  Though it takes some balancing you manage to remain standing until stability returns, her shoe safely on the floor.  You're relieved when she withdraws her fingers, focusing on the few moments you're at peace while Fulda gets back to her feet, appearing impossibly tall from the inside of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relief quickly dies when she picks up her foot and slides it into the opening.  Fulda's foot, covered in a stark white sock that's clinging tightly around her humongous foot, slides into your view and quickly blocks everything else out.  She sets her toe down just beyond you, trapping you under her foot as it inches lower on top of you and giving you nowhere to run.  Her foot quickly raises and those fingers appear again, pulling the back canvas of her shoe straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're flung to the ground and sent rolling down into the ball of her foot as she lifts her shoe into the air, tugging on the fabric.  Little by little she forces more of her foot in, driving you deeper and making what little space you have even more compact.  Very soon she'll have her shoe back on, and it'll be entirely up to luck whether you're under half a million tons or not when she does.</span></div></div>",

Even at your size it's not much space you can tell, though you can't see in the all encompassing darkness. All you have to go by is your sense of touch as you  feel the canvas wall of the shoe to one side, the soft insole under you, and the rest? The rest was nothing but warm thick cotton fibers that contained her mammoth foot which flexed and stretched over top of you like a slumbering beast. Not slumbering near long enough though, Fulda has no time to taunt you or even worry if you're alive. She probably in fact does think you're dead as she starts to walk and the real trouble begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's not much space to be sure but you'd probably be better off if there was less still as your fractional sized body bounces with each step as G forces take hold, her foot constantly shifting inside the shoe threatening to toss you under it yet. Your stomach lurches which is the only reason you're not screaming in terror, you needed to secure yourself and the only thing was her sock. You grasp hold the next time her foot slams down, your arms so tiny you can fit them between the fibers in a hug, your arms actually brushing her flesh on the other side. Clinging like a mite, the taste of blood in your mouth as you bite your tongue, somehow you manage to last what seems like hours, and in truth is a mere ten minutes as the shoe encompassing you falls away, or rather the foot slips free. You drop what seems like stories but air resistance saves you the same way it would save an ant dropped from any height, your impact on the floor a mere bounce.

She lifts up her feet, setting one down in front of you so that the thick cotton fibers block your view of the room.  Beyond it you see the toes of her other foot twitching, her ankles crossed in a relaxed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooming thuds and rumbling alerts you to the arrival of someone else, though you can only see her stocking-encased feet beyond Fulda's socks.  The thuds get louder and you can hear a more distinct slap of feet on the hard wood as she gets closer, until she finally stops a few feet away from Fulda.  Quickly the new giantess takes a seat next to Fulda and sits in silence for a few moments, allowing you to gather your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing's for sure: you're not going to say forgotten at their feet waiting to be swept up by a broom for sucked up by a vacuum.  While Fulda is much closer, she's responsible for you being here in the first place and seemed quite cruel.  The stranger, on the other hand, would take at least a half hour to reach, and they might decide to leave before then.  Besides, you know nothing about her, and she might be even more sadistic than Fulda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor creaks before you when Fulda lightly presses her foot against it, and her heel drops down toward you before stopping just above your head.

You saw firsthand just how ruthless and sadistic she could be, and anything could be better than her. And besides, you could always use her friend as a mode of transportation to get you as far away from as was possible from Fulda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walked towards where Fulda\u2019s friend was sitting. You walked for about 15 minutes and you were almost halfway there. As you walked, you could still hear, and feel, Fulda shuffling her massive socked feet about on the wood floor. She would rub her feet across the floor, reaching dangerously close to where you were. Then she started cracking her toes and rubbed her toes against each other, and the sound was overwhelming. You were glad that you were moved away from those monsters, because those giant writhing toes would have ground you to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually, you reach where Fulda\u2019s friend was sitting. She was wearing a pair of bright orange socks and she rested them close to where you currently were. You also saw that there was a small hole in her right sock, right around her 2nd and 3rd toes. They were massive, but not as large as Fulda\u2019s monstrous feet. If you could hazard a guess, she might have had about size 12 feet. It was still pretty intimidating, but you needed to act. They were fairly still, only wiggling subtly. He could see bits of cotton fall around him, probably from her socks. You couldn\u2019t make out anything else about her, because her feet filed your entire world view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched and thought of a plan, the smell from her feet started to wash over you. It was a very overpowering and oppressive smell. It was so bad that it was starting to give you a headache. At least Fulda didn\u2019t have feet that smelled this strong! It was beginning to feel like you were in another stink filled atmosphere, where the smell surrounded you completely. You thought that these titanic feet could probably give the best biological weapons a run for their money, if they were at his size right now. But you needed to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you needed to figure out just how you would go from here. You could try and climb her foot, and eventually reach somewhere higher up. You were pretty small, so you wondered how far you could even get. And you had no idea how long they would sit around for. But then your eyes wandered to the left of these gigantic sock-clad feet, and you saw her footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pair of pink moccasins near her feet. Those could be your ticket out of here. You were small enough that you could fit deep inside her moccasins and be brought away from Fulda\u2019s reach. It could get a bit dangerous, but sometimes you need to take risks. You saw that the outside edges were rough enough that you could climb easily. But you knew that if you tried this, the smell would only get worse and you could easily get crushed by this titaness without her even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You knew that she was sadistic enough to kill you for her own amusement, as you experienced earlier in her converse shoe. You were wary of getting in moccasins owned by this mystery woman who had such awful smelling feet. But your safety was more important than your comfort right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you begin climbing the pink moccasin. It is several times larger than you, but the rough material made many footholds for you to work with. Eventually you get to the top and the first thing you notice is a wave of stench. But you persevered and made your way back down into the moccasin. When you finally got to the bottom, you thought you were looking a pink building. You walked your way towards the toe section, where you thought you\u2019d be safest and you tried your hardest to ignore the smell. But it was even worse inside, and it got worse and worse as you continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, you heard the giant goddesses chatting above. You couldn\u2019t make out anything they said, but it was a loud noise either way. And as they chatted, their legs and feet tried to keep themselves occupied. Fulda stretched her legs out, and started brushing her toes against her friend\u2019s moccasin. The very same one that you were currently in, and to you it shook up your whole world. Her playful brushing against her friend\u2019s shoe made it very difficult for you to reach the toe section. Eventually, she brought her feet close to the moccasin\u2019s opening, cutting off a significant amount of light. It was as if her feet knew that he was trying to escape her, and they wanted him back. So you ran the rest of the way into the toe section, nearly falling into one of the imprints left by Fulda\u2019s friend\u2019s massive toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fulda told her friend that she needed to leave. She understood, and Fulda brought her feet back to her side of the table. Her friend began putting back on her moccasins, as she wanted to walk her outside the apartment and she had no desire to do that in her socks.  She started putting her left foot into the right moccasin, nearly giving you a heart attack with how suddenly and just how large her feet were. But before her monstrous toes reached you, she realized her mistake. She quickly removed that foot and wormed her right foot into the correct shoe. From where you were, you found yourself buried by her 2nd and 3rd toes. They immediately gripped you up, as she felt something tiny and strange in her shoe. She shook it a few times and it seemed to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you were flung into the hole in her sock and found yourself between her 2nd and 3rd bare toes. The smell was even worse, and the toes were damp with sweat. You were caught like a bug in-between two giant toes, and they had no intention of letting go. They would routinely rub against you, making sure you were thoroughly coated with her foot sweat, and squeeze you harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulda and her friend hugged and said their goodbyes, and her friend walked Fulda to the apartment\u2019s exit. As she saw Fulda leave, she took off her right moccasin and scrunched her toes together. You were pushed deep within her sweaty toe flesh. She, whose name was Ashley, worked her foot back into the moccasin and started walking back to her room. She thought about what she should do for the rest of the day. She should go to the library to do some homework. But she could always go to a coffee shop and work there. Wherever she went, she was not changing. She felt comfortable enough like this. While she thought about it, her toes kept wiggling; making sure you had their full attention. Where did she go?</span></div></div>",

After two and a half years of work the device you had been helping with, capable of changing the size of any living thing, was finally ready for a full test.  However, since you're not qualified to operate it, you take a seat and wait for the woman who put it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Lana enters, walks over to the table and takes the coffee you brought for her.  When the department assigned you to aid her with her ongoing project, you never thought it would be something quite as groundbreaking as this.  Even though it's far from your specialty you had picked up a little bit about how the contraption is supposed to work while assembling circuitry for it, and your complementary skills had led you and Lana to become friends as well as coworkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to give it a shot?\" Lana asks after taking a sip from her drink.  She takes a controller from her open light blue button-up shirt's pocket in her delicate hand and brushes it off on her red undershirt.  Quickly she straightens her dark brown, not-quite-knee-length corduroy skirt over her black stockings, and taps her tarnished silver kitten heel shoes.  \"Though I guess first we need to find someone willing to stand in front of the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your coffee, stand out of your chair, and declare, \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looks surprised and walks toward you, the base of her slender neck at around your eye level.  \"Are you sure?\" she asks.  \"If something breaks there won't be anyone to fix it.  Surely the department will send us some freshmen who need a bit of money if we just ask, it'll only be a few more days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive,\" you answer, looking up into her dark blue eyes.  \"Today's the day, if we wait any longer we won't have time to properly report the results.  I know the machinery and circuitry are good, and I trust that you have all the calculations correct.  Besides,\" you smirk, \"I'm already pretty small, the gun won't have to do much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana chuckles, rests an arm on your shoulder and says, \"Yeah, you're pretty damn short.  Okay, go stand in front of it, I'll get it going.  You're fine staying small for a few days until the presentation, right?\"  You nod, and walk over to the designated point.  \"Good, I don't want any skepticism from my review board ruining this.  Don't worry, I'll take care of you until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device is a large, bulky thing mounted on a tripod by a window for extra ventilation.  You stand on the wall opposite it with your back against a height chart, standing straight up.  To your side a pencil hangs from the wall, which you take and mark your height - still around 5'3\".  When you press yourself back against the wall you smile reassuringly to Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's at power, locked on to your heat signature, ready when you are.\"  You wave to her as the go-ahead, and Lana types in the code.  At once the machine whirrs to life and shoots out a beam of white light, striking you in the stomach.  As the beam's energy spreads throughout your body you feel tingly while waiting for it to take full effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's subtle at first, and if you didn't know what's going on you'd think you're losing your mind.  The lab tables seem like their proportions are off, and you can feel yourself sinking along the wall.  Lana approaches, careful to not get in the way, to provide a better scale as you shrink (and likely just to watch you dwindle).  When she reaches you it's apparent that you've already shrunk a foot, since you're eye to navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your friend as she gets ever-bigger to you, changing from a tall, slender woman a head taller than you to a towering giantess before your very eyes.  Of course you know she isn't growing, just you shrinking, but from the mixture of surprise and pleasure on her face you're not sure she isn't thinking of herself as a giantess now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device shuts itself off, and your tingling dissipates a moment later.  \"Wow, we really did it!\" Lana exclaims, her amplified voice causing your ears to ring.  \"I can't believe we got you so small, it's incredible!  Here, let me mark it on the chart.\"  Lana bends down beside you, still many times taller than you as she squats, and makes a mark above your head.

Based on how it looks and smells I'm fairly confident this thing is completely fried inside, if not totally melted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You WHAT?\" you shout, unable to believe what you just heard.  \"Why didn't you tell me?  What am I supposed to do in case you can't fix it after your defense and I'm still tiny for a few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gives a nervous laugh and begins laying down on the floor.  Not a good sign, you think as her knees make contact, followed by her monumental torso eased down by her hands the size of helipads.  She props her chin on one of her hands and looks down at you, her face filling up the sky like a billboard.  \"A few days is being really generous.  You know that most things in there were custom ordered and could take months to arrive.  And you're smaller than a lot of them now too so I'd have to have someone else come in to build it so... a year if you're lucky.  That's if they even keep funding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year?\" you shout.  \"I'm going to be this tall for a year?  Lana, why would you do this without telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman bites her lip.  \"There might be some residual energy left over from the test, so uh, you might keep shrinking.  Just a bit though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana if I shrink 'just a bit' more you might need a microscope to look at me.\"  You sigh and idly kick the tile.  \"So you're saying that, best case scenario, I'm an inch tall for a year, and there's a chance I'll shrink down to nothing, be stuck like this forever, or both.  Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winces and answers, \"Yeah, that's right.  Don't worry though, I'll take good care of you!  I'll make sure you're safe, fed, and healthy until you're normal size again... if that happens.  On the bright side though we'll both be famous: me as the woman who invented a shrink gun, and you as the first man to be shrunken by a beautiful scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and decide to just resign yourself to this.  \"You're right, it could be worse.  So, now what?\"  Lana brushes a strand of hair behind her ear as she ponders, then says...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grunt as you place your hands on top of the toe of her shoe while standing on the top of the sole and heft yourself up.  Then you walk up the slope of her shoe, leaning forward so as not to slide backwards on the slick fabric.  When you hop from her shoe's tongue onto her nylon-covered foot you hear an enormous giggle from above and Lana say, \"That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach her ankle sooner than you thought, and grab two handfuls of nylon while slipping your feet into the mesh.  Gingerly you make your way over to her ankle bone proper, sufficiently center yourself, and begin the climb up her skinny calf one hand at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go you're conscious to take as much time as you need, making sure you have a firm grip before moving up.  Every now and then you have to pause while Lana's leg shakes from her giggling, but despite that you make surprisingly quick progress up her lower leg - fortunately you had chosen to scale the inside portion of her leg where the slope was steady and there was some sort of cushioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long you reach Lana's knee.

At the very top however her embroidered white panties form a ceiling, and provide you with a short-term goal for this part of the climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolutely you thrust a hand upward, securing another handful of nylon to support your ascent.  Since you don't even weigh an ounce it's no strain on the material, and you're able to move just as cautiously as you had before.  The only obstacle as it were is when Lana shivers and minutely shifts her legs while she giggles, temporarily making it too risky to keep climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before you fully enter the darkness and pass the hem of her skirt.  From up above you hear an exaggerated gasp followed by Lana's voice.  \"Little guy!\" she exclaims.  \"I know we're friends and all, but you waited until now to tell me you want to take it to the next level?  And like this?  I mean, I do have a thing for shorter guys...\"  She trails off, and you decide to not read too much into her teasing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she shifts back and forth more often the higher you get, you reach the top of her stocking soon enough.  You brush a hand against the smooth, alabaster skin of her exposed thigh, and Lana practically jumps.  She's tracking you entirely by feeling since there's no way she can see you - even if you weren't up her skirt, she wouldn't be able to see you without bending over a bit.  With another stroke of your hand you survey Lana's bare thigh, making her jump again.  If she keeps that up it'll make the climb harder, but you're confident you can climb it all the same.</span></div></div>",

As you cling to her goosebumps raise on her skin, and she suddenly goes very rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <i>really</i> tickles, little guy!\" she says, a sort of nervousness edging into her voice to replace the former jocularity.  \"You're giving me a powerful itch down there, and if I have to scratch it you're not going to have fun.\"  The thought of her long, slender fingers descending upon you as she maniacally scratches her thigh fills you with dread, since you can only picture yourself being cut to shreds by this.  You spur yourself upwards, abandoning caution so as not to be caught and cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolstered by fear, you reach the top of her thigh in under a minute and find yourself dangling from a frill on the edge of her underwear.  Lana lets out a quizzical hum and says, \"You know, a tiny little dude like you being up my skirt gives me another itch to scratch, if you know what I mean.  So uh, you want to scratch it for me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable.  Sure, you had always thought Lana was attractive - she's insanely pretty, trim, and possibly the smartest person you know - but this seems a bit absurd.  It's actually starting to seem like she tricked you into volunteering for this so that she could push this on you.  On the other hand, this opportunity may not have come about any other way: when she was just a foot taller than you, both of you were too nervous.  Now all the barriers seem to have been broken down and she's even more into you - unless, of course, she's just having some fun with you, and if you misread this it could end very badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dangle from the edge of her panties, legs braced against the very top of her thigh, while you consider what to do.</span></div></div>",

A thought suddenly comes to your mind, if only you had something like a net to catch your fall... Something fabric maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You again hesitate, better ask permission just in case you think not wanting to offend the goddess who could smite him with a flick. \"Hey, do you mind if I go in from here? ... I mean so there's less chance of falling.\" As you say the words you immediately regret it, she's going to think I'm some sort of pervert. Before you can apologize the world shakes as she giggles \"I don't mind 'you' doing that, sounds fun actually.\" The way she stressed the word 'you' sounded off if I was anyone else the answer would be no? You blush pushing that thought aside she probably just means she trusts you as a friend, although a part of you wishes she did feel that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a very deep breath you slip a hand into her lacy undergarments and try and pull the tight fabric open, To no avail. However not giving up you grab hold of the soft inside pulling yourself inside. After getting your head in you adjust yourself and pull the rest of your body in, while pushing her collosal thigh with your legs. After your feet are pulled in you realize just how tight her panties are as your face and stomach are pressed against her warm soft body. You feel around for something to hold. reaching to your right your hand gets caught in a tangle of rope. You wonder if her panties are freyed for a split second before you realized your location. You grabbed hold of her hair pulling yourself to the right. \"Keep going almost there\" you hear a voice seemingly very interested in you making his journey. Given the extra encouragement of pleasing your current landscape you pull yourself along with extra vigor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You began to notice a moistness, paying little attention assuming it was sweat you continue. Moving your hand across again you find it getting much more damp than before. Heavy breathing could be heard far above. Your heart and mind raced in unison, this was going to be the best part so far. You moved over again lying right on the edge of the source of moisture. Taking a deep breath of the think sweet smelling air intoxicates you as you move once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A soft moan squeaks above you as your body slides inside the soft crevasse soaking you in a sticky mess. \"Oh finally!\" The voice about blurts shaking the world as her knees buckle. You smile to yourself as your efforts are not just noticed but appreciated. A thought comes to mind do you stay here for a while or continue toward the peak of Mt. Lana? </span></div></div>",

You don't want to shove yourself into her underwear straight away, but you also don't want Lana to think you're entirely uninterested - besides, if she is, she can force the issue on you fairly easily, she's several hundred times your size after all.  With these thoughts steeling your resolve you reach forward, grab the stitching on her panties, and drop your feet from her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're free you swing back and forth like a pendulum, and you don't feel safe enough to move while swinging.  While you wait to come to a stop you look down at the floor, your view framed on either side by Lana's slender legs.

It seems she wasn't joking around earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin swinging yourself forward, one arm in front of the other, while your legs dangle freely.  It's impossible to shake the feeling that you're treating your friend's panties like a set of monkey bars as you go, thankful that you're so small they won't sag.  Lana for her part doesn't seem to mind one bit as her shaking intensifies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more swings and you find yourself in the very center, positioned directly under the lips of her vagina.  You pull your legs up, placing your entire body against her labia, and begin climbing again while you hold yourself tightly against her underwear.  You're met with a spot of moisture that quickly spreads, and you find the entire front part of your body as wet as Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is what you meant,\" she begins, sounding absolutely giddy, \"when you said you'd climb someone.\"  You grin as you recall an instance one night when you told Lana you'd specifically like to climb her, though you never thought it would be like this.  \"Y-you think you can handle me, little man?\"  You answer by pulling yourself up another inch, making her shudder in response.</span></div></div>",

While you ready yourself for another thrust you test the motion out, slightly wedging yourself into her crevice.

Your head pokes out between the top of her corduroy skirt and a bit of bare, pale flesh.  You look up the titaness's tight red undershirt to see her looking down at you, her pupils dilated.

As you get situated for the next leg of your journey Lana just looks down at you, smiling feverishly, as she brushes a lock of hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily you lean against her and look up her shirt, planning out just how you're going to make it up her torso.  The next obvious hand hold, her navel, is much higher than you expected, and you're unsure if you'll be able to grab your own holds on Lana's trim tummy.  You make two preparatory feints, counting down to your jump, and on three you kick off her skirt and push with your hands, launching yourself up under her shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apex doesn't get you even close to her belly button and you slide back down ignominiously, your feet wedging into the waistband of her panties.  Quickly you scramble up to free yourself, and take your position again.  You brace your feet against the bottom of her tummy this time instead of the force-absorbing corduroy and get ready again.  Once more you count down and launch yourself up against her chest, scrabbling your arms to try and reach your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you come closer, but it's still a far gasp away from actually getting your hand in there, about two or three normal-sized inches - as far as you're concerned you're about 15 feet short of your goal.  You manage not to slide partially into her panties this time, and get ready for another attempt.  This time, you tell yourself, there's no way you'll miss.  Again you count down, kick off from your perch, and leap with all your might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time you're not even close, but on this try something different happens: you hang at the apex.  Just before you start falling Lana pulls her shirt's tail tight, pushing it into you and holding you in place.  The giantess giggles and says, \"Hope you don't mind the help, I figured you could use it.\"  You grunt and climb the rest of the way up, supported by her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Lana's help you reach her belly button easily, and you crouch inside to take cover.  The fabric in front of you loosens and drifts away slightly, fanning some fresh air towards you.  For the moment you decide to take a short break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little dude,\" Lana says, making the cave you've taken temporary refuge in rumble, \"You gonna keep going?

Your tiny hands can't possibly keep their positions, and you're rapidly pulled downwards by this unseen force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second you're out from under the stifling shirt and falling along her corduroy skirt, then just as quickly it reverses direction, yanking you upwards.  As you're forcibly lifted past Lana's waistline and along her shirt you finally realize that the unstoppable force holding you is Lana's left hand.  Reflexively you begin to struggle, kicking and flailing to try to get free, but it's no use: two of Lana's fingers are enough to stymie any of your attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana holds you in front of her face, and she can't help but grin with her thin lips as she watches you futilely thrash about.  She holds a finger up to her lips then moves it toward you, gently resting it atop your head.  \"Calm down little guy, I'm not going to hurt you,\" she assures you.  \"I just - well, you know how when things are tickling you, you slap at them?  Yeah.\"  She moves her finger away and you can see her blushing.  \"Look, I'm bored of this room anyway, let's get out of here.\"  You watch her feel around her skirt for pockets, and her lips pout when she doesn't find any.  However her dark blue eyes light up when she thinks of another place, though perhaps not the safest.</span></div></div>",

When you drop past her neckline you look down and see the colossus in movement.  Lana's free hand pulls up the hem of her skirt, revealing the top of her stockings and the bare flesh of her skinny thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe descent continues, and when you're below Lana's waist she slides out a slender finger, lifting up the stocking's opening like a small tent.  You pass her wrinkled skirt, each fold in the corduroy sufficient enough to be a balcony, and soon after you pass the hem and onto her exposed leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sets you down against her thigh and shifts her hold on you so that you're just being held by a single finger pressing against your chest.  You look down past it and see a small opening in the nylon waiting, large enough to fit you in it with space to spare.  Without warning Lana pulls her finger away and you slide down her leg, into the opened stocking.  The dark fabric catches you like a net and wraps snugly around your body, conforming to your presence easily.  Lana gently lets the nylon close around you again, leaving just your head and neck exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a slight push on your head as Lana makes sure you're secure, and then the giantess waves down at you.  With both hands she seizes the bottom of her skirt and pulls it down over you, covering you in darkness.  You're aware of every step she takes, but being midway up her thigh you don't really feel the movement with too much force.  Lana is careful to step softly so that you don't fall down any further, and you do your best to enjoy the swaying of her leg pumping while she goes about her way, not stopping until she's reached her destination.</span></div></div>",

Now that you're above the knee and no longer have any sort of slope to help you, this is doubly necessary to keep you from plummeting to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're a few inches above where her knees meet she slides her feet together, closing her legs around you.

You proceed upwards, not giving your predicament any more thought, until the majority of light reaching you is suddenly blotted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see a waterfall of straight black hair lowering toward the floor, followed by the alabaster skin of Lana's forehead.  Lana adjusts herself until she has you level with her deep blue eyes, and you look up to her mouth as she speaks.  \"What's taking so long, little guy?\" she asks.  \"I know you like climbing, are you just not motivated enough?\"  It's not hard to see that this is going somewhere you won't enjoy, so you pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another minute you reach the peak of Lana's pointed nose, and continue up to her narrow, broad mouth.

Her breath continues to blow you like a flag, and your white-knuckled grip on a single strand of nylon begins to slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the gust stops and you fall back against her thigh, relieved to have maintained your hold.  Before you can re-secure yourself though there's a huge inrush of air going the opposite way, and Lana purses her huge lips once again.

You watch the titaness take another careful step down the aisle, this one a bit more bold than the last, as she resolves to track you down.  With each step she seems more secure in her surroundings, and you remain stiff as a board while she scans the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few more steps Lana resumes her normal, graceful gait, albeit significantly slowed down compared to normal.  You freeze as her eyes pan over you, not wanting to give yourself away by even the slightest movement: though you doubt she can see you breathing, the movement might be enough of a hint.  Her eyes sweep back over you, leaving you unnoticed as she continues walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's shoe sets down in front of you, the dull silver fabric creased from frequent use.  You look up at the spindly giantess, so close and yet oblivious to your presence, and think about what must be going through her head.  Is she concerned?  Does she think she's lost you, her friend and prize specimen?  The shoe in front of you creases again as she steps off, and you watch her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly she shoots forward, swinging around the opposite table and slamming her foot into the ground.  \"Gotcha!\" she yells, expecting you to be on that side, but of course you're not.  It seems like she's decided to play the game with you and, wanting to be a good sport, you leave cover so that you can be a more exciting quarry.

You press your back against the enormous wooden pillar to rest and catch your breath, having been warmed up by your sprint.  There are two light clicks as Lana steps out from behind the desk she had been searching to stand in the middle of the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not making this easy, little guy,\" she chides, standing with her hands on her waist.  \"But don't get too cocky, because I will find you.\"  Lana bends down, her skinny knees popping on the tile as they connect, leans forward, and places her hands on the tile.  Her straight, raven hair sways back and forth as she crawls along the ground, scanning the ground from her vantage point dozens of feet above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's massive leg stops beside you, the nylon grid perfectly shaped to her calf.  She bends down, nearly touching her head to the ground as she surveys the land under the desk you were just under.  While she searches she idly hums to herself, a clear tune which would be unnoticed by someone at a normal size.  Briefly she pushes herself forward, straightening her shoes and showing some minor muscle definition while she fully searches the desk's underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDissatisfied with not having found you under there Lana pulls back to a crouching position and turns her head to face you.  Her straight hair covers her eyes from your vision, so you're certain for now that you're safe from her dark blue gaze.  Slowly she turns her head from the far side towards you and you do your best to remain still.  From the outline of her hair you can tell that she's looking directly at you, but the wooden pillar keeps you from her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, slender arm slams down, the slap of pale skin sounding like a whip's crack.  Lana's head pops in shortly after and quickly turns the other way, buying you a few more seconds.

Having evaded Lana once more you decide to plan your next move, so you look both ways to try and figure out your next sanctuary, only to see that Lana has pulled back from her search entirely and is sitting on her heels.  You look up from her knees to see her hands folded over her skirt and continue upwards to see her patiently perched as if waiting for something, and her dark blue eyes are focusing right on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\" she declares when she knows that you know you've been spotted.

You hear a light thud as they set down on the floor with you between them, and you throw yourself backwards just as her fingers snap shut.

Before you can assess your situation there's another tremendous slam as her other hand hits, framing you between the columns of her arms.  You turn and see her legs standing tall as well, her skirt nearly reaching the ground to form a corduroy wall as her torso leans over you like a ceiling.  When you look straight up you see her face framed by long strands of black hair, expectantly staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment she doesn't make any moves to recapture you, so you continue moving away from her.  There's some rhythmic thudding as she taps her fingers on the floor, but at the very least they remain on the ground.  After a minute you're outside of her shadow and risk a glance back; Lana is still simply watching you, not moving a muscle aside from idle twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're past the table you had been hiding under, and decide to see if you can go down that road.  You turn left and continue jogging, only to be stopped when an enormous hand crashes down in front of you!  Quickly you turn away from the thumbnail and go forward a bit more, then try turning right.  Again, as soon as you start straying from the path a hand blocks your path, this one balled up like a fist.  Confused you turn back towards Lana, who's barely suppressing a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she still isn't making a move to grab you, you decide to continue forward.  A light scraping interrupts your thoughts, and you look over your shoulder to see Lana's knee sliding forward.  Her shadow encompasses you again as she settles in, and her grin continues to make you feel uneasy.  For a moment you hesitate, trying to decide what game she's playing now.</span></div></div>",

You know that an escape attempt is vain, since there's no way you'll be able to outpace someone with fingers longer than you are tall, but she seems to be enjoying the game.  For that matter you're not having such a bad time either, and find the chase invigorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out from under her shadow and hop across the gap between two tiles, landing safely and using the momentum to keep you moving forward.  Sure enough, not long after you've gotten back into the light there's a loud pop to your left when her hand slaps down, followed by one on the other side.  Her knees drag against the floor with a swish from her stockings, and just like that you're back under Lana again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case continues with Lana slowly crawling behind your stubby-legged pace, with any deviation from a straight line blocked by one of her enormous hands.  When you're between two tables again you wait for her to pull herself up, trapping you once more between her hands and looming over you to try something else.  You stop running and turn to face Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've fully turned she lifts up her hands and sits back on her heels, waiting for you to speak.  You look up the length of the giant physicist's body until you're looking her in the eyes and say, \"Lana, what are you doing?  You could've caught me a dozen times now and you haven't, what gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't trapped you yet, so it doesn't seem fair!\" she explains, grinning down at you.  \"I'm having fun chasing after you, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fun, sure, but there's no sense of danger,\" you tell her.  \"Like, I'm tiny, you're huge, it should feel like you could overtake me at any moment, you know?  Don't try to actually kill me, obviously, but maybe spice it up some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana grins, putting on the same smile from earlier that was making you uncomfortable.  \"So it's danger you want, huh?  I can make that happen.\"  With that she sets the fingers of one hand against the tile in front of you and swings them forward, slapping you off your feet and into the air.  You land and slide another tile's length until you come to a stop beside a far table leg.  \"That dangerous enough for you?\"  She begins crawling toward you, much faster than before, her hands slamming down hard enough to make a steady pounding rhythm.  \"I hope so, because I've got a lot more danger for you!\"  You realize that encouraging her may not have been the best idea as you decide whether to keep running down the aisle or duck beneath the table.</span></div></div>",

You get back to your feet, still feeling Lana's swipe in your chest, and turn to continue trying to escape the giantess.  Laughter peals from behind you and a hand slaps down in your path, Lana's thumb curved just enough to pass over you.  The shock causes you to stumble forward and lean against her thumb, now appearing as a neck-high wall of warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can do anything else you push off from the thumb, drastically changing your course to run under the table.  Lana quickly brings down her other hand in your path, slapping it against the ground with such force that your teeth chatter.  You end up between her index and middle fingers, and find yourself stumbling forward again.  When you press on the tip of Lana's middle finger you lean into it and send yourself vaulting over her fingernail, sliding the width of it on your butt.  With one foot out you land back on the floor, just far enough forward she can't pin you with her ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce down you get back to running at full speed, passing the crest of her ring finger in just a second and entirely safe from her pinkie.  Only a few inches away is the table, the support beam of which is a few inches off the ground and should keep her from pursuing you under it.  When you pass under the table's edge Lana makes one more grab for you, banging her hand against the wooden beam.  She sucks in air from her teeth and pulls her hand back while the wood vibrates from the blow, and you make it inside unmolested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of chasing you inside Lana crawls between the two tables and pushes herself up to her feet, squatting low.  She turns to face you while you head toward the far edge of the table, trying to stay out of the long reach of her arms.  Her eyes follow you as you move, and dart in whichever direction you feint while her arched back twitches that way as well.  It seems like Lana is patiently waiting for you to choose a side before she pounces so that she won't have to risk bumping her head.</span></div></div>",

Exhausted and sweating from the massive heat radiating from the hands, you finally look to Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression is flooded with thick mirth. Stifling a giggle, she begins to close her two hands toward you, scraping against the ground and producing a one discordant note. Unable to even blink, you're suddenly encapsulated within a flesh tomb. There's a moment in which you're manipulated by the force upon your body, twisted and wrapped, but it comes to a stop and finally the light floods back into your vision, yet you still sit within Lana's grasp. Her two eyes close for a moment. Soul power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like maybe a second until you notice that you're being pulled toward Lana, to the collar of her shirt, where the fingers of her left hand grasp and tug at it and then there's an opening, an abyss before you, lined with the wiry material of Lana's shirt. Beyond pale skin and two collar bones lies darkness, and the gentle curve of two heaving breasts. You can't absorb your surroundings before you've been tossed into the crevice, laid flat across the soft cloth of a brassiere and then enveloped into the very same darkness you'd observed not a moment beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you roll down Lana's bra with the cloth rubbing your skin raw, the ceiling above you closes down and you're stopped near the crest of her breast. Her hand, fatigued in the material of her shirt rubs you against the wall you're pinned to, spinning you dizzy.</span></div></div>",

Once you've settled your thoughts are crowded with fatigue and the sickness in your stomach.

Despite this, she was aware of your descent and her hand comes underneath her shirt and takes you back up to her face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to speak to you but it's difficult to hear her past the cloudiness in your ears, blocking out sound. You stare down the cracks between her fingers to the floor until you can make out her voice saying, \"--so sorry, I don't know what I was thinking, I hope you're okay, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her desperation you put your hands below yourself and push your body up into a sitting position.

Girls are like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom walking around for some duration you make out the landscape of the desk. Toward the far left is Lana herself, and in front of her is her notepad. She's still writing into it. Further in from of her is a laptop, and behind that is a variety of wires connected to it, all tumbling from the top of the desk down to the floor, where you assume they're plugged in. To the right of them is the second half of the desk, the area you've been given. Closest to you is a coffee mug, but feeling it tells you that it's cold, so the coffee in it is either old or not there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly farther from you is a pair of earphones coiled around itself, and past even that is a pencil holder that is fully stocked, next to a pad of post-it notes and a stack of other notebooks. The absolute top right corner of the desk holds a crumpled piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you get the gist, there isn't very much here to work with. You wander toward the earphones and observe them for a moment, running your hand along the wire and feeling the rubber. There's nothing particularly special about it, but the ear pieces themselves are grotesque at your size, along the inside of it runs small deposits of brown ear wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity you take a handful of it and feel it in your hands. There isn't time to play with it before you realize how gross and unsanitary the action is, so you shake your hands around wildly until the most of it is off, then scrape the rest off along the rim of the interior of the earbud. You're sure some of it is still stuck between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou observe the mug from the distance and see the image printed onto it, a painting of a woman in a sundress standing along the shore of a lake, admiring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you look to the pencil holder, an idea comes to mind. You run toward it and climb along the ascending compartments inside of it until you reach the largest, where you can barely reach the top of a pencil, where the eraser is. You pull yourself up and now have a much larger view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing around you is interesting, but you can see that there is cold coffee inside of the mug.

When you open your eyes you look to the walls of the mug around you, at least half of the coffee was drank.

This trance is only shattered whenever Lana reenters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a variety of tools in her hands, which she places on the table. Silently, she sorts them out for a while, seemingly by order of least to most dangerous. The two safest tools she moves closest to you, then picks one out to use first.</span></div></div>",

Of course it'll be more than far enough to keep you from catching on fire. We can try that after you pass some other tests,\" she smiles, \"so we can slowly lower you into it, and if you feel like it's starting to hurt, tell me to stop. Don't worry, even if you don't stop me, I'm not gonna actually set you on fire yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounds simple enough to you, and you definitely trust Lana to not kill you. Come to think of it, if she gets too close then her own fingers will be burned, so there's a foolproof way you'll survive. Nothing to be worried about, unless Lana actually prioritizes science first, over her own wellbeing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you with one hand and strikes the match against her chair with the other. The match comes closer and closer to you, so close that it feels like you may be blinded by it. But you figure that it's best to get this over with and let Lana have her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match is put under you, so far that you don't feel any sort of heat coming from it. Lana sees your lack of a reactiom so she raises it higher, and now you feel a minor sense of heat, like a campfire. With that, you still don't react, and instead try to give Lana a look to hint that you're scared for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Lana interprets your look as, let's get incredibly close. You're taken so low that it feels like your clothes may begin to singe off, and then after a moment you feel the dampness from coffee comes off of your clothes. This has to be as far as Lana could take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like that predicition is true, but Lana still holds you over the flame for a long period of time. She says, \"You really don't feel anything at all? That's amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lana, I think this test was a rousing success,\" you say nervously, \"But I'm feeling sick from being up here.

Very slowly she brings the flame closer and closer to you until it's nearly licking your shoes. You look up and Lana with genuine fear in your eyes, but you see in her expression that she is stuck in her own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you touch the flame, you scream out for her to stop, but it's too late. You are set alight in less than a second. Lana yelps and drops you onto the metal desk, and puts out the match.

Tomorrow will be a big night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves you feeling a lot better, so you agree and she gathers everything up and puts it back up, tools like scalpels, glue, and most threateningly a bottle of bleach.

The travel makes you nauseous but it's manageable after your experience with the matches.

The sharpened edges gleam brightly, illuminated by the humming fluorescent light above. Lana asks you to take off your shirt and pants and  lay onto your back. You start taking them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so I'm gonna start off just poking you a little bit, once we get past that we can get into more extreme stuff. If you start to feel pain, tell me immediately! We'll be in big trouble if you're injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, but, uh, maybe we can do this later?

There's a brief period of silence before you hear the sound of the tweezers clapping together, then they make contact with your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most painful thing is the cold on your bare skin, it's like a sudden shock down your spine from the freezing sensation. Soon enough, you grow used to it and a new world of pain is introduced to you. What probably seems like gentle prodding to Lana feels like a massive, sharp boulder being lowered onto your stomach. As it comes to settle onto you, Lana brings the tweezers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels first like only an immense amount of pressure, but the pain begins to register after a few moments. Your entire body is seemingly set alight as your skin is tightened and pulled toward your stomach. It only lasts for a few seconds before Lana stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that is left is an indentation on your tummy. Lana asks, \"How would you describe me pinching with the tweezers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't defeated yet, you lower your head and respond, \"It felt like a lot of pressure, but it didn't hurt at all.\" You're just digging yourself into a deeper and deeper hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's face lights up. She says, \"Alright, let's do it limb by limb, then. Remember to tell me if something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tweezers are brought back to you and she begins by grabbing at your left arm and squeezing a bit. She moves down each limb, and with all of them it feels like a clamp being slowly tightened more and more onto your limb, until it feels as though it could snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she reaches your last limb, the right arm, she squeezes as normal, and you don't respond verbally. Her face is extremely intent, she squeezes more than anything she's done before. There's a small moment where all of the pain stops, and then you feel your arm give in, and your reaction is like an explosive being detonated across your arm. You hold in any reaction so strongly that you soon pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you come to, Lana is staring down at you, nearly in tears. You look into her eyes and try to push yourself onto your butt with your right arm, but the explosive pain returns. Looking at your arm, you see that it's now a deep shade of purple and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, are you still alive? Did I break your arm? I'm so so so so sorry, oh my God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off, saying, \"I'm fine... I just feel nauseous now. Give me a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're at a loss. You could tell her the truth, and make her feel even worse than before. But it would keep you from being experimented on further. Or you could say that it's all alright and continue. You've nearly reached your breaking point.</span></div></div>",

She reaches over you and places a hand on her knee, rubbing it gently as she peers down at you.  Lana grins and says, \"Looks like I win again, little guy.\"  A quick survey of your surroundings shows that she's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you hang your head you spot another possible route - up her skirt!  Maybe you won't be able to escape, you think, but you can hold out a little longer.  You dash forward, taking the giantess by surprise and run into the dark cave of her skirt.  Everything gets dark as the floor transitions to corduroy, and you continue running for the shining beacon of her white panties.  If you can latch on to those you may be able to weather any retribution she sends your way for this.

You can't process what it is before it gives a firm tug, pulling you off your feet and slamming you face first into the inside of her skirt.  You're briskly pulled backwards while you claw at the corduroy in a vain attempt to gain traction, but even if you could get a solid grip the force pulling on you is much too strong for you to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft corduroy gives way to firm linoleum, and you finally piece together that Lana managed to grab your leg.  Luckily she doesn't drag you along the cold floor, opting instead to lift you up in her grip.  Though your position is far from comfortable you realize the only way out would be Lana dropping you, and looking down at the one foot drop tells you that's not going to be a good option for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana slowly lifts you, her dainty fingers tightly pinched over your ankle and lower shin as you ascend.  Blood rushes to your head while you remain upside down, and you expectantly look past your foot towards Lana's face.  Despite having nothing else to focus on you can't discern any feeling or intent from her deep blue eyes as you're raised past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stops, letting you dangle in front of her nose.  Lana tilts her wrist, making you lightly swing side to side in a manner very uncomfortable for your leg.  Sternly she lifts up her other hand and wags a finger at you in admonition, and her face looks none too pleased.  You wait a beat, hoping that she's kidding around to see what she does next.</span></div></div>",

What fucking world did you grow up in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes quiet and takes a couple deep breaths, seemingly trying to calm herself down before continuing.  Lana jerks her hand forward, making you flinch as you race toward her lips, but she stops just before you reach them, letting you bump into her bottom lip as you swing.  \"You know, I felt bad about shrinking you,\" she begins again, her voice much quieter now.  \"I figured we could have some fun, play some games, keep things from getting too boring for you even though you can't really do anything now.  But apparently,\" her voice growls a bit before she brings it back down, \"you can't handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana pulls you away from her lips then slightly flicks her wrist, swinging you upwards.  Temporarily you're freely flying through the air and do a half flip until your back hits against Lana's palm, at which point she closes her fingers around you.  She walks with you at about chest level to a table where she's left a variety of open containers.

You try to scream, but with no air all you can do is frantically move your mouth.

Her shoe's sole stops just above your head as her heel impacts, making you stumble backwards from the source.  You back away, honestly surprised that she's being so aggressive and somewhat in shock.  When you clear the impact area she swings her foot down, causing you to unsteadily collide with the toe of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I convince you yet?\" she asks as she lifts up her foot again.  She slides her heel up until it's just in front of you, allowing the rest of her shoe to hang over you menacingly.

As soon as you've cleared her shadow her foot slams down again, causing you to slip to a knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to change course and try to get past her other foot.

You take the previous session of this game into consideration and look deep into Lana's eyes as you run. You're thinking harder now. Remember, you say to yourself, one foot in front of the other. Do not trip. She's looking straight at you, she's reading your mind. It is like you feel these thoughts you're having being shuffled around clumsily to an intruder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne foot in front of the other.

This girl then pivots, her shiny shoe racing toward you to knock you down (perhaps leading to critical injury, does Lana know what she is doing?) but you feel an undying calculation in your chest and mind, and duck in time to avoid her foot. Now she understands that perhaps this will not be so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're running off in the opposite direction without looking back. One foot in front of the other. Your hands, clenched into two fists, begin to tingle and feel sore. This enthralls you. One foot in front of the other. Your back is killing you at this point but you do not care. Above you is a massive shadow that looms. You spare a moment to look up and you are seeing the bottom of Lana's shoe. Is This The Death Of You, you think, but of course it isn't. She slams down, harder than any of the previous times, directly before you. The ground shakes and your brain knocks around in your skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne foot in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even expect it, the floor comes up to meet you. The wind that was whirring in your ears comes to a stop instantly and is replaced with a loud thud, the sound of your head colliding with the ground. You're bleeding, and your thoughts are incomprehensible. Is your head on straight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath you are tremors, and then above you is shadow. You make out heavy breathing and whispering, all like: \"Are you okay?\" \"He can't be dead, can he?\" and \"Oh god, it hasn't even been a month.\" and you do not understand the words. Your motor functions are temporarily halted, until you finally feel the urge to stand to your feet. Your shift your left arm slightly to help yourself up, but before you know it, this panicked woman has stepped on you to remove the evidence of the man she thought she had killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is smeared and ground into millions of red and pink and yellow particles, atoms, molecules, and you are reduced to a stain so thin you can never be recognized. This girl cries later.</span></div></div>",

Lana turns you to face her as she lifts you up, letting you see a triumphant grin spread across her gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she has you fully facing her she begins to stand, and places her other hand underneath you, palm open.  Gradually she lowers you into her hand, finally letting go of your shirt when your feet are securely on her palm.  She raises you up to her chin, keeping you eye level with her lips while she continues smiling and looks down at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all tuckered out already?\" she asks, setting two fingers down before you.  She starts walking them around on her palm, each finger twice as tall as you.  \"Little guy can't even play for a few minutes?\"  Lana \"kicks\" one of her fingers out, hitting you straight in the chest and knocking you down.  Before you can get up she lays the finger down on you, pinning you against her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?  Is big, strong Lana too powerful for a little pipsqueak like you?\"  She grins as she prods you with her finger.  \"You're really small, I understand if I'm too much for you.\"  Lana giggles as she pokes you again, apparently thinking it's hilarious you're this small because of her.  \"I mean you were always a tiny little thing, but now...\" As she trails off she giggles, poking you two more times, then an expression of inspiration lights across her face.</span></div></div>",

Out of frustration you roll sideways, sliding down into the center of her palm, and push yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're standing again you look up at Lana smiling down, your vision rimmed by the edges of her cupped hand.  As you watch her other hand slides into view, totally eclipsing her face as her fingers pass over until you're centered under her palm.  The last bit of light is squelched out as she closes both hands together, cupping them tightly around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even question what's happening you're rapidly lifted into the air, then the floor stops, sending you flying into Lana's top hand.  She quickly shoots her hands forward, rolling you against her palm in a disorienting spin as you're moved backwards until you get wedged between her palm and fingers.  She reverses direction again with you held in place by light pressure until she suddenly stops again, rocketing you out to sail through the dark cavern and land on what you think is her middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're too disoriented to know which direction is up as she keeps churning her hands, bouncing you around her palms with wild abandon.  So far you've managed to avoid any serious injury thanks to Lana keeping her palms creased and fairly soft, but you're definitely dizzy and getting worse with each second.  <i>This must be how a die feels,</i> you think to yourself as you bounce once more off what you think is the \"roof\" of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tumbling continues for some time, none of it easy, until Lana decides how to you're going to exit.</span></div></div>",

Before you can recover you're forced up again, and with no canopy Lana one-hand catapults you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe G-forces from this acceleration make your stomach drop, and you feel yourself getting light-headed as blood pools into your feet.  In a second you rocket past Lana's face, locked in an expression of quizzical wonder as your tiny body flies past it.

Despite your current location, you are relaxed as you realize something incredibly important: Lana is no fool. It could only be a matter of minutes until you are rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely out of any air to breathe, you drift off to sleep.

Her soft grip of hand, calluses colored auburn or orange rubbing at your epidermis, is let loose when she has approached the existing table. With concise speed you are lowered to the table and palm outstretched she releases you and blinks, thin layer of skin scraking across the second and then she smiles and pokes you roughly with her long, thin finger until you tumble down off of her hand. Impact with this table is disorienting and strange, alien really, and when you are standing you feel the blood inside of your skull or brain seethe around to climax and you are once more conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I composed a list of things that we can do together! And yes, I know that's kind of nerdy and all but just read it, honestly. There's a whole lot of neat things that I thought of.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeat things you are wondering, and Lana pulls a paper from a drawer to the left of her (the paper was not already on the desk?) then brings it forth to you in a presenting manner. You cannot hold the paper, you think, you cannot hold this. When you reach out with your left hand she laughs and sets it down to your right. The letters are each written in uniform and clear print with red and sometimes blue ink, more frequently as the list goes down. There are sixteen 'neat things' on the list but several appear uncomfortably unpleasant. Retrieve objects lost beneath the refrigerator? Or travel across a room taking notes on microscopic fauna? No particular option sticks out as pleasant and you begin to grimace. The boring girl Lana frowns and you frown too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This list is boring; do you have no soul or something? Maybe we can do something actually interesting?'<br>\r\n'I thought that these were interesting things to do. The list outlines a whole lot of creative research ideas so we can make practical use of your size. That was the intention of this, of course. I do not see what else we could do, unless you are willing to implore upon non-conventional research.'<br>\r\n'What is that supposed to mean?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looks like those men on television who advertise vehicles with absurdly low pricee. You blink and she stands to a full height and you are still down here on the table. Her hair is framing her face in this strangely alluring way and it is honestly almost too much. She plucks you directly off the table and then puts you on top of her head, within her thin hair that tangles and wraps around itself an infinite number of times and you trip on the rounded surface. Her hands appear above you and suddenly the hair all around begins to strangle you as she controls it, tying it into a formal bun with you as the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl giggles and fingers the bun a bit until it is well adjusted and then she sneezes cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to go out, you can tell me whatever you discover when I'm back home.'</span></div></div>",

For something called-\" you check the sheet to read it, but the receptionist cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're the first one here,\" she says as she checks a clipboard.  \"And it looks like you're the only one signed up for this.  I'll let her know you're here, she should be out in just a few minutes.\"  You nod and take a seat in one of the chairs by the door, take out your phone, and begin reading the news to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute a door beside the desk opens and a woman's voice calls, \"Come on back, I'm ready for you.\"  You pocket your phone and stand, then walk over to the woman in the doorway.  She's a fair bit taller than you, with flowing blond hair and grey eyes with a very athletic body.  The woven pattern of the collar on her hot pink shirt is at about nose level, and her long, slender legs are accentuated by very tight jeans tucked into a pair of knee-high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds out her hand to you and you take it, giving her a solid handshake.  \"Good morning, I'm Olga,\" she says cheerily.  \"How're you doing?\"  She turns around and leads you into the room, a fairly large lab with racks of test tubes and beakers on each table.  Briskly she walks to the far corner where she's set her equipment up, and beckons for you to stand against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing so bad, how 'bout yourself?\" you answer as you follow her instructions.  As you take your spot on the wall she says that she's doing fine, and tells you to stand up straight.  She withdraws a tape measure from her prepared kit and holds one end beside your head, then drops the other end to the floor.  Olga tells you to step on it as she pulls it taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jots down your height and weight, then says, \"Do you know what sort of drug you'll be testing today?\"  You shake your head, figuring that she must have gotten your weight somehow, then she explains, \"We've been working on a dietary supplement to assist people with losing weight.  The way it works is that it latches onto unnecessary fat cells and reduces them without totally eliminating them, though it does make them much easier to burn off.  With me so far?\"  You nod, and she continues.  \"We've already got human trials well under way, but we need you to see what happens when someone's subjected to an extra large dose.  Of course a dose is based on body composition, size, and a variety of other factors, so that's why we had to use someone so small for it.\"  You nod again, and Olga begins spooning a powder into a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The normal dose is one-quarter tablespoon,\" she elaborates, \"so we'll be giving you twenty.\"  She hands you the glass, making sure you have a firm grip on it before releasing it.  \"For safety we'll need you to stay here a while for observation, that won't be a problem will it?\"  You shrug and shake your head, and Olga smiles.  \"Good.  Drink up when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head back and chug the liquid as fast as you can.  It's faintly cloudy from all the stuff she added to it, and it tastes incredibly bitter as it gushes out onto your tongue.  Still, you want that $200, and it's not like the side effects could be too bad.  When you finish it you hand the glass back to her and wince from the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you feel strange, uncomfortable, or have any suden changes, let me know,\" Olga says as she sets a timer, then leans back to watch you.  Several minutes pass as your eyes dart furitively around the room and you try to make small talk with her when she stands up and grabs the tape measure again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you can tell something's wrong.  For one thing Olga, who had previously merely been tall, now towered over you as your eyes met her chest.  For another she steps on the loose end of the tape measure, holding it down with her boot as she compares the end she's holding with the top of your head.  \"Four feet, six inches tall after five minutes,\" she reports matter-of-factly, not even a hint of surprise in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I'm four-six?\" you ask.  \"I may be short but I'm over five feet, did you measure right?\"  When you finish talking you find yourself looking up at Olga's chest, and she has to peer over her breasts to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're just shrinking.\"  Olga must have noticed the surprise on your face since she continues, \"We knew there was an outside chance of this happening with such a large dose, it was on the back of the flyer we posted, didn't you read it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" you say, looking up from her waist, \"I just thought it was a joke!  I mean, who would think 'loss of height' could be an actual side-effect?  Do you at least know how small I'll get and when it'll wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga squats down to put herself at eye level with you and reads off \"Three feet eight inches,\" the stands back up, putting your eyes right in the middle of her thighs, then she answers your question.  \"Typically the risk is one to two inches with a normal dose over the course of usage, but you got eighty times that all at once so... really small?  As to how long, well, it's supposed to never let the fat cells grow again so that they can be burned off at any time, so I guess you might say it's,\" she suddenly gets a lot quieter, \"permanent.\"<br>\r\nYour eyes bug out as they reach the top of her boot.  \"Permanent?\" you shout, your voice getting higher-pitched.  \"And how small is 'really small?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga towers above you more and more as you continue shrinking.  This time she doesn't bend down to get a measurement of your accelerated shrinking and replies, \"I can't be sure, just focus on my boots and you should be able to tell from them.  Remember that you're in a lab, everything's safe and if you follow my instructions  I can make sure nothing goes wrong.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top buckle on her boot goes racing past your head as you watch her grow ever-larger compared to you.  You try to back away from the titaness, but she slides her unoccupied boot behind you, blocking you as you bump up against it.  \"I really need you to not move for your safety,\" she instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more minutes pass as you watch her constantly grow taller, her boot becoming like a tower on its own.  Finally Olga crouches down and says, \"Well, let's see where you've ended up for now...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her enormous mouth curves upward into a smile and she leans in closer, bringing her tremendous lips just an inch from your head.  Olga reveals teeth five times your size when she opens her mouth to say, \"You know though, you're a bit too small to be out and about, I'll go get somewhere safe for you.\"  With that she pushes herself off the ground, her enormous boots making the ground rumble as one lands next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess scientist walks away, covering several miles in a few strides, while you remain where you are.

Before you can recover another titanic booted foot stomps down, the vibrations working together to knock you down.  You feel as if you're about to be shaken apart, but luckily Olga is satisfied with her position standing astride you.  She looks down at you, a self-satisfied look on her mountain of a face as you try to simply comprehend this colossus of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some time she seems content to just tower over you like this, somehow making you feel even smaller, as the smirk never leaves her face.  She can clearly see you, and as the stare-off progresses you become concerned that she might harm you, intentionally or otherwise.  You begin slowly backing away, making almost no real progress relative to Olga but making  yourself feel better at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness notices your movement, and crouches down as a response.  There's a glint in her huge grey eyes as she brings her slender - to someone her size - hands out towards you, implements at the ready.  You stop backing up as the tweezers descend, bringing huge steel platforms onto either side of you.  Effortlessly Olga lifts you up with the tweezers and drops you just inside the rim of the test tube, slanted in such a way that you can slide down it without getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the test tube you slide back and forth on the rounded bottom, then finally come to rest.  Olga lifts the container so that you're level with her eye, distorted by the glassware so that her already enormous eye seems massive as it wraps around you.  She gives it a quick shake, bouncing you against the sides as a slight tilt of her wrists violently buffets you.  When you settle down again she's having a hearty laugh, which sounds like a long series of explosions rumbling over you and echoing throughout the test tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should admit that I haven't been completely honest with you,\" Olga says as she peers down at you from the top of the tube.  \"Actually I've mostly lied.  This wasn't a trial, I knew exactly what would happen - I've been using that to shrink mice for months.  It may be permanent because we've never found a shrunken mouse, but it's supposed to be; regardless they usually get loose and crushed shortly after it takes effect, or I just crush 'em for fun.  And lastly, you weren't randomly chosen for this.  Someone contracted me to shrink you, and specifically you, as much as I could.\"  A buzzer sounds and Olga turns her head away.  \"That must be them now, get ready to meet...\"</span></div></div>",

The distorted light passing through the glass makes it hard to make out the figure, but as she gets closer the view normalizes and you nervously gulp.  That bleach blond hair, light freckling and hazel eyes you'd recognize anywhere: it's Susan, a gym rat you dated for a short while and then abruptly broke it off with.  You knew it hadn't ended well, but if she did this she must have taken it harder than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan approaches the test tube and centers you between her eyes, the abnormal view making them seem to wrap around you.  She reaches out and aggressively flicks the glass twice, making it resonate with the impact of her fingernail and shaking you.  \"Is this really him?\" she asks, her voice a low rumble.  \"For all I know you put an ant in there and took my money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's smaller than an ant,\" Olga corrects, \"much smaller.  I have a magnifying glass if you'd like a better look, though I'd have to dump him out first.  There's also a video of him shrinking like you requested, though I understand you might want to watch that at home.\"  Olga hands her a magnifying glass and says, \"Get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually Olga tilts your test tube over Susan's waiting palm, causing you to slide down toward the opening.  You land on a vast peach field covered by interwoven furrows and a couple of long ditches, sprawled on your back.  Olga pulls the now empty test tube away and it's immediately replaced by a magnifying glass.  An enormous hazel eye fills the lens, and after it blinks a couple times she says, \"Yep, it's him.  Not much smaller than I remember either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan lowers the magnifying glass and leans in, putting her mouth an inch above you.  Her lips seem to stretch for hundreds of feet in either direction, dominating your whole sky.  She opens her mouth, revealing a set of enormous, perfect teeth ringing her cavernous mouth.  \"Hi again,\" she booms, her warm breath covering you as she assaults you with sound.  \"You may have forgotten about me, but I didn't forget you.\"  Her smile is completely malicious as it threatens to engulf your tiny form.</span></div></div>",

Can you make him... oh, I don't know, smaller than this?\"  She licks her lips down at you, her face the highest expression of mockery.  \"I mean he's small, but he's still much bigger than I feel he should be.  I'll pay you extra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can definitely do that for you,\" Olga responds as she turns around.  \"I thought you might ask this, so I whipped up an extra-concentrated batch of the active ingredient and put it in this dropper.  It's not nearly enough to affect a person like you or me aside from maybe tightening your skin a bit, but it's enough to practically drown him.  The skin contact alone would drastically reduce his size more, and he's bound to drink some by accident.\"  Olga takes hold of Susan's wrist as she moves the magnifying glass back into position, and begins lowering the dropper towards you.  \"You can consider this included in the package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous tube takes its position directly overhead as Olga's fingers guide it, and before you can move she gives it a slight squeeze, discharging its contents.  A drop of very harsh-smelling liquid lands on you, engulfing you in its horrible pool.  You try to seal your mouth but some still gets in, and by reflex you swallow the mouthful of very bitter compound.  Before you can recover it's followed by a second drop, then a third, turning the pool into a moderately-sized pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you try to decide how to deal with this water you get very disoriented.  You try swimming towards the nearest shore, but it just seems to get farther and farther away, and while earlier you could touch Susan's palm with the tip of your toes you could now dive down if you wanted; the depth was easily 50 feet and getting deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women watch you with utmost satisfaction through their magnifying glasses, adjusting the distance so that they can still keep tabs on you as you shrank.  They continue to stretch upwards as your perspective gets smaller, and begin to seem less like gigantic women and more like enormous, immovable spires.  When they speak, unless you concentrate their words seemed more like the rumbling of thunder than any human speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's hand seems to change, with the gentle low rolls on the heel of her palm rising to become a towering mountain as you dwindled.  In the other direction the one finger you could properly see apparently had no end, if that was indeed her finger; it seems  wide enough to just be a normal part of the landmass.  You try to swim out of your sea consisting of three drops, but your constant shrinking keeps you right in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a mighty crash and you look up to see Susan's eye open - the sound had been her blinking.  There's a loud smack as her lips part slightly, and the sound of in-rushing air whips through your ears.  Her lips move, accompanied by two low rumbles of thunder when she speaks.  You do your best to concentrate and decipher what she says.</span></div></div>",

You continue treading water in what may as well have been an ocean of this shrinking serum, continuing to somehow get even smaller while you wonder what she meant.  Did you misunderstand what she said?  After all, her voice is a barely-intelligible rumble at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as her all-encompassing eye vacated your sky, a humongous rounded shaft with deep contours appears to occupy it once more.  You try to swim away, but your still-shrinking body can't even make it a thousandth of a millimeter before Susan's finger strikes you in the back, submerging you in the liquid.  Reflexively you scream, forcing the air out of your lungs and allowing more of the vile solution into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're driven down into Susan's palm your lungs burn for air and you somehow begin shrinking even more rapidly.  Without some sort of reference you're not even sure how to relate your size to the woman whose palm you're in - you've certainly never seen the human palm at quite this scale.  When her monumental finger drives you into her waiting palm you're immediately squeezed between the two and smashed flat, too small to even leave a red dot on her hand.  For good measure Susan grinds you into her skin, eviscerating you just before you reach microscopic proportions.</span></div></div>",

She gives it another quick, violent shake, making you bounce against the glass walls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that too much, you'll hurt him,\" says the skinny blond woman who just entered, by far the tallest of the three.  She pushes her wide-frame glasses up her nose and continues, \"It won't be any fun to hunt him down and step on him if his leg's broken.\"  You recognize her as Emma, someone you'd had a literature class with the previous semester, and while you found her attractive even then she towered over you.  Apparently you made an impression anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dumb, why would you step on him?\" asks the petite Asian woman to her left.  Even the refracted light reaching you conveys the borderline maniacal spark in her coal black eyes as she twirls a strand of long black hair around her finger.  \"I'm not paying for another shrunken man, and this is my one chance to eat someone whole.  Just imagine the taste...\" she licks her lips, and you just now recognize her as Amy, though you don't remember what from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that's disgusting,\" says the third, standing on Emma's right.  Her dark brown hair is cut to perfectly frame her face, and her soft brown eyes make her look like the most sympathetic of the three.  \"Eating him is barbaric and stepping on him is wasteful, if I catch him I'm going to torment him without him dying... for a while at least.\"  So much for her being kind.  From her voice alone you know it's Elena, an incredibly athletic girl from one of your history classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he gets to me before any of you catch him,\" Olga offers, \"the hunt's over and I get to keep him for whatever I want.  Hear that, pipsqueak?\"  She flicks the glass, causing a pinging thud to resonate throughout the test tube.  \"I'm home base.  If you touch me before they get you, you're safe.  But if they get you at any time - today, tomorrow, a month from now - they get to do whatever they want to you.  There's no time limit.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything Olga shoves a cork into the test tube's rim, cutting you off from any clear sounds.

A row of tables, unoccupied at this time of the day, and the open cafe door beside you are definite hallmarks of the library's basement.  This is better news than you could have hoped for; after four years you know this place like the back of your hand, as well as all the regulars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour small moment of triumph is interrupted when Olga kneels, setting the base of your test tube on the linoleum floor.  With an echoing pop she pulls out the cork, allowing fresh air and ambient sounds to rush down to you.  Olga quickly tips the test tube over, setting it on the floor, and lifts the base up.  Your tiny body races down the near-frictionless glass until you shoot out the end, landing with a roll.  Olga sets a finger down in your path, and you bump into her soft fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know you're somewhere in this building,\" Olga says, the enormous woman's voice taking on an otherworldly quality from her sheer size.  \"It's ten floors and the basement so you should have some time.  I'll be on the far side of the room for a while finishing up some work, if you hurry your tiny little legs might get you to be before I leave... and before they find you.\"  With that she stands up and steps over you, taking care to almost scrape the top of your head with the heel of her boot as she does, and heads off into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now you stand where Olga left you, considering the great journey ahead of you at this pitiful size.  In the past you could get to the back in a minute, but now you'd be surprised if you could make it in six hours.  It occurs that survival is the most important thing, and reaching Olga may not really be in your best interest - if you could get outside, you may never see her and the three other women again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you consider your options the floor shakes.  You spin around and see a massive cross-trainer slap down to the floor, a smooth and shapely leg rising out of it.  Its owner is already taking another step forward, and it looks like you'll be right in her shoe's path.  </span></div></div>",

In just a second the lights shining down are blotted out, and the ceiling is replaced by a rapidly descending trainer's sole.  You duck down and cover your head, the latter mostly out of reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubber slaps against linoleum, a racket that makes your teeth chatter, but much to your surprise you remain uncrushed, safe in a section of tread.

Having narrowly avoided being smashed, you resolve to proceed quickly and get away from the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swift walk of about ten minutes gets you to the metal divider between tile and carpet, and you scale the smooth brass surface like a low hill.  Before stepping into the thick, dense carpet fibers you decide to survey the room and decide on your path.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga is indeed sitting on the far side of the room, typing away on her laptop and seemingly oblivious to everything around her.

As long as you're able to stay on top this should let you move much more quickly than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across the top of the carpet, hopping between each section when you reach the edge of one.  Enormous people walk back and forth around you, their thundering steps shaking the ground when they pass, and make you acutely aware that you have no cover.

Your heart was pounding wildly inside your chest as you knew this was a reckless plan but you didn't want to loss your only chance at getting back to normal. It's been two hours since Olga left you here, which you had no idea how much longer she'll stay in the library or where Elena and her hunting goons are in the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carpet fibers were thankfully worn down and solid, but you were hyper aware of every tremor and shadow from the giants around you. When the coast was clear, you bolted down the aisle, sticking close to the desks to avoid foot-traffic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesks passed by painfully slow, your new height making you realize the sheer distance that you had to cover before you reached Olga. She was still at the end of the row, probably inserting your lab results and her own notes on the shrinking. Anger bubbled in your gut as you thought how that cold-hearted bitch used you as a guinea pig for her experiment and sold you out to the highest bidder before you had even met her. Your thoughts begin to turn violent as your reality and situation seethed in your mind and eroded the values you held onto the last four years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always knew that you were different and the sever bullying you suffered in middle-school had confirmed it. The doctors called it \"Antisocial Personality Disorder\" which is to say that you avoided everyone in high school as they were nothing but annoying pricks. It was only after a loving girlfriend and four-years of happy college that had put you back to semi-normal. But now...Olga ruined that growing normality as you remembered how the world really worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Only the strong and smart rule. The weak and ignorant will merely serve the whims of the mighty.' The joy of your college life and girlfriend were now a dream, so it was time to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You should've just left me with Elena', you thought arrogantly, because now your veins were thrumming with the burning desire to deliver judgement. To deliver vengeance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know how, but'll find away to exact my revenge. Just you wait Olga Sergeyeva, I'll make you pay for this.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing yourself to the limit, you sprinted across the carpet. A strange warmth began to infuse your body as you single-mindedly ran towards Olga's rapidly growing form. A female student in high heels got up from the desk in front of you and the aforementioned shoe was coming down right on top of you as she left. You simply kept running as the heel of her shoe narrowly missed you, grazing your head before disappearing behind you. By the time you realized it, you were now at the end of the row, underneath Olga's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boot swung lazily in the air above you, the gusts of wind from the simple movement threatened to knock you over but you remained firmly standing. The game would end in your victory the moment you touched Olga, but the witch never explained how you would tell her that you made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idly noted the strange heat and the peculiar sensations coming from your body. In fact, you weren't even winded despite all the running you did and covered more distance than when you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The drug must have something to do with this,' You thought passingly then smile. 'Looks like Olga doesn't know everything about the effects of her formula and I don't intend to reveal it.' He turned towards her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'First thing to do is get her attention. I won't be able to get back at her if I'm caught by Elena.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching her non-moving foot, you shoved your hands and feet into the minute crevices in the leather boot's exterior. You slowly began climbing up the outer side of her boot, the two buckles farther above looking like enormous gates. You dug your fingers in deeper as a tremor rocked you as Olga unconsciously shifted her leg. This grimly reminded you of the difference in size between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat flowed into your arms and legs as you climbed. When you arrived at an out of reach handhold, you imitated a rock-climber by throwing yourself up towards the handhold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell?!?!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as you shot up the side of her boot, well pass the handhold you were aiming for and approaching the first of the two buckles. Grabbed the leather as gravity took over finally with you hanging just beneath the silver buckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at your hand, you noticed subtle differences that weren't there this morning and looking down at your body, muscles that you don't remember having were seemingly coming out of nowhere. Whatever the drug was doing to you...other than the obvious reduction in height, it was still changing your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She said the dosage she gave me was eight times more than the norm, so what would it do to me at this height? Was there even other human subjects or was I the only fool that she used it on?' Fresh rage boiled in your veins at the thought. 'Think first, don't rush yet. I still need her to escape Elena. Focus on getting her attention first.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you could barely see her face pass her bulging breast that were literal mountains at your height. Olga was focused on her laptop, a violent rhythm of booms coming from her rapidly typing fingers. The laptop would be the best place to draw her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scaled up the rest of the way up her boot with your new strength till you found yourself standing on her knee. The edge of the table was like a cliff above you, out of reach and unscalable. The you before all of this had happened would be frightened of the distance, but yourself right now wasn't afraid but determined to cross the obstacle in front to achieve your goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see how far I can go.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore heat was circulating in your legs and arms, a good sign for what you come to understand so far. Taking some distance up Olga's thigh, you dropped into a sprinter's stance and waited. When Olga unconsciously shifted in her seat, raising her leg closer to the edge of the desk, you took off from your position straight towards the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pumped your legs with all your might as Olga's thigh blurred beneath your feet. Incredible heat pumped through your body as you leapt at the last possible moment, sailing up and over the edge of the desk. You rolled as you slammed into the hard desktop to kill some momentum and avoid breaking any bones. When you came to a stop, you were now in front of Olga's laptop as her fingers thundered over the keyboard behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up and down, you waved your arms to get Olga's attention while trying to control your strength. Olga's eyes drift away from the monitor for a moment as the enormous grey irises roll over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she notice you?</span></div></div>",

From her shoe you gaze up at her defined ankle and lean calf, shaven so closely even you are unable to find flaws with it at this scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get a good look at the rest of her, your view is blocked.

Looks like today you'll be with Roshan, someone you hadn't been paired with before though you certainly recognized her from previous classes.  Considering that last time you were paired with someone who could generously be called rotund, this is a step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the room you can easily spot Roshan, a dark-haired beauty with sharp features, standing in front of a wall length mirror.  Her long black hair falls in curls down her dark blue T-shirt, and her white skirt made of light fabric rests just above her knees.  Roshan's long, shapely legs come to rest in a pair of jade colored high heels, boosting her up to over half a foot taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey,\" you begin, \"we're paired together today.  Not sure how good of a lead I'll be but-\"  You're cut off when Roshan grabs your wrist and pulls you out onto the floor, her heels clicking with each determined step.  When she reaches her chosen spot she turns around, plans your hand in the small of her back, and pulls your other arm out to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do what comes naturally when you're with a girl like me,\" Roshan says, \"I'll handle the rest.\"  You smile up at her, and wait for the assigned signal to begin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start off incredibly well, and Roshan is very compliant to your lead.  Every step you take she mimics, and she goes along with even the lightest bit of pressure.  When you try to spin her she dutifully arcs her back to go under your arm rather than run into it, accomodating you better than several of your partners in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few turns around the room however you start to feel off.  You get very light-headed, and you have trouble holding your grip.  Roshan seems to notice this and not only readjusts your hands, but pulls you tighter as well.  It might just be your imagination but she seems somehow... stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes must be deceiving you too, since you're now looking at her collar bone.  You look up and find her looking back down at you, with something like hunger in her eyes.  Suddenly uncomfortable you look back down, only to find that you're now eye level with her chest.  Overtaken by shock you try to back away, but Roshan's firm grip keeps you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep going, act like nothing's wrong,\" she commands.  \"Keep leading, there's nothing unusual here, you're just getting smaller and smaller until I want you to stop.\"  You reach her stomach and fear fills you as you remember her hungry eyes.  In a panic you try to run but Roshan keeps a firm grip on you, slamming you back into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not very good at listening,\" she chides.  \"Make it up to me by spinning me.\"  You try to turn over her hand twice the size of yours, and to your surprise it works!  She has to bend her knees significantly to get under your arm, but she manages it without knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stands back up you're about waist height to her and still shrinking.  She's taking baby steps to do her best to follow you, but eventually she can't even hold your hand anymore, letting them drop to your respective sides.  You make one more attempt to get away once you're free of her grasp, but she must have anticipated it: as soon as you turn her leg shoots out and you run face first into her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just making it harder on yourself,\" she scolds, glaring down at you.  \"Just pick a leg and hold on, I'll act like you're doing a good job and not shrinking.\"  You wrap your arms around her shin and do your best to hold onto the ever-widening leg you're draped around.  Before long you're too small to even connect your hands around her leg, and you know that if you get any smaller you'll go tumbling down to the floor.  However, even that won't stop it because Roshan wants you at...</span></div></div>",

At the same time, every time she steps her leg gets minutely wider and harder to grip, and you can feel yourself dwindling against her warm, bronze skin.  In only a few more measures the only thing keeping you attached to her silky smooth shin is the sheer force with which you're clinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven this can't last forever, and in two more measures you're not even half as wide as her shin bone.  Not even your iron determination can compete with physics, and the next time Roshan's heel slams down the vibrations, coupled with your continuing size adjustment, send you plummeting from your perch.  You land on top of her foot just as it pitches up again, your perspective making it seem like a great jade yacht that's caught a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're carried forward as she steps, and when her foot lays back down the momentum, coupled with her heel's incline, sends you rolling down to the studio floor.  Roshan drags her toe with her next step, grazing you such that you go sliding across the floor.  Her heel sets down again just in front of you, stopping your slide as you bump into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch from the floor as she continues another turn, her posture and poise held as though she were being led magnificently.  Is she doing this to maintain the illusion that you're still dancing with her?  Is she actually maintaining an illusion, and everyone else sees a normal-sized you still dancing with her?  Could your shrinking itself be an illusion, then?  Your pondering is broken when she extends her shapely leg again, setting her heel down before you and slamming the toe down beyond you, trapping you under her arch.  No, this at least is very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stops and the dance is over.  Roshan moves her shoe so that she stands astride you looking down.  She brushes a curly lock behind her ear with an enormous hand and declares, \"Well, my little morsel, you look just about perfect.  I've become quite good with this particular magic, don't you agree?\"  Wait, magic?  Morsel?!  This doesn't sound good at all!  You look at the other pairs around you, and no one seems to have noticed she said anything at all, let alone something that strange.  When you look back up you see her bending down, her slender fingers extended to pick you up.</span></div></div>",

Just in time you jump out of the way, leaving her to grab empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoshan groans and strikes again, this time with a swipe of her enormous hand.  In her anger she miscalculates and whiffs, grabbing only the air just above your head.  This time she practically growls and raises her hand high, then brings it down on top of you, her manicured fingers forming the bars of a cage.  You dive forward just as she closes the trap, narrowly escaping her grasp yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dim shadow falls over you as Roshan stands, her titanic height blocking out one of the fluorescent lights.  You don't turn back to revel in her gigantic majesty, even when you feel the rumble of her foot hitting the floor.  Out of the corner of your eye you see her other foot slide forward, primed to swing down and block your path.  Acting on instinct you jump just as it swings down, sliding over the very tip of her shoe right when it lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Roshan must be getting desperate to stop you.  There's a grinding sound as the shoe you just slid over pivots, and you break your concentration to look back.

Focusing you look straight ahead at the mirror to give yourself a goal.  Curiously you don't see a reflection of yourself running away; you only see a non-shrunken version of yourself apparently making small talk with Roshan in the post-dance reprieve.  This must be what everyone else is seeing while you desperately struggle to get away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflected illusion distracts you to the point that you don't notice the shadow fall over you until it's too late.  Before you know what's happening an enormous tapered column smashes into your path, dazing you.  There's no time to stop and you run bodily into Roshan's heel, your arms involuntarily thrown forward as you're knocked to the floor, seeing stars from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend some time on the floor, your eyes unable to focus, making the sky above you a thick brown blur.  No matter how hard you try you can't make your arms or legs react, but the sharp pain from their hard impacts on the floor assures you they still work.  All you can do is groan and wait for some sort of function to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're finally able to focus again you see that Roshan has maintained her victorious pose, basking in her triumph over an inch-tall man.  You blink twice and her coal colored eyes flash toward you, alerted by the movement.  Frightened, you try to force your weakened arms to prop you up, but they can barely even support themselves upright.  From above a hand races toward you, two fingers poised to pluck you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're defenseless as Roshan ensnares you, your limp body dangling between her fingertips.  Your stomach sinks as she lifts you up, unconcerned for your safety, for her eyes to feast upon you.  \"I do like chasing down my meals,\" she taunts, \"but you almost broke the illusion.  Not that you would've lasted much longer after, but I do wish you'd respect my work.\"  She grins, baring her teeth in a sadistic show.  \"You understand I can't risk you nearly getting away again.\"</span></div></div>",

Hot breath assaults you as she laughs at your plea, but she moves you no closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to eat you just yet,\" she assures you, \"not after all the trouble I put into catching you.  No, I have something else planned.\"  After she's done talking she lets you linger before her lips, trepidation building as your imagination runs away with you.  It's not long until you feel the hold of her fingers around you loosen, and you worry she's about to drop you to the floor.

At the same time her mouth grows wider, but not with a growing smile as she maintains her sadistic mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingertips gradually rise up to block out the intimidating view, and it finally comes together - she's making you smaller again.

Roshan looks down at you, stranded in the middle of her hand, with her impassive black eyes, and chuckles.  \"Not even a morsel, you're a crumb,\" she taunts.

Very short dark brown hair that's near black and her eyes match well. She usually looks sickly, more than pallid and so thin it's almost worrying. You hear she's a big music nerd and she's in the choral program to match. Sometimes you wonder what she's really into, since she's so withdrawn and legitimately boring to talk to or be near as you've heard from friends. Majoring in Anthropology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynsey Sterling - 22 years old, 5'9\" (175 cm) girl you went to high school with, though she was a year behind you.  Despite that you've always looked \"up\" to her, as it were, and you got the impression that she liked that, and would engineer situations where she could accidentally bump into you and peer down.  Not that you would mind if she's sweet on you - with her long chestnut brown hair and radiant turquoise eyes lined by dark, flared eye shadow and slender frame she's quite striking.  For quite some time you barely saw her, but now that you have a class in her department's building you've been running into her more often, and you're starting to doubt it was ever accidental.  Majoring in Egyptology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi McLaughlin- 21 years old, 5'3\" (160 cm) a shy bookworm with bright orange hair, deep brown eyes, and a very overweight body. You've seen her around at least a couple times, but you haven't talked to her much. She's not too popular with the guys because of her weight, but she's used to it by now. She relished in the freedom that your university offered, which quickly lead to her gaining far more than the \"Freshman 15...\" The fact that one of her greatest passions involves the culinary arts certainly didn't do any favors to her waistband. Though, she's always looking for new cooking ideas. Should one manage to get close to her, they would find that she's kind, sweet, well-read, and has a bit of a nerdy side. However, since she's so short, she would love to find someone she wouldn't have to look up at. Majoring in Culinary Arts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa Staid - 23 years old, 5'6\" (168 cm) art student with long, light blond hair, bright grey eyes and incredible legs.  She has a dark sense of humor and a very punky style, and is very forward with whatever it is she wants.  The two of you have been dating off and on for a year though not too seriously, and often take breaks when course work gets too intense.  When you're together she loves calling attention to your height, to the point that she makes drawings of he she sees you \"through her eyes:\" fist fighting an ant, hiding behind a soda can, things like that.  Earlier this week she sent you a preview of her senior project - a series of drawings from \"your\" point of view making her look 500 feet tall, to show off perspective she claims.  Recently finals stress has begun to flare up, but she doesn't seem to be backing off. Art Major.</span></div></div>",

You do your best to get in the middle of the group of eight exiting the room in hopes of getting out of the building unnoticed so that you can hurry back to your room and study.  Even in such a small crowd it's easy for you to hide among the people much taller than you, and you keep your head down to hopefully keep an even lower profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you walk though you naturally become distracted counting the tiles as you pass over them and the group gets strung out.  Before you realize it you're alone in the hallway, heading for the exit most convenient to get you back home on autopilot.  When you turn a corner there's suddenly a pair of cross-trainers in your path, topped by a pair of shapely legs in yoga pants.  Before you can stop you bump into the owner, knocking yourself back slightly while not budging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooo down there!\" she excitedly calls out.  \"Long time no see, shorty!\"  She giggles as you crane your neck back to look up at her as she joyfully smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you ask.  \"You pulled this same stunt on my way in.  My ancient history lecture isn't even an hour long, and I wouldn't call fifty minutes a long time.\"  You try to sidestep past her but she anticipates your move, pivoting to block your path.  When you bump into her again you take a step back, only to realize that you're trapped between her and a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I mean, doll,\" she responds, reminding you of when she would call you doll-sized back in high school.  \"We used to hang out all the time before you went off to college, and now we hardly ever see each other!  I miss spending time with my itty-bitty boy.\"  She puckers her lips in a kissy face down at you, then smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynsey I'm sorry but I really don't have time,\" you say.  \"I've got two papers I need to finish by next Saturday, three exams next week alone, and...\" you trail off as a realization hits you.  When she did that ridiculous kiss face she angled her lips down at you, but when you ran into her not even an hour ago you were eye-to-mouth with her, just like you had been since senior year.  Now you're eye-to-Adam's apple.  \"Are you having a growth spurt?  Like, a really sudden and severe one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she begins, her tone unsure.  \"People pretty much stop growing before 20, even people like me who are gigantic compared to you.  Look, it's Friday night, we're both done with classes for the day and we both know you won't actually do any work on that stuff until late Sunday.  One night hanging out with an old friend won't kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.  She's right on pretty much all counts, you admit, except for the growing thing: in the time she was talking she had definitely grown two more inches.  \"Fine, I concede, mighty giantess.\"  She positively beams when you bring up the old nickname you had for her, though it was looking more and more accurate now.  \"How do you want to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynsey's eyes light up and she grabs your wrist.  \"Come on out to my car, little dude!\" she exclaims, having decided you were coming with her long before you agreed.</span></div></div>",

She hands you a wadded-up bundle which you disentangle as she drives.  Inside you find a teal shirt cut to bare midriff, a pair of black baggy shorts and some athletic shoes at least three sizes too big for you.  All you can think about is how uncomfortable this is going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride over is uneventful while you listen to a punk band you hadn't really heard in a while, and when you stop Lynsey practically jumps out of the car.  You're much less enthusiastic, doing your best to drag your feet while you mentally picture how ridiculous you're going to look.  However Lynsey's not having it, and she grabs your arm to drag you along again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get past the check-in counter she lets you go and says, \"All right, go get changed, I'll be waiting out here.\"  You head into the locker room and start changing, afraid to look in the mirror as you do so.  Surprisingly the clothes mostly fit, though they are a bit long, but the shoes may as well be clown shoes on you.  At least the shirt covers your whole chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back out, oversized shoes flopping with each step, and walk over to Lynsey.

Instead you just fall in behind Lynsey, admiring the way her yoga pants cling to her butt.  Admittedly you never had much interest in going to the gym but it's obvious she does, and it's definitely paid off.  You think it may not be such a bad idea to come out with her a bit more often now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynsey leads you to a rack of free weights and hands you one marked 25 in big white numbers.  She takes another one for herself and says, \"Okay, give it a shot!  Try lifting it to your shoulder without moving your upper arm, just bend your elbow.\"  You do your best to follow her instructions, and after a bit of straining manage it once, but no matter how much you try you can't get it halfway up the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, watch me and then I'll have you try it again, this time at a lower weight,\" Lynsey instructs.  She does one exactly how she described, then goes for another.  As soon as she gets it up to her shoulder you feel a little lightheaded and somewhat dizzy.  Lynsey continues, and by the fourth rep you realize that she seems to be getting bigger each time - not necessarily more in shape, just taller.  After she finishes her full ten you barely come up to her chest, making her seem like a small giantess to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lynsey I don't feel so hot, maybe I should sit this out and just watch,\" you say while she's shifting the weight to her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being a baby,\" she chides as she continues lifting with her left hand, making her grow even larger.  \"I don't feel like coming here every day either,\" another rep, and Lynsey enlarges a bit more, \"but I know that in the end it's good for me.\"  The nonchalance of how she's speaking while doing this with her off-hand amazes you.  Does she even know she's growing right now?  You look in the mirror to see how big she's gotten, standing on your toes to peer over the rack and see that you're about eye level with her belly button right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, peer over the rack?  It occurs that since she's nearly doubled in size by now the weighs should look absolutely tiny in her hand, but from what you can tell it's been growing with her.  Now it dawns on you that she hasn't been growing - you've been shrinking!  With each rep she does more than you, you've lost an inch.  When you turn your head back to her directly she's just finishing up with her left hand, and your eyes are below the top of her taut butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that didn't look so hard did it?\" she asks teasingly, apparently unaware of your new situation.  Including the two from when she blocked your path earlier you'd say that you've lost 21\" already, making you a mere 42\" - three and a half feet tall.  You watch her bend over and momentarily tense up while she lifts a 20 pound weight off the rack for you and turns around.  Briefly she looks where you would have been before turning her head further down and spying you by her waist.  You look back up at her, feeling more than a little intimidated by your friend, and wait for her to say something.</span></div></div>",

Does she even notice that you're barely half her size now?  You wrap both hands around the weight's grip, your small fingers unable to reach all the way around it and get a solid hold.  As soon as Lynsey lets go of it the weight immediately slams to the floor, causing you to double over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strain as hard as you can to pick it back off the ground, but your little hands have trouble gaining proper leverage.  With a final pull you're able to lift it off the ground, but before you can stabilize yourself it falls back to the ground with a thud.  No matter how hard you try it might as well be bolted to the ground for all the chance you have of picking it back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even move it!\" you declare, looking back up at Lynsey.  You notice that she's standing there casually holding more in one hand than you can budge with two.  Before giving up you decide to give it a few more futile tugs, and to your horror you find the weight becoming even heavier in your hands as the grip widens.  Almost immediately you let go, when you stand you see the damage has been done, and now you only come up to around her mid thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just not using very good form,\" Lynsey explains as if she didn't see you shrink a foot.  \"Here, watch me again, and remember that it's all in your head.\"  She launches into another set, and you find yourself unable to look away even if it would help you.  With each curl you shrink another inch, the effects feeling more dramatic the smaller you become.  Before she's done with her right arm you've shrank below her knee, nearly at the bottom of her spandex pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost feel mesmerized as she continues, your eyes drawn up her body as she grows ever more massive compared to you.  Your monolithic friend's face appears serene as can be while you dwindle down toward nothing, apparently totally unaware of your plight.  In only a few reps you've shrank past her pants and continue diminishing along her shin, amazed at how enormous she's getting.  By the time she's done you can stand underneath her calf and lean against her ankle at a mere ten inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's easy!  Give it another shot,\" she implores.  You look back to the weight on the floor, now up to your shoulders, and immediately know that's a bad idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" you say.  \"That thing's heavy enough to crush me, there's no way I'll be able to lift it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynsey laughs and replies, \"C'mon little guy, I know you're short but you're not <i>that</i> short.\"  Does she really not see you down at her ankle?  \"Maybe if you stopped huffing helium you'd have better blood flow.\"  She looks down directly at you, your back resting against the top of her shoe.  \"But if you're really that opposed to more curls we could...\"</span></div></div>",

You groan as she gets a little bit larger just from that, and continues slowly stretching upward the whole time she walks it back to the rack.  She sets it back down in its place and picks up another one on the far end of the rack, the absolutely lowest weight possible.  Quickly she turns around and walks back to you, setting it down almost on top of your head.  By now you are only about as tall as her ankle bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and pick it up, just to make sure you can,\" Lynsey instructs.  \"I know it's ridiculous, but I'm trying to establish a baseline here.\"  The barbell itself comes up to your shoulders, and the rubber grip is about as thick as you are.  Lynsey stands with her feet on either side of the weight, her black sneakers sticking out past the discs while she patiently looks down at you.  In the presence of a woman looming over you, you have to at least try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck under the bar and brace your shoulders under it, bracing your legs so you can put as much power as you can into it.  With a grunt you push up, trying to squat the weight even half an inch off the floor.  Your legs shake while your back compresses, but the weight itself does not budge.  The harder you push the more you are able to straighten your legs, until you totally lose contact with the grip.  Desperate to at least nudge it you being pushing with your arms, until even your palms are unable to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynsey's fingers unexpectedly wrap around the grip, causing you to hurriedly jump out of the way.  She lifts it, allowing you to see her in full.  You may have only lost a few inches by doing that, but they were very important inches according to your new perspective.  Her black shoes alone rise high over  you, and Lynsey looks even more gigantic now, with her navel large enough for you to curl up in, and you can only gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you punking me, doll?\" Lynsey asks, her voice much more resonating and powerful now.  \"That was two and a half pounds, you have books heavier than that.  Hell, your clothes weigh more.  What gives?\"  You're unable to respond, even to run away, and simply stand there gaping up at how imposing Lynsey is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you manage a small squeak, drawing her attention back down to you.

The papers scattered all over the steps had her name on it: Naomi McLaughlin. Yeah, you remember her now! You managed to get a good look at her. Her face was kinda cute... and her long ginger hair was a nice feature. However, the rest of her body was definitely not as attractive. In a word, she was fat. In fact, her largest feature was her huge belly, which dwarfed her equally fatty breasts. Her shirt couldn't properly cover it, leaving her navel exposed to the world. At least her fat didn't make bumping into her hurt as much as it should have... Though, her skirt did a better job at covering her thighs. Even you had to admit, they were pretty nice at that size. You thought it was nice that she was roughly as short as you! You didn't have to look up at her to see eye to eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one thing you were confused about. If you both were at the same height, and you both were sitting down on the ground... then... how come your eyes were level with her breasts? Naomi didn't seem to notice because she was too busy ordering her papers. Meanwhile, you now had to look up at Naomi's breasts, and you were now internally panicking. Was she getting bigger? You looked to the side to see that the books and papers on the ground had grown too! She wasn't growing, you were shrinking! You were now at eye level with her belly button. Her breasts were now blocking most of Naomi's face, and you could only see her eyes. You called out for her, hoping to get her attention, but it was no use. Naomi was off in her own world, making sure her papers were nice and tidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were at her knees, and her gigantic belly now blocked Naomi's head altogether! It was like an ocean of flab that was partly blocking out the light! You kept getting smaller and smaller, until your shrinking got slower, and eventually stopped. You couldn't quite tell how tall you were right now, but that wasn't your concern right now! Naomi was the only witness to your shrinking, and you weren't even sure if she knew what happened to you!

Naomi made her way down the stairs, and you held onto her foot for dear life! Naomi's quick steps down the stairs tossed you around, but you somehow managed to hold on tight! You stayed on her ankle while Naomi kept walking. She eventually sat down on a bench and took something out of her backpack. You weren't sure why, but it definitely gave you an opportunity to get to a better spot! You looked up Naomi's leg. Sure, it was a daunting climb, but it seemed doable. However, you saw Naomi's backpack nearby. It would be a much easier climb and you can just rest while she takes you wherever. Then again, it might be harder to get Naomi attention in her backpack. Naomi was a little preoccupied with what she had in her hands. You probably had the time to climb up whatever you wanted...</span></div></div>",

If she didn't feel you climbing up her, you would have to get close to her face so she could hear you. Of course, you were hoping that she might notice you before then. You hopped up her ankle and then you climbed up the front of her leg. It was actually quite a long climb. You couldn't help but wonder what Naomi was so focused on that she wouldn't notice you climbing up her leg. Once you get up to Naomi's knee, you can see what she's so transfixed about. She's playing some sort of handheld video game. She looks really focused, but you could feel her twitch her leg as you climbed up her leg. Now you just had to walk across her thigh. Aside from the squishiness, it was much easier to travel across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached her torso, you got a new problem. Naomi must've been frustrated with her game, because she growled a bit and she shut the cover. Naomi was getting ready to stand up, and you were holding onto Naomi's skirt for dear life! Though, now you had to decide which way to go about climbing her... The safest way to go would probably be crawling underneath her skirt. That way, you would have less of a chance of falling off to your doom. Though, crawling on a girl's panties is definitely not the way to get her attention. There was another problem... Naomi's belly would be nearly impossible to climb in one go... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another way you could go. You could crawl around the outside of Naomi's skirt, and climb up her back. You were in danger of falling off, and getting squished if she laid down somewhere, but at least you won't be branded as a pervert if she felt you crawling over her panties... Naomi was getting up, so you only had a few moments to make your decision!</span></div></div>",

You covered your ears because it was so loud, and even louder since you were so tiny! \"W-What happened to you? Y-You're so tiny!\" Naomi said. She seemed a little afraid, was she scared of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have no idea!\" You reply. \"One moment, I was helping you pick up your papers, and the next, I was shrinking down! I don't know what's going on! How am I supposed to get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi had her hands covering her mouth. \"You poor thing...\" You were starting to freak out now. How would you live now? You were barely bigger than a quarter! You wouldn't last the rest of the day with all the people at the college! You'd be squished if you tried to enter a building at all! Life as you knew it was over! \"I-I could take care of you...\" Naomi said, as if she were reading your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at her. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It would be wrong to j-just leave you here. I'll take care of you, and I'll do whatever I can to get you back to normal.\" Naomi said, with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned by her generosity. \"You would do something like that for a complete stranger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi gulped and nodded. \"Yeah, like I said, it's the right thing to do...\" She said as she lowered her hand for you to climb on. You couldn't help but feel like there was a different reason why she was helping you, but you decided to take her up on her offer. You climbed up on her hand and sat down in the palm of her hand. She smiled warmly at you before placing you on her shoulder, next to her neck. You decided not to question her motives as Naomi went on her merry way. \"So, where are you taking me?\"</span></div></div>",

It's a stressful time, but you know you can get through it unless something goes catastrophically wrong.  Unfortunately as often does, something unexpected happens - you get shrunk to a very small size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI invite everyone to contribute who wants to, and bring your own giant women to the story, keeping in mind a few requests:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Write good chapters - At least a paragraph of legible English with some details.  I'm not expecting a magnum opus, just something that's easy and fun to read while painting a vivid picture.  Something should happen in each chapter beyond the very first introduction ones.<br>\r\n1a) Remember that they're characters, not measurements.  Each giantess has a personality that doesn't involve her bust size, and you can be more descriptive when describing it than \"34DD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No underage giantesses - I'd prefer to see none of the women under 18, and will reject anything with a giantess under 16.  I made the setting a college for a reason.  I'm open to bending on pretty much any guideline as long as there's reason except for this one.  Other than that, playful giantesses encouraged!  However I have nothing against gentle, uncaring, or needlessly cruel ones either, just write whatever floats your boat and is consistent with the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Most things are okay! - I realize this is a very broad fetish with many secondary or tertiary facets, and would like to respect that.  Whatever floats your boat!  I just ask that you keep bodily waste out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Endings are especially okay! - As long as they're telegraphed in advance, don't be afraid to end a particular line.  If you do so though, don't have it leap from a choice of opening a door to getting stepped on, and if writing an ending don't simply go \"she swallows you you're dead;\" see 1).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Have fun! - I know I sure do.  Let's come together and make an excellent, detailed story about shrinking around beautiful college girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is optional, but please let me know how I'm doing!  Send me reviews, let me know what you like and don't like, and if you have anything you want to see but are too shy to write it yourself, let me know.  I'm willing to accommodate most things.</td>",
