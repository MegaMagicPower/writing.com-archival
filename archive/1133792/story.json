How could so many people go missing?  It didn't make any sense.  Someone had to be behind this whole fiasco and Jack was determined to find out who.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we start?\" Jill asked him, already flipping through the missing persons reports.  \"That list is pretty long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jack agreed and sighed.  He didn't know where to start.  Any one of them was going to be a chore.  Not only did they have to look for clues, but they had to try and restore the order to the Tales that had gone awry without their heroes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to start with...</span></div></div>",

I need a good reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked at him, unamused.  \"Well for starters, without Little Red to come along and inspire the Woodsman to rid the world of the Big Bad Wolf, who isn't actually that bad of a guy, let me just say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a point here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill scoffed.  \"I'm getting to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get to it a little quicker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Jill crossed her arms over her chest.  \"Because the Woodsman isn't coming, Granny's sitting nice and cozy in the Big Bad Wolf's stomach.

After a few minutes of walking through the dense forest they came upon a very celestial looking log cabin. Jack led the way to the front door. He took a quick look and Jill, then knocked. Some rustling can be heard from inside the cabin. Finally the door pops open and staring back at the two sleuths was something they weren't expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" asked a tall, bearded man. He looked sort of like The Woodsman, but something was amiss. This man was the same height as The Woodsman, had the same thick, black beard, and even wore the same clothing. But this man did not possess the cut, chiseled physique that The Woodsman had. Simply put, this man was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, yeah,\" Jill said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for The Woodsman,\" Jack said. \"Ha..Have you seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearded man laughed in response. \"Seen him? I am him! What, do you want an autograph or something? You know, once upon a time I saved this old lady from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, we aren't autograph seekers,\" Jill said. \"Actually, we need your help Mr. Woodsman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need some trees felled? A cabin built?\" The Woodsman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jill answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we're looking for somebody,\" Jack said. \"A Miss Hood, Little Red Riding. We'd like to ask her grandma if she's seen her, since she's her only known living relative, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's currently in the Big Bad Wolf's belly? Sheesh, that wolf never learns. So lemme guess, you want me to save the grandma? Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack and Jill replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The faster the better,\" Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Woodsman thought for a moment, then answered...</span></div></div>",

After all, I'm very experienced when it comes to wolf catching,\" Wally said. And with that, the three set off to find the Big Bad Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after about a mile of walking, Wally suddenly stopped. He had been huffing and puffing ever since they left his cabin. \"Guys, *whew* lets take a rest,\" he wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Wally, we're not that much farther are we?\" Jill said. \"Besides, what about Red's poor grandma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this was a mistake!\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know we aren't far off, but I need the time to rest and plot my next move.

He took a seat on a tree stump and let out a loud sigh. \"These dogs sure are barking.\" He pointed to his feet and took off his shoes. \"Whew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up to Jill. \"Do we really have time for this? I mean seriously, Little Red Riding Hood is missing, grandma is about to be digested, and we're sitting here letting this overweight lumberjack rest. I say we leave him now, and go find BBW on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Jack, I feel the same way you do, but we need Wally. He defeated the wolf once and he can do it again,\" Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOOOOOWEEEE, smell these boots!\" Wally said.

JILL, WHERE ARE YOU?\" he bellowed, looking around frantically. Finally he looked up, and there in the tree was the blue-and-yellow, ex-school scarf she'd been wearing, tangled in the tree branches. Where had Jill gone? Peering up into the tree again, he realized what looked like a grin was forming out of thin air, on top of the old scarf. Slowly, an entire face formed, and as he watched in fascination the rest of the creature appeared too. Flashing its teeth in a way entirely different to Johnny's grin, the Cheshire Cat smirked down at Jack, purring loudly. \"What happened to Jill\" he called up to it, knowing it knew where his partner had gone. \"Before the Court, to stand against the Queen Herself, no less\" it chuckled, obviously deeply satisfied at the turn of events. \"But... but...\" Jack stuttered, astounded by this revelation. \"But... she's on THIS case, not some trial for an old queen of some distant land!\" The cat considered this, kneading the knitted fabric of the scarf thoughtfully. \"The Queen of Hearts waits for no man\" it intoned, yawning so that its many vicious fangs could be seen. \"So says the White Rabbit, and not even the great Jack himself can deny it.\" \"Me?\" the detective, Jack, asked, puzzled.\"The Jack of legend, of flaming towns and swirling blades, who comes upon the turn of the tide. Jack, whom the Queen locked back in the worlds from which He came. And Jill, key to the case, is key to the chest that binds Him unto His enforced slumber.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jack puzzled over the mystery of Jill's disappearance, something rather more sinister was about to begin. In a world much older than Jack's; a world laid over his own, that was invisible and untouchable, darkness gathered. In a palace far from the point corresponding to Jack's location, the Court met, to discuss the fate of the Key. \"The previous events are of no consequence\" a deep, earthy voice spoke from beneath the owner's cloak. \"The girl; the Key, must be retrieved, and prevented from fulfilling her potential. I say we eliminate the threat, and destroy her\". Another voice spoke up, similar to the first. \"The Queen of Hearts, the Key to the Chest, Jack of Spades and our own Void, are all inexorable\" it said slowly, it's eyes burning blue beneath the shielding cloth.\"So says the Courts of old, and who are we to deny them?\" Beside him, seated upon a hard granite throne, a figure sat up. Her crown, wrought from the twisted hearts of men, glinted in the half-light as the Queen of Hearts raised her head. A new voice, as cold and hard as steel, rose up above the murmurings of her Court. \"The Key cannot be truly killed by any, mortal or lord. You speak the truth, Lord Cairn. Her, Jack of Spades and I are somewhat indestructible. As for the Void... we are no longer known by that name. As of last Sun-Return, the Great Jester stripped us of the title, since we have not had a Spade on the throne for nigh on a millennium, though I plan to keep it that way. Once again, we are Wonderland\". After the moment of silence that followed her words, Lord Cairn spoke again. \"The Key, Your Majesty?\" The Queen thought for a moment, her sharp features softened by the smoke-laden air surrounding them. Then she spoke, and this time with a voice tinged with boredom: \"I have decided. Once captured, we shall hold the Key in Deep Seven, thus keeping her from releasing Jack of Spades. Septus\" she nodded to a skeletal figure waiting by her side. \"Find the girl, and bring her to me. Orchus\" here, she pointed to another hooded form. \"Check on my Lord Jack; ensure he still sleeps\". With that, she was suddenly gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, the usually reserved Court began to chatter. \"Deep Seven?\" They all wondered, shaking their heads. A barrel-chested warrior spoke up. \"The Lord of Spades is kept in Chamber Two down there... supposing the Queen takes the Key down, what if they react? He'd be free...\" All present shuddered, remembering their part in confining Jack of Spades. His retribution would be terrible; how could the Queen risk it? The Deep Quarantine Chambers, or DQC, were where enemies of the Ruler that were not to be executed were held. In Deep Four, the Mad Hatter languished along with nine other souls, jailed for causing Her Majesty displeasure.In Deep Seven, however, there were only two chambers. From far back in the mists of time, there had always been the Powers: the Jester, the Queen of Hearts, the Jack of Spades, the Knave of Diamonds and the Knight of Clubs. Each Power had a Key; a person solely dedicated to the restoration of them, for each Key was only born if a Power was denied. Locked in an infinite sleep, the Jack of Spades was in line for a Key. The Queen and the Jester were the ones who ruled, thus not requiring a Key; the Queen held Wonderland, the Jester held Earth, and the other Powers went by different titles and occupations. The Knave of Diamonds was known as the Mad Hatter, and had his estate in the Wild Woods bordering Wonderland, although he was currently  under temporary arrest. The Knight of Clubs traveled under the name the White Rabbit, and ruled the Under-lands. And Jack, if freed, would rule them all. Thus He was kept in Deep Seven, the safest place in all Wonderland, and also the best guarded, for the Queen could not afford for Him to escape, for her and the Jester would be banished to the Nether Realms, where all Powers were originally formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down in the bowels of the earth, suspended in His slumber, the Lord of Spades dreamed of the boy searching for his lost partner, and smiled in His sleep. Jack Crown, in the Other World, stumbled desolately down a dusty track, facing a new case to solve. He had to find the Court, and get Jill back. After all, he reasoned, good assistants were hard to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could remember a sandstorm, screaming birds, a panicked Jack... and then darkness. She went to rub her blurry eyes, then found her arms were somehow strapped tightly to her sides. <br>\r\nBlinking, Jill felt dizzy as the room swam into view, then wished she hadn't woken up. \"Took you long enough\" an amused, somewhat ironic female voice said, coming nearer as she felt footsteps come towards her. Cool fingers carefully brushed the remaining dust from her eyes as Alice of Wonderland loomed high above her, her gray-blue eyes triumphant as she surveyed her captive. Struggling against her bonds, Jill tried to sit up, but found she couldn't quite balance, and slipped back to the wooden floor. <br>\r\n\"Would you like some help?\" Alice asked, and without waiting for a reply grasped Jill's elbows and firmly levered her upright. <br>\r\n\"That's better. Sorry about the straitjacket; it's just a precaution, you know? Can't have you attempting to break free, now that I've found you.\" <br>\r\nSwallowing her confusing, Jill found her voice. \"And why am I here?\" she asked, looking round for an escape route. <br>\r\nThere were none to be seen. Alice took her time answering, pacing up and down the underground room as she thought up a reply. <br>\r\n\"Well, you are the last Key, you know. No more can ever be born; for once the sleeping Lord is wakened He'll never sleep again\". Thoroughly confounded, Jill remained silent, and after a moment Alice continued: <br>\r\n\"I was the White Rabbit's Key, on that first venture into Wonderland. I was from Earth, like you, until they claimed me as his Key, but now I'm a retired Power since I fulfilled my duty. But, now that I've found you, I can't let you fulfill yours.\" J<br>\r\nill looked at Alice questioningly, her eyes troubled, and Alice went on: \"I'm a little sorry about this, but I can't let you free Jack of Spades. He'll absorb the White Rabbit's territory into His own, and since the White Rabbit gave me a patch to myself He will take that too. So you're trapped down here for good, since you can't really die, and anyway I'd not want to kill you, since in a way I think you're like me. Better get used to this room, kid. It's your world now\". <br>\r\nHaving explained, Alice left Jill to her own devices, and Jill realized that Alice had meant it. but on the bright side, she reasoned, she'd found Missing 'Hero' No. 21. If only Jack knew... suddenly she wondered what had happened to Jack. \"I hope he's okay!\" she muttered under her breath, then turned to the pressing question of Keys. What was a Key? What was a 'Jack of Spades'? Was it her Detective Jack? Why was Alice behaving weirdly? Jill slowly forced herself onto her feet, and started towards where Alice had gone, intending to get answers.</span></div></div>",

Slowing as it neared the rock, the beast looked around quickly before darting into a well-concealed cave. <br>\r\nTied to the creature's back was a screaming, howling red bundle. Standing up on it's hind legs, it swung its writhing burden onto the floor, and busied itself making its dinner. \"WOLF!\" the little bundle screamed, managing to free one if its limbs. \"UNTIE ME AT ONCE, YOU FIEND!\" <br>\r\nThe Wolf yawned, picked at his teeth a little, and went back to his cooking. In a small pot, he stirred a meaty broth, regretting stealing the hysterical little girl. Who happened to be a practising member of one of the largest karate clubs in Wonderland, hence the bruises he could feel as he stirred his pot. <br>\r\n\"Shut the hell up, Red!\" he snarled at the flailing bundle, waving his wooden spoon threateningly at her. <br>\r\nShe looked at the large collection of nunchucks, star blades, and daggers arraying the western wall of his cave. She wriggled round to stare at the painting of death on the wall. Then she laughed. <br>\r\nMr Wolf felt exasperated. How was he supposed to be scary when everyone laughed at him? Was it his beautiful honey-coloured eyes, his mother's pride and joy? Was it the small bald patch on the top of his head, from where he'd scalded it on the Three Little Pig's caudron of soup? Or was it the way his partner in the back of the cave snored? What ever it was, he was sick of it. What was the point of being a wolf if he wasn't frightening? <br>\r\nHaving already sufficiently frightened Red the last time she visited dear old Granny, he'd thought it would be a piece of cake, scaring her again. Thought admittedly, he thought, that was seven years ago and Red had grown up since then, being now 18, a karate champion and a mean cupcake-baker to boot. <br>\r\nTurning back to Red, who was still laughing uncontrollably, he decided to take action. She was firmly bound he reasoned, and unable to beat the living daylights out of him, so he went for revenge. Hovering over her for a moment, he choose to boot her very, very hard in the stomach. <br>\r\nThat would show the swine. However, what he hadn't done was take into account her awesome karate skills, and more importantly, her flailing arm. Waiting until Mr Wolf was just about to kick her, Red struck. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Wolf felt a blinding pain erupt from his groin. \"AHHHHHHHHHHH!\" he yelled, scrabbling back from the girl as fast as she could, tears filling his eyes. From the back of the cave came a drawn-out yawn, and his partner emerged, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \"Wolfy, what's wrong?\" he asked, extending a paw to pull Mr Wolf upright. <br>\r\n\"Little brat punched me in the nuts!\" Wolf coughed, his legs tightly crossed. <br>\r\nRed saw Wolf's partner, and began to cackle again. \"GAY!\" she shrieked, rolling on the cave floor in mirth. \"Ha; I knew it!\"<br>\r\nGoing as red as was possible for a wolf, Mr Wolf blushed. \"Red, I'd like you to meet Alfred\" he said, pointing to the grey wolf beside him. Turning to Alfred, he pointed to the laughing girl and introduced Red to him. \"Alfred, this is Red, formerly known as Little Red Riding Hood, four times Karate Kid of the Year, recently awarded Guides Wonderland, who is a senior Ranger, and also a leading junior reporter\". <br>\r\nAlfred whistled, clearly impressed. \"You forgot one\" said Red, untying herself with her free arm. \"Cousin to Alice of Wonderland\". \"Yes, yes\" interrupted Alfred. \"But where are we to keep our guest?\" <br>\r\nNow freed of her bonds, Red stood up. \"Awww; isn't that cute! Wolfy found a friend!\" she said, looking Alfred up and down. \"Oh, come on, Wolfy. We shall simply have to let her go\" Alfred looked over at Mr Wolf. \"She'll come between us; the togetherness we have. Off you go, little girl\".<br>\r\nAgreeing somewhat with his mate, Mr Wolf led Red to the cave entrance to let her go. \"But don't you dare tell\" he growled, once out of earshot from Alfred. \"We have a nice lifestyle, peaceful, like, and I'll not have you ruining it\". He looked menacingly at Red, willing her to agree.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Wolfy\" Red sang airily, pleased to have met a real live all-male marrige. \"But don't harrass my Granny ever again\". Conceeding to this, he went back into his cave, shaking his shaggy head, and Red went on her way.</span></div></div>",

Vague visions of fire, sharply contrasted against darkness, filled His mind as His sub-conscious dwelt on His past lives. The world burnt again, the sounds of screaming villagers rising in His ears like it did so long ago. But who had begun the chaos? It was this point that He dwelt on always, trapped as He was in the long hours of sleep.<br>\r\nA blurred face, streaked with blood and dirt... the dull thump of an exploding cannon, the shrill keening of a weeping winner. But who had won the war? Why the bitter sorrow, painted across the conquerer of the worlds in blue and grey?<br>\r\nUnable to truly awake, Jack of Spades found Himself thinking. At last! he thought, then wondered, why? There was a change in the pattern, He decided. A rift; a frayed thread in the fabric of reality. All of Wonderland had descended from those who survived the war, and it was they who wove the pattern now. Not mighty sorcerers, twisting the strands of the weave until they distorted and warped, but the remaining creatures; those who had become the so-called 'fairy tale heroes'. So what was wrong with them? It seemed to Jack  that there was almost something missing, like a whole lifetime of memories had been found to have been misplaced or lost. Indeed, that WAS reality; He couldn't even remember why He was here, where ever here was. Or who He was... suddenly a strange thought entered His mind: was He a he? 'Jack' implied a certain male element, but He doubted He could go by that alone... but He just had to escape this dreamstate. Unknown to Him though, help was on its way. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The aforementioned help, however, had found itself in quite some trouble. Finding her attempts to free herself from the straitjacket fruitless, Jill cautiously followed after Alice, thinking very rude and vengeful thoughts against her red-haired captor. The sound of running water could be heard, masking both her and Alice's footsteps, and soon she was lost in the maze of tunnels that linked the chambers in Alice's domain. \"Oh yes, Jill, VERY well done\" she muttered to herself sarcastically, trying to keep track of the twists and turns in case she needed to backtrack pronto. The air became colder, and soon she realized that the scanty light from candles set into the walls was fading as she passed the last of them. Was she reaching the surface, or going deeper in? Feeling particularly negative because of her current captivity, Jill decided on the latter. Treading lightly on the slightly soft soil, straining her ears for any sound, Jill was so intent on being silent and listening for others that she didn't realize Alice was ahead, and watching her, til she found herself reeling back after bowling Alice over. \"Oi!\" Alice snarled, trying to regain her footing. \"Sorry; got to go\" Jill said, and wished she'd said something a bit more intelligent, just as a parting shot. Then she was off, up towards the glorious light that proved her wrong, leaving Alice in her wake. Exulting in her escape, Jill stumbled across the dew-laden grass of the outer world, pleased with her small success, planning what to do next. But her new-found freedom didn't seem so certain, when after a sweet moment of brief peace, Alice came hurtling out of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face her, Jill glared defiance at the other girl, annoyed at the impending imprisonment that threatened to put an end to her endeavors. \"Now, you'll come along quietly, yes? Like before\" Alice asked, her teeth bared in a feral grin as she watched Jill eye her warily. \"Oh, but this time I beg to differ\" Jill tartly replied, then stared in amazement at the change her words had inspired in Alice. What began as a silent heaving of the shoulders erupted into a full-hearted chuckle as Alice laughed. \"You are still straitjacketed, don't know where you are, have a price on your head and you're trying to escape? Oh, but that's just too ironic for words\". Jill stopped her glaring momentarily to consider this strange revelation. A price on her head? As unfortunate as it was, she decided she'd have to postpone her escape long enough to hear the explanation owing on the topic.  \"Do explain\" she said with as much venom she could muster, then settled on the damp grass to hear the reply. Her hands up in front of her in a gesture of peace, Alice came and sat down beside her. \"In short, the Queen in her infinite wisdom has placed a bounty on your head. 'Dead or Alive' I believe she stated, although you technically can't be killed unless you are back in your own world, where ever that may be.\"<br>\r\n\"Dead or alive? That's just a little bit OTT, don't you think?\" Jill sighed sadly, wondering what the world was coming to. \"Maybe, but I don't think she minds if whoever catches you tries to kill you, since she's fond of torture. Finds it quite enjoyable, or so I'm told. Point is, don't you think you'd be safer locked away in a cell somewhere in my turf, rather than being hunted and chased all over Wonderland?\" Jill pondered this for a bit, turning the fresh scenario over in her mind, trying to find an angle that suited her best.<br>\r\n\"I don't have too much of a choice in this, do I?\" She asked, knowing what the answer would be. Confirming her suspicions, Alice nodded, and stood ready to escort Jill back to her new home. 'THAT was pointless then' Jill thought glumly, wondering what to do now. The future seemed so bleak, what with the whole 'kept like Alice's pet' thing, and all. Sighing deeply, her thoughts turned to Jack.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could he forget that the Granny was in the middle of being digested? That was <i>really </i>embarrassing. He was the Sherlock, wasn't he?

Go on, drink some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        By the time Jack realized that something about this situation just wasn't right, he was already slipping into a stupor. The last thing he saw before going unconscious was the witch's ugly face leaning over him, her great worty nose obscuring almost all of his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Thought I might get the bounty on you fairy tale types. Didn't think I'd notice you had your own story once? I see everything you fools!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         And with that, she let out her resounding evil cackle, the ever so annoying type. Jack would have been glad he was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         *******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Jack awoke slowly, feeling hard manacles around his wrists and a hard, cold floor beneath his feet. Apparently he was chained to a wall. Groggily, he opened his eyes and willed himself to see. Slowly, the details of his predicament came into view. He was in a small, dirty tower with small bits of disgusting cloth and straw littering the floor. Rats scurried to and fro, oblivious to the what they were wallowing in, squeaking out information to their brethren.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      Finally, his vision cleared completely and he was able to make out the blurry form chained across the room from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Jill! What happened? Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      No answer. Apparently she was still knocked out from the witch's unholy brew. In frustration, he rattled his chains and angrily sighed. It looked like they were stuck here... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Then Jack noticed the effect his shaking had on the chains. They were a great deal looser. He looked up, to where they were planted in the wall and noticed the old, crumbling stone around the emplacements. It didn't look very stable and he was sure with a few good shakes, they would come right off...  </span></div></div>",

But we've escaped! Now, let's find a way out of here so we can report the witch to the authorities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack broke down the old, wooden door and led Jill down the long, dark halls until they found their freedom. Only once outside, they didn't know where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go straight through the woods until we come off on the other side,\" Jill suggested. So they walked through the woods for what seemed like hours before finally reaching the town on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed straight to the Fairytale Land Police Station to report what they've learned. After informing the police of the witch's evil deeds, the sheriff shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry kids, but it wasn't the witch who kidnapped you. Or at least, she isn't the once who kidnapped the other characters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBewildered, Jill cried, \"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" the sherriff replied. \"The mirror on the wall was just in here this morning to report that the witch, herself, has been abducted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witch?\" Jack demanded. \"But-\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"She's a fairytale character, too, afterall,\" the Sheriff pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow more confused than ever, Jack turned to Jill and asked, \"Now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it wouldn't be the vile witch that returned but instead a possible ally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting went on some time and he hooed, hummed and hollered for Jill to wake up, but to no avail. \"Will we ever get out of here?\" he asked himself from his classic dank dungoun bondage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it occured to him. \"Strike the Light!\" He actually said outloud. \"Rats! For one, if they can get into and out of this dungoun, maybe there is some way that they can help and two, who would have a better lead on the Pied Piper himself than them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling down to that rats, Jack tried to get them to take some notice of him in his shackles.

Well, you see, they had heard the Tweet-twee-spit... well, you get the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jack's surprise, the rats, which had been scurrying at random around the floor all began to huddle together in some sort of odd rodent conference.

When Jack gave her a look (which she could sum up in a four-letter word), she spurted, \"I'm so sorry, but we need to know. For the investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Majesty seemed peeved, but nodded to concede. \"We did not give him the full details, but he seemed cognizant of her anger. Seems she tried to have an innocent girl shot down by pirates and even Peter's own Lost Boys.\" A thought seemed to have occurred to her and she lost a bit of her anger. \"They will probably have seen him last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did <i>you</i> see him last?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few months ago. The poor boy looked frazzled. He has that job, you know, escorting the souls of murdered children on their way to the next world, and it seemed to be taking a toll on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escorting the souls of murdered children?\" Jill asked, more to herself than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that he minds. He's got a good heart, that boy. He wants children to be lost on their terms, not someone elses. Does that make any sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering the source, yes.\" Jack said. \"Did he say anything specific?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He'd just had a few rough nights that week. Or so he said. My Court Magician thinks he was suffering from dehydration and insomnia due to the side effects of a type of Lover's Draft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A love potion?\" Jill asked, again more to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why <i>else</i> would he let that little so-and-so stick around so long?\" The Queen snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty.\" Jack bowed and flashed her his best grin. \"We are greatly in debted to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill bowed. \"Yes, thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gathered the dust into a silk bag the Queen's courtesean brought them and left the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A love potion?\" Jill said. \"What do you think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's been drugging him to get him to stay with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she can't possibly hope to have a relationship with a prepubescent boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stopped on the street and gave her a hard look. \"Yeah. A fairy is slipping a human love potions and age is the problem? You are a strange individual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill scoffed. \"Okay, for one thing, who said Pan was even human? And for another, if she's slipping him love potions, what else would she be after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she'd be crazy to attempt a romantic relationship,\" Jack began. They continued walking back to their office. \"And she surely knows that. So she's probably tweaking the potion. Lover's Draft isn't a potion for true love, it's for infatuation. It wouldn't be that hard, especially for a someone who specializes in brewery and herbs, to tweak the potion so that it will cause an intense longing for the brewer's presence, but with no romance in it at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill considered this for a moment. \"What do we know about Tinkerbell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed to the police station on Drury Lane. At this hour, just before dusk, the street didn't have much traffic. The usual steady flow in and out of the Muffin Man's shop was about all. They took the back door into the basement and drudged around for Tinkerbell's file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is!\" Jack pulled out a bright purple folder with yellow glitter. \"Let's see. Birthname: Amalthea Tinkerbell of Dragon's Wort, full title: the Right and Honorable Lady Amalthea Tinkerbell Tarragon, Duchess Tarragon Second-Descending. Father is the Honorable Bromios Redthumb, the Duke of Tarragon, Mayor of Dragon's Wort. Mother is Her Highness Sarah Merriweather, Duchess of Chives in Puzzlewood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy bloodlines she's got, there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says here she was sent to a nunnery for fighting with the girls at her grammar school. After she left, she fell in with the court of the Fairydom of Never-Never and took to the boy who became the new Pan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few citations for disturbing the peace, one assault and battery with a frilly weapon...oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here that the King of Never-Never indicted her on two counts attempted girlslaughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that even an applicable legal term?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is in Never-Never. The report says that she attempted to have a certain Wendy Darling of Kensington shot down, first by the crew of the Jolly Roger, and again the same day by the Lost Boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen mentioned that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack closed the file. \"Let's go upstairs and get some supplies for the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs, they met Detective Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Knavey! What's going on?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming down to get Puss' boots out of evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got any leads on him?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we found him already. Turns out it's hard to tell one cat from another when the only distinguishing characteristic is the boots, which we had, so when he came to report them stolen, it was pretty easy to find him.\" He spun on his heels once and proceeded down the steps. They watched him go and when he got to the floor and was out of sight, Jack muttered, \"The transfers from Wonderland are always so spaced out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So for food, should we go to the Muffin Man or grab whatever's in the lounge?\" Jill asked.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s closer than anywhere else but the bottom of the garden \u2013 and I for one don\u2019t want to have to shake any fairies down for their dust. They can give a nasty nip!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. The wishing well,\u201d agreed Jack, just relieved that Jill hadn\u2019t been too scathing about his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set out toward the centre of town, lilac cobbles paving their way. If the Well-genie was in a good mood, they could have the fairy-dust in a matter of minutes. Of course, it all depended on how much djinn-juice he\u2019d been drinking the night before. They\u2019d just have to hope they got lucky, that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there, however, it became obvious that something bigger than the search for fairy-dust was going on here. A crowd of onlookers were trying to out-shout each other and there was something in the centre of the circle, beside the well itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wasted no time, pushing through the crowd\u2026 and Jill was right behind him. Thus, her nose hit him in the small of the back as he came to a sudden halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d she said, in a slightly nasal voice. Then she saw what he was looking at and her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the centre of the circle stood two\u2026 things! Loosely speaking, Jill supposed they were human-ish, but no human she\u2019d ever seen had green warty skin, bulbous eyes and a bright-red inflatable throat and chest. They looked like the human equivalent of toads, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned. \u201cFrogs. Don\u2019t tell me \u2013 the Frog Prince is missing too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet he\u2019s gone missing!\u201d croaked one of the huma-frogs. \u201cThree days and he hasn\u2019t been back once to see how his poor old mother\u2019s doing. Leaves me to take care of the well without so much as a \u2018by your leave!\u2019 Who\u2019s going to scrape up the well scum \u2013 that\u2019s what I want to know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Jack, helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-thing glared at him, then shrugged and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was out at the edge of the well, looking to see where my son had got to\u2026 lousy good-for-nothing toad that he is\u2026 and the next thing you know, some passing Princess with gender blindness has picked me up and planted a smacker on my lips. Then, she turns into <i>that</i> \u2013 and I turn into <i>this</i> \u2013 and now I can\u2019t get back into my well and she\u2019s talking law-suits and treason charges. As if it was <i>my</i> fault she sexually assaulted me. Pah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked at the creature sympathetically. \u201cOh, you poor thing! Jack \u2013 we can\u2019t just leave them like this \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack winced. Where animals were concerned, Jill was often far too sympathetic for her own good. \u201cI thought we were supposed to be tracking down Peter Pan?\u201d he said, helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND setting the other fairy-tales back on their track,\u201d reminded Jill, bristling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d sighed Jack. \u201cHere\u2019s what I suggest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jill was on the princess in a second and started wrestling her to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned back to the witch, whose eyes were tearing, and added his own too-loud laughter to her high-pitched shrieks of mirth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was a good one!\" said the Witch of the West, wiping a tear from her eye. \"Do you want to hear another good one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and said a shade too brightly, \"Why yes, of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see...\"      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
