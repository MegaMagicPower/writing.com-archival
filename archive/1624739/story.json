She was also a very thin girl. She was actually *too* thin according to her Doctor. She'd inherited her Mother's (un)naturally thin body and her taste for gothic romance, which did tend towards forgoing meals in a fit of emotion. Fortunately, she'd also inherited her mother's all-consuming love of chocolate and her father's thousand recipes. As a matter of fact, since her parents had died recently, (well, not so recently, she'd spent a year in mourning dress, writing poetry by her parent's graves and nearly starving herself by forgetting to eat several times) she had also inherited...</span></div></div>",

She looked inside and was utterly unsurprised to see no one at all. The old stone floor was covered with a dusty rug and the walls with antique tapestries. There were many doors in the room, and a grand set of stairs at the other end, that split in two halfway up. She walked in and stroked a tapestry with a hand. It left dark marks on her fingers, but she didn't mind. There was so much history here, so many generations of ancestors here to welcome her. In fact, there was one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of her nerve to keep her appearance of gothic wistfullness when she realised that she had seen a translucent white ghost appear before her very eyes. She couldn't keep her voice from cracking with a mixture of fear and delight as she spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, oh, spirit of restful death. What doth such a shade ask of their humble mortal brethren?\"</span></div></div>",

You look like you could really use it to! You're all skin and bones, not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's a little bit worrying when you ain't dead yet!\" The spirit of the night was a large woman, who was called jolly when she was alive, but would have been called obese if she lived now. This wasn't going quite how Violet planned, but it was true. She was dangerously underweight. Maybe she could be goth and still eat well, if the cook was a ghost? She certainly couldn't turn down her friend, since she'd been here a lot longer than Violet had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I am a little hungry.\" Violet admitted, while her stomach growled like a hungry lion with the first mention of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a little, I'd wager. And if not, I reckon you oughta be!\" The cook shooed Violet into the dining room. Her touch was like ice, but somehow friendly all the same. She pulled out a chair by waving at it and called \"Alfie!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ma'am?\" A deep voice came booming through the room from nowhere. \"Ah, I see we have a guest. My apologies for not attending the door myself, I was currently possessing the cellar, attempting to take stock of the wine.\" At some point he must have manifested in person because his voice gradually grew more quiet, and more focused. It was behind Violet's left shoulder. He leant down from his height of six foot four to speak to her. She was only five foot tall. \"If Madam would care to be seated?\" Violet sat. \"Then I expect you have some questions, while Cook prepares a meal?\" Violet span around in time to see Cook disappear into the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Clearly, her parents had taught her well. And the fact that she asked for their names so soon was a very good sign. \"I am Alfred. Or Alfie, if you would prefer. Mr Deets if we have company, please. But, if you would be so kind, never EVER call me Alf. It holds bad memories for me.\" He paused for her to ask the awkward question of whether it had to do with his death or simply *that* TV show. When she didn't ask it, his esteem for her grew all the more. \"Cook's name is Deborah, or Debbie, or Mrs Hanson if we have company. She also has a fondness for nicknames, both giving them to people and recieving them. She may refer to me as Pebble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about Violet's parents for about a half hour, till Deborah came in with the food. She'd clearly learnt a lot from Violet's father, about Violet inheriting her mother's sweet-tooth, and her addiction to chocolate, as well as many of his chocolate-filled recipes designed specifically to indulge that need. Although she had only two hands, she was somehow carrying three trays of food, all coated with the rich brown colouring of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had one tray with four different large chocolate milkshakes, another tray holding a large cake lined with thick chocolate cream, and a third tray that fit three chocolate coated donuts and a large unopened box of actual chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet tried to protest, \"I couldn't possibly eat that much. Even if it is chocolate.\" Unfortunately for her protest, just the sight of that much chocolate had started her salivating wildly, so much so that when it came to actually saying the word 'chocolate' she literally drooled onto her chin. Alfie had already prepared a napkin and swiftly wiped the drool from her face with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCook ignored her, putting the trays down before her at the head of the table and saying: \"Now, we both know that's not true, dear. In fact, you just holler if you want anymore, alright? I can summon up more ingredients in a jiffy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie spread a cloth over Violet's lap, then thought better of it and tucked one under her chin like a bib, too. The staff ghosts sat down to watch their young mistress enjoy her meal.</span></div></div>",

She begins stuffing her face with slices of rich, moist, chocolate sponge cake, then an enormous donut, then more cake, and bit of the shake to wash it down with. Her cheeks were filling up with food and it was smearing over her lips, even dribbling a line of milkshake down the side of her chin. She didn't stop. She didn't even seem to notice what a mess she was making on her face. She just kept stuffing herself with cake, and donuts and milkshake. She stopped for a second just long enough to undo the clothes she wore a little and wipe her mouth on the back of an arm. Of course she soon demolished the donuts and consumed every crumb of cake. She had one last shake left, when she picked up the box of chocolates. They were all her favourites, of course, made to the recipes left by her father. She flung chocolates into her mouth one after another after another, chewing them all at the same time, and swallowing occasionally. Soon, she had finished the first layer, and flung the wrappers to one side to get at the second layer. Then, because her maid was no fool, she found a third layer and consumed that almost as quickly as the first two, before grasping the final litre of thick chocolatey shake and drinking the whole thing without stopping. She sat back with a sigh of contentment and a huge smile, one which was absolutely *covered* in chocolate. She absent-mindedly wiped her mouth again on her arm, noticed the chocolate on it, and licked it off.</span></div></div>",
