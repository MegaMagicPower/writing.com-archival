They said that this creature is the goddess and queen of their city, and that everyone honors her and praises her for the things that she does. Legend has it that this creature has been borned out of ancient magic that was use by the Kenzo army during the Imperial War, (alternative history here). They needed something to prevent their city from being taken over, so they created Shizuha, or Togera, and she easily defeated the invading army. Everyone was in marvel of her, and then named her the goddess and queen of Kenzo. She is a fair queen, but can be ruthless at times. She rules Kenzo, Japan with an iron fist, and allows no enemy to come to Kenzo, etc. Still, she is kind and noble, and would help the people, and that's is where she gets her respect. Somehow her clothing changed as time went on, so she now wears what she wears. Somehow her form comes with green scales on her hands, feet, and even a tail that can turn into a spike weapon. She still rules Kenzo to this day, but does go to other cities, and is well respected by them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?</span></div></div>",

Some just saw better Kaiju girls than her. This made Miko really disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, this one is over her head. I like Soyaka better since she less of a narcissist.\", said a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.

She has slain powerful kaiju girls and immortals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well I can do twice of what she can do since I have the power that it two times stronger than any other Kaiju girl out there..\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Miko with doubt. The girl just crossed her arms with an embarrassed look and turns back to normal. Miki glared at her sister for her behavior and tells everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for my sister's behavior. She can be a bit over the top at times.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently everyone is falling over her. Some say that they find her pretty in her dress in her Kaiju form, some say she's cute, while others say that she is so awesome. Miko then got jealous of her sister's fame while Miki tries to escape from their wraith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you look pretty when you fight.\", said a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ten times better than your sister.\", said a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thank you all. Now if you excuse me, I need to go.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of that, they left the place. They try to outrun the crowd and manage to do so after running for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven minutes.\", said Miki, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do much more than that at school.\", said Miko, \"So tell me, what's your secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You manage to get everyone go ga ga over you.

With our will power and determination, nothing can stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except on where is Soyaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where your wrong.\", said Miko as she showed her sister the newspaper of Soyaka in a town nearby theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki replied with a face palm. The two fused together with Miko in control and they dashed to where Soyaka lives. Miki in the inside felt that this was a really bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar, Soyaka was finishing up fighting a Kaiju with no problem since she was an experience fighter for a year. Miko then tapped the Kaiju girl on the shoulder and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Are you Soyaka?\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, who might you be?\", asked Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Double. Double the trouble. I'm the new hero in town and with my sister fused with me, we stop evil wherever it might be. Today, were here to prove to the world that were the greatest.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice to have new allies.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant. I want to fight you and make everyone think that I'm the best.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", asked Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki then got in control and in a new outfit. Miko as a transparent head looks at her sister with a pouty expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about my sister's attitude. She's a bit egotistic.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You changed. Its as if your two people in one.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko then got in the control and looked at the sided saying, \"Geez sis, what's up with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking two?\", asked Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister\", said Miko, \"Now its time to kick some ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko launch herself to Soyaka, but the kaiju girl blocked it and blew a hyper beam out of her mouth. Miki is in control and immediately used her counter which blasted Soyaka in the face. The force pushed Miki back as the girl struggle to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko got control and shot some energy balls at Soyaka who only deflected it and punched the girl really hard. Soyaka then tries to make another punch, but Miko released a powerful shock wave which pushed Soyaka away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople that saw this made bets on who would win. No one has ever seen a fight as epic like this in a while, with two heroes clashing at each other. Some took pictures while others ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko then charges up an aura made of literally pure will and synchronization with her sister. Soyaka was surprised to see someone charging up so much energy. Never has she seen a Kaiju girl do this before, not even Volt, the lightning lizard, charge up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready sis.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get this over with it.\", said Miki's transparent head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both show determination in defeating Soyaka as they sprinted through the streets and gave Soyaka fast punches and kicks. Soyaka turned into her cyborg form, but the fusion Kaiju girl were strong enough to bend her metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if your the good guy or not?\", asked Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'm the best hero out there.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why must we fight. We both desire justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just my way of saying to respect my authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka had no choice, but to use her goddess for. This was a time that she needed power. Miko was about to shoot a big laser and did. However, Soyaka turned into her goddess form and it blocked it. Soyaka released a big laser from her hands and mouth, and Miki got control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka blasted her beam and Miki closed her eyes and try to absorb the beam. She did and never had she felt a surge of energy in her. She thought that her power up with Miko was too much, but it was nothing compared to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka stopped and saw that Miki is all charged up and ready to fight. Miki jumped and threw a big punch at the Kaiju girl in the gut which made her fall down face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, we did it. We beat the legendary Soyaka!\", said Miko's transparent floating head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. She's standing.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka got up really angry for what they did and head butted the girl. Miki was taking all the punches and reflecting them back. Soyaka attacked with no fear and not even caring that she's in pain. The two fought until they decided to charge up their big attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko got control and used the power that Miki absorbed to released a big laser while Soyaka prepares a big attack. They shoot and the beams clashed and clashed until boom. Both of them were weaken and the fight ended with a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka shrunk down, while Miki and Miko defused. After all of that, Miko stood up and wants to do more despite of having no powers and is still human. She crawled up and punched the shrunken Soyaka. The punch wasn't that strong and raised her arm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I beat Soyaka!\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miko, you moron. We destroyed half the city.\", cried Miki trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko then tripped due to her injuries. The three girls were sent to the hospital and are in the same room. They got better and decided to talk for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you girls did was reckless?\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry. It was all my sister's fault.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went with it so you share part of the blame. Honestly, trying to stop you girls is like picking a needle in a haystack.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally won that battle.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news on the T.V. set apparently said the opposite and call Miko a sore loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they can go to hell.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayors of many cities came together and has something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We decided that after seeing this awesome fight, we should set up an arena where not only many competitive will happen, but also many fights with Kaiju girls in it.\", said the mayor of Fusion City, \"With our city's energy source, we can make this possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I found a way to earn money, I hope.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miko, we will not participate in that.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is going to get you your book?\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki paused and looked guilty. Soyaka was surprise to see why a girl like Miki would do all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the twins receive phone calls from their parents and Miko try to lie to them that Soyaka was brainwashed because she's stupid and the news has no idea what they are saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I remember those times where the news always do that to me as a child. They always either side with the monster or not understand at all, but you have to be more careful in your fights.\", said Miki <br>\r\nand Miko's mom in the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up and Miki sighed in relief. Soyaka was really offended with Miko's lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you say that?\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\", asked Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, I think we had a bad start. Let's introduce each other properly. I'm Soyaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Miko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Miki, her twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that we can get along in the future.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...</span></div></div>",

Before that, Viola released a special type of unknown spore and Volt used her electricity at Mist and suddenly Mist grew bigger. Her body became cloud like and is twice the size as she is. About 600 or 700 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka used this as a chance to blast Volt with her lase and made her flinch. Mist threw a cloud bomb which Miki deflected and it got Viola. From Viola's knit bag fell off the book that Miki wanted. Miki wanted to grab it, but Miko took over and use her energy balls to blast both Viola and Volt. At the same time destroying the book that Miki wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

No longer am I just air.\", said Mist while throwing a powerful punch at Soyaka and kicked Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Kaiju girls shot their lasers and it went through them. Soyaka used her dragon form to blow fire, but it only wen through Mist. The fire was not big enough to defeat Mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki then took over to explain something for Soyaka. From what she saw what, she observe the place where Mist was hit and made an conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soyaka, fire is her weakness, but your flames are too small.

She also has a sister that she fuses with just so they can be a Kaiju girl.

You'll just be as bad as these bad people.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko regrets about what she said, but the girl just does so. Everyone in the area woke up and started to run for their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl comes up to the twins and the shadow Kaiju shrunk into the size of her host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\", asked Miki with fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Vivian. My friend here is Grim.\", said Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Miki and this is my sister Miko\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell after they introduced to each other. They saw a shadow like Kaiju attacking the city. This time, it had Faust riding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These shadow creatures are marvelous. I really adore such beings.\", said Faust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its you. The one who caused this mess.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh girls, its nice to see you again.\", said Faust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap. Were gonna stop you once and for all.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fused together and became big. Miko is in control. Vivian asks Grim too and the Kaiju girl grew and attacks with Vivian following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko threw many punches while Grim uses the power of darkness and some jabs. Faust stood there proud and simple laughs. Grim tries to steal Faust's soul, but suddenly can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly mortals, I died before. I'm just here without a soul.\", said Faust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko then punched Faust when he wasn't looking and was sent flying. Grim with Vivian goes after to chase Faust.

In the fictional kingdom of the Imperials. The Imperials ruled with peace and justice, and the Queen had a daughter named Hakura (note I am only using the picture's appearance). However, somehow an evil witch came to them one day, and in a maleficent like way (a long story to what happened with the king and the witch he formerly loved until she was betrayed so he can become king) the witch curses the young girl with a power that can never be erased. The curse came to Hakura as a baby, and as she grew older, her height grown drastically with it, but she also developed powers as well, but then came the day she turned 13, the witch came back and revealed the most devastating curse of them all to everyone. Hakura will become immortal with her powers for good. This shocks everyone, and Hakura even ran into the forest and eventually into the mountains, and isolated herself from the world for a bit. She then received the shocking news that her mom and dad died in a shipwreck in a storm, and she was next to be the queen. However, inspite of her powers and size, the kingdom loved her anyway for her kindness and compassion, and she grew to become a powerful young woman, and rule her kingdom. She defended it from threats single handedly with her powers, and all of the children loved and played with Hakura all the time. Even as time went along, the people view her as a queen, and even in the 21st century, the people still live the same way as they did (just in modern times now) and she has a great life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how would you like to start this story?</span></div></div>",

You see, Helga was born with some sort of a special gift that you can say. Her single mom was a worker at a science company, working on a way to enhance the human DNA to do so much more, until one day an accident occurred and the mother was the sole person somehow infected with the Project \"Evolution.\" Thankfully she was not injured, but during that time she was pregnant as well (she was pregnant prior to this), and when she gave birth to Helga, she seems to be healthy and her mom was okay, but there was one thing drastic that happened. Project \"Evolution\" seem to have no effect on her mother, yet it did on the child and it was dormant (her mom was completely recessive to the mutation, but not Helga). Helga grew to great heights when she was young, towering buildings and everyone else for sure. She somehow also developed heightened senses and even has the power to shoot some lasers from her eyes. It was by her luck that the government, her mom, and the company intervene in time to provide for her growth, and did an amazing job with it as well. She is a great help to the city, and also even obtained some sort of a normal life by going to school as well with her friends, and also play with them as well. Sure she had to eat more than normal people, and of course is adjusting to city life and moving around in it but her bright and cheerful personality lets anyone be a friend with her.<br>\r\nOther info: She likes giant monster movies, heck the government built some model buildings for her to destroy from time to time so she can behave like a giant monster from time to time. She likes this a lot and some times the people and herself call her Helgasaurous or Helgazilla. Also she sometimes roars and stomps violently on areas but has no intention of destroying anything or harming anyone. Also, many visitors come to the city to see the giant child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you want to start?</span></div></div>",

Lily attached herself to the body and her tentacles dig into the neck and the girl finally get the feeling of normal hands again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily observed herself and saw her body being so attractive that its as if she is destined to have a body like this. She then spotted the woman's head on the ground moaning.

There was a guy who did some sort of curse on me and it just happened and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down girl. I understand if you need a body because of some wizard. Look, do you have parents?\", asked the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I live alone and work part time to survive in a diner as a maid. I don't get much appreciation. due to my old body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can borrow my body then, if you are willing to share it with me.\", said the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most people would refuse so I'm trying to be the one who will accept you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much... uhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie. And yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its settled than. You can live with me for now on since you need a body.

For some reason it feels nice. Well I'm not like most people who would hate this.\", said Cassie's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily went to her apartment and begin packing and did all her preparations in moving. She then went to Cassie's house through her guidance while trying to hide her head. Lily never felt this nervous before as she walked around seeing men ohhing her new body.

You see, she was born on a ship that was sunk that same night, and she somehow was the sole survivor. Her parents didn't made it out, and she was spirited away to an island, where some sort of ancient tribe took her in and preformed some sort of ritual. Not only did she grown into great height, but she also had Kaiju like Powers and somewhat its behavior. She grew up in 8 years to be a fun loving girl, but can love to be really monstrous, and also she would imitate movements of giant monsters, roars, and even minding get out of hand with her pincher. She is also seen in Haruka and the Kaiju Girls in a similar design to the character. She made lots of friends, but her accidents can be a bit.... Crazy at times. Can really get out of hand. Also, on her island, she is treated like royalty. She is also great friends with Helga Norena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info: She will appear in this route.

Asuka was surprised to see Miko since this is the first time seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, YOU! I heard that your the most powerful Kaiju girl out there, Asuka. Well listen here, today, me and my sister will take that title for you.\", said Miko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister, where is she?\", asked Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its complicated, her sister is her mind while that girl is the body.

I'm Miki.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\", said Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of now, my sister is berating me about dragging this on. I really don't want to fight you for no reason, but are you up for the challenge? I really don't want to make a bad impression because of my sister.\", said Miki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all.

Kari's pod however had a small malfunction that altered the auto pilot and suddenly made her crash into Earth instead of her targeted destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari's pod was a big as a battleship and it was pulled into the atmosphere. The pod kept the baby safe until it crashed into a barren desert area. The force from the landing created a shock wave that caused major damage to the desert and an earthquake in nearby cities. Now the military spotted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General, we spotted a battleship from space.\", said a soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better not be a joke.\", said the General.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are positive that its not, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier gave the General the images that spotted Kari's pod and they set up a mission to investigate.

Giantess size: 250 feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Personality: Mostly calm and reserved, though she can be as unpredictable as the weather she rules over. Friendly and kind to most but dangerous to her enemies. Though she is a goddess she does enjoy pranks and a good joke can get her laughing hysterically. Wise beyond imagining and a skilled warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Exclusive power(s): Helena is an ancient storm goddess. As such, she has full control over the weather, summoning hurricanes force winds and calling lightning from on high with but a thought.

And finally, she can heal from any wound if given enough time and can travel faster than light when flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Clothes: When at peace, she wears blue jeans and a red V-neck shirt with knee high boots. In battle mode, she wears a blue armored chest plate with matching gauntlets on her arms, grieves on her legs, an armored battle skirt around her waist and helmet on her head. The armor has silver trim and a silver European dragon head on the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n City that they attack or defend: New York city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bio: Helena is a member of a god like race that existed before the dawn of man. Countless centuries ago, they battled an invading race of demonic creatures for dominion over the Earth. A short time later, the man race appeared. A third race entering the war posed many benefits but also problems to both sides. The human's growing intellect would make them ether great allies, valuable slaves, or dangerous enemies to both sides. A truce was called between the warring races. With their battle threating the safety of the humans, and both sides seeing potential uses for the tiny creatures, an agreement was made. Both races would discontinue the fighting and going into a mass hibernation until the humans were advanced enough to enter the war proper and become tools in the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And so, Helena's race and the demon hordes began their long sleep below the seas and under the Earth's ground. They will not awaken until human's are ready for their return...Well, that was the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Someone awoke Helena from her sleep in the ocean. This caused her to turn her attention to the nearest human settlement, New York, NY USA. But is she friend, or foe?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Of course my other interactives basically gives you a choice of gentle, evil, neutral... etc, but what if I make them either heroic or make them purely evil, like giant monster evil. In this story... you can make that happen, make your girl terrorize or defend a city at a whopping 140ft-250ft tall with super powers. (All girls can breathe hyperbeam attacks from their mouth or hands, shoot lasers from eyes, has vicious roars... and can breathe and talk underwater)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow you girl gets created is unknown to you, but here are the ground rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><u><i><b>NO GIANTESS UNDER THE AGE OF AT LEAST 13 CAN WEAR A BIKINI</b></i></u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The characters can be whatever they want, they can be superheroes defending the city, or giant monsters, maybe big sis, etc... But try to keep the Girlzilla all in Kraft, her powers, size, etc.<br>\r\n3. No male giants.<br>\r\n4. They can be more than one giantess in your own route, but you must however either have them defend the city, or destroy it.<br>\r\n5. I will allow as much vore as you like in this story.<br>\r\n6. All the giantesses will be clothed in some way. No nudity. <br>\r\n7. Sexual content cannot be overdone here, like a few chapters (still clothed)... it's fine, but not like every other chapter.<br>\r\n8. No Lesbian or gay stuff.<br>\r\n9. No tiolet jokes.<br>\r\n10. No piss or poop.<br>\r\n11. Since we are all in this together, you can add onto other's work if you think it fits your style. What I mean here, is that you don't have to add your own made up character to add here, you can add on someone else's work as we are all in this together.<br>\r\n12. I will give ownership of your own path once you came it (notice as I change the (free) to the author who added in that route)<br>\r\n13. While you can have to as many characters in any free spots you haves (Bios must be explained by format as well), you are only permitted up to 3 free spots. We can't have the same author in all spots over and over again.<br>\r\n14. No scat, I just had a negative experience with it, and it just digustes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: there was a rule that inform that no giantess under the age of 13 can be created, but I just did a 2 week testing on that rule to see how many adds I would receive when there is a ban on underage giantess, of you want that rule back up, pm me, but for now, that former rule is no longer in effect<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you will be able to create your own character, choose which city she terrorizes, and what exclusive power your girl will have that no other girls can have, but here is a few rules on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They should be some sort of an origin story on how they grow into giantesses with powers and become kaiju.<br>\r\n2. You can decide if she destroys the city,defends the city, or other. But she must still have monster instincts, like roars, etc<br>\r\n3. The same rules apply from the first 10.<br>\r\n4. They must be in some city, either in the middle of destroying, or if they have already... conquered it, and their form slavery on people can be done.<br>\r\n5. All info like body parts, origin, exclusive powers must be explained.<br>\r\n6. They can be furries, dragonesses, robot giantesses, etc.<br>\r\n7. They can all shoot lasers from their eyes, roar like monsters (you can make your roar in description), breathe underwater, fire hyper beams from either mouth or hands, and they all have an exclusive power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is example of the format.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:<br>\r\nAge:<br>\r\nEye color:<br>\r\nHair style and color:<br>\r\nSkin:<br>\r\nHow tall: (younger would be around 140ft, older would be up to 220ft)<br>\r\nExclusive power(s):<br>\r\nClothes:<br>\r\nCity that they attack or defend:<br>\r\nBio story on how she became what she is/Where she is from, etc:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood adds will reward you will GP, free adds from me, and even you get your path reserved completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso: Make sure to check out my friend Redhurricane's interactives Monster Arms and Monster Shores<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms</a></td>",
