He does alright in his classes but it does not particularly make him excited. As he is about to open his room door he sees Choa waving at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it is something to look forward to\" Shu mutters as he waves back. He opens the door to his room, it does not seem like James is back from class yet. \"he is probably off doing some tutoring\" Shu thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Shu puts down his bag he hears a strange sound coming from his room. Opening his door he is met with an old looking book open on his bed, his room fan is on and it is pushing the page on the book....but the page is not turning. It is like it is stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the book Shu sees an indescribable language of seemingly random symbols. Suddenly he feels a rush to his head and he quickly passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours pass and Shu wakes up on the floor of his room with a pounding sensation in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that\" he says as he gathers himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShu now feels like hes gained a tremendous amount of information. He positions his right hand into a finger gun and a small blue light emits from the tip of his pointer finger. \"So I can point this at someone, pretend to fire, and they will turn into a suit....that I can wear?\" Shu is not especially impressed by this far-fetched tale. The book is nowhere in sight, and his finger is clearly glowing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Shu do.....</span></div></div>",
