You're biking to school one day when you hear a strange whooshing sound, like some great beast breathing.  Characteristically curious, you pull over to the side, put up your kickstand, and turn towards the source of the sound, where you see a large blue police box materializing out of nowhere, blowing the pine branches nearby with a breeze.  Suddenly, a strange-looking curly-haired man with a red hat and a long scarf runs out of the box, followed by a blonde woman with unseasonable striped shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shouts, \"Sophia, get down!\"  You stand there, dumbfounded.  Where did that box come from, you wonder, and why is that woman wearing shorts in late November?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appears agitated.  \"What are you waiting for, a formal invitation?  You are hereby cordially invited to DUCK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he says this, he tackles you to the ground, and his companion drops; almost at the same instant, an explosion occurs overhead, lighting the trees on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, you get up and find - to your surprise - that neither the strange man nor the woman is hurt.  However, it is only now that you realize the other strange thing you forgot to wonder earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy,\" he answers.  \"I read your nametag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not wearing a nametag,\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, obviously.  In the future.  Your future.  My past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The past is just the future that's already happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, into the TARDIS!

Please, do visit me sometimes.\u201d She said. All of a sudden, you heard the sound of a mysterious blue box materializing. Then, out of nowhere, a man dressed like a cricketer from Edwardian times in England, and he happened to be traveling alone at the moment. You observed that although he looked around 68 years old, he was not human. \u201cExcuse me, sir, but I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re traveling alone. Where are your friends?\u201d You said. \u201cCitizens of Pine Valley, Ohio, I am The Master. You will either die or submit to my rule.\u201d The figure identifying himself as the Master said. \u201c Oh, Dear. This is very bad. Very, very bad.\u201d The mysterious man said. \u201cCome on, we need to get out of here. Claudette!\u201d You said, but the Mystery man put his finger to his lips. \u201cHush, Young man. The Master means business. Unless you want to get hit with a laser pistol, I suggest you follow me, mr...\u201d He said, looking for your name. You replied, \u201cit\u2019s Pierce, sir, Jacob Pierce. And I\u2019m a student at Anthony Wayne High School.\u201d \u201cWell, Jacob, I do believe we\u2019ve not yet met. I\u2019m The Doctor. The correct terminology for those who travel with me are Companions.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s The Master doing here?!?\u201d You asked. \u201cHe happens to be plotting something sinister, and from the looks of it, your Girlfriend could be in danger.\u201d He replied back. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop him!\u201d You said. The Doctor was in agreement, saying, \u201cIt is imperative that he be stopped or we- including the entire human race- are destroyed.\u201d He said. \u201cWhat are you anyway?\u201d You asked. \u201c I\u2019m a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. A renegade one at that. And so is the Master. I\u2019ve known him a long time.\u201d He said. </span></div></div>",

Like mud, it's both dirty and clean at the same time, and it has many odors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the crowd, exchanging open polite smiles (and discreetly impolite sneers) you seem to collect various synonyms for those odors, like strong, foul, sweet, pleasant, and other less flattering words that shouldn\u2019t be in the vocabulary of a woman of your status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose isn't for the money, however. You were brought up in this world of strategic parties and fancy clothes and though you have long since learned to blend in with it, it bores you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Hannah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and fight the urge to wince at that horrible voice. Instead, you help yourself to a glass of champagne and catch your appearance in a mirror on the far wall. Your dress of black satin practically absorbs the light as you turn to face the owner of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttica,\u201d You reply in your most falsely cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttica Spitswicke stands a good foot above you and manages to look powerful in his gangly state. Wearing a black suit and tie, his skin is a burnt tone that looks like someone took a burlap sack, stuffed a bunch of old withered bones in it, and put its name on a birth certificate. Though you\u2019re not one to make fun of someone\u2019s appearance, his hooked nose completes the image in your mind of a giant buzzard \u2013 minus the general affection you feel towards buzzards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah, I can\u2019t believe your father let you out of the house in that get up,\u201d Attica says in a tone that borders on the fatherly affectionate and something even less appropriate. He even puts his hand on your arm, making you almost regret wearing a strapless as you pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit old to be concerned with what my father wants,\u201d you retort. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t wind up in prison, he couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttica seems at a loss for a response to your wit, so he resorts to taking a bite from an H\u2019orderve. He invites you to look at a statue in the center of the room. As you weave through the crowd, following closely behind, he barely seems to notice as you quietly dip your fingers into the loose fold of his coat pocket, removing the key you knew to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagnificent isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barrier has been set up around the piece. At first glance, it seems to be made out of stone, but it seems to shimmer in the spotlights that are focused on it. People gather nearby, gazing, pointing and making murmured comments of praise and awe. You\u2019re just trying to figure out what the heck it is. It seems to have no discernable shape and it reaches almost up to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something,\u201d you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bought it dirt cheap,\u201d Attica says with a catch in his voice that he must believe is a joking tone. \u201cThat is, if you consider forty-thousand dollars cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust have been a steal,\u201d you say, ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique in this world.\u201d Attica goes on, ignoring you. \u201cMade of an impossible material not found anywhere on this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does sound interesting, you think. But it\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for. Attica has been your father\u2019s business partner since the day you were born, and his reputation for collecting rare and valuable items is legendary. You can\u2019t go a day without hearing about some new acquisition to Attica\u2019s collection because he announces it to the four corners of the world as if expecting some kind of unearthly praise in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why you accepted the invitation. Because the item you are here about is something that Attica didn\u2019t feel the need to announce. You know through the grapevine at Dad\u2019s office that Attica has something in a safe in his office. And now that you have the key to that office, it\u2019s only a matter of slipping away from this high class crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your champagne and take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to use the powder room,\u201d you say, disguising your condescension with an upward inflection. \u201cWhere is the ladies room if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttica points it out, giving you a once over that should make you uncomfortable, but honestly just makes you want to laugh. As if he would ever have a chance with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way for the restrooms, taking a turn down the hall and casually glancing about to make sure no one\u2019s watching. When you are certain you are alone, you take a staircase off to the side and find yourself in the upper rooms of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttica\u2019s office is at the far end of an equally decadent hallway. In no time at all, you use the key you lifted from Attica\u2019s pocket and enter the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is large enough to play a few games of American football and have room for some rugby on the side. As you scan the office, with its mahogany furniture and state-of-the art technology, the thing that catches your eye is a 17th century portrait of some cardinal in Rome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways in the obvious places,\u201d you think out loud. After making sure the door is locked behind you, you make your way to the painting and with little effort, push it to the side to reveal the large, gray safe in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your white gloves and put them aside as you pull a miniature stethoscope that a good friend had modified for your use. Placing the earpiece near the tumblers, you methodically work the dial. A rush travels up your spine as you indulge in a talent that you\u2019ve spent years mastering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few short minutes, the last tumbler slides out of place and you whisper, \u201cChild\u2019s play.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what you find inside is not what you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man sits in the cramped space, but looks less put off than if he had been inside of an egg crate. Dressed in a tweed overcoat, with a loud, brightly colored sweater full of question marks, he looks up at you with an expression of mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You normally wear jeans and a black leather jacket over a white button up shirt. Thanks to a traumatic incident you suffered during your tour of duty you keep an M92F pistol in your jacket at all times and often keep a multitool and basic survival kit on you person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sunny morning in Boston, and you were walking back from the cafe to your car when a black haired man in a leather jacket ran past you, followed by a highly suspicious looking man in a ridiculous amount of Redsox memorabilia, including a foam finger and a fanny pack. Things soon turned for the worst however, as the suspicious man picked up speed and tackled the jacket clad man. As the suspicious man lunged for the other's shoulder you suddenly saw the sunlight glint off of something in his fanny pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought was \"Gun\" and your second was \"Terrorist\" before you had a third thought time seemed to slow down, giving you time to plan every move as you drew your pistol and aimed for the \"Terrorist\"s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get up and put your hands in the air!\" you yell toward him. While he didn't follow your instructions, he was distracted long enough for the man in the jacket to get away. The \"Terrorist\" stood up into a hunched over position like a gorilla and emitted what sounded like a combination of a hiss and a growl before charging at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got close enough to attack you, however, you squeezed the trigger three times and jumped to the side as he skidded to a stop on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the distraction but please put the gun away, I don't like guns.\" you heard someone say from behind you. You whipped around and trained your pistol on the speaker but quickly lowered it and replaced it in your jacket as you saw that it was the man who your attacker had pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that, a terrorist or a mugger?\" you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not who, what, that was a Toniten.\" he answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"you asked, bewildered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Toniten, they're a reptilian humanoid with a taste for flesh, and he wasn't to pleased with the fact that I set his friends on fire.\" said the man. He then turned and began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you any way?\" you asked and he answered, \"The Doctor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor who?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" he answered and continued on his way. You looked over at the \"Toniten\" to get a good look at what it really was. You turned it over and saw that the guy looked human, but the skin felt weird, as if it was some sort of mask. You looked back at \"The Doctor\" and saw him point a small device over at the creature. The device glowed blue the end and the creature disappeared. The Doctor turned the corner and walked away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the age of thirteen, you had the most wonderful experience of your life. Not counting the six months in a psychiatric hospital for children, but two years after you were released you published your first novel so you consider that a bump on the long road to success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've read all of your books.\u201d The bright-eyed boy of twelve or thirteen says. \u201cYou're amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you,\u201d you say with an unrehearsed level of appreciation that shows that your success has not gone to your head. \u201cWhich one is your favorite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Smaller Sun,\u201d he says without hesitation. \u201cI just couldn't believe it when Jack Borough  tricked the Zal'Dum general into inhaling his own poison gas. It makes me want to be a writer so much because I love the way you keep me in suspense until the right minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho should I make this out to?\u201d You ask, taking his copy of your latest book and opening it to the blank pages between the title and the prologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKerry,\u201d the boy says. He looks like you're about to hand him the ownership papers to a brand new Dodge Viper and as you pen out a short wish of success to his career as a writer, assuring him that you'll be looking forward to reading his first book, you feel a swell of pride that you have had such an influence over this and so many other young minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanks you as he takes the book, as does his mother, who now gently guides him by the shoulders towards the exit. You wait until the sales clerk has moved the latch the doors before releasing a sigh of relief and stretching your arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good day,\u201d you think out loud. It's not over yet, of course. The manager thanks you and you thank him. And a few of the staff members also get autographed copies as thanks for all of their hard work in arranging this event and keeping your readers corralled in the seating areas while still managing to run the rest of the bookstore. You are always grateful to these people and there is nothing false when you thank them, but even you get tired at the end of a long haul and as the 29th year of your life comes to a close, you give yourself a couple days to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, the advance for your next book is all ready collecting interest in your bank account. But the night before your birthday you are stricken with the worst sort of affliction you can get; Writer's block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there for hours, staring at the computer screen, watching the blinking cursor of your word processor. A few times you lose yourself in the screen saver before telling yourself you have something and jostling the mouse, only to stare at the blank white page. Finally, you turn the computer off and stretch your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've certainly had a successful career, you think as you run your hand along the spines of your best sellers. Then the magazines and anthologies where you've published short stories. The wall is decorated with frames of reviews from various major publications. But the one thing that's missing, you are all to aware of, are pictures of you with people you love. Friends, family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, even after your writing has helped you to pay for college, a nice apartment and car, as well as keeping out of debt, your parents can still be disappointed in you. Although, to be fair, you understand their point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly they know the full story. That while you have made a career off of your fiction, you have always believed the events in your books to be as real as if you had actually been there. They even tried to have you put back in the hospital again because it was clear to them that the first book, A Feast of Diamonds was a sign that you were slipping back into your delusions, but your literary agent came to your rescue with a forensic psychologist and an exclusive attorney on retainer. The shrink gave you an evaluation that summed you up as an eccentric writer who poses no threat to himself and others while the attorney was able to get the judge to slap your parents with a gag order. Needless to say this drove a gap between you and the rest of your family, though you would have gladly done things much differently since they haven't returned a letter or a phone call, much less wished you a happy birthday in the last twelve years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how happy it would make them to know that for the first time in your life, the visions appear to have stopped. After fifteen years, those very real experiences that only seemed to take place in your mind, have left you with no inspiration to draw upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unplug the cellphone from the charger. You're hungry and right now you need human contact, even if it's for just long enough to order and pay for food. The pizza place is always open, you think, scrolling down the contact list to the number of your favorite pizza delivery. There's also Denny's just on the edge of town if you want slightly more contact. Heck, if you're feeling adventurous, you could always see if the pub down the road serves nachos.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you grab your keys and wallet and a short drive later, you're sitting at the counter sipping on coffee and going through the menu. Something about watching the waitstaff and seeing the cooks do their thing always fascinates you. The waitress balancing a hot coffee pot on the stub of her right arm never fails to inspire and you've always wanted to know how she lost her hand, but knew it would be impolite to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenny's is mostly empty, except for a few late night travelers stopping to get a bite to eat. A trucker sits at the far end of the table, reading his newspaper as he finishes his coffee. A man sitting at one of the booths with a young girl that you guess is his daughter, talks quietly but  with obvious enthusiasm that you almost want to eavesdrop to see what could be so exciting at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I sit here?\u201d A man asks, gesturing to the empty seat beside you. There are plenty of empty chairs at the table, but who are you to tell him where he can and can't sit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places his shoulder bag on the floor and removes his long coat. He's probably a few inches shorter than you and his dark brown hair, while clean and reasonably neat, is a mosaic of long and short strands - the sign of a serial self groomer. And from the second hand look of his sweater, jeans, and shoes you guess that he might be a graduate student who counts his pennies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice something else. A bracelet on his right wrist. It seems familiar but you quickly dismiss it as another waitress takes his drink order. Just water. He then takes a book out and starts to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress assures you that your order will be another couple of minutes. So with nothing better to do, you turn to the kid and ask, \u201cGood book?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not bad. Thank god libraries are free,\u201d he jokes. He's about to go back to his book but then he takes a  glance at you and smiles. \u201cYou look familiar. Are you Michael Tavis by any chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return the smile and nod. After all you're no James Patterson . So if he recognizes you he must have at least read one of your books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a book signing recently, didn't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was this past Sunday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have been there, but I had to work.\u201d He hesitates, like he wants to tell you more. Then he adds, \u201cImmortal Gray got me through some tough times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmortal Gray is truly one of your lesser works. It surprises you to hear of it again after all this time, although it reminds you of the bracelet on the kid's hand as you remember a minor detail about the main protagonist of that book, that no reader could possibly know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that takes me back,\u201d you say, making conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents died when I was twelve,\u201d he says, looking away. \u201cThe group home they placed me in had an copy of it. Reading it is what helped me keep my mind off of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart goes out to him. Though your parents hardly speak to you, at least you know they're alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d You say, sincerely. But like the boy at the book signing, you're gratified to know that your accomplishment made this difficult time easier for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d His eyes hover over the pages of his book, but you can tell he's not reading. Suddenly, with a sheepish glance at you, he reaches for his shoulder bag and removes something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the shimmery cover title of your fourth novel, Immortal Gray. Though it's tattered with pock marks and the spine shows the signs of years of degradation it is unmistakable as is the block letters that spell out your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis book was in such terrible condition when I got a hold of it,\u201d the kid explains. \u201cI felt like a lost boy reunited with an orphaned puppy or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorts, as if what he said was the most ridiculous thing in the world. You don't think it's weird at all and it invokes an urge to try to find out more about him. For all he went through in life, this kid could have wound up in a far worst position and to have found that strength in one of your novels recharges your creative juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to sign it?\u201d You ask, sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks surprised, like it would never have occurred to him to ask you. You take out the check writing pen that you always keep in your shirt pocket, because you never know when you have to sign something. You ask him his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaymon Frye,\u201d he responds. When he reads what you've written, the happiness in his face is so tangible that you feel like it's ten degrees warmer. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour food arrives. With each bite you keep sneaking glances at that bracelet. The outer material is some bizarre, dark shade of blue that you don't feel like you can compare to anything else. And along the center of the bracelet is a thin line of a maroon colored material. When you're finished, you order a refill on your coffee and wait for him to finish his meal. Finally, when it seems like he's almost done you ask him nonchalantly, \u201cWhere did you get that bracelet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon doesn't seem all that surprised as he lifts his wrist up. In fact, there's a knowing gleam in his eyes as he turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I were to tell you... that it's all real?\u201d His voice is low. \u201cThat the things you write about really happened, or are going to happen at some point in the your future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost laugh, but stop yourself. He's not joking. And while it's occurring to you that he might be a little odd, you're certainly not going to condemn someone else for something that you've made your living on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, letting him fill in the blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same low voice, Daymon says, \u201cI mean that your visions were real. The ones you told your parents about that made them think you were crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to work to keep your eyes from widening with surprise. It's true that your hospital stay is no big secret. You were afraid at first of letting it out but your literary agent insisted on sharing that information with all of your readers from the get go and surprisingly, he was right. It didn't alienate you from your readers but instead made those who had undergone psychiatric treatment feel connected to you. That interview on National Public Radio even boosted your sales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew about the hallucinations. The version your agent released to the public was that your stay was because of psychological abuse from your parents. As far as the rest of the world is concerned you are just an inventive writer who has added something new to the genres of science fiction and fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything else your waitress places a check in front of you and takes your dirty dishes. Daymon also asks for the check and quickly grabs yours as he removes his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that's okay-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI insist.\u201d Daymon's wallet is surprisingly good quality in comparison with his clothes. And he surprises you even more by pulling out enough money to pay for the meals as well as leaving a generous tip for both waitresses. \u201cAfter all I didn't buy your latest book but you still signed the one that's most important to me. The least I can do is buy you dinner.\u201d<br>\r\nThis is a first for you. Fans have sent you things, of course. Flowers, cards, creepy invitations and unpublished manuscripts for your approval (that you've politely refused to read for liability reasons), but none of them have ever bought you dinner. And certainly not, as you glance at the clock and see the hour hand slide into midnight, on your birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy thirtieth,\u201d Daymon says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you say, still stunned by his generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathers his things and goes to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about that bracelet?\u201d You ask, getting up to follow him. \u201cAnd what do you mean about-\u201d you lower your voice as you follow him out of the foyer. \u201cWhat did you mean by my visions being real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon stops and turns to face you. With a smirk he holds up his wrist and pulls back the sleeve so you can get a better look at the bracelet. The light from Denny's as well as the street lamps lighting up the parking lot fills the area, but somehow the bracelet doesn't reflect any of it. Strange how you hadn't noticed that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's something I need to show you.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd all I want you to do is touch the bracelet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. Of course you wonder if this kid really is some kind of crazy. Where did that money come from, after all? Was he really better off than he looked or did he take someone's wallet after leaving them in a ditch somewhere? While you certainly don't hold it against him for the choices he's made in life, or having any sort of mental illness, you also wonder if you should be making your way for the car and calling for someone to take him to the looney bin while you're at it. That's what a smart person would do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that bug has been sitting in your ear. It's been buzzing for the last half hour that whatever this kid is, psychotic fan, some rebellious trust fund baby, or something else, the inspiration for your next book is standing right in front of you.<br>\r\nSo what's the harm in touching the bracelet? It's your thirtieth birthday after all and you're a  big boy. If the kid tries anything funny he can spend a night in the gray bar hotel and you get to go home and write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch the bracelet and everything goes black.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a carpet beneath you. You're resting against a wall as you regain consciousness. Surprisingly you're not gagged or bound. Slowly you climb to your feet, pressing your back against the wall for support as you slide yourself upwards. You feel groggy but as far as you can tell you're not missing a kidney. Your wallet and keys are still in your pockets but that doesn't exactly reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see something. A shifting mass of blue, red and orange forming a constantly moving swirling shape as you gaze out of the... window?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, you think. <i>I've been kidnapped and now I'm on a train.</i> Or a jet. A jet that's flying over... You go to the window and press your head against the glass to see if you can make out a body of water or a landmass. But the rainbow light show continues on for as far as you're able to see. It's like you've flown into a sixties music video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Daymon. His gaze shifts from a device in his hands to the window. He's still wearing the long coat and the old clothes and the handbag is slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d You ask. \u201cWhere have you taken me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d He says. \u201cIf that star is Sinwe then we're on the planet Zetanyne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused as to whether or not you want to slug the kid or ask him to repeat himself, you join him at his side and follow his gaze to a bright object in the sky. The clouds have formed a kind of whirlpool around, wherever it is you are, and you can see the orangish ball of light through a grayish white haze, the way the sun looks on a very cloudy winter's afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see a man approaching and realize that the two of you are standing in some kind of corridor. The man is dressed in what looks like a uniform, with large shiny black boots that come up to his knee and tight white pants, he's almost comical in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He asks. \u201cThis area is restricted to crew members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon calmly removes something from inside of his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really sorry,\u201d he says in an innocent tone. \u201cMy friend and I got lost looking for the coffee shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds up what looks like another wallet, unfolding it as he shows it to the crewman. The crewman inspects it and his gaze softens. He then turns to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see your ID?\u201d He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon closes the wallet and lowers his hand. In a move to quick for you to see he \u201cpulls\u201d the same wallet from your pocket and shows that to the crewman once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's a bit too slow,\u201d he says, glancing at you with a look that says to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crewman can't seriously be so dense as to not have seen that slight of hand could he? But sure enough he just nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm very sorry Doctor Stevens,\u201d he says to you. \u201cBut this area is restricted. I'll lead you and your friend back to the promenade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can open your mouth Daymon grabs your hand and squeezes gently. He doesn't say it but his nonverbal insistence that you not contradict the crewman is loud enough. As you pass several doors, you see a digital screen on each door that displays unfamiliar symbols, with a number or letter cropping up now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crewman stops at a set of doors, which silently part without making the \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound  you almost expect it to make. He stands there and gestures you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's a coffee shop just a few feet from here. Please be mindful of where you're going in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon leads you past the man and you look up. For the first time you notice the strange color of his eyes as well as the reptilian slits of his pupils. Before you can get too hung up on that detail you turn around as the world literally opens up before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promenade opens to a vast deck that seems endless as people fill the space. At the edge of the deck you can see several floors stretched along the walls. It's like a huge shopping mall, with  restaurants, stores, and things you can't find a name for. The very bottom is filled with large pools shaped like lakes, parks and wooded areas, as well as fields for playing various kinds of sports. The ceiling is one giant glass roof that allows you to see even more of the brightly colored, constantly shifting clouds. Daymon leans against the railing beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to year 61,382.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you don't think anything could at this point. That is until Daymon taps your shoulder and points to what looks like a giant walking stick. It lumbers past you on six spindly legs and carries what looks like a set of shopping bags in it's upper arms. Other passengers cut it a wide birth, though it's clear that they barely pay it any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon leads you to a coffee shop as you try not to stare, but fail. People are sitting in lawn chairs enjoying drinks. Others are out for a walk, enjoying the scenery, carrying bags from a day of shopping. It all seems ordinary yet so very alien as many of the more obviously non-human passengers and crew members stand out. You think you've seen only two other genuine human beings besides yourself and Daymon since arriving here but even then you can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d You say. \u201cHow do I know this isn't some hallucination and that I'm not really in a mental hospital imagining all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it matter of you were?\u201d Daymon asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon guides you to a table outside of what looks like a... oh, God it's Starbucks. Of all of humanity's achievements that makes it into the distant future? But you graciously accept the coffee that Daymon orders for you. It grounds you and slight burn of the familiar hot liquid makes you realize that this is definitely real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said this is the planet Zeta, 9?\u201d You ask.\u201cZetanyne,\u201d Daymon patiently corrects you as he pulls something else out of his handbag. God, how much stuff does he have in that thing. \u201cOne word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZetanyne,\u201d you repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes something towards you. A journal with a blank brown cover and red binding, like something you would find at Staples. It's open to the first page and at the heading is an entry. You read it and frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c61, 382,\u201d Daymon read, pointing at the entry. \u201cMichael Tavis and Daymon Frye in the Sinwe system on the planet Zetanyne.\u201d He shows you his own journal, which has an older, harder cover and clearly has many more entries than the one he's giving you. He shows you the same entry on the lower half of a page he's obviously trying to cover. \u201cAs a time traveler you now have an obligation to protect other time traveler's individual lines. If you were to see me in the near future and I don't seem to recognize you, you can't tell me about this event. If I don't have my own journal at all you can't even tell me that you are a time traveler as well. Always keep a working pen on you and make sure you can clearly read what you write always.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell who says I want to be a time traveler? Don't get me wrong, I love this-\u201d you gesture to the promenade, watching a group of humanoid looking aliens with bulbous blue heads and watery black eyes. \u201cBut I have a to a life to live. There's bills to pay and I need to get started on my next book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon rubs the bridge of his nose, then, he speaks slowly to you, enunciating each word, \u201cTime traveler. As in one who travels through time. You can take all the time you want here and be back five minutes after we left the front of Denny's. Ten minutes even.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be easy to take offense to that. But then, you were the one who insisted on trying to learn what made Daymon tick and it was you who touched the bracelet when he asked you to. And though you could have easily wound up in the back of a truck on the way to some human trafficking ring, you certainly aren't unhappy with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d you say, throwing up your hands in mock surrender. \u201cSo what next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon smiles. He pulls out a credit card sized device and hands it to you. It has your picture on it as well as the name he gave the crewman earlier.  \u201cIf anyone asks, you are Doctor Rubeus Stevens. You're a theoretical physicist at Drexel University on Newark Five. There's fifty thousand credits there. Just slide it into a reader or let the cashier scan it and you're good to go. I have some stuff to do. Meet me back here in four hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the credit card and then, out of force of habit, you check the clock on your cellphone. You're not sure it's every going to be the right time anymore, but at least you can get four hours from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second,\u201d You say as he gets up to leave. \u201cWho are you? I don't just mean your name, I mean who are you that you know all of this and can do these things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon's knowing grin returns. \u201cRemember, I have to protect your timeline as well as my own. This will give you a chance to stretch your legs a bit. It's a ship and there's only so many places you can go so don't worry about getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe  pulls out that device and pushes some buttons holds it outwards. A small holographic image is projecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a closer look. It's a blue box with little windows and large block lettering at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old Police Box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaymon nods. His expression has changed to a darker, more serious gaze as he says, \u201cIf you see this anywhere or at anytime during your travels, run.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Doctor Who</i> is one of the most innovative shows on television. We all envision ourselves traveling time and space with that enigmatic Time Lord. Now it's your chance to be the Doctor's companion, as he undoubtedly has had more than the ones we've seen on-screen. The Doctor has a lot of time unaccounted for in between his travels, and he could easily go to the bathroom and come back 10 years later to pick up his companion (though I doubt he'd really do that). Just to make the plot lines in this interactive as good as possible, here are some basic rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>RULES:</u><br>\r\n1.) I think that the most important rule is that you need to have proper grammar! Some spelling mistakes are ok, but if I can barely decipher what you are trying to convey than I will delete your chapter without a second thought.<br>\r\n2.) This is to be written in second person (ie: You step out of the TARDIS; The Doctor hands you the sonic screwdriver)<br>\r\n3.) I would like the visits to places to a minimum of 4 chapters long so as not to have frequent change in where you are. \\<br>\r\n4.) Try to keep your chapters long and engaging, ending in at least two choices. If can't think of a storyline for the other chapters just put in \"Other\" or \"Continue\" for all the blank ones.<br>\r\n5.) There are set names for characters, please don't change them halfway through.<br>\r\n6.) The Doctor does not regenerate. Period.<br>\r\n7.) The companion may be left behind, killed off, etcetera (but not on their first trip!). If you end the companion's time make it sad, maybe with a small monologue, but don't make it vulgar or gory..<br>\r\n8.) Use your own ideas for planets or aliens. You can use the Daleks and Cybermen but the Doctor doesn't amass his knowledge of the universe by fighting the same aliens every time.<br>\r\n9.) Look up historical figures and try to incorporate them into the story. If you're adding to the story line, look up the figure and know more about them.<br>\r\n10.) Have fun with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Doctor Who Interactive's authors.
