For the life of me, I don't know why you are always teasing him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Its so much fun, mom, you should try it sometime\" smirks Sara.  Stacy fires a stern look at her daughter.  \"Jeez, I was just playing with him.  I'll get the crybaby's toy from my room.  And yes, I did all my chores.  My room is clean, the garbage is out, the dishes are in the dishwasher, and I watered YOUR garden.  All that for a measly 5 bucks a week.  They taught us in school that Lincoln freed the slaves.  I guess you didn't get the memo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watch your tongue, young lady\" Stacy called out as Sara stomps off to her room.  After slamming her door, Sara glances around her bedroom while trying to remember where she hid Elmo.  She knows its not on her pink bed with her teddy bear collection.  Its not on her bookshelf.  That only hold the complete Harry Potter and Twilight series.  She opens her dresser drawers but Elmo isn't hiding under her ripped jeans and thrift store blouses which highlight her lack of fashion sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lack of fashion sense?  That's rich coming from a middle-aged slob who hasn't bought new cloths for himself for over 3 years.  Just what are you trying to do here, Jacknife?  Be descriptive?  If you are then you're failing miserably.  Your readers won't know what I'm really like just by telling them what books I read or that I collect stuffed animals.  Come on, you haven't even told them what I look like, just that I am a tomboy.  I can do a better job than you.  As a matter of fact, I'll prove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Readers,  My name is Sara and I am 13 years old, 4'9\", with long, curly brown hair blue-green eyes.  My mom says that I'm too young to wear make-up, but I do have pink lip gloss on and my cheeks are covered in freckles.  I am skinny but muscular, since I play a lot of sports.  I have not developed much yet as a woman so all the pervs out there can stop reading now.  My clothes may be from a thrift store, but I think that the light blue butterfly tank top and jewel studded blue jeans that I have on are really cute.  I hope you are taking notes, Jack, because that's how you describe some one to your readers.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, she looks in her closet and finds Elmo behind her stinky roller blades.  She grabs the doll and stalks out of her room and down the staircase.  \"Here's you stupid dolly, twerp\" snarls Sara as she tosses Elmo to her 3 years old brother Bryan, who is sitting on the couch, watching Sesame Street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWWW, Elmo smells badder den ma poopy diapee\" cries Bryan as Sara walks toward the front door,  past her mother.  Stacy is on the phone and holds up a finger to tell her daughter to wait a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here she is right now, I'll let her know.\" says Stacy \"Sara that was...\" </span></div></div>",

She really wants to go out, but cannot turn down a raise in her meager allowance.  Giving in to greed, she mutters \"Okay, I'll watch the little snot.

Emm. Gee. How did I <b>know</b> that some tickling freak would find this story?! Diapers, growth, shrinking, age regression... and this weirdo is in it for tickling. You can't even get here with a keyword search! Jack, I hate you! Tickling weirdo, I <b>hate</b> you!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!\" Elmo squeals out, tummy crushed between the shoving siblings. \"That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it!\" Bryan yells, pouty and in need of a nap. Sara's not in much of a better mood, because she knows how to read between the parentheses that sometimes accompany branch options. Trying to dispense with Elmo like he's a live grenade, she feels the doll's plush nap yield under her hand and split. Some gleefully dextrous <b>thing</b> pushes out from Elmo's innards and loops around her wrist. Sara sees that it's a Muppety, furry red tentacle before she screams with outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>How retarded is that? A <b>tentacle</b> inside a stuffed toy? No, great, a <b>bunch</b> of tentacles, please, so I guess Elmo swallowed the TARDIS or something to hold all of this in his guts. If I stay mad enough, it's not gonna tickle...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off!\" Sara shouts, trying to pull the Tickle Me Elmo-cum-tentacle factory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Hee hee, \"cum\" isn't 13+, somebody ban this guy!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...from her arm, with absolutely no success. Snaking past her elbow, the tentacle zips straight for an armpit left exposed by Sara's stylin' blue thrift shop tanktop and gives her the butterflies with a single, purposeful stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Hold on, I've read these things before and you're not even doing it right. What's your name... Jiminy?! Look, Jiminy Cricket, I'm supposed to 'suddenly get knocked out' and regain consciousness in a pair of stocks with someone leering <b>evilly</b> at me. Then I spew out three paragraphs of 'HAHAHA!'s and 'Sta-hahaha-hap it!'s and then you shift focus to another part of my body for three hours or some ridiculous amount of time that no one could stay ticklish for because they'd just get desensitized and bored. Hey, cred check... does anyone even <b>know</b> Jiminy, out there in the tickling weirdo ghetto? I think he's genre-bashing and not taking this satire business seriously! And I know for a fact 'cum' isn't a preposition, so ban Jiminy Potty Mouth, and I mean <b>NOW</b>!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomach churning with dreadful anticipation, Sara grits her teeth and awaits the worst. Bryan is speechless, his mouth a SpaghettiO of surprise, but he starts laughing at the same moment Sara does, realizing what's happening to his mean older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle, tickle, tickle!\" Elmo pipes up in synthesized falsetto, with just enough glitchy reverb to freak Sara out. \"Sara's ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is totally <b><i>LAME</i></b>,\" Sara shouts, before another fuzzy nudge in the old oxter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>The old <b>what</b>?! Jiminy's trying to get over with a dictionary, I swear! It's just pedantic naughtiness, someone please look these words up, 'K - then ban the freak!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...prompts one more reluctant and uncharacteristic cackle from the teenager. Once the introductory tentacle quits teasing and gets down to business, Sara's too overwhelmed to shriek in horror as the patient tentacles she saw earlier blossom out like something from a John Carpenter remake, wrapping her up with wriggly zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her, get her!\" Bryan shouts, utterly devoid of brotherly compassion. It's fair that Elmo has his revenge, and Sara's only getting tickled. Bryan jumps off the couch as Sara futilely attempts to wrestle her way out of the skein of monstrous Muppet tendrils that are slowly binding her down even as they tickle whatever bits look promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>I swear to Ga-hahahaha-hod, <b>STAWP</b>!! Sta-hahahaha-hap it, plea-heeheehee-HEEse, areyousatisfiedyet?!?!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's tanktop is untucked and urged to reveal tummy, which gets mobbed posthaste. She tries squeezing her arms to her sides in defense of both ribs and armpits, but her wrists are pinioned to disallow what would only be an empty gesture, anyway. A suggestive ripple under rhinestone-studded denim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>HAHAHAHA - wait tentacles in my pants = 13+ rating totally blown - i'm free make him quit do it <b>NOW</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only leads to an E-rated stroking of Sara's \"kneepits\" (which clinical term of <i>popliteal fossae</i> shall not be invoked here as a courtesy to the frantically squirming teen).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Yeah, thanks for <b>not</b> foisting that choker on us, you goober...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll motion ceases briefly, allowing Sara a chance to catch her breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>[Huff, puff] Thanks, I think...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and finally notice that the shoelaces she tied two chapters back are being slowly pulled taut til the knots pop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>That's sort of a midlevel clich\u00e9, but you're holding up the torture for <b>this</b>?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and Sara's shoes are gently, firmly forfeited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pew!\" Bryan sings out at once, happy to mock the appearance of Sara's socked feet. Which really don't stink at present, but that's immaterial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Weird, but gallant...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sara thinks she's got some \"torturously slow yanking off of the socks to expose the feet one precious pink inch at a time\" time to work with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>What? You're <b>not</b> going with that? Oh, come on, Jiminy, you poseur of a tickler!!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...she loses the socks at once and has all attention shift to her feet. It's Sara going tonic-clonic under perhaps a dozen fuzzy tentacles with a deflated husk of Elmo supported overhead. With a hint of malice in his plastic eyes, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>HAx10\u00b2, NOT THE FEET!!!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of this extremely thorough attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Which [gasp] <b>feels</b> like three hours, but is still chivalrously restrained, thx.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Elmo spools his appendages up with a sort of zithering fuzz-squeal and plops back down on the couch. Anyone looking at Elmo would say that there could never possibly be tickling tentacles inside of his tummy and that Bryan must have somehow gotten the best of his bratty older sister, which turnabout the young miss was best served by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Oh, please, like I'm not just gonna take it out on him now for payback...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara collects herself, freckles standing out on her cheeks as the blush of ticklish travail fades. Retucking her tanktop and straightening her pants, she dismisses the footwear as too much effort and sinks back into the couch cushions, a tickle-enfeebled heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i><b>OH</b>, what's this? You're keeping me barefoot? I've got your number, Jiminy - you're a foot freak, too!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, Sara got tickled!\" Bryan chants, staying out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up, you little twerp,\" Sara says, nervously peeking over her toes to see what the next branches will put her through. \"And bring me that thesaurus! That big red... yeah, that book, right there, bring it.\"</span></div></div>",

I have been 13 years old for the past 4 years! And so far the most devolved story has to do with a genie making me wet myself. I thought you were going to put in some effort to writing this story, not just 'set up' for future stories with magic and slobs versions of my mother and friend.

I was going to let some else write a magic story.

Her best friend had lived in a very nice neighborhood due to both of Tina's parents bringing in a significant income. It wasn't long after ringing the doorbell that Will answered the door. \"Hey Sara, nice to see you made it on time for once.\" \"Shut up. You're in no position talk after just finishing a whole week of detention for coming to school late so many times...in a row.\" \"Ok ok, you're right. Little Tina is upstairs, and you will not believe how much she 'prepared' for this night. By the way, nice to see you in that old thing again.\" Sara didn't pay much attention to Will's last comment. She made her way through the rather large house to Tina's room. She was stopped by Will however saying that Tina had set everything up in one of the few rooms that Sara had never seen before. It was a some type of guest bedroom at the end of the hall. When Sara opened the door, she could swear that her jaw hit the floor. Tina was sat in the middle of the room playing some dolls, but Sara's attention was everywhere but there. The walls of the room were bright pink, with decorative wall borders containing flowers and fairies. The Floor was a soft pink carpet that you could just sink into. The furniture in the room was equally girly and infantile. Up against the wall opposite the door  was a white crib so large in scale that any pre-teen would struggle to climb out of it, but still had enough room for two to sleep comfortably.  On the wall just to the left of the door was a large closet and a diaper changing station, fully stocked and equipped with straps. On the wall right to the door was a single window overlooking the backyard and just under the window a massive toy chest. Finally right next to the door was a large mirror. Sara's attention was drawn back to her friend who's short hair was tied into cute pigtails, the only thing covering her upper half was a lose comfortable fitting T-shirt with a pacifier dangling from the spot where it was clipped to her shirt. Apart from some babyish socks covering her feet, the only thing she wore on her lower half was the largest bulkiest diaper Sara had ever seen in her life. 'Where do you buy something like that?' she wondered to herself. \"Sara you made it!\" Tina looked up excitedly. Jumping up to give her best friend a big hug \"You have no idea how much this means to me. I get to try out this exciting new world with my closest friends.\" Sara was not sure how to react, she had never seen Tina this happy over anything, not even the time she won those concert tickets. \"Well....what are friends for...I guess?\" Tina then looked Sara straight in the eyes \"Oh I have to change you into a diaper\" as she dragged her friend to the changing table. 'What have I agreed to?' Sara thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">\"Ok so you are not going into detail about how I get put into a (sigh) diaper are you?\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo I think I wrote enough for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">\"But seriously just how long are you going to take with the next part?\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short I don't know. And I am very sorry for waiting so long between updates. I do care for this story and want to see it grow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tina meanwhile was darting from one drawer to the next, clearly lost in excitement as she gathered all the supplies together. Sara watched as her friend organized everything when she noticed something that needed to be brought up. \"Say Tina, um I know that you're really into this whole thing, but...\" \"What is it?\" Tina asked turning to her friend. \"Well...\" Sara then gestured to the three large nighttime diapers that Tina had assembled, the type with extra padding for nighttime accidents. Realizing what Sara was referring to \"What? Do you not like the designs?\" Tina asked. \"No it just... well.. to things bluntly, could we start with just one? and something less thick?\" Sara asked slowly, not wanting to sound rude. \"Oh well, yeah I guess so. Sorry I guess I wasn't thinking.\" Tina said a little embarrassed about her overly excited behavior. Sara then hoped up on the table as Tina grabbed a diaper that more reasonable, simple white disposable with some padding. The actual process of Sara being changed will be skipped for the sake of the ratting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Well I can't complain about that. I got to say despite getting Will and Tina's personalities completely wrong and making up a bunch of stuff that didn't happen, you have written a pretty tasteful story here.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell thank you for that, but let's face it Sara, you know it's coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Wait, what's coming?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is writing.com. Do you really expect things to stay \"normal\" for long?

The diaper around her waist felt odd but the was so thin that it didn't interfere with her movements. Which brought the question to her head, how could Tina move around in something so bulky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Admitting your plot holes? Are you trying to be clever? Because it didn't work.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina then asked Sara how the diaper felt on her. To which Sara couldn't think of a better response than 'good'. \"So now how about we...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just... what? Are you trying to ensure that the whole internet knows you are making this crap up all in the span of ten minutes? I knew people that add to this site are amateur writers straight out of a middle school English class, but really? And what's more you're making an even bigger deal of it right now by writing me say this! Just....wow.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk so I made a type-o, and messed up the grammar. Can we just end it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">You are writing all this, not me.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk now back to the story....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Oh wait a minute! Now I need to get into the discussing title of this chapter \"Tina uses her diaper\"! That is beyond gross, and if I know anything about you AB fetish writers you are going to go into graphic detail on just how bad she soils herself and then you're going to grab some lotion and *********************************</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk now stop! I know this story is rated 13+, I already skipped the diaper changing scene so you can trust me to be tasteful. No one is doing that, characters or readers. There are plenty of places on the internet for that \"activity\". Listen Sara I don't want to push you too far right away (unless you really dissever it, in which case it is an unrealistic hyper-messing for you in front of everyone in the town followed by a life of forced infantilism). So for now it will be a wetting, and it won't even be you this time. Sound fair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Well....no. None of this fair in the slightest. But fine whatever go on ahead.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina sprinted to the other side of the room to the massive toy chest, once again filled with energy now that she had a play-mate. Sara meanwhile took her time walking as she tried to wrap her head around this whole scenario once more in her head. 'What did Tina see in this stuff' all of this should be embarrassing or humiliating. Even in a private setting with your closest friends all of this should be making Tina just as uncomfortable as she is. It was so odd to see Tina this excited, there must be something she was missing. Tina continued to rummage through the chest as though she were looking for gold. Her diaper on full displayed nearly eclipsed her whole torso as she bent over, digging deeper into the chest. Sara took the time to take in the room a bit more. Her hands sunk into the pillow like pink carpet in much the same way as her bare feet had done when she first walked into the room. The room's scent now had a small hit of baby powder in the air after the diaper change. Speaking of amongst the loud shifting and banging of the various toys Tina had moved, moved again, and moved some more, Sara could hear the gentile crack of her diaper as she shift her position on the floor next to Tina's dolls. Her attention now more centered on her own diaper, Sara could feel just where the padding made contact on her body. The whole sensation was weird, but (if she dared say it) kind of...not terrible. \"Hey Sara.\" said an overly childish tone coming mere inches away from her. Sara look up only to startle herself back. Right in her face was a handmade doll weathered by several years of play and later neglect. Tina giggled to herself at Sara's reaction, while Sara was not as amused. \"What was that for!\" Sara spat nearly screaming. \"Don't you remember me?\" Tina said in the same tone as before with the doll covering her face. Sara upon closer inspection did recognize the doll. 'It couldn't be?' she thought \"You saved it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Whoa whoa whoa...hold up. Number one I never had a handmade doll, two this is going on way to long you are suppose to be adding a chapter not writing the whole story in one sitting (there is another section for that), and finally (and I can't believe I am saying this) Tina hasn't wet herself yet! Isn't that the focus of this chapter? Granted I am thankful for it, but the people reading this expected one thing, and this is nowhere near what you promised them.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I can't argue with that. Sorry everyone, I got a little off track. But I am sure that Tina will wet herself next chapter. Also I will finally acknowledge the fact that Will came back into the room after the changing and is watching the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo next.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You might have given her to me back in Kindergarten, but she still means a lot to me\u201d Tina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara gazed down at Miss Starfly not sure of what she should say next. She barely remembered this cheap toy but clearly, Tina was still fond of her. Taking Miss Starfly from Tina, on one hand, Sara began scanning the room. She noticed Will leaning against the doorframe watching her and Tina and met his eyes. He said nothing but gestured to Sara's right where a plastic dollhouse and it's many residences lay scattered. She looked back at him with her face pleading for more help but Will only shrugged his shoulders. Tina's giddy smile and sparkling eyes silently raised the tension further. Sara was not ready for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling over to the doll-house Sara, and quickly Tina in tow, sat down and soon both girls held dolls in each hand. Slowly the two of them started playing \"house\" together, with Sara trying her best to think of what exactly Mother Starfly would say and do in response to Baby Penelope's behavior. Tina's confidence combined with the positive energy she put into the Penelope character helped immensely with both girls' immersion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew by for the diapered teens, so much so that Sara hadn't noticed the plate of sandwiches (no crust and cut up into triangles) brought over by Will. What she did notice right away was Will's casual insertion of his finger into Tina's diaper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth are You..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought. You're wet little miss potty pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina giggled and in a sing-song voice said. \"No, I'm not. Daddy's is being silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's jaw was on the floor. How could these two be so casual about this? Playing pretend is one thing but this is something else! Sara's eyes followed Tina as she was lead by the hand towards the changing mat. Will laid her down and pulled out one diaper from a store pack that wasn't there before. Sara shut her eyes and turned away just as Will was undoing the tapes. Her face grew beat red as Tina cooed and giggled during her personal change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Had these two started a relationship?' Sara thought to herself. 'You had to be dating to do something this intimate right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sat very still as the scene between her two best friends played behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done! You were such a good girl Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always a good girl daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? So you've never been naughty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh huh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about last week when you got into the baby-powder? I spent over an hour cleaning that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was quiet, if she did respond then Sara couldn't hear it. What she could hear were footsteps coming back her way so she turned around to face her friends. Tina and Will stopped once they saw Sara's face. Their own expressions shifted to a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, is something the matter?\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we went a little too far with the role-play,\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ah, ... well, are you ... I mean ...\" Sara stuttered unable to complete a single thought much less a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if you're uncomfortable with this,...\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Heck yeah I'm uncomfortable with this! Now my two best friends are some kinky item, how can you write this!?!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pretty easily actually. And can you at least give me a little credit for being tasteful here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Hummpf...Fine. You deserve that much. It might take you forever but your writing is passable if nothing else.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Getting back to the story.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I mean, I am very weirded out by all of this and I didn't want to interrupt, but I couldn't help thinking...\" Sara trailed off finding it hard to look her friends in the eye. The diapers and baby junk were bizarre in their own right but there was a far more pressing question she could barely choke out. Closing her eyes and taking a deep breath, Sara faced her worried friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina. Will. Are you together? Like, boyfriend and girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them turned their eyes to the ground blushing bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..\" Tina started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not officially...\" Will finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just...we both share this interest and... Will is just so sweet, especially as Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina opened me up to this idea, and I always thought she was cool and funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I'm funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" Sara interrupted. Grabbing both of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just...like...well really awkward and if the two of you are a couple...\" Sara's voice grew soft and low. \"I don't want to be the third wheel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not the third wheel!\" Tina exclaimed, surprising everybody including herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my best friend and I wanted you to be apart of this because I trust you and I hoped...\" It was now Tina's turn to grow hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hoped you would love this as much as Will and I do. I wanted this baby play to be something we shared. I just wanted to be as much of myself around you as I am around Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was a long minute of silence between the three friends. A silence that was broken by Tina's stomach loudly growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I guess I'm hungry...\" Tina said awkwardly laughing. Kneeling down to the sandwiches she started wolfing them down as more of a distraction than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always seem to be in intense situations,\" Sara replied with a small smile. As Tina finished the plate in record time Sara looked back at her friends and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Will, Tina, I love you both and obviously I want to stay friends. But this, all of this, is just too much too fast. I promise to keep an open mind about the diapers and the relationship. Just, promise me you both will ease me into this and not go overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Tina and Will said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends shared a group hug before Tina ran down to the kitchen, wondering to herself aloud if she has one or two jars on mashed carrots in her 'stash'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill helped Sara up off the floor. \"Do you want me to step outside while you take off the diaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...no need. I think I'll leave it on for now. They're a pain to walk in but are pretty comfortable. I'm going to take this at my own pace if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill smiled and helped guide Sara as she walked out the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like ice cream except it tasted better and less sweet. Will beamed at her as he took a spoonful of his taro. Sara felt strange as she took a few more tastes. It was as if the yoghurt was changing her.  <i><span class=\"chotpink\"> I'm warning you, Robbie! Don't do it!</span></i> Sara gasped when she realised her hands are glowing. Will's eyes widened when he looked at her. To Sara's horror, Will was glowing to. They were turning into <i><span class=\"chotpink\"> Robbie!</span></i></span></div></div>",

Why is it that you Writers always take things so literally.  Yeah, so what if my Mom forgot the second A on my birth certificate.  EVERYONE calls me Sara and that includes you, Jacknife.  </span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sara <i><span class=\"chotpink\">that's more like it</span></i> is a bit of a tomboy and lives with her mother, Stacy and her brother, Bryan.  She hangs out at the mall with her friends Will and Tina.  She is just your average teenager until one day something strange happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Oh My Gosh!  Why does it have to be another transformation story.  Is that all you people on writing.com know how to write these days?  Just once I'd like to be in a romance, or a mystery, or even an old fashion fantasy with elves and dragons.  So what are you going to do?  Turn me into a boy?  Regress me back into a baby?  Make me fat?  I play sports you know and this is going to seriously cramp my style.  I bet you'll even steal other characters that REAL writers have made and turn this into a Fan-Fic.  I hope you get bad reviews, Jacknife.  So bad that even if you offer 500 GPs for a R&amp;R no one will read this sorry piece of trash you call a story.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you can see above, this is a story where the main character knows she is in a story and likes to talk back to the Author and Readers.  This is the second story of this type that I have wrote.  The first one was called Bill Igerant and while I deleted that one a year ago, I may rewrite it in the future.  Now time for the rules(there are many so please bare with me).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)The regular story is to be written in third person.  Sara's words to the Author and Readers should be in first person and also be in <span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Italics and Hot Pink</i></span>.  The interface for changing colors is much easier now than when I wrote Bill so I hope that everyone who adds will follow this format but I will edit and fix if someone has a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)I want strict adherence to the content rating.  That means no sex, no swearing and no graphic violence.  You can have a character be naked but no descriptions of gender specific body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) This story is made to poke fun at different genres that appear on writing.com, but only by those who love them.  This is not meant for people to bash genres that they hate.  So please only insult a type of story that you would normally write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)Here is a list of the genres that I want and do not want in here.  <br>\r\nApproved genres: Shrinking, growing, age regression/progression,adult baby, tickling,fart torture, inflating, fattening, gender bending, animal transformation(full and anthro),fanfic, fantasy, mythology,magic items, wishing.<br>\r\nRestricted genres:Vore, unbirthing, gay/lesbian, scat.<br>\r\nAnything else that isn't on either list is allowed as long as it doesn't conflict with the content rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)Sara loves to insult whoever is writing about her.  Be inventive about it as long as it is PG13.  However, she will only insult the current author of a chapter.  That means that when you add a chapter, the only author you can have her insult is you.  The exception to this rule is me.  Anyone can have her insult me.  Don't worry, I am thick skinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Please write at least 2 paragraphs with each addition.  I don't want any choice chapters.  The exception will be when I write a choice chapter and then have Sara berate me for it for 2 paragraphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7)Have fun with it.  This is meant to be lighthearted and silly, so I hope you get as much enjoyment out of this as I do.</td>",
