            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an hour of struggling through crushing pressure and strength-sapping heat, David thrust one hand upward into fresh air and struggled for a handhold he could drag himself up using! His fingers gripped into the thick edge they found, giving the exhausted man enough leverage to finally pull himself up, through the tight crevice, and into the blinding light above! \u201cF-Fuck! It\u2019s like she has those glued to her ass!\u201d he exclaimed, his whole body shaking from an ear-splitting sound he had already been bested by, blood running from his burst eardrums. Instead, the roaring around him was just a dull throbbing in his ears. He didn\u2019t care. Those cheers weren\u2019t for him. They were for her\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHANK YOU EVERYONE! BUT WE\u2019RE NOT DONE YET!\u201d her voice thundered through the speakers, drawing an even louder scream from the crowd. The world shifted once again and David knew he had only seconds to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying, David pulled his full body through the crevice and began plummeting past the black pillar toward the wooden floorboards far below. Looking back, he could see his prison far overhead: the back-right pocket of Dev\u2019s tight-fitting pants. Part of David wished he\u2019d just splatter against the stage rather than survive like this, a mite of a man. His gaze shifted back to the floor and Dev\u2019s looming sandal\u2026that shifted. His eyes went wide and he braced for impa-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!...THWACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAching all over, David cursed and struggled to stand up only to fall back on his ass again. Who the hell could have guessed Dev\u2019s fucking foot would get in the way! Bouncing off the pale flesh had tormented him twice\u2026not only did it break his fall, but even his little body managed to tickle Dev enough. He could feel her eyes glance down. Their gaze brought an oppressive weight as they locked on his crumpled form to the left of her sandal. He needed to move. NOW!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first note of the band\u2019s next song rang out, forcing David\u2019s giant captor to focus again on the cheering crowd in front of her. David thought this was his chance, but he should have known that the metal band\u2019s frontwoman wasn\u2019t going to let him go without a fight. A dark shadow grew over David as he timidly looked over his shoulder and saw the lifting slab of rubber that was Dev\u2019s sandal. If she couldn\u2019t keep him, she\u2019d crush him. Anything was fine so long as no one discovered him. There were always more people to shrink down if she could keep the secret. David screamed, his body taking over as his brain froze in fear. Scrambling forward, David just barely managed to throw himself forward as Dev stamped down in time with the first guitar riff of this set!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDust blew up all around David, along with a buffeting gust of wind that knocked him on his face. Looking back desperately over his shoulder, he could feel fear clutch his heart as Dev slowly began grinding her sandal back and forth, trying to snuff out the life she thought was beneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh f-fuck! This bitch is crazy!\u201d David whimpered, feeling dampness in his pants as he slowly tried to crawl away from the wall of rubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes shot down again and narrowed. This time she didn\u2019t stomp, her foot lifted ever-so-slightly, dust falling from it like the rubble of a building. With a quick step, she moved her foot well over his body and stepped down. Trapped. David found himself trapped between Dev\u2019s two massive sandals! Slowly, her right foot began dragging along the ground, trying to make sure he had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Dev wasn\u2019t here to play cat and mouse; she was here to put on a show and remind a bug that he was her property\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStaying here and waiting was asking for death, it was like watching a fucking rash compactor coming together\u2026from the perspective of the trash! If she was going to crush him, David wasn\u2019t planning to make things this easy for Dev. Turning, he began desperately feeling along the rubber instep of her sandal, hoping to find a groove or imperfection that he could use to climb higher. It might be dangerous, but getting over her foot would let him run again\u2026and she couldn\u2019t follow too much more without drawing attention to him. Either he\u2019d get free of her by himself or someone would see and rescue him. Either way, all he had to do was climb over this fucking sandal! Finally, David found the kind of rough material he needed to scale the side of her sandal. Gripping onto the rough edges and grooves worn into the side of Dev\u2019s sandal, David began climbing toward its insole; the pale wall of flesh; and, hopefully, freedom from this nightmare.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRRRRN\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDev\u2019s mind was racing as she continued trying to drag her feet together and get through this song. If they found the tiny creep on stage right now, then they might find the others. They\u2019d know about all the little ones she\u2019d played with in the past and\u2026well, it was something she\u2019d really like to avoid. Shrinking down this venue and her band were an option, but she prayed it would remain remote\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDavid groaned, his muscles aching after escaping from her pants, falling to the floor, and almost getting crushed underfoot twice now. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could struggle like this, but as his hand finally slapped against the damp leather insole of Dev\u2019s sandal, he found his umpteenth second wind of the day! Pulling himself up and rolling onto Dev\u2019s insole, David looked at the pale wall of flesh, wrapped in stocking and swallowed nervously. In the panic earlier, he hadn\u2019t really tried to see just how big the colossal woman he was trying to escape from was (and it wasn\u2019t like he could gauge it when pressed against her ass). Taking his firth breath in a while, he could see that she\u2019d made him absolutely miniscule. He could see dead skin on her foot\u2019s arch; he could see the fraying edges of her stocking; he could hear the groaning strain of her insole under her weight; he could practically taste her perspiration on his tongue; he could see what he was compared to her\u2026nothing. Less than that. He wasn\u2019t even a bug, just a mite. And to make matters worse, as David was struck by his pathetic situation, Dev adjusted her stance\u2026her ankle rolled a little\u2026and David found himself tumbling into the darkness of her foot\u2019s arch and the wrinkled ceiling of her sweaty sole\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling into the parking lot, Julie was practically bouncing in her car to Dev\u2019s music, pre-gamming the concert so she didn\u2019t blow her whole budget at the venue\u2019s bar. As the music pounded and drinks spilled down her gullet, Julie cranked up the music and literally began bouncing in her car. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because she\u2019d poured too heavy or because she was so excited, but Julie could have sworn she felt her whole car shaking with her! Her phone buzzed from friends asking if she was alright; they were inside the venue and seemed concerned\u2026Julie figured it was because she still hadn\u2019t gone inside. Without texting them back, Julie killed the engine and kicked open the door to her car, flask in hand. Taking another deep swig, she jumped out and giggled while slumping against the neighboring car. She threw her door closed and just enjoyed the night air on her skin. Looking up, she felt confused. \u201cW-Where the fuck ish the moon?\u201d Julie asked. It hadn\u2019t been cloudy tonight, yet all she could see overhead was darkne-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDev felt her pale cheeks flush red and slowly slid a hand between her legs, rubbing at the tight fabric of her pants as the sensation of crushing metal and buckling asphalt managed to make it through her sandal to her soft soles (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/412193_378992992139620_1431705315_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_sid=e007fa&amp;_nc_ohc=p17wAKzGh8kAX_SCJLn&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&amp;oh=839c633e5e9d865b78d73f7e4b2f0437&amp;oe=5EA85B85\" target=\"_blank\">https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t...</a>). Part of her wished she had done that barefoot, but there was always another parking lot on this stupid city that would be waiting for her foot to fall on it. Biting her bottom lip, Dev wordlessly looked down at her sandal and began grinding it back and forth. She had no clue how many people were in that parking lot, but it had been packed. At least a couple? Fuck, she hoped one of them looked up before she stepped down on their worthless little face! A soft moan escaped Dev\u2019s lips as the power surge she was feeling raced through her body like electricity. Her gaze slowly lowered to see the small black building she had been schedule to play at tonight. Dozens of sweaty bodies were crammed into its walls, all waiting for her. Well\u2026they were about to get more than they bargained for. Grinding her foot a little more, she tapped her sandal on the ground and delighted in the damage she saw that caused to the surrounding buildings! Windows cracked and facades crumbles in the wake of the Dev-quake. Shifting her eyes back to the building, Dev saw some of her little fans coming out to see the damage. Her eyes went wider when she saw the venue apparently had a tarp roof that it was pulling back to appease her panicked audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShowtime~\u201d she whispered, already feeling hot again as she imagined the view from inside the venue. After several tremors that would have doubtlessly caused a panic, the roof slowly pulled back to reveal pale moonlight\u2026and Dev, staring down at them like some ancient, dark goddess, come to wreak havoc. Her ears picked up the faint echo of a panicked choir of screaming. She was wet\u2026enough foreplay, time to do what she came here for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSquatting over the venue, Dev knew that all eyes were on her\u2026though she was clueless that the horrified onlookers could already smell her excitement; it served to terrify them even more. Planting her hands on either side of the building, Dev couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she felt the fragile buildings crumbling against her palms. She\u2019d broken gingerbread houses with more structural integrity. Some little ones looked like they were trying to run through the front, causing Dev to just roll her eyes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sun9-50.userapi.com/c621704/v621704362/56aca/y72uSUxWmhU.jpg?ava=1\" target=\"_blank\">https://sun9-50.userapi.com/c621704/v621...</a>). With a flick of her finger, she caved in the front and back entrances to the venue before brushing her hair back behind her ear. Looking down at the tiny people like a cat eyeing cornered mice, Dev cooed, \u201cWELCOME TO THE SHOW, BUGS~ THERE\u2019S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE LINEUP TONIGHT\u2026YOU LUCKY ONES ARE GOING TO GET A PRIVATE SHOW~ FEEL FREE TO THANK ME.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t Inside the venue, the terrified onlookers began pushing and shoving, looking for an exit that didn\u2019t exist as their gothic-themed goddess overhead loomed menacingly. Screams grew as a second moan managed to sneak past Dev\u2019s lips, shaking everyone to the bone and threatening to burst eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFUCK\u2026I CAN\u2019T TAKE IT ANYMORE~\u201d Dev purred, leaning in closer. Her face now took up the entire sky\u2026her flushed cheeks told the crowd all they needed to know: the more frightened they became, the hotter Dev was going to get (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4s_KSewezGo/hqdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4s_KSewezGo/hqdef...</a>). This wasn\u2019t an extermination; they didn\u2019t deserve that kind of recognition. This was playtime, and Dev\u2019s dedicated audience had become her unwilling playthings. Dev\u2019s overwhelming presence was driving some people mad, screaming and begging to wake up from their nightmare. As if in response, Dev bit her bottom lip hard enough to almost draw blood before bringing her face in closer. The little ones could hear the crumbling of masonry as one of Dev\u2019s fingers appeared and pushed against a nostril, closing it. People realized too late what was going on as Dev inhaled deeply\u2026dragging more than a dozen people from the venue and snorting them like a party drug many had partaken in before the show. Their screams were drowned out in the roar of Dev\u2019s snorting, but the giggling and groaning from Dev let everyone know that the unlucky ones were fighting for their lives deep in her nose\u2026and losing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOOOOOOH~ THEY\u2019RE STILL GOING? AMAZING~\u201d Dev moaned, not caring whether her voice deafened every one of her toys. They didn\u2019t need their ears to scream or struggle. Speaking of struggling, Dev thought that snorting some tiny fans would have just been silly, maybe make her sneeze. She was dead wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it felt like she\u2019d taken a hit of a powerful aphrodisiac! Groaning, Dev leaned back, plopping her tight ass into the middle of the parking-lot (and the neighboring buildings) that had been demolished under her sandals. She leaned her head back, the tingles and tickles from her victim\u2019s struggling acting like a bolt of lightning running right to her libido! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDeep inside Dev\u2019s left nostril, the dozen or so tiny fans were each engaged in their own life-or-death struggle. The shifting of the world as Dev leaned back and crashed on her ass had made their situations go straight from bad to worse. One unlucky fan had been clinging onto a nose-hair, but when Dev plopped down, she found herself falling\u2026falling\u2026falling\u2026until he head found itself getting caught in a bit of mucus on a hair; it acted like a noose, instantly snapping her neck and leaving her limp body flopping until it was swallowed by the gooey matter coating the walls of this cavern. A second one had been sucked clean back through Dev\u2019s nose and found themselves in pitch-black darkness trying to climb the slick walls of her nasal cavity. As Dev leaned her head back, the tiny man rolled backwards and found himself sliding slowly down the back of Dev\u2019s throat. Others were struggling to drag their way out from a glob of snot, or clinging to nose hairs, or drowning in her mucus if they were supremely unlucky. Each struggle though tickled Dev\u2019s nose hairs; each tickle sent a small shock through her body; and knowing what was causing those tickles, each one just made Dev inch closer and closer to grabbing the nearest sturdy object to masturbate with\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nope. She was on the right part of the venue and all the shit that should have been around her merch booth was all correct. \u201cFuck\u2026I mean\u2026Kat\u2019s the one setting up tonight. She normally does it right,\u201d Lacey sighed, flicking the map away and scrolling through her contact list to see if she\u2019d remembered to save Kat\u2019s number in her phone. Finding the number, she pressed it and held the phone to her ear as the dial tone began to sound. Nearby, the phone began to ring\u2026but Lacey wouldn\u2019t hear it. Afterall, Kat\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t as big as Lacey\u2019s anymore\u2026nor was Kat. Shivering, Lacey\u2019s merch booth salesperson looked up at the headliner looming over her like a downtown skyscraper\u2026with feet\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOOM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKat screamed, ducking behind the merch booth as Lacey\u2019s left foot slammed down a few inches away from her hiding spot, kicking up a cloud of dust and debris that rained down on her like a landmine had just gone off! Peeking out from under the booth\u2019s tablecloth, Kat felt her heart leap into her chest. About 10 yards in front of her was a wall of white rubber that stood at least 7 feet high. The top row had a series of thick black ropes weaving in and out of the material, linking the rubber rampart to a massive sail of black canvas that was peppered with bits of dust and debris that clung to the woven material like remnants of grapeshot lodged in a castle\u2019s wall. Higher still, Kat saw as the fabric gave way to pale flesh; veins stood out like blue waterslide tubes and Lacey\u2019s ankle cast its own shadow that swallowed the booth in its darkness. Kat had always liked Toms in the past; they were comfy and cute. Lacey\u2019s pair gave off an entirely different feeling now; from her position on the ground, the cute flats now looked like an imposing fortress\u2026and Kat was the unfortunate soul who now had to launch a lone assault on its wall (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.facebook.com/LaceySturm81/photos/a.297219620387709/2498458943597088/?type=3&amp;source=54&amp;ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.facebook.com/LaceySturm81/phot...</a>). Whimpering, Kat could only stare as Lacey squatted down and her own phone\u2019s ringing stopped; from her eyes rolling, it was clear she\u2019d been sent to voicemail. One chance to contact the giantess who\u2019s mere presence dominated her world, and Kat had let it slip by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cL-Lacey?\u201d Kay managed to squeak, her voice cracking as the wall of Lacey\u2019s foot groaned from her shifting weight. \u201cL-Lacey! Lacey, oh fuck, please! I\u2019m here! I-I\u2019m down here!\u201d Kat began to scream, her voice gaining strength with every word. Still, even when she began shouting at the top of her lungs, Kat\u2019s voice didn\u2019t even make Lacey twitch in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGRRRRRRRRRN\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tiny woman\u2019s eyes shot back down to see the white, rubber portion of the Toms had moved\u2026closer? To Kat\u2019s horror, Lacey slowly began rising to her full height once more. In a matter of moments, Lacey was once again taller than the Empire State Building and stretching higher. Rising onto her tip-toes, Lacey sighed and shifted her stance. Kat pissed herself as the dirty sole of Lacey\u2019s Toms replaced her sky\u2026and began to fall. \u201cF-Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Not like this! I-I\u2019m not gonna die like this! L-Laaaaaaaaceeeee-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no more booth. It had crunched under the ball of Lacey\u2019s foot, shattering into a mess of splintered wood, twisted metal, smashed shot-glasses, and crushed coffee cups. T-shirts, sweaters, and other clothing that had been piled high were flattened into a messy mass of fabric, sliced to bits by the tiny pebbles that had been lodged in the underside of her footwear. Everything that had been caught by the unforgiving rubber sole of Lacey\u2019s flats was flattened. Everything. Panting and sobbing in relief, Kat saw that she had managed to scrape by the fraction of an inch that separated her continued existence as a person\u2026 from her potential death as a greasy smear on Lacey\u2019s sole. Although she was bug-sized, Kat was alive. At least for now. But if she didn\u2019t move soon, another twist of Lacey\u2019s foot might spell the end of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKat couldn\u2019t afford to wait and plan her next move. There was one place nearby where she would be least likely to get stepped on\u2026and that was on Lacey\u2019s foot itself. Looking up at the instep of Lacey\u2019s left foot, Kat knew that this was stupid, but staying still was even dumber. Running forward, she leaped at the rubber wall and began scrambling up the small imperfections. \u201cJ-Just need\u2026to\u2026reach\u2026the\u2026fabric,\u201d she groaned, struggling to find hand and footholds on the thick material. Maybe it was because she was so tiny or maybe it was because of the adrenaline running through her system, but Kat managed to scramble up the wall and grabbed hold of the black stitching with an iron grip. That was one step down. Unfortunately, Lacey looked like she was about to take another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOOM\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith her stretch over, Lacey allowed her heels to come back down onto the tile floor (nearly shaking Kat off her precarious hold in the process). Stowing her phone back in her pocket, Lacey was about to move when she felt something under her foot. Something\u2026dusty? It was slight, but her foot just seemed to shift. Lacey remembered that this venue had a very special security system; anyone in an unauthorized area  was warned and, if they didn\u2019t vacate the area, shrunken. It had been designed to stop people from stealing and running since you needed to be found and restored to your normal height. Lacey had thought that the system was turned off for them\u2026but the slight sensation of something crunching under the thing rubber sole of her Toms made Lacey begin to break out in a nervous sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh no\u2026nonononono\u2026. Not Kat,\u201d Lacey whined, looking around and finding a nearby table she could plop herself down on top of. Slowly lifting her left foot, Lacey began bouncing toward the table on her right foot, cursing under her breath and praying that Kat just flaked on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-Shit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNononono!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cL-Lacey! Please!\u201d Kat whined, her fingers burning as each of the giantess\u2019 bounces toward the table threatened to doom the shrunken woman to a bone-shattering freefall. It seemed like Lacey had gotten the picture of what was going on, but her attempts to be careful were going to kill Kat at this rate! Digging deep, the tiny woman dug her hands into the black ropes even further, causing her fingers and knuckles to scream out in pain as each hop threatened to push them beyond their limits. If the pressure had increased on a single finger much more, then Kat knew they\u2019d snap. Broken hands couldn\u2019t help her climb the giant singer. It was a race against time. Would Kat\u2019s hands last till Lacey made it to a seat? Or would she lose her grip and splatter on the dirty tile floor below?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease, please, please let me be wrong,\u201d Lacey whined as she made it to the table and turned around, planting her butt on the surface and hoisting herself up. Legs crossed, the giant woman paused, almost too afraid to see what debris might be clinging to the sole of her left foot (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/xs9PPL8\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/xs9PPL8</a>). What if? Lacey felt her cheeks growing red at the thought. Poor Kat. Down there. Calling for her, screaming for help. Did she really? Closing her eyes tight, Lacey swallowed audibly and grabbed her foot, pulling it closer for a look. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could hear your heart hammering in your chest and closed your eyes, slowly and awkwardly puckering your lips as you waited for her lips to meet yours. You could feel her warm breath on your face\u2026but no kiss. Instead, she leaned in closer, her breath in your ear as she whispered, \u201cYeah right, loser~\u201d You felt a pinch in your arm and thought you might throw up as your head felt like it was suddenly splitting open and every inch of your body was in unimaginable pain! Then\u2026nothing, just cold air around you as the sound of the bus door opening and people pushing past each other boomed in your ears like it was broadcast over the loudspeakers\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore you could figure out what was going on, something big was moving your way\u2026and quickly! The ground shuddered. You fell to your ass. Tremors continued getting worse as you struggled to stand up. Your eyes opened to a vertigo-inducing display of massive bodies milling around like annoyed skyscrapers. Snapping your head to the side, you felt sick as Nuki\u2019s hand reached toward you\u2026larger than your home and not nearly as friendly-looking (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/46/66/574666e9405a8b22daf603a710dd6cc8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/46/66/57466...</a>).  You could see the pale pillars of flesh that were here fingers and acted on instinct, trying to roll out of the way. It was pointless. Nuki easily pinched your pathetic body between her digits and didn\u2019t even bother lifting you to her face to gloat. Instead, she dragged you across the seat and leaned forward, making you think for a moment she might just let your body slam into the floor of the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wanted to be closer, right?\u201d she whispered venomously as your eyes caught sight of her pale, right foot slowly sliding out of her flip-flop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou began to panic as you saw the foam foundation with a clear imprint of Nuki\u2019s bare foot waiting for you. Turning to look up at the massive head of dreadlocks, dark make-up, and pale skin, you began to babble and beg for mercy\u2026. Nuki paused, her large, dark eyes turning to stare at you for a moment. \u201cP-Please! I promise, if you make me big, I\u2019ll leave you alone!\u201d Her fingers suddenly squeezed tighter, threatening to snap your ribs like dry twigs as she wrinkled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, you only wanna talk when I don\u2019t want you to\u2026but as soon as it\u2019s not fun for you, you\u2019re ready to leave? No way, fucker. You\u2019re getting what you asked for,\u201d Nuki whispered, suddenly letting go of your body and smirking as you tumbled to the abandoned, wet foam of her flip-flop below\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou almost passed out as your body slammed into the indent left by the ball of her foot. A few centimeters to the north or south and the blush foam would have cushioned your fall, something Nuki clearly didn\u2019t want as she giggled overhead. Pain surged through your body as you flipped onto your back and prepared to beg one more time. No such luck. Nuki winked as she pulled on her headphones and looked out the bus window\u2026you were officially beneath her notice. At least, her head wasn\u2019t going to pay attention to you. Her toes were another matter. You felt the entire flip-flop shudder as Nuki\u2019s bare toes drummed against the heel of her footwear. Each pale digit was bigger than your car\u2026and like a deer-in-headlights, you could do nothing as they began moving toward you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i1.wp.com/n1s1.starhit.ru/a3/5c/52/a35c52f65bedb564598b31ca4e062ce1/600x600_0_817083c3310b240d7ad48660898bdff3@600x600_0xc0a8399a_15328040441478011766.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i1.wp.com/n1s1.starhit.ru/a3/5c/...</a>).... Whether it was a car slamming into a deer or toes hitting a bug, small things tended to do badly when their bigger counterparts hit into them. If you didn\u2019t get off of this flip-flop now, then you were positive that Nuki would end your life.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nFlipping onto your stomach, you grimaced as your senses were overwhelmed with the scent of foot-sweat that had soaked into Nuki\u2019s massive flip-flop. It has been a hot day outside and the foam you were crawling across had been more than lightly coated in her perspiration. Your clothing quickly became heavy with it. Your mouth and nose were forced to endure the scent and taste as each tremor from her tapping toes caused your head to smack into the foam. Looking over your shoulder, your heart jumped into your throat\u2026the pale toes were at the thong of the flip-flop and gently wiggling, pulling the foam up in jerking motions.

Instead, you saw a massive, pale face smirk down at you without a hint of remorse as Nuki casually chewed on her thumb-nail (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQjLEw-Krb_PxxPmfFyxp3bX3G0gQqDPYpLBSLJRQZi-8KYLK3B&amp;usqp=CAU\" target=\"_blank\">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/image...</a>). You were just another piece of filth on the floor of this bus that had been lucky enough to get this close to her feet\u2026that was what Nuki\u2019s gaze was telling you. And before you could formulate a response, the massive toes pulled into position, swallowing you under their slick, hot, heavy pads\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cP-Please! N-No!\u201d you screamed, one of the giant digits slamming down into the middle of your back and squeezing the air from your lungs. Just as quickly as it had smashed into you, the digit lifted, pulling you into the air with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cF-Fu-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even meaning to, the giant woman had just used her middle toe to knock the crap out of your tiny body. Nuki had a tune in her head that wouldn\u2019t leave her alone; with each toe-tap she unknowingly made, Nuki birthed a new bruise on your body and pushed your ribcage closer to shattering like a painful pinata. You felt your stomach lurch as her toes rose for a fifth tap. Looking down at the imprint her digit had worn into the massive flip-flop from several uses, you couldn\u2019t help but whimper. At least if she were mocking you, it would have meant you mattered somehow. Right now, you weren\u2019t worth talking to or looking at. You were dirt. Stuck to her toe. Already free-falling to be suplexed against the damp foam of her flip-flop one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
