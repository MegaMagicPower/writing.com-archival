All of the following characters are friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b><br>\r\nEmily is a 4'11\" 84 lb. blond-haired girl on the junior varsity cheer squad. She is the smallest girl on the team and is a \"flyer\" (the girl who is tossed up in the air by the larger cheerleaders). The larger, more developed girls on the squad make fun of her short stature and lack of development. She has a sister, Emma, on the varsity cheer squad, who is a pretty 5'4\" 115 lb. girl who makes fun of her younger, less developed sister as well. Emily would give almost anything just to cross the 5'0\" mark!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kat</b><br>\r\nKat is a 5'0\" 90 lb. redhead. Her mom forces her to go to ballet class twice per week, where she is picked on by the other girls. She is clumsy and small and has difficulty executing the moves in dance class. She has acne and braces and is an only child. Her mom puts pressure on her to be elegant, charming, and beautiful, but she feels anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maria</b><br>\r\nMaria is a 4'10\" 82 lb. Latina girl. She is a point guard on the JV basketball team, but rides the bench most of the time, due to her lack of strength and height. The other girls on the team make fun of her tiny stature and lack of athleticism. Her brother is a year younger but 6 inches taller than her and constantly shows his superiority when they shoot baskets in front of the garage at home as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jessica</b><br>\r\nJessica is a 4'9\" 78 lb. Asian girl who wears glasses. She is the youngest of three sisters. Her parents love music and want their girls to excel at it. The oldest is about to start college in the fall on a music scholarship. The middle sister is about to start her senior year of high school and is an immensely talented musician. Jessica is in the school choir, but she is small and shy with a squeaky voice. The more beautiful, more developed girls in choir taunt both her looks and her singing ability. Her eldest sister encourages her, but the middle sister belittles her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Another Character</b><br>\r\nMake up your own character!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>The Story Begins...</b></font><br>\r\nTwo weeks before the school starts, a girl walks into a dusty antique book shop. She sees an ancient-looking Venetian leather-bound book with faded lettering on the cover--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The Burgeoning Book</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girl opens the book, it seems to be a collection of short stories about girls who grow larger and more beautiful. A strange sort of glow seems to emanate from the pages as it is opened, and the girl feels a strange tingling sensation as her eyes scan the pages. She closes it and purchases it with all of the cash that she has, then takes it home to read the first story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich girl found and purchased the Burgeoning Book?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Emily walked home with the book in her backpack on Sunday afternoon, she thought about the start of cheer camp the following day with dread. The girls were always so nasty to her, especially Carly. Carly was only 5\u20191\u201d, the second-shortest girl on the squad. Emily supposed that Carly was happy to have someone else even smaller to make her feel better about herself. Carly <i>was</i> a cute girl, with red hair and a splash of light freckles. Some of the girls, like Jamie, Amanda, and Rachel were much taller and bustier than Carly, but Emily would be happy even to match Carly\u2019s 5\u20191\u201d height and A-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily got to her room, she looked at posters of the most beautiful pop stars and actresses on her wall and sighed enviously. <i>What I wouldn\u2019t do to have even a fraction of their beauty\u2026</i> she thought. She took the book out of her backpack and set it on the desk in her room. <i>If I can\u2019t </i> become <i>more beautiful, at least I can read about girls who do,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily heard her mom\u2019s voice from downstairs and ran down the stairs for dinner. Emily\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d pretty sister Emma arrived at the table just as she did. Emma used one of her large, sexy hips to bump Emily to the side, sending her sprawling to the ground. \u201cOops! Sorry about that, squirt! I guess my hips are just getting really wide. This hourglass figure of mine has just grown so much,\u201d Emily\u2019s sister said with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rose from the ground fuming. Her sister was already far bigger and more developed than she was. Did she have to rub it in at every opportunity?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom and dad arrived at the table, and her mom served each of them a helping of spaghetti. Emma stole a meatball from Emily\u2019s plate and gobbled it down. \u201cEmma, you thief!\u201d objected Emily too late to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you need it, squirt!\u201d said Emma. \u201cWhat do you weigh\u2026 60 pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, don\u2019t quarrel,\u201d said their mother. Emma promptly kicked Emily under the table, leaving a bruise on the smaller girl\u2019s shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Emily woke up at 6:00 AM and put on the sports bra and leggings that all of the girls at cheer camp would wear. She looked in the mirror. She was so flat that the AA sports bra didn\u2019t look like it was containing anything. Her stomach was flat but shapeless and undefined. Her stick-like legs made even the lycra fabric of the athletic leggings look loose and baggy. She steeled herself for the mockery that was to come as she looked in the mirror. Why couldn\u2019t she have even half of the curves that her older, sexier sister had. Her sister\u2019s hips and shapely legs filled out an outfit like this Emma\u2019s B-cups made a sports bra look great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blew out a frustrated breath, packed a water bottle and put on a jacket. Her mom drove her to cheer camp at the school. The football team was practicing at the stadium, whistles and yelling coming from that direction. The cheer team was assembling in the soccer field, so Emily hopped out of the car and jogged over to meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily approached the other girls, she felt a surge of envy. Rachel was a pretty 5\u20194\u201d brunette with B-cup breasts and a build similar to her sister\u2019s. Jamie was more athletic, with a defined stomach under her sports bra, and long legs that brought her to 5\u20196\u201d. Her chest wasn\u2019t huge, but it was larger than Rachel\u2019s. Amanda, the captain of the squad looked like a model. Long blond hair, D-cup breasts, a slim, leggy 5\u20198\u201d build, she was what Emily always wished she looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily admired the sexy forms of the other cheerleaders, she felt ashamed as she unzipped her jacket to show her shapeless, tiny body. Carly ran up behind her and knocked her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2014you\u2019re so skinny I didn\u2019t even see you standing there, 2D Emily!\u201d Carly said, with a cruel smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2D Emily\u201d was the nickname Carly had given her, apparently thinking the reference to a two-dimensional surface clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you actually lose weight over the summer, 2D? I wouldn\u2019t have thought that possible. You\u2019re boobs look almost concave!\u201d The other girls began to laugh along with Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily fumed. God, how she wished her body would just <i>grow</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, Emily had worn out her frail body practicing the cheers, jumps, and throws. She hadn\u2019t even been able to do more than one burpee as the other girls each did thirty. When her mom picked her up and asked how the first day of camp had been, she lied and said that it had been great! Her mom had smiled at her and told her about Emma\u2019s first day of cheer camp when she had been promoted to varsity immediately. <i>Just what I wanted to hear\u2026 how another girl is better than me, yet again!</i> thought Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to her room, she shut the door and cried quietly. After a few moments, she looked up and spotted the book she had purchased yesterday. She remembered the stories that she had quickly skimmed in the shop and felt a surge of emotion. She definitely felt like reading a story that might give her some hope! She opened the book, her face lit by the faint golden glow of its pages, and began to read.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily read the story of the <i>Princess and the Peach</i>, her exhaustion from cheer camp sending her drifting off to sleep the moment she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, she awoke, still at her desk, head resting on <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. She stretched her aching back, which hurt from a night of being hunched over her desk instead of in a proper bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze, she put on her next athletic outfit. Putting on the sports bra, she noticed two small lumps pressing the fabric outward. What was that? Were those breasts? She raced to her mirror. Sure enough, there were two tiny breasts, barely enough to fill her AA bra, but certainly more than the ironing board  she had yesterday. She danced around the room, thrilled that puberty had finally blessed her with an appearance! She pulled on the leggings, which were still loose but noticeably fuller than they had been the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith newfound energy, she prepared her things for the day at cheer camp, ate breakfast and jumped in the car with her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached Carly and the other girls, she saw Carly frown as she noticed the smaller girl\u2019s small swells in her sports bra. She seemed to notice that Emily was only an inch shorter than her as well. Feeling her place in the pecking order threatened by her growing teammate, Carly was relentless in her teasing for the remainder of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2D\u2019s stuffing her bra now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2D is 2Dumb to know the moves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2D Emily has no curves just like a tree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bothered Emily, but not as much as it had the day before. She was 5\u20190\u201d today. Nothing was going to bring her down on this day. She had dreamed of hitting the big 5-0 for years and was so thankful that it had finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was able to do five burpees easily today, struggling through another five as well, before her strength failed. She may still be the lowliest of the cheerleaders, but at least she was improving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, when she got home, she called Kat, sharing with her the excitement of finally hitting the five foot mark. Kat wanted to come over to see Emily\u2019s growth for herself. While she waited for her friend, Emily read another short story from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kat arrived, she pulled out the tape measure she had brought. Standing Emily against the wall, she measured\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but you\u2019re actually 5\u20191\u201d now! You\u2019re an inch taller than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shrieked with excitement! She had grown not one but two inches in the last 24 hours!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat examined the small bulges in Emily\u2019s t-shirt and said, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re growing in more directions than one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily followed Kat\u2019s eyes down to her chest. Were they bigger than they were this morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat grabbed the cloth tape measure and measured her friend. As she pulled the measure around, it read 23\u201d. Okay, so you\u2019re a 28 bra size. She pulled the tape measure around the fullest part of her friend\u2019s now visible breasts. It read 29\u201d. So you\u2019re a 28A now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Kat squealed together this time. She was the first of her friends to hit the magical A cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s celebration, Kat noticed the ancient-looking tome sitting on Emily\u2019s desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, on Sunday, I was at that antique shop downtown, and I found it. I\u2019ve read a couple of the stories\u2014they\u2019re about girls growing taller and more beautiful. It sounded like what I wanted to do, so I\u2026\u201d Emily trailed off, a thought dawning on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think the book\u2026\u201d Emily started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Had something to do with you growing two inches since yesterday?\u201d Kat finished. \u201cI\u2019m starting to suspect it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat opened the book and the golden glow illuminated her face. Her eyes skimmed the pages and she flipped toward the end of the book until a title caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Emily and the Cheer Squad</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily watched her friend\u2019s jaw drop, then walked around to see what Kat was looking at in the book. She read the title and the opening paragraph of the unfinished story, and gasped, \u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends read the story about Emily, Carly, Jamie, Rachel, Amanda, and Emma. At the bottom, they read about Emily and Kat and the measurements, the final words appearing on the page as they read them. There was no doubt. The book was recording Emily\u2019s own story as it went!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the girls know as they looked at each other in stunned silence, they had both gained another inch in the time that it took them to read Emily\u2019s story.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carly arrived at cheer camp the next day. Rachel, Jamie, and Amanda were all so tall and sexy. They were what cheerleaders were supposed to be! Carly looked in the mirror every day to see her modest 5\u20191\u201d frame and A-cup breasts only to wish she looked more like the other girls. At least she was more blessed than Emily. That girl had absolutely nothing in the looks department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had looked just the slightest bit taller yesterday, however. And she had tiny little bumps in her bra where there had been pretty much nothing the day before. The girl was probably just stuffing Kleenex into her bra, Carly decided. As modest as they were, that much growth didn\u2019t happen in one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly saw Rachel do a double take at something behind her, so she turned. There was Emily. Wow! Her face was looking a little better. It seemed clearer and brighter than yesterday. Were her legs longer? Carly was pretty sure that they were. Her breasts filled out her sports bra even more than yesterday. Those might even be as big as Carly\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily approached, Carly\u2019s stomach sank as she looked\u2026 <b><i>up</i></b> an inch to meet Emily\u2019s eyes. Emily smiled broadly. \u201cGood morning, Carly!\u201d she said, then bounded off to join the trio of prettier girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was stunned. How had this happened? In one night she had gone from an inch shorter to an inch taller than her? And just as busty? That wasn\u2019t possible, was it? Clearly, it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger surged through Carly. She was the ugliest and smallest of the cheerleaders now?!? How dare this little runt do this do her! She ran up to Emily and slapped her, ready to fight. Emily looked shocked, but Jamie and Amanda pulled each of the smaller girls away from each other before anything more could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda pulled her away from Carly, Emily tried to wrap her mind around the sudden turn of events. Why had Carly attacked her? Emily tried to put a lid on her anger as she worked to understand what the other girl must be feeling. If she were Carly, she would probably be upset at being passed too. But would she slap the other girl? Call her names? No, on both counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was a bitch, Emily decided. Emily couldn\u2019t wait to read another story from <i>The Burgeoning Book</i> and leave her even further behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda reprimanded both of them and told them they would be kicked off the squad if they did anything like that again, Emily resolved to try to beat Carly at all of today\u2019s exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily put her full focus on learning the moves that Amanda was demonstrating to them. She emphasized every movement and nailed every turn. Amanda even complimented her once today! That had never happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, however, just seemed to give her an angry glare every time Emily looked her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time for burpees. This was the moment of camp that Emily always dreaded. Today, however, she was feeling stronger than usual. She looked over to Carly. She could beat that girl today and finish all thirty burpees before Carly could. She had never even completed all thirty before, but today would be the day\u2026 she just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 four\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked over to Carly. She was a half-burpee ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...15\u2026 16\u2026 17\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked over. Was she ahead? She wasn\u2019t sure. She redoubled her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...28\u2026 29\u2026 30!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily jumped up to finish the final burpee, gasping for breath. She looked over. Carly was still down, struggling to push off the ground for her last one. She had done it!!! She beat Carly and finished all of her burpees for the first time ever!!! Amanda came over and said, \u201cNice job, Em! I\u2019ve never seen you get all of your burpees before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily beamed with pride. She smiled beatifically when her mom came to pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! It looks like someone had a good day at camp today!\u201d her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded excitedly. She pulled out her phone and texted all of her friends. She couldn\u2019t wait to share this feeling with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, she anxiously read another story until her friends arrived. She stood on the tape measure and marked her height. When she turned around, she saw it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5\u20193\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d she said out loud just before the doorbell rang. She ran downstairs to greet her friends.<br>\r\n\u2003</span></div></div>",

As they passed, Emma noticed that Emily was nearly as tall as she was! The small swells under her shirt were new as well. Emma was used to being five inches taller than her younger sister, so being one inch taller was quite a difference!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was certain that Emily wasn\u2019t that tall even a few days ago, when she had knocked her sister down at the dinner table. There was no way that was just a normal growth spurt! Now all of her sister\u2019s friends were over? Something was up. And she intended to find out what is was. She walked into her room and shut the door. Placing her ear to the door, she listened for the other girls to go into her sister\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rushed past her sister in excitement and let her friends in. She hugged each of them then quickly ushered them up to her room, where she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily showed her friends the book, showed them the 5\u20193\u201d measurement on the tape measure then thrust out her new boobs. Kat, Maria, and Jessica took turns feeling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Em! That\u2019s amazing. Those feel like pretty big A\u2019s to me. You have got to be closing in on B-cups now! You\u2019re huge!!\u201d Jessica said, staring up to her friend, now six inches taller than she was. \u201cCan I read a story? I\u2019m shorter than all of you guys, and I soooo want to get a little bit taller!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow them the most amazing thing about the book, Em,\u201d Kat suggested to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily brought the book over, flipped toward the end and found the title:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Emily and the Cheer Squad</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s and Jessica\u2019s mouths opened in shock. \u201cThat\u2026 that\u2019s you!!\u201d they both said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, crazy, huh. The story seems to be appearing as things happen,\u201d said Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Kat chattered with Emily about how wild it was that the book appeared to be writing new stories by itself, while Jessica finished reading the story. Jessica read the last line, which said, \u201cJessica read the last line of Emily\u2019s story.\u201d <i>That is totally trippy!</i> Jessica thought to herself. It was beyond strange to read a story that included you reading that very story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Jessica would discover that by reading the story, she had added an inch to her 4\u20199\u201d frame, taking her to 4\u201910\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled about how cool the book was, then decided that they would come over to Emily\u2019s house each night and take turns reading a story and grow a little more each day. They wanted it to look like a normal, if fast growth spurt, so they didn\u2019t dare read more than a story per day to keep up appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, however, was leaving on a vacation with her family the following day and wouldn\u2019t be back until just before school started. \u201cI\u2019m so jealous,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so far behind you guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Emily said. \u201cYou can just read a little faster than the rest of us when you get back to catch up! Why don\u2019t you read a chapter now, before you go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria did, and left that night an inch taller than when she came. She couldn\u2019t wait to see if she could finally launch a shot over her taller brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily had been telling the girls about the book and how it had affected her, Emma had had her ear to Emily\u2019s door and had heard every last detail. When she heard the girls preparing to leave, she snuck back into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that\u2019s how she\u2019s growing so fast! Well, two can play at that game\u2026</i> Emma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, she waited for Emily to fall asleep, then snuck into her room, took the book back to her room, and started reading\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With this one, she would be nearly as tall as her sister. Emily finished chapter, verified her 5\u20194\u201d stature, showered and got ready for cheer camp. Pulling on her AA sports bra, her B-cups filled the bra to the straining point. Her stomach was beginning to show some lines of definition as it toned up. Her hips and legs finally filled out the lycra workout pants to their sleek, athletic design. She looked again at her now-almost-pretty face and smiled as she walked out of her bedroom door\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026until she saw her 5\u20199\u201d model-gorgeous sister saunter by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, squirt!\u201d her sister said with a wink. Emma was even taller and sexier than Amanda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Maria\u2019s parents have to be taking her on vacation now of all times? She was excited for her friends to start reading stories and growing, but she wished that she could be part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was so sick of being the shortest, tiniest member of the basketball team. Her <i>younger</i> brother could block her shots without even jumping! A few more inches would mean so much to her. At least she had gained an inch last night. That was something, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her parents drove north, Maria imagined how her life would be when she grew a few more times from the stories in <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. The girls on the basketball team wouldn\u2019t be able to call her \u201cMini Maria\u201d any more. Maybe she could shoot a proper three pointer! Right now, she was barely tall enough and strong enough to launch the ball hard enough to even hit the rim on a three point shot. With a few more inches and a few more pounds of muscle, she could finally be a decent player!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they arrived at the ferry dock and made the crossing to the island. Maria\u2019s father checked them into their hotel, and the family dropped off their bags. At her brother\u2019s urging, her parents decided to explore the island town for a bit before they went for dinner. Maria\u2019s father, an avid reader, spotted a bookstore that he wanted to check out. Maria, after seeing <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>, had a renewed interest in books herself and didn\u2019t argue as she normally did when her dad dragged the family into old bookstores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the store, Maria looked around. The place had old-school wooden shelves lined with rows upon rows of old leather-bound books. The place smelled of wood, aged paper, and burned pipe tobacco. A wrought iron track lined the top of the shelves, and another customer rolled a wooden ladder along the track, stepping onto it to reach an upper shelf. It felt as if she had gone back in time a couple of centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria walked along the shelves, running her finger along the old dusty tomes, until she saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria pulled the book off the shelf and looked at the title:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>The Burgeoning Book</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped to the end and saw the title of the final story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Maria\u2019s Vacation</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d she said aloud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had probably overdone it, but she could not resist the temptation of reading more stories from the book and growing just that much more each night. Her parents and brother had been astonished by her amazing growth spurt. She had two inches on her younger brother now. <i>Let\u2019s see him try to block my shots now,</i> she thought with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had a beautiful face, beyond pretty, but not yet gorgeous. Her ebony hair was fine and silky. Large eyes, full lips. She was probably not the hottest girl in school, but she was definitely in the top dozen or so. Full C-cup breasts stood proudly on an athletic, defined torso. Her six pack abs were clearly visible, especially when she flexed down. Long, lean legs consummated her athletic beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family finished packing, she picked up the two heaviest suitcases with no trouble at all. Her brother looked stunned. He had struggled hauling just one of those on the way in! Maria was so much stronger now, and she felt great! She couldn\u2019t wait to start basketball practice when she got home. No one had seen her since school ended in June, so her teammates would be shocked at her summer of growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived home, Maria challenged her brother to a game while her parents unloaded the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst one to make 10 baskets wins! If you make a basket, you get the ball again!\u201d Maria called out, as she began to dribble toward her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, she scored her tenth basket with a swish. It was far enough out that she was fairly certain it was a three pointer as well! She had won 10-6, beating her brother for the first time in at least a year, which was about when he had had his growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the game, Maria asked her parents if she could go over to Emily\u2019s house, and they agreed to let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grabbed her copy of the book, and headed over to Emily\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completed unprepared for what she saw when she got there\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve been gone!\u201d asked Emily, mystified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria pulled the second copy of the book from her backpack, and both of her friends\u2019 eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stuffed the second book back into Maria\u2019s backpack and looked around furtively. After making sure that her sister wasn\u2019t watching them, she ushered them the rest of the way into her room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow on earth did you get another copy of the book?\u201d asked Emily, her attractive face bunched up in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria told them about the bookstore on the island and the events of her week of beautification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends measured each other, felt each other\u2019s significantly larger breasts, and generally admired each other\u2019s new bodies and more alluring faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was 5\u20198\u201d and 136 lbs. with a 32C bust. Her athletic frame was primed and ready for basketball season.<br>\r\nKat was 5\u20196\u201d and 116 lbs. with a 32B bust.

She looked like a fashion model, willowy and leggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria flipped her book open and showed the other girls her own story, which ended with her flipping the book open, and showing the other girls her own story. It was still so strange to see that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done examining it, Maria took the book over to Emily\u2019s copy and placed it on top of the original version, when the completely unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that the two books touched, both books burst into flames, incinerating each other within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls stared at the pile of cinders in absolute shock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s not lose the ashes of the books. Maybe they are still valuable somehow\u2026\u201d Emily ran to the kitchen, found a zip-lock bag, and carefully brushed the ashes of the books into it before sealing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Kat decided to go back to the antique shop where Emily had found the book originally. It seemed their best lead. Maria, however, had to go to basketball practice, so she told the others that she would meet up with them after practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Kat arrived at the antique store. The walls of the shop were piled high with miscellaneous junk like lamps, bicycles, and furniture. There didn\u2019t seem to be much organization, just all sorts of dusty old stuff. They made their way to the back of the store, where they saw the wizened, old owner scrubbing at some sort of knick knack with a brush, back turned to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d said Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man started, then turned around. \u201cSorry, young lady. My hearing isn\u2019t as good as it used to be. How may I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually in here the other day, and I bought a book. It was called <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. Do remember it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinkle of interest sparked in the old man\u2019s eyes. \u201cAh yes. How could I forget <i>that</i> book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was encouraging,</i> thought Emily. <i>Maybe he can help us after all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we actually found another copy of the book at this store up state,\u201d Emily continued. \u201cThey seemed to have the same effect. But we set one copy on top of the other, and they, um\u2026 spontaneously combusted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou touched them together!\u201d the man said, shocked. \u201cDidn\u2019t your parents ever tell you not to touch magical artifacts together?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey must have missed that one,\u201d Emily said, bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cParents these days\u2026\u201d the old man muttered. \u201cYou did keep the ashes, at least, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2014I have them right here,\u201d Emily passed the zip-lock bag over to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d he said. \u201cWizards sometimes choose to have their magical remains crafted into a magical artifact, so that their magic is not lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked the girls to describe the book, so they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is curious that you found two artifacts made in the same way. Curious, indeed,\u201d the man said, looking lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you fix them?\u201d asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can craft a new artifact with these ashes, but it is difficult to tell the effect. It is unlikely that I will be able to craft it in exactly the same way as the previous crafter. However, the general principal should be the same, if that is the will of the magic. Because I have the ashes of two wizards rather than one, however, the artifact will be at least twice as powerful. Sometimes, however, the combination of the two has a certain synergy, and the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it will work even better?\u201d asked Emily, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be more powerful, and it will work similarly, though it may not work exactly the same way,\u201d he admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay. How much will it cost for you to make the new artifact?\u201d Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will cost you nothing except one day with the artifact\u2019s magic for myself,\u201d the man stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d said Emily, pleased with how things had worked out. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow afternoon to pick it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Kat walked out of the shop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the starting point guard, and her 5\u20196\u201d height and lightly muscled build had enabled her to push Maria around ever since she had joined the team. She wasn\u2019t very attractive, and she didn\u2019t have much in the way of breast development, wearing an A-cup, but she was the team\u2019s best player. She looked down on Maria and her scrawny 4\u201910\u201d 82 lb. body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s other teammates ranged from 5\u20192\u201d to their 5\u20198\u201d center, but Wendy had always ruled the roost. The rest weren\u2019t about to defend Maria and incur Wendy\u2019s ire. They were simply happy not to be the one that she bullied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria arrived at practice, jogging onto the court, with an extra 10 inches of height, 54 lbs. of extra lean mass, and beautiful swells filling her sports bra, Wendy gawked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to you, runt?\u201d Wendy asked her, struggling to accept what this meant in terms of Maria\u2019s placement in the team\u2019s hierarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria began to warm up with the rest of the team, when Wendy commanded, \u201cGet the towels and the water bottles, runt, and put them beside the court!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria instinctively began to do what the previously larger girl commanded, when she realized that she didn\u2019t have to.

She stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet them yourself, bitch!\u201d Maria told Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned purple with rage.

THE. WATER. BOTTLES.\u201d said Wendy, anger making her enunciate every word with crystal clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy walked up to Maria until their bodies pressed together. Wendy\u2019s A-cups dwarfed by Maria\u2019s C-cups. Wendy\u2019s eyes looked up two inches to Maria\u2019s. Maria\u2019s scowl slowly turned into a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake. Me.\u201d said Maria, echoing the other girl\u2019s style of speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s rage was nearly overwhelming, but her brain kicked into gear. <i>This girl is taller than you and bigger than you, and hitting her will likely not go well for you,</i> her brain told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll settle this on the court,\u201d said Wendy, managing to somehow contain her rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grabbed a basketball, and said, \u201cFirst one to ten baskets wins.

She gave a sly smile of satisfaction. She could never have imagined using her superior body to get the best of the team bully two weeks ago. How she was going to love this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the game was over, she had won 10-5, and Wendy was running over to fetch the towels and bottles. Their coach, having caught the second half of their game, said, \u201cMaria! You\u2019re starting first game.

Amanda had read two stories from the book with Emma, and had gone from being the most beautiful girl in the school to the most beautiful girl in the school by far. Her long blond hair flowed as she danced and spun. Her DD-cup breasts swelled out spectacularly, jiggling with every motion. Her legs were long and toned under the twirling fabric of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5\u20199\u201d with a model\u2019s looks, Emily was definitely the second prettiest cheerleader, with Rachel and Jamie giving her the same envious looks that she was giving Amanda.

Is he your grandfather?\u201d asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>am</i> the shop owner, young lady,\u201d said the boy in the same, albeit stronger, voice that the shop owner had used the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 Oh my God, you <i>are</i>!\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy chuckled softly. \u201cHere you are, young lady. Remember, the book is now extremely responsive to your desires.\u201d He handed Emily the new book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls walked home, Emily said, \u201cThis is sooo great! I can\u2019t wait to pass Amanda and be the queen of the cheer squad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be a basketball superstar and dominate the court at practice tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just wish that Jessica\u2019s mom would loosen up and that she could get a chance to grow from the book like we have!\u201d Kat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three girls arrived at home, Emily opened the book. To her surprise there were no completed stories. There were three titles in <i>The Burgeoning Book</i> with just a phrase at the start of each story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Emily, Queen of the Cheer Squad</b></i><br>\r\nOn Friday morning, when Emily arrived at cheer camp\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Kat and Her Friend</b></i><br>\r\nOn Thursday evening, Kat wished for her good friend Jessica to grow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Maria, Singular Basketball Talent</b></i><br>\r\nOn Friday afternoon, Maria walked onto the basketball court\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt knows what we said we wanted on the way home!\u201d breathed Emily in surprise. \u201cDoes that mean that it is going to make it that way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d Maria said, \u201cThe stories start at different times! Emily\u2019s and my stories start tomorrow, but Kat\u2019s starts tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess there is only one way to find out\u2026\u201d Kat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three decided to go to bed and see what came tomorrow. None of them slept very well, too excited to manage it!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so disappointed that she nearly burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was she complaining about?</i> she thought to herself. <i>If you had told me I would be the second hottest cheerleader on the squad with a possible career as a model after high school two weeks ago, I would have been overjoyed. </i> She tried to content herself with her beautiful 5\u20199\u201d body with its 32Cs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt cheer camp, she jumped out of her mom\u2019s car and ran toward the other girls. She dropped her duffle bag to the side, and watched the gorgeous Amanda working through the moves, making everything look graceful and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily joined in with Amanda and the others, Emily felt a tingle in her chest as she danced and jumped, echoing Amanda\u2019s movements. The tingling grew stronger and spread over her entire body. For some, reason, she didn\u2019t think anything of it. She just felt really good, losing herself in the blaring music, moving her body through the moves. She closed her eyes and finished the routine until the song ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she noticed that Carly was looking at her. Carly seemed mesmerized! She seemed really short too! Emily realized that she was looking at the 5\u20191\u201d girl from a really high angle. She looked over and up to Amanda, and she wasn\u2019t there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! She moved her eyes downward, she was there, just shorter than Emily now! \u2026And she was looking at Emily with shock and\u2026 awe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down. Her breasts were huge! She felt her abs, tightening them as she did. They were smooth, defined\u2026 awesome! Her hands roamed down her wider, sexier hips as she looked down at endless, shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ran to the locker room, the other girls following behind. She looked in the mirror, bending her knees a bit so that she could see the top of her head in the mirror. Her blond mane was silky and glorious. Her sapphire eyes huge and luminous. Her breasts strained the confines of the sports bra. She wasn\u2019t sure how big they were, but they put Amanda\u2019s DDs to shame. Her abs were smooth and defined, and her hips, ass, and legs were curvaceous and gorgeous. She was 6\u20194\u201d of nubile, feminine beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down at Amanda, who was starting at breasts at least two cup sizes larger than hers, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled a broad, brilliant smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s time to put you back in your place. I don\u2019t care if you grew over the summer, I\u2019m still better than you. You just caught me off guard yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, surprised at the girl\u2019s statement, watched Wendy dribble around her and lay the ball in for her first basket before she realized that the other girl was starting their game. Maria began to feel a tingle in her sternum. Wendy dribbled back to center court as the tingling spread throughout Maria\u2019s body. Wendy readied herself to get past Maria again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria was defending, she seemed to have to keep looking further and further down toward Wendy. Was Wendy shrinking? Was Maria growing? She shook her head, stopping her thoughts. That didn\u2019t matter right now. She focused on the task at hand\u2014stopping this bitch from scoring on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy dribbled with her back toward Maria before she spun around for another shot. Wendy seemed surprised, her eyes going wide as she shot the ball. Maria launched herself into the air and swatted the ball away forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Maria said to Wendy with an intimidating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy watched as Maria ran over to get the ball. Was Maria only two inches taller than her? She seemed even bigger somehow. Were her breasts larger too? Geez\u2014this girl was becoming some kind of amazon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy got into a defensive crouch in front of Maria. Maria\u2019s arms seemed to swell with muscle as she watched. The girl\u2019s muscles weren\u2019t huge, but their definition was amazing. She looked as if she didn\u2019t have an ounce of body fat. Well, except for her huge boobs. What were those now? DD?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria exploded past her and laid the ball off the glass and into the hoop. \u201c1-1\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continued trip after trip, scoring on Wendy every time as she grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 8-1 now. Maria\u2019s muscles looked carved from stone. As she grew, her tank top pulled up from her shorts, leaving cobbled bricks of abdominal muscle bare. Was this girl doing serious weight training ten hours a day all summer? She looked incredibly strong. Wendy gulped in fear as the Amazon moved toward her with fluid, athletic grace. Maria approached her, spun, and rocketed upward toward the basket, dunking it hard with both hands as Wendy fell over backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s 9-1\u201d said Maria, grabbing the ball and dribbling back to half court. The ball seemed to be hitting the court harder and harder with every dribble. <b><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">BAM.</font> <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BAM.</font> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BAM!</font> <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BAM!! </font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy scrambled back to her feet to try once more to defend the incredibly built amazon athlete. Maria looked like she could intimidate Olympians. Every movement commenced a symphony of muscle fibers, all visible in her zero-body-fat arms, stomach, and legs. She moved like a panther, graceful and predatory. Her strength seemed immense, but her movements were lightning fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria crossed the ball over from left to right, blowing past Wendy before the smaller girl even knew she had moved. Maria blasted upward from the free throw line and slammed the ball through the rim, shattering the glass of the backboard all over the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding with a *boom* in a crouch on both feet, Maria looked back at a trembling Wendy as she rose and said. \u201c10-1. Good game.\u201d The 6\u20195\u201d statuesque amazon tossed the ball over her shoulder and walked to the locker room to shower, striations of iron muscle popping and releasing with every step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her clear, bright, pretty face, while not exactly beautiful, was a far cry from her acne-covered mess from two weeks ago. Her lithe body had been significantly more graceful and coordinated in Monday and especially Wednesday\u2019s dance classes, though she hadn\u2019t grown again since Wednesday. Kat squeezed her B cup breasts with another surge of delight. With these babies and her prettier face, maybe she could attract a girlfriend this year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girlfriend that Kat really wanted was Jessica, but she didn\u2019t know if Jessica reciprocated those feelings. Kat had never seen any indication from Jessica that she did. So she held her crush on the tiny girl in check. Maybe if Jessica could see her now, with her prettier face and more developed body, she would want her. Heck, maybe the girl of her erotic fantasies, Amanda, would want her. Sure. Like that would ever happen. Amanda was about three levels out of her league, even with Kat\u2019s new body. Jessica, though\u2026 She texted her friend again to ask if she was okay. No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, Kat had hoped that with the book recreated, she would be even larger and better looking, but she had no such luck. She thought about her story in the book. It had been called <i>Kat and Her Friend</i> and had started with a wish for Jessica to grow. Maybe Jessica had experienced some changes. She wished she could talk to her friend, but Jessica didn\u2019t seem to be answering calls or texts since Thursday morning. Kat hoped everything was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat went downstairs, where her mom was making breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, dear. Have some orange juice and some eggs.  After all, you\u2019re finally having the growth spurt that I\u2019d always hoped you would. We want to keep that going, now don\u2019t we? Your teeth are looking straighter too! Maybe we can get those braces removed soon\u2026\u201d Kat\u2019s mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s mother was a beautiful woman. Kat now matched her height, but her D-cup breasts and hourglass figure were in fine shape for anyone, let alone a woman of her age. Kat had always felt that she was in her mother\u2019s shadow. Her mother had never said anything along these lines, but Kat had always felt like a disappointment\u2014like her mother expected her to be as beautiful as she was. She clearly wasn\u2019t. She was significantly closer now, however, than she had been. She would have to be satisfied with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat thought again about Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dance class, her ballet instructor approached Kat and complimented her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so much better than last year, Kat. I think that I may have a small part for you in <i>The Nutcracker</i> that we\u2019re preparing for the December recital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Swan. I\u2019d like that very much,\u201d Kat said with sincere gratitude. She had never been offered an actual part in the recital before. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell her mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, she walked over to Jessica\u2019s house to check on her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Jessica\u2019s mother advised Kat that her friend was \u201cindisposed\u201d and couldn\u2019t see Kat right now. Frustrated, Kat went over to Emily\u2019s instead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kat went into Emily\u2019s room and closed the door. She opened <i>The Burgeoning Book</i> and flipped to her story. It had followed her day exactly so far. The only difference was that it kept dropping vague hints about Jessica\u2019s changes. What changes? Sheesh! How she wished she could just see her friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat considered how to reach Jessica, she heard Emily talking to someone in the hallway, approaching. Kat set down the book, and opened Emily\u2019s door. She saw Amanda, the subject of many of her adolescent fantasies, looking better than ever at 5\u201910\u201d. But wow! The other girl was AMAZING! She was huge\u2014maybe 6\u20194\u201d\u2014with curves that wouldn\u2019t quit. She had never seen a girl so tall and developed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! WAIT! Was that\u2026 no, it couldn\u2019t be. It was! It was\u2026 EMILY?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled at her friend as Kat\u2019s neck craned to look up at her as she approached. She hugged her friend, enveloping Kat\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d body with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell! How did you\u2026\u201d Kat trailed off, searching for the right words to describe her friend\u2019s transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened. I just looked at Amanda, thought about how beautiful and big she was. Then, I closed my eyes and started dancing, then there was this tingling feeling, and\u2026 voila!\u201d Emily did a pirouette. \u201cYou like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat licked her lips. \u201cOh, I like alright! You are a freaking goddess now! You\u2019ve got to be the hottest girl in school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily beamed--then eyes and lips took on a more mischievous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw the way that Amanda was looking at me after I changed. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s into girls. Just like a certain other someone I know\u2026\u201d Emily winked at Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat flushed with embarrassment. \u201cEm, Amanda is so far out of my league, that I\u2019d have to book a flight to get to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you <i>do</i> have a story in the book. And so do I\u2026 and look what happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, Amanda has been hanging out with my sister a lot, and my sister\u2019s really pretty now\u2014not as pretty as me now, of course--but pretty. That might be why Amanda has been making time with her lately, if you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on Kat\u2019s face. \u201cYou think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d Emily said slyly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s giving me an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat eagerly waited to her Emily\u2019s plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily snuck up behind Amanda, who was standing in Emma\u2019s room, texting on her phone. She reached around and covered the beautiful girl\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmma has a surprise for you, Amanda. And I think you\u2019re going to like it\u2026 but she wanted me to blindfold you first.\u201d Emily proceeded to tie a blindfold around Amanda\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she have in mind?\u201d asked Amanda, trying to hide the obvious interest in her voice. That note of interest was all that Emily needed as reassurance that she was right. Amanda was definitely into girls\u2014and into her sister, specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat finished getting out of her clothes, and was now in just bra and panties, waiting in Emily\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked back into her room, and told Kat, \u201cAmanda is sooo into girls. You\u2019re on! Good luck, Kitty Kat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was incredibly nervous. She raised a hand and watched it shake. This was like one of her nighttime fantasies come to life! She wasn\u2019t sure whether she could actually go through with it. Before she could back out, however, Emily pushed her out into the hallway and toward Emma\u2019s room. Kat gulped, and walked into Emma\u2019s room as a tingle began in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat walked into Emma room and shut the door behind her. She certainly didn\u2019t want Emily\u2019s parents walking in on her doing this! Kat approached Amanda, her near-naked form trembling with the combination of both fear and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat knew that she couldn\u2019t say anything, or the jig would be up. Her voice didn\u2019t sound anything like Emma\u2019s. She looked at the gorgeous girl in front of her. Long blond hair, gorgeous face, full breasts, long legs. Jessica had been Kat\u2019s realistic crush. Amanda had been her fantasy. And Amanda now looked better than ever, thanks to her time with the original <i>Burgeoning Book</i>. Kat noticed that Amanda was trembling too. Knowing that beautiful, sexy Amanda was just as nervous about her first time with a girl gave Kat some confidence. Her tingling feeling intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat took Amanda\u2019s hand in hers and touched it to the smooth skin of her thigh. Amanda gasped as she felt the other girl\u2019s flesh, wondering what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat slowly moved Amanda\u2019s hand up her thigh and over her rounded hip. Was her hip wider? Her panties seemed to be straining. She focused back on Amanda\u2019s hand, moving it up her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her stomach firmer and more defined? It sure seemed that way. What was this tingling all about? It had now spread across her entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat moved the beautiful girl\u2019s hand to her chest. Amanda felt her breast through the bra, looking a little disappointed, as if they were smaller than she had expected. The sexy girl remained silent, however. Kat\u2019s bra was feeling uncomfortable, and her breasts were clearly overflowing the cups. Seeing Amanda\u2019s reaction and feeling the discomfort, Kat decided to go for it, a sudden boldness rising within her. Kat unclasped her bra and let it fall to the floor. She took both of Amanda\u2019s hands in hers and placed them on her bare, sensitive breast. Were they even bigger than a moment ago? They sure seemed to be a good handful now, as Amanda felt her. It was Kat\u2019s turn to gasp in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda moaned a little before she caught herself. Kat\u2019s (though she believed they were Emma\u2019s) lush breasts seemed to be growing as she felt them. The thought was making her aroused. She shifted her hips a little as moisture started to tickle between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat took one of Amanda\u2019s hands and traced one of the other girl\u2019s fingers around her lips. Were her lips becoming puffier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were standing, Amanda about a foot away from Kat. But instead of looking up to see Amanda\u2019s expressions, she realized that her eyes were now level with those of the other girl. Amanda was 5\u201910\u201d. Did that mean that she had grown four inches while they were both standing here? It must! Emily\u2019s plan was working. The book was making her grow!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat gained more confidence as she realized that she was becoming taller, more beautiful, sexier. She was as big as her fantasy girl now. Could it be possible that she would grow even taller and more gorgeous than her fantasy? The thought sent a shiver of arousal through her, and she gave an involuntary moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda, hearing the other girl\u2019s moan, became even more turned on. She had been a little disappointed with Emma\u2019s (actually Kat\u2019s!) breasts at first, thinking that they should be larger, but they had seemed to inflate under her very fingers. It was sooo erotic. What was Emma doing? Where was this leading? She wasn\u2019t sure, but she was certainly enjoying the moment, wherever it led.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat took Amanda\u2019s index finger into her mouth, sucking it with her fuller lips, closing her eyes. Amanda gave a full moan of desire. This sensation was driving her crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kat opened her eyes again, she realized that she was looking slightly down on Amanda now. She took Amanda\u2019s hands and placed them on her breasts again as they continued to grow. Amanda lightly brushed her white French-tip nails against Kat\u2019s tender nipples, and Kat gave a squeak of surprise and sensation as she felt a jolt of sexual heat from her breasts.<br>\r\nAmanda couldn\u2019t believe it! Emma\u2019s breasts were becoming fuller and fuller beneath her touch. They were so firm, so round, so voluptuous now. She wanted to see them so badly, as she explored the burgeoning flesh with her long, soft fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s head rolled back in pleasure, full, rich red hair brushing ever further down her bare back. She couldn\u2019t believe the sensations that were flowing through her at Amanda\u2019s touch. Finally, unable to take it anymore, Kat moved the other girl\u2019s hands back down her torso, tall enough now to see the top of her fantasy girl\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda could feel the muscles of the girl\u2019s abs clenching and moving under the skin. Her stomach must look incredible! Her fingers traced the ridges of muscle as they worked their way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reached down under Kat\u2019s panties and placed her first two fingers at the other girl\u2019s entrance. Kat gave a chirp of surprise and craving as a wave of arousal and lust lanced through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda moved in closer and pushed in with her fingers. The two girl\u2019s breasts touched. Kat\u2019s huge breasts felt amazing against Amanda\u2019s perfectly formed but smaller spheres. Sensual electricity crackled through both girls where their flesh joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat moaned in ecstasy as Amanda found her clit and worked it with her fingers. She felt her panties snap and fall off as her swelling hips stressed the fabric past its breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat pushed her body harder against Amanda as their full lips met. Kat pushed her flexible tongue into Amanda\u2019s mouth and arousal flared as tongues intertwined. Kat\u2019s hands began to roam Amanda\u2019s nubile flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat began to move the now smaller girl backward with her body until the both ended up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands and tongues searched and danced as each girl released sounds of smoldering desire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emma\u2019s home, and Kat\u2019s still with Amanda in her room!</i> Desperate for a plan, she thought, <i>It\u2019s too bad Emma\u2019s not growing like I did at cheer camp right now!</i> That <i>would be a distraction that would work!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn\u2019t notice as words began to appear in her own story inside the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cOn Friday afternoon, Emily wished her sister would begin to grow taller and sexier to the point of distraction\u2026 and she did!\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bounded down the stairs, trying to think of something that would prevent her sister from going to her room, when it finally hit her. HER! Her new appearance! Her sister hadn\u2019t seen her yet, so that should <i>definitely</i> be a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily approached Emma looked up\u2026 and up! Emily was HUGE! And SEXY! Emily had to be the most gorgeous girl in the entire school now! Emma gulped. She had never experienced the feeling of her younger sister looking DOWN on her before. She didn\u2019t like it. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, shortie!\u201d Emily greeted her 5\u201910\u201d sister from her vantage point six inches above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma, too stunned to think of a comeback, simply gaped with wide beautiful eyes. She began to rub her chest as she felt a tingling sensation. She had been shocked by her sister\u2019s appearance; she hoped the tingling didn\u2019t mean she was having a heart attack or something! It seemed to be spreading!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked right up to her sister, pushing her huge boobs into Emma\u2019s face. How she was enjoying being bigger and taller than Emma for once! \u201cSorry, I guess I don\u2019t know how far ahead of me these things are sticking out yet!\u201d Emily stuck out her tongue at her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma tried to push Emily\u2019s large breasts away, but Emily was too big for her to move. She stepped back, instead. Emily didn\u2019t seem quite so tall now. She was definitely taller than Emma but only by 3 or 4 inches. She must have misjudged earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many stories did you read in the back today, psycho?\u201d Emma said. \u201cOverdo it much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one, Emma. But one was enough for my to pass your sorry ass!\u201d Emily fired back, annoyed that her sister was still giving her attitude, even when she was the bigger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s expression changed to one of puzzlement as she realized that her sister was only about an inch shorter than her. Hadn\u2019t she been a lot shorter than that a minute ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God!</i> Emily thought. <i>She\u2019s growing too! How could this be? Did Emma have her own story in the new book?</i> Emily wondered how big her sister would get before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say <i>pass my sorry ass</i>? Whose ass is sorry now?\u201d Emily\u2019s eyes widened as Emma\u2019s were now even with hers. Emily lowered her gaze to look at the rest of her body. Emma\u2019s breasts were at least as large as her own\u2026 and still growing. Her sister\u2019s legs were at least as long as her own\u2026 and still growing. And her body was growing even curvier and <i>remarkably</i> sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should know that you\u2019ll Never. Be. Bigger. Or. Sexier. Than. Me!\u201d said Emma as she finished her growth spurt at 6\u20196\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at her sister in awe. She was statuesque and incredible, beautiful enough to grace the cover of any magazine and with a body to match. Emily\u2019s reign as the hottest girl school was over as quickly as it had begun\u2014at the hands of her stupid older sister! Would she never be able to surpass Emma at anything?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled a cruel smile and used her larger body to shove Emily against the wall. She raised an insanely long, elegant leg to the first step and began ascending the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled broadly and brilliantly. Sliding off the bed, she pressed her naked body to Emma\u2019s clothed one and said, \u201cThat was amazing, Emma.

Emma\u2019s door slammed and they heard someone run down the stairs in tears. Emily opened her door to look, but the front door was closing. Emma\u2019s door was also closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 that just happened,\u201d said Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d asked Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shook her head, then walked over to the mirror. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to check herself out in her curiosity to read the book and see what would happen to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was 6\u20192\u201d, though still with a dancer\u2019s slim, muscled build.. except for her breasts, which weren\u2019t massive like Emily\u2019s, but would probably fill a D cup. Sinuous, lithe curves and defined muscle swept along every surface of her coltish body like a rhythmic gymnast\u2019s at the Olympics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily came up behind her and said, \u201cThe new book seems to trigger growth when we really want it passionately or urgently. And it doesn\u2019t do it an inch at a time like before. It seems to be quite a bit more\u2014and less consistent. Maybe it depends on how much we want to grow, or how urgent or passionate we are about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily puzzled out how the new book might work, Kat\u2019s thoughts drifted back to Jessica.

This year, the party was planned for Saturday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gushing over Maria\u2019s Amazonian muscles and height, Kate, Emily, and Maria headed to the mall to go shopping for bikinis to fit their new, buxom bodies. As they walked into the store, Kat\u2019s phone chirped. She had received a text from Jessica saying that she would be at the pool party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nearly jumped for joy and seeing her friend\u2019s text! Finally, she would get to see Jessica again! Kat\u2019s heart soared at the news. It had been nearly two weeks since she had seen her best friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kat was texting, Emily and Maria walked up to the shop girl and watched her eyes widen with amusement. The three bodacious amazon beauties <i>were</i> quite a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of bikinis later, the girls had chosen the ones that they wanted. Emily had gone with a classic red string bikini. Maria had chosen a neon green monokini that showed just enough of her ridiculously cut abs to be tantalizing while giving her athletic, muscular body a more hourglass appearance. Kat picked a white bandeau that complimented her sleek, lean form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls went straight from mall to party. People were just beginning to arrive. Football players, the soccer team, cheerleaders, the band, the choir, even the chess club were invited. Kat noticed with a chuckle that the chess players were all wearing t-shirts while the football team was entirely bare-chested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat heard a timid \u201cHi, Kat,\u201d from behind her and whirled. It was Jessica!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, always the smallest of the four friends at 4\u20199\u201d, looked absolutely miniscule from Kat\u2019s new 6\u20192\u201d perspective. Kat also immediately noticed that she had healing bruises up and down one arm and both legs. \u201cMy parents wouldn\u2019t let me see anyone until my black eye healed,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cSorry I\u2019ve been MIA. My parents didn\u2019t realize this is a pool party or they would never have let me come. They made me wear long sleeves because they didn\u2019t want anyone to see the bruises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you made some serious progress with the book over the last two weeks! You look awesome, Kat!\u201d Jessica continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get all of these bruises? What happened to you?\u201d asked Kat, jumping straight to what was bothering her the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Jessica said, looking down her arms and legs. \u201cI got into a fight with my sister, and she\u2026 got carried away,\u201d said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say! Are you okay?\u201d probed Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for some time with the book tonight to get big enough that my sister won\u2019t be able to push me around any more.\u201d Smiling at the thought, she mused, \u201cIt would be even cooler if my parents couldn\u2019t stop me from doing whatever I wanted too. I felt so trapped this past week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would be so cool if Jessica could just absorb the strength and beauty of any of these girls and take it for herself! She would never have to worry about her sisters, her parents, or anyone else hurting her or bossing her around\u2026 not to mention she could be the sexiest girl in school!</i> thought Kat, the very thought sending a surge of arousal through her sufficient to turn her cheeks pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by Jessica\u2019s strong emotions from being beaten by her sister and all of Kat\u2019s thoughts and desires along these lines over the past week, power stronger than anything the other girls had wielded began to rage inside the tiny girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked over at Emma\u2019s huge, buxom body and wished she had some of those curves and that muscle tone for herself. This really strong tingling feeling burst through her body, and Jessica felt faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat followed Jessica\u2019s eyes and focused on huge, sexy Emma. Wait! She wasn\u2019t so huge. And her bikini was starting to look downright loose! Kat\u2019s mouth formed an \u201cO\u201d as Emma shrank rapidly before her eyes. She started to say something to Jessica, but all thoughts of speech were lost as her eyes shifted to her friend\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pool party was getting underway at the rec center, Carly was outside the window of Emily\u2019s bedroom. She pulled a lawn chair beneath the window and stood on it. She popped the screen out of the window, placed her fingers until the slightly open window pane and pushed it up. Then, she used her meager strength to pull herself up and into Emily\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to figure out the girl\u2019s secret if it killed her! She needed to be bigger and prettier, and nothing was going to stand in her way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly\u2019s eyes scanned the room for anything out of the norm. Her eyes came to rest on a large, leather-bound tome sitting on Emily\u2019s desk. She looked at the title: <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. She didn\u2019t know what \u201cburgeoning\u201d meant, but the book seemed interesting. She opened it, and a faint golden glow lit her face\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her breasts swelled, her face re-formed into a hypnotically beautiful version of itself. Simultaneously, Emma lost that foot, her ripe breasts withered, and her legs shortened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica turned to the choir girls, who had always ridiculed her small, squeaky voice, and pulled the vocal ability of three of them into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Jessica looked at the school\u2019s gymnastic team. She licked her lips as she thought about how much stronger she could be with their muscle, drunk with the power that Kat\u2019s and Jessica\u2019s combined desires had given her. She pulled. Their muscles dwindled\u2026 and nothing happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica tried again to pull their muscle, their fitness. Nothing happened.

Little did Jessica know that when she pulled the strength from the entire gymnastic team, it went to Carly. When she pulled Amanda\u2019s beauty, it went to Carly. Carly stretched Amanda-length legs and thrust out Amanda-sized breasts, as she stretched superhumanly strong arms, sinewed with steel-hard muscle from all of the school\u2019s gymnasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly giggled in delight as she looked at her full breasts and long, ridiculously toned legs, watching the effects of her story in real time on her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Emily\u2019s bedroom door flew open.

I need you to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at her friend, and let go of the frenzy that had overtaken her. Tears began to well as she realized what she had done. She hugged Kat and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly felt a surge of beauty, growth, and power. As she stood, she surged past 7 feet. Legs stretched and breasts bulged, straining the fabric past the breaking point. She began to hear a tearing sound as firm, prodigious breasts tore through underwire and cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's bra and shirt fell away as her beauty grew to astonishing levels. Then her muscles swelled and hardened. Abs carved into a six pack. Then an eight pack. Finally, every detail of every muscle became fully defined. Arms and legs were defined and hard as steel.

Now, however, they had allowed it to go to that wicked girl Carly, who, of course, had abused it. That was <i>not</i> what he had in mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper waited until midnight, then slipped into Carly's mansion with a quick spell to disarm the camera's and security system. He took the book from her room, tucked it under his arm, and went back to his shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for the book to find a new owner, so he decided that he would find some new deserving owners for the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began his own new story, this one a poem, in the book, watching as the title formed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The Wizard's Apprentices Three</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday, the wizard went to school.<br>\r\nScanning the halls, the book, his tool,<br>\r\nThe wizard saw the freshmen three.<br>\r\nSaying to them, \"I have this for thee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard smiled as he start the start of the story form.

I guess something happened to her, and her parents wouldn\u2019t let her come in today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see Emily, Kat, Jessica, and Maria?

Yeah, I heard that Wendy, that girl from the basketball team, threw them all into the dumpster in back of the school. Jim told me it was pretty funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper smiled at that last conversation. He may have found the next worthy recipients of the book!

She had come harder than she ever had in her life. Emma was her fantasy made flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Emma had suddenly and, seemingly for no reason, rejected her outright. Emma had said that she was only attracted to boys and that she was seeing Stan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new surge of despair welled within her, and more tears poured from her eyes. Why?

The team currently had five\u2014Amanda, Jamie, Rachel, Carly, and Emily. The squad was supposed to be seven, so two of the three freshmen girls would make it; one would not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls were small\u2014smaller even than the 4\u201911\u201d that Emily had been two days ago. Emily felt bad for them. She knew what it felt like to be the smallest girl on the squad. She introduced herself to each girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Emily! Welcome to cheer camp! Good luck on making the squad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls introduced themselves as Vicky, Lexi, and Melinda, looking faintly relieved at Emily\u2019s welcoming smile. Vicky was a 4\u201911\u201d ebony-haired girl with curves off a less-than-appealing pear-shaped variety. Lexi was a cute, blond pixie, maybe two inches shorter than Vicky with no hips and no breasts to fill out her spandex workout clothes.  Melinda was a acne-laden brunette whose height was between that of the others. Melinda wore cheerleader-inspired outfit with a short, light, waist-length sweater and skater skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Jamie came over, looking stern and far less welcoming. The girls seemed to tense under their gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, girls. One of you will be going home today. The other two will be making the team, tiny and pathetic as you are. Let\u2019s figure out which one of you goes home.\u201d Amanda and Jamie took seats at the camp chairs to the side of the practice field as they ordered the girls to line up before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, jump as high as you can, arms raised!\u201d ordered Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls jumped up, when they landed, Emily could swear that Lexi, the smallest girl before, was about the same height as Melinda now. Cute before, her face looked even cuter with bright blue eyes and pink lips. She seemed to have small bumps pushing out the spandex halter the slightest bit as well. Did she have those before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do the splits!\u201d Amanda told the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls slid their legs out until their pelvis touched the grass. Lexi\u2019s legs seemed longer, shapelier. The hem of her tight workout pants sliding to mid-calf. This Lexi girl was small, but she wasn\u2019t just cute, she was pretty, Emily decided, revising her earlier opinion. As the three girls stood up again, Lexi seemed to be the tallest of the three now. Her blond hair shone in the bright sunlight, the swells of her small breasts now even more significant than a moment earlier. Was the girl growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s attention stayed on Lexi as Amanda ordered the girls to do ten burpees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi\u2019s bare arms were looking more defined with small swells of feminine muscle rising and falling along their length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lexi\u2019s legs propelled her upward, she seem to jump much higher than the other girls. Her legs looked more muscular than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi\u2019s cute butt and slim hips seemed to expand as she dropped to the ground. Emily was nearly certain now that the girl was growing before her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi\u2019s face was passing pretty and bordering on beautiful. Her large, crystal blue eyes dazzling in the summer sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swells of Lexi\u2019s breast were large enough to jiggle within the spandex halter now as she jumped up. <i>Were those things B-cups now?</i> wondered Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Amanda counted ten, Lexi looked as if she might be the same height as Emily now at 5\u20193\u201d. Her face, cute before, was gorgeous! The beautiful bone structure and full lips framed by bouncing platinum curls gave it an ethereal, angelic look. Her beasts were full C-cups, bulging into captivating cleavage, forced upward by the undersized halter. Her tiny waist remained the same in circumference, but sexy lines of definition ran its length now. Rounded, feminine hips fanned out from her small waist, tapering to disproportionately long, slender, muscled legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s stomach dropped as she realized that this tiny freshman was sexier than she was now! This must have something to do with the wish she and her friends had made with the book! Emily thought back to what the book had said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make the small group big and sexy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on Emily. She and her friends were no longer the smallest group. Clearly, this girl Lexi was! She wondered how big and sexy this girl was going to get!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lexi\u2019s form grew even larger, her burgeoning hips stretching their lycra confines to the limit as they swayed from side to side. Her toned arms moved gracefully with the music, and her abs had gained enough definition for a six pack to be visible as the muscles contracted under smooth, tanned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi\u2019s breasts past the D-cup mark as threads began to discolor in her overtaxed halter top.

She felt wonderful as she moved her body in more and more exaggerated ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls stared as Lexi\u2019s spandex pants split down the thigh, revealing smooth, tanned flesh. Her halter tore down the back, breasts pushing the fabric out until the skin on the underside of her breast became visible and cleavage bulged over the top. Her DDs were full and succulent. Their perfect swells caused Amanda to wipe a dribble of drool from the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5\u201910\u201d Lexi\u2019s growth finally stopped as the song ended. She opened her long eyelashes slowly, revealing brilliant azure eyes. Her face looked youthful but mature, fresh but elegant. Her DDD breasts were barely covered to decency by the remnants of her halter top. Incredible abs popped and relaxed with every movement.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat saw red as she walked slowly home from the mall. In the literal sense because the wind was blowing her hair in front of her eyes, but also in the figurative sense because she knew there would be hell to pay when she arrived. Her Mom had not authorised her impromptu retail therapy and certainly would not approve of her having emptied her wallet to buy the strange old book that was now weighing down her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat couldn\u2019t help herself though. She couldn\u2019t stand another minute of the constant criticism, training and exercises in becoming a lady. At 18 she was technically an adult but that fact didn\u2019t seem to cross her mother\u2019s mind. Every teen novel, girl power movie, coming-of-age story and Disney princess had always told her to be herself and follow her dreams but her Mom was having none of that. For Kat, being herself meant being short, skinny, clumsy and socially awkward. Being herself was supposed to be ok, but Kat\u2019s Mom had only had one child, one daughter and so that one daughter was going to become an elegant, charming young lady if it killed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo today Kat had deviated from her normal walk home and decided to treat herself to something nice. Ice cream would have momentarily filled the void in her heart, but then it would be gone and heaven forbid she put on any weight. Jewellery was out of her budget but it was also something a lady might wear and Kat didn\u2019t feel like doing anything her mother might even slightly approve of right now. As she was pondering the issue her eyes had fallen on a dusty antiques shop and very shortly thereafter, bewilderingly fast in fact, she was walking out of it having been parted from every last penny she had on her. Somehow though, she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d been conned. The large leather-bound tome looked valuable, or at the very least it was decorative. She even felt a little cultured, like one of those old-fashioned librarians who always seemed mysterious and knew lots of strange facts and ancient tales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat grinned for the first time that day. As long as she had the book she was sure she could endure whatever her Mom had in store for her. It had to be a secret though, otherwise it was likely to be confiscated, so she would take her punishment without complaint and hope her Mom didn\u2019t find an excuse to open her bag. Distracted by her thoughts, Kat barely noticed she\u2019d reached her own house and pulled up sharply at the gate before gritting her teeth and heading inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere. On. Earth. Have. You. BEEN?!\u201d the immediate tirade began. Kat\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t a tall woman, but she was still nearly a head taller than her daughter and looked imperiously down her nose with a scowl on her face. \u201cYou should have been back an hour ago! Do you know how worried I\u2019ve been? Why is your phone turned off? What were you doing?\u201d The barrage of questions didn\u2019t seem likely to stop so Kat interrupted to try and stem the flow.<br>\r\n\u201cI was with Jess,\u201d she began, hoping her friend wouldn\u2019t soon get a call to confirm the made-up story. \u201cShe wanted to show me a new ice-cream place she\u2019d found.\u201d Kat\u2019s Mom raised an eyebrow but her daughter hurried on before she could interject. \u201cI had sorbet, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s mostly water anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Her Mom\u2019s tense shoulders relaxed the slightest little bit. \u201cYou\u2019re far too tiny all over but at least you have a tiny waist so don\u2019t go messing it up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. Anyway, I lost track of time and hurried home as soon as I realised. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She decided to keep the story simple. Fewer details meant fewer chances of getting caught out. <br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d her Mom muttered. \u201cWell next time call and let me know before I send out the search party!\u201d Kat nodded and apologised again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised that there didn\u2019t seem to be a punishment coming. Maybe her Mom had actually been impressed when she\u2019d mentioned the sorbet, as if she was pleased her daughter was starting to think about ladylike things for herself without being forced. The search party comment also made her realise that her Mom did actually care and was actually worried about her and she felt a little ashamed about making the whole thing up. Still, it was only her Mom\u2019s overbearing strictness that made lying to her necessary in the first place.<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t do it again, but I\u2019ve got homework so I\u2019ll be upstairs \u2018til dinner,\u201d and grabbing her bag the small girl dashed up to her room before any further interrogation could take place. Once there, door closed for what privacy she could get, Kat removed her prize from her bag and laid it on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Burgeoning Book</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her fingertips over the gold embossed lettering on the leather cover and read the words out loud to herself. Opening the cover there was no author\u2019s note, no contents page, no index or anything, only a title and a short story every few pages. There were so many to choose from she didn\u2019t know where to start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat slowly turned the heavy old pages and skimmed over the titles. She\u2019d noticed that all of the stories seemed to refer to some part of the female body, and only one. From what she could tell at a glance, each was about a girl whose body began to change in just that one aspect. Each was a few pages long and she probably only had enough time to read one before dinner, after which she really would need to get on with her homework for tomorrow. One particular title caught her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lucy\u2019s Luxurious Locks</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had been a flaming redhead all her life and had mixed feelings about her hair. On the one hand it was bright and wild and she felt it gave her otherwise small and unimpressive form some character. On the other hand it was frizzy, tangled and difficult to manage and never seemed to look the way she wanted. Intrigued, she began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lucy was a lovely lass from a little village by the Long Lake. Lucy loved to lie languidly by the lake and look at the long white clouds littering the sky. Lately, Lucy had looked longingly at the local Lord\u2019s son, Liam, loving him from afar. Lonely and languishing, she listened to the lore of the local wisewoman, Lady Lyra...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story went on to describe Lucy\u2019s plan to attract the attention of young lord Liam using a potion brewed by Lady Lyra. The potion gave Lucy the most beautiful locks in all the land which grew longer and lovelier until eventually Lucy and her locks caught Liam\u2019s eye and the pair lived happily ever after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wording was archaic and a bit difficult to follow in places, but eventually Kat finished the story and closed the heavy tome with a thud. She pulled a lock of her own hair in front of her eyes and stared at it, wishing she could attract her dream boy by the beauty of her hair alone. It was a nice story, but not something that could ever really happen. Girl is plain and lonely, girl uses magic thingamajig, girl becomes beautiful and achieves all her dreams. As if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat, dinner time!\u201d Came her Mom\u2019s voice from downstairs. Tucking her new favourite book out of sight under some papers in the top drawer of her desk, Kat called back in response and headed down to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until her morning routine the next day that Kat noticed the difference. While she\u2019d been studying the night before she had tucked her hair behind her ears and out of the way, but it still kept falling into her eyes somehow. It was only when she took her morning shower and washed it that it became obvious that her very own lovely locks were about 3 inches longer than they should be. Drying off, she noticed they were also a bit nicer than before. Nothing spectacular, but maybe a bit shinier and smoother than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely impossible, but very welcome all the same. Kat felt like she should be freaking out more, as though magic being real and apparently contained within an old book she\u2019d bought at the mall should be more of a world-shattering revelation. Something was keeping her calm though, probably the same thing that had kept her from worrying about buying the book on impulse the day before. Something was suppressing her concerns just enough that she noticed the change but didn\u2019t go to pieces over it. Kat didn\u2019t like the feeling that her mind was being messed with, but it didn\u2019t bother her all that much, which she realised was probably part of the effect as well. There was nothing much she could do though, and she did like her improved hair, so she just went on with her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour hair looks nice today dear,\u201d was all she got from her Mom over breakfast. Again, noticing a change but not really bothered by it. Maybe the magic worked on everyone, not just her. The same was true at school. Kat had a pretty normal day, caught up with her friends, was bored by some classes, frustrated by others and terrified by a sudden pop quiz in one. She got an unreasonable pile of homework and wandered slowly home at the end of the day where the Burgeoning Book was waiting safely in her top drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Kat noticed she had changed again. Her hair was shinier, thicker and another 3 inches longer than it had been that morning, having gone from shoulder length to reaching her shoulderblades in 24 hours. It would have reached her bra strap, she thought ruefully, if only she needed to wear a bra. The book was doing this to her, it was clear. She had no idea how it was possible, beyond the obvious answer of \u2018it\u2019s a magic book\u2019, but there was no other explanation. She bought a weird book from a strange store that she\u2019d never seen before, read a story about a girl magically growing long, beautiful hair and overnight she grew longer, more beautiful hair. Even without knowing the mechanics, it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kat looked with interest at the other stories in the book, flipping through the pages until she found one she couldn\u2019t pass up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat's darting eyes locked onto a single word on the page as she flipped idly through the book. <i>Taller.</i> It called out to her. It brought to mind memories of always being the shortest girl in her class, of hoping she would grow just a little bit more. She did grow, but others always grew more. Kat was always behind the curve and always looking up. As a little girl she dreamt of puberty when she would grow more and faster than ever and get some curves of her own. It didn't happen. Puberty came sure enough and she was delighted to finally reach 5 feet tall, an adult height at last, but that was all she got. Her ideal height was 5'9\", taller than most girls, tall enough that her form would look more slender and elegant but not so tall that guys would hesitate to ask her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew tall girls had a tougher time finding dates and people always thought a couple looked odd if the girl was taller than the guy. The young Kat reasoned that nobody would notice a 1 inch difference so at 5'9\" she could date guys who were 5'8\" and above.  If she could find a really tall guy, 6' or taller, then she could even wear heels and she wouldn't look like a shrimp standing next to her man. Kat giggled at the memory of some couples she had seen where the guy was well over 6 feet and the girl was closer to 5. She imagined just stealing a kiss must involve either a great deal of bending or possibly some lifting on his part. No risk of that with the perfect 5'9\" girl! Which of course, she was not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but perhaps with the help of her new favourite book, she could be! Kat pulled a lock of flame red hair before her eyes again and momentarily smiled at its improvement. If the book could do for her height what it was doing for her hair then anything was possible. The hopeful little smile still on her face, she took up the book and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tara was told the tale of Tiny Tim by a travelling teller. Tiny Tim was a titchy tot who never grew any taller. Terribly for her, Tiny Tim's tale was Tara's truth. To Tara though, the travelling teller told another tale. To the tippy top of the tallest oak tree must she climb tonight...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story continued with Tara learning of the full moon's blessing on a single acorn at the very top of the biggest tree in the forest. That acorn was destined to be the tallest tree in the future, but if she plucked it under the full moon then some of it's power would flow into her. Tara found the tree and plucked the acorn and wore it around her neck like a charm. Little by little she grew taller and taller until she was the tallest girl in the village and nobody ever looked down on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat closed the Burgeoning Book and laid a hand gently on its cover. She really hoped it would work its magic on her again. Lucky for her she didn't need to go climbing tall trees in the middle of the night, that sounded dangerous! With any luck she could get the same results as Tara just by reading the other girl's story. Knowing she wasn't going to get immediate results though, Kat put the book aside and somehow managed to focus on her homework for the rest of the evening until it was time for bed. Well, mostly focus on her homework. She did idly have one hand on her measuring tape from time to time while she worked. It wouldn't be needed until the morning, but just running her fingers over it was a happy reminder that she might not be the shortest girl in class from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Kat was a slow riser, she pressed the snooze button several times and only really hauled herself out of bed when her Mom came knocking on her door threatening to drag her out if necessary. That morning though, as soon as her foggy mind could comprehend that she was awake her eyes snapped open and she threw off the blankets in a rush. The tape measure was in her hand a she had her back to the wall with a pencil held overhead in the blink of an eye. At that point she slowed right down though so as to be completely accurate and very carefully drew a faint line on the wall behind her. Once she had made her mark, she stepped forward and with shaking hands measured up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, the measurement was 5'0\" but the brilliant smile broadening slowly on Kat's face told a different story. One eighth of an inch. She was one eighth of an inch taller. You couldn't see it by looking at her and you could barely tell on the tape measure, but Kat had hoped so desperately to be taller that she had measured herself hundreds of times, not wanting to believe that she had stopped growing at only 5 feet. She knew exactly how tall she was down to the smallest fraction and now the smallest fraction had been added. As if to mock the miniscule growth in her height, Kat's lovely locks were another full 3 inches longer and much less frizzy than before but she hardly noticed after the revelation of her newest change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the entire school day giddy with excitement but refused to tell anyone who asked why she was so happy. <i>'A magic book is making me taller! You can't tell but it's definitely happening,'</i> were the words of a crazy person and Kat retained enough good sense not to speak them. Even so, she breezed through the day with nothing able to bring her down and measured herself again as soon as she got home. Another eighth of an inch. Two more of those and she'd be half an inch taller. That was when you could round up! She started doing the math and then stopped suddenly, a frown forming for the first time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had done these calculations before. When she was still growing she'd worked out how long it would take to get to 5'9\" at her current rate. Then it had stopped and her hopes had been dashed. She wouldn't make that mistake this time. She would measure herself from time to time and be glad of every fraction of an inch but she wouldn't have expectations. All that mattered was that she was growing again and she had the book to thank for it. That brought it to the front of her mind again and seconds later it was out of the drawer and in her hands again. The Burgeoning Book had done so much for her already, but she couldn't help wonder if it would keep blessing her with growth if she just kept reading its stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up for Kat was...</span></div></div>",

Her friend was always complaining about her squeaky, immature voice. Kat\u2019s eyes scanned the page as she considered. Maybe she should test it out first, to see what it would do before she shared it with her friend\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Veronica was in the vicinity of a visitor to the villa, the very vivacious vocalist Verity. The velvet voice of the visibly voluminous vacationer was vivid and virtuous. Unfortunately, the vain woman vexed Veronica, viciously vehement and vociferous in her vile and venomous views\u2026</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen Kat finished, she spoke a few words. Was there anything different about her voice? She couldn\u2019t tell. It might be ever so slightly richer\u2026 but maybe that was just her imagination. Her changes in height were very subtle at this point--maybe it would be similar with her voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have time to experiment any further right now, with ballet in twenty minutes. Kat quickly changed into her leotard, grabbed her ballet shoes and ran downstairs. Her mom was already holding her coat out for her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mom, I was busy reading, and I lost track of time\u2026\u201d said Kat sheepishly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI swear, dear, if I had a nickel for every time you were running late, I would already have your college fund taken care of,\u201d said her Mom, looking at her with an ostensibly stern expression. Kat could see the fondness in her eyes, though. As Kat grabbed the door to head out to the car, her mother ran her fingers through her long, thick hair, fluffing it a bit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou really are blessed with this magnificent head of hair. I\u2019m so glad that you take such good care of it. It looks so vibrant and healthy,\u201d said her mother.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom!\u201d said Kat. It was rare for her mom to compliment her appearance this way, and she was basking in the feeling as she hopped into the car.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUnfortunately, as she arrived at ballet class, the girls in ballet were less complimentary.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey, look! It\u2019s the redheaded stepchild of the class!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Kat, your head\u2019s on fire! Oh, wait\u2026 that\u2019s just your hair!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKat ignored the other girls\u2019 barbs as she always did, putting on her shoes, then lining up for barre.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClass proceeded uneventfully until the girls reached the All\u00e9gro movement, and they needed to practice fast feet and jumps. Kat stumbled out of the landing and landed hard on her back, the air whooshing out of her as she hit. Long, full, vividly red curls spilled across  the hardwood floor. Kat felt color begin to rise from her neck as titters of laughter erupted around her from the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, the worst of them all, was quick to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that ridiculous mass of hair of yours was good for something! Let me get a bucket of water--this place could use a good mopping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s warm, pleasant feeling from her mother\u2019s compliment before class made the harsh pain of Vanessa\u2019s ridicule all the worse this time, as the crimson patches that colored her cheeks deepened a shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat rose to her feet and excused herself from class as her teacher glared at Vanessa for her rude comment. She ran to the bathroom, closed the stall door, closed the lid of the toilet, curled her feet up to her chest and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was feeling better about herself, her classmates, especially Vanessa, had to go and ruin it for her. Why couldn\u2019t they just let her have this one day to feel good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat let her tears finish, then wiped them away with her fingers. She took a moment before the mirror to compose herself, then steeled her courage to go through with the rest of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, as she ate dinner across from her mother in silence, her mother finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, Kat! Why are you so glum this evening? You haven\u2019t said two words to me since I drove you home from ballet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t have a very good class today. That\u2019s all,\u201d said Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how I feel about you taking ballet, dear. Ballet gives you grace and elegance. Every woman should have those qualities, you know. Of course, you <i>could</i> take choir as well. When you were singing along to the radio, I noticed that your singing voice is rather pleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d said Kat, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention now on it, she did notice a dulcet undertone within her speaking voice that she was reasonably certain hadn\u2019t been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom gave her a puzzled look as Kat smiled broadly, her gloomy mood evaporated by her sudden realization of another book-given gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Kat lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. She should be sleeping, but she couldn\u2019t. The events from ballet, the changes to her hair, her height, and her voice, combined to keep her thoughts whirring deep into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached a hand out to turn on her lamp. Her eyes slipped to the book on her nightstand. She gave into temptation and cracked open the large tome just below her underdeveloped chest, idly flipping through the pages as she lay in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother story caught her eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was pleased with everything the Burgeoning Book had given her so far, very pleased, but she still wasn't going to be winning any beauty contests any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing which had bothered her as much if not more than being short it was being flat. Breasts were something she had never had, not even a little. She may not have grown up very tall, but at least she had grown a bit. In the chest department Kat was a complete non-starter. She had no idea what it was like for other girls to look down and see actual curves, let alone not be able to see their feet. As the title of the next story burned itself into her brain, the redheaded teen wondered what it would be like to finally feel like a woman for the first time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chelsea was a charming creature, cute and carefree as can be. Conversely, her closest companion Caroline was cunning and competitive. The couple of them were constantly combing the countryside by carriage and by cart for clothes and cuisine but Caroline conspired to curb Chelsea's choices by claiming the choicest for herself. When Chelsea...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story became something of a tragedy after Chelsea began growing the most 'charming chest' with the most 'cavernous cleavage' in all the land and Caroline was completely outclassed in her one-sided rivalry for eligible suitors but still did everything she could to ruin Chelsea's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the book, Kat knew she didn't have to worry about that. What had happened at ballet earlier was not exactly an isolated incident. She was already suffering from other girls trying to ruin her life, or at least taking great pleasure in laughing at her every misfortune. Kat would kill for a big enough bust to drive them mad with jealousy. She could get her own back on them without lifting a finger and there wouldn't be a thing they could do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the straight and uninterrupted fall of her nightshirt for what she hoped was the last time, Kat fluffed her now even thicker mass of vibrant red hair out over her pillow and closed her eyes, looking forward to what the morning would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stayed up so late reading the previous night, Kat had no time in the morning to measure anything and could only hope she was still growing taller. In her rush to get out the door on time though, she could have sworn her chest was the slightest bit more prominent than before. Without the book in her life she would have brushed it off as a trick of the light but her gorgeous new mane and the fact that even her idle humming was somehow in tune now made it clear she wasn't seeing things. It had started and who knew when it would stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downtrodden but defiant core inside of Kat secretly hoped her breasts would keep growing until she overshadowed not just the girls who tormented her but their friends, their sisters, their mothers and every woman in their lives until she was without question the bustiest, curviest, most feminine girl any of them had ever seen and completely beyond any hope of catching up. That was how she wanted to avenge all of the barbs and insults she had suffered. Not by bullying them in return or spreading rumors but by total, crushing victory in the puberty war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat may have been at the very bottom of the hierarchy, but she knew how the system worked. Extreme hotness was a completely unassailable defensive position as well as the insignia of commanding rank. Any attempt by a less attractive girl to bully or even sass a hotter one was entirely ineffective and just looked jealous and pathetic to those observing. As the underdog it was very frustrating since there was no way at all to turn the tables, but Kat now had a secret weapon and her campaign was underway. She wasn't going to see Vanessa or the other ballet girls for a few days and that gave her strategy, and herself, time to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, she had school and a whole different set of torments to endure, starting with how her best friend could possibly be this lively this early in the morning.<br>\r\n\"It's so not fair. Not even a little bit. How do you do that? You look like you've barely slept, your eyes are all puffy, your skin is even paler than usual and yet somehow you're always having a good hair day!\" Jess grumbled in exasperation as Kat met her at the lockers. Drawing the flaming waterfall in front of her protectively in case Jess decided to take out her frustration on it, Kat noticed it was longer still and its weight had pulled it into soft waves leaving just the ends to curl and bounce behind her.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it's just like that. I don't really do anything to it,\" she replied meekly.<br>\r\n\"That's even worse! It's like you're mocking me and every other girl with just how naturally amazing your hair is with no effort at all. How dare you!\" the Asian girl exclaimed, wearing a strict expression and waggling an accusatory finger under Kat's nose before breaking into giggles. Kat giggled softly too before clapping a hand across her mouth at the unexpectedly musical sound. There was no way to measure it, but from time to time she noticed the small improvements in her voice since the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does have nice hair, doesn't she?\" A new voice drawled sarcastically from behind them. The pair turned to find their school's head cheerleader and queen bitch Angelica, looking down on them. \"I'd ask how she does it, but of course I don't take advice from ugly flat-chested midgets, so once you sort the rest of ...this out you be sure to come and see me.\" The taller girl waved an imperious hand up and down to indicate the whole of Kat's body before her laughter became the cue for the sycophants around her to join in. Until recently, Kat would have turned as red as her hair and run from the cruel laughter but now there was a spark inside her and it was growing as she did.<br>\r\n\"I will,\" she replied quietly, the clarity of her enhanced voice making sure everyone heard her despite the noise of laughter. \"Just remember you said that because I will come for you, when I'm ready.\" Kat stared straight up into Angelica's eyes. The implied threat was weakened a bit because Kat's nose barely cleared the taller girl's impressive chest which strained against a cheerleading top probably a size too small and wobbled with her laughter. However, the intensity of her gaze seemed to unnerve Angelica and the laughter petered out into awkward silence while Kat held her stare for a long moment before grabbing Jess's arm and marching out of the circle of taller, more developed students. Nobody tried to stop them, everyone was too shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat kept up the strong front until they turned a corner out of sight before leaning against a wall and sagging as the tension left her.<br>\r\n\"What was <i>that</i>?\" Jess whispered in quiet awe, still processing recent events.<br>\r\n\"Can't let her win every time,\" Kat replied, sounding tired. \"Maybe Angelica's got it all over me. Maybe I am ugly, short and flat compared to her but that might not always be true and maybe next time she'll think twice.\" Jess just looked at her friend in silence before grabbing her hand.<br>\r\n\"Come on then, we've got to get to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat allowed herself to be led, still thinking about Angelica's taunts. She wouldn't be short or flat for much longer if the book kept doing its thing and maybe once she got home there was something she could do about ugly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty more stories to read. Next up would be: </span></div></div>",

Remembering Jess\u2019 comments on her pasty face and puffy eyes as well as Angelica\u2019s nastiness of the day--despite her best efforts to forget the latter--Kat wanted something that would help her turn the ugly duckling reflected in her mirror every morning into a beautiful swan. Flipping another set of pages, a smile burst forth on her thin lips. She saw the title of the perfect story for the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fiona's Flawless Face</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes began to flow along the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fiona felt the fanfare was a farce. A flawless face? What a funny fantasy that flirtatious, fickle fop of a friar had floated forth. Finding herself furtively filled with foolish fulfillment at fetching the fevering friar\u2019s fervent fancy, she finally, fondly, found the fascinating foundation of facts that forced the flow of freakish fate to finish with the fantastic formation of the fair, feminine, features of her famously faultless face \u2018ere they faded forth to their former fog of forgetfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona frollicked with her furry friends in the fertile forest that fine Friday\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished the fine fable, Kat\u2019s body, exhausted, perhaps, from its growth over the course of the day, sent her into a deep, unbroken sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat woke up the following morning feeling incredibly energized. As her brain kicked into gear, she could think of nothing save the changes the book may have wrought on her flourishing figure overnight. She flung off the sheets and bounded out of bed, coming to a stop before the mirror in her room, eyes exploring her appearance with an intense gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair had gained another three inches in length during the night, its thick, vivid tresses forming ginger ringlets that cascaded in a massive, shifting wave over her shoulders and down her back. As it caught the light with shimmering undulations from her movements, Kat thought that the girl from ballet, though she hadn\u2019t meant her comment as a compliment, wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. Her hair <i>did</i> look a bit like fire--liquid fire--flickering and licking her improving form as it poured over her developing curves. Her hair was beginning to feel a bit heavy for her slender neck to hold upright--at some point, she would need to have it cut. As she admired it\u2019s full, rich expanse, however, she decided that it would be a shame to lose any part of this sumptuous treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had never really felt attractive and, well, <i>womanly</i> before, but the stunning splendor of her magnificent mane gave her a sense of pride in her appearance, foreign to her until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith effort, she finally tore her eyes away from her ginger locks to see if there had been changes to her face. There were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face hadn\u2019t undergone massive changes, only slight ones. Her cheekbones looked slightly more pronounced, her lips had swelled a bit, and her eyes looked marginally larger and brighter. Her eyebrows seemed to take on a higher, more refined arch. Her nose seemed slightly smaller, the tip more retrouss\u00e9 in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat glanced to her chest, which was noticeably fuller. It must have increased a full cup size! Maybe she was a full 28A now! While still small, the lemon-sized evidence of femininity that graced her upper torso made her giddy with excitement! For the first time in her young life, she was beginning to look like a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran over to find her tape measure and stepped onto the bottom, running it up her back, then pinching it off at the top of her head. She turned to see what it read. 5\u20191\u201d!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m finally a full inch taller!\u201d she said aloud, thoughts jumping from enthusiasm for her new height to note a clear difference in her voice. Even with only the one short, softly spoken phrase, she could tell that it was taking on a mellifluous tone, feminine and pleasing to the ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t wait to see Jess\u2019 reaction to her accumulating improvements! Her body was far from a match for Angelica\u2019s, but it was closing the gap. And her hair! It was a match for the models in magazines already! She giggled as she thought of the prospect of modeling for hair ads. Such a thing would have been absurd just days ago, but now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat felt like dressing up for school today. Eschewing her typical jeans and t-shirt, she instead put on a white dress that complemented her increasingly healthy-looking skin and showed the small but growing swells on her chest. She donned white crystal earrings and white wedges to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat looked in the mirror, pleased, overall, with her enhanced figure, but still giving a critical eye to her shapeless waist, two-dimensional hips and butt, and her sticklike legs. She looked at the clock and considered. She could probably squeeze in one more story before she needed to head downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried the book over to her desk from her nightstand and flipped it open. The title of the story at appeared was....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her little, lethargic, languishing legs labored to lift the lithe lass under the leering, lamp-lit looks of the lord of the land. Lily\u2019s lips lolled as she listened to the lovely largo lilt of the lyrical lady. At long last, Lily lifted a leg and launched a lovely leap...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat licked her lips as she lingered on the story\u2019s final words, looking forward to the effect she knew it would have on her legs. If her slender legs could put on some shapely, toned, muscle, maybe they would actually begin to resemble those of an actual ballerina. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about falling out her leaps during ballet class then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a knock at her door, followed by her mother\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat! Wake up! You need to get ready for school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, and watched her mother\u2019s eyes widen in surprise as the older woman took in her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re already up and dressed! My goodness, I forgot just how wonderful your hair is looking these days, Kitty Kat. That dress really brings out the\u2026 fullness of your figure as well. Just remember not to eat all those carbs they have in the school lunches, dear. You don\u2019t want to add any pounds to that slender profile of yours.\u201d Her mother\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly at the word \u201cfullness,\u201d but the look quickly faded as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat grinned. Her mother had given her usual chiding remarks on her figure, but clearly, she was noticing Kat\u2019s developing beauty. She couldn\u2019t suppress a giggle as she thought of what her mom\u2019s reaction might be a week from now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom shot a curious glance to her daughter as the melodic laugh escaped the girl\u2019s slightly fuller lips, then shook her head. Teenagers--you could never understand what they are thinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shoveled some breakfast down, then gulped her juice before bounding out the door, clearly eager to go to school. Her mother\u2019s lips curled upward at her daughter\u2019s unusual level of excitement this morning. She was glad that her daughter was happy, even if she wasn\u2019t behaving particularly ladylike. As her daughter closed the door behind her, she put the girl\u2019s dishes into the dishwasher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica marveled over Kat\u2019s hair when her friend approached her in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it that you only have good hair days\u2026 and <i>better</i> hair days, while the rest of us are stuck with <i>this</i>!\u201d Jessica ran her fingers through the thin, dull, lifeless black strands atop her small head until they hit a tangle. She pulled her tiny hands away from her head with a frustrated growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat strongly considered telling her friend about the book, but she resisted the urge for the moment. Just a few more days before she shared her little secret with the petite Asian girl. She relished being the center of increasingly positive attention and didn\u2019t want to share the spotlight just yet. There would be plenty of time to help her friend, after all, once Kat was a bit further along in her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour complexion looks clearer too! Okay, spill! Makeup? Conditioner? One of those fancy shampoos? What little tip can you give your lifelong bestie to help her out, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat pulled a book from her locker for first period then turned to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, just the usual, you know,\u201d said Kat, feeling a tinge of guilt at hiding the book from her friend. Maybe she should just tell her now rather than waiting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica\u2019s face dropped in obvious disappointment, Kat opened her mouth to give her the lowdown on <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. Before she could say anything, however, she heard Angelica\u2019s voice from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to find some clothes in the toddler section, Jessica. It\u2019s too bad they don\u2019t make <i>women\u2019s</i> clothes for those that are shaped like prepubescent boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sycophant squad behind Angelica snickered, casting wicked stares toward Jessica\u2019s rapidly falling eyes until her gaze fell squarely on the floor, crimson circles blooming on the tiny girl\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, didn\u2019t say anything to Kat as her eyes quickly scanned her inch-taller form. Kat thought she detected a flicker of uncertainty in the voluptuous girl\u2019s eyes, but it was gone before she could be sure--if it had actually been there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelatedly, Kat called out to the flock of departing girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not <i>that</i> small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! That didn\u2019t sound like the clever, fiery comeback she had intended to hurl at the girls! They didn\u2019t even acknowledge her pathetic attempt at retribution, continuing to walk in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat turned her gaze back to Jessica, who had already turned and was running away to the women\u2019s restroom, likely to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat sighed and felt a spark of anger at the cocky head of the cheer team. She was going to bring that horrible girl down from her perch on the top of the school\u2019s social ladder, no matter how much time--or how many stories--it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched her friend jog to the bathroom, head bowed, books clutched to her miniscule chest, she made another silent vow as well. She would show Jessica the book tonight. She wasn\u2019t going to wait any longer. Now that Angelica\u2019s bullying ways seemed to have turned their focus to Jess, she needed to come to her friend\u2019s rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you want me to come over tonight?\u201d asked Jess, eyeing her friend, who had seemed to grow a bit prettier over the course of the day, even as her makeup wore off. Come to think of it, Kat looked a bit taller too. Were her legs longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo show you this!\u201d said Kat in a velvet voice, a mischievous look on her now-cute features. She swung the book upward from the desk, an excited look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave her friend a disbelieving--and slightly bored--look, clearly less than impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkaaaaay. I\u2019m glad you have a new\u2026 er, old, weird book, but I\u2019ve got homework to do, and my mom will want me to be home in time for dinner, and\u2026\u201d Jessica trailed off, clearly not thrilled about reading some centuries-old book and looking for an excuse to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kat could speak, Jessica turned toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jessica turned to leave Kat's hand came up almost involuntarily, reaching for her friend to make her stay. Kat wanted to share the book with Jess, wanted to share its powers and let her friend have the same benefits that she was experiencing. That was the good friend in her, wanting the best for the people she cared about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice in Kat's head disagreed though. The compassionate side of her wanted to help her friend right away, but the dispassionate side advised her to wait. Cold logic told her she still knew almost nothing about the book or its powers and she could do a lot of harm in her ignorance. She'd been lucky so far. Apparently magic was real and it was making her beautiful but how did it work? She really had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if it wasn't just reading the stories but also sleeping in the same room as the book that was making her grow? She'd have to take it to school and lend it to Jess overnight. It wouldn't be safe. It would be in her locker where Angelica or some other bully could steal it. What if Jess got addicted to its power and never gave it back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if the book only recognised one owner at a time and as long as it was changing Kat it wouldn't work for Jess? It would seem like a cruel trick to Jess. Kat would 'reveal' the source of all of her wonderful improvements and give Jess hope that she could change too only to crush that hope immediately when it didn't work. She would think Kat was naturally blessed and making up nonsense just to make fun of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr worse still, what if as soon as Jess read a story from it the book's power transferred to her and all of Kat's changes stopped? Then she could only watch Jess growing taller, bustier and more beautiful every day while she stayed as she was right now suffering with the knowledge that she'd had everything she'd ever wanted and foolishly lost it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of all of that, even if it did work for Jess the way she hoped it would look pretty suspicious to anyone at school. Kat was short, plain, flat and generally unattractive and all of a sudden she starts the world's greatest growth spurt and only a few days later her equally unattractive best friend also begins developing into a stunning beauty. No one would buy that as a coincidence. One girl growing up nicely was good genetics but hotness wasn't transferable through the bonds of friendship. Anyone who noticed both of them changing would come looking for the source. Kat knew there was some kind of mind-affecting power that suppressed concerns over the book's changes but it had to have its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing, both her mother and Jess and even Vanessa had commented on some of Kat's enhancements over the past few days so she knew they were seeing her as she was, but neither seemed to think anything was strange, so perhaps they didn't remember her as she used to be. What if she didn't notice Jess' changes? What if she lent Jess the book and then couldn't see anything different about her? Or worse, what if she lent Jess the book and its power to make others accept its changes made Kat forget about the book itself altogether?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts and worries swirled around Kat's mind in the few seconds it took Jess to cross her room to the door where she stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh sure. I thought maybe reading a story together would help cheer you up. Some other time then.\" Kat mumbled, lowering her hand. She gave her friend a little smile of encouragement which turned up the corners of Jess' mouth if nothing else.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks, another time,\" Jessica replied and left the room with a wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat turned back to the book on her desk. She had wanted to share the book's power with Jess to protect her from the bullies too, but if she couldn't do that then Kat would have to protect her friend herself. Defying Angelica had seemed to work at least a little when she'd stood up to her earlier but she'd only switched targets to Jess. That only meant Kat had to make it clear that Jess was off limits too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another rule of social warfare that could help her with that. Hot girls were allowed to have less attractive friends and they formed cliques around themselves. The leader of one clique didn't pick on the followers in another clique. It was like admitting they couldn't win against the leader of the rival group and had to go for an easier target. If Kat could make it clear to Angelica that Jess was with her then Angelica would have to stop picking on Jess and focus all of her attention on Kat or she would lose face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat could hardly believe she was about to bring down even more heat from the queen of the school onto herself but if she couldn't directly help her best friend with the book then she would have to do it indirectly. Kat's own defence against Angelica would be her ever-improving face and figure and eventually she hoped she would equal and then beat the hottest girl in school at her own game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Kat picked up the book again and chose the next story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rebecca's Resplendent Rear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca rarely reveled in the regal rondure of her resplendent rear. She was really rather reticent and regularly relaxed reflectively as a relative recluse. Rumours roamed though, and one day a royal retainer rang the bell at her residence...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story described the prince having dispatched servants to every village seeking to track down the girl with the finest rear end in all the land, summoning them to the castle for a ball, Cinderella style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat ran a hand over her flat backside and wondered what it was like to have a proper popping bubble butt. Hopefully she would soon find out but even as quick as the book seemed to work its magic nothing was going to happen straight away. Her talk with Jess, brief as it had been, was emotionally draining and after a quiet dinner with her Mom she went almost straight to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornings were quickly becoming Kat's favorite part of the day because they always brought the biggest changes. She couldn't tell if it was because the time she was asleep made hours of changes seem to appear immediately or whether being asleep let her body focus on growing and she actually did change more overnight but either way the results were obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe because her legs were now lengthening alongside her height itself, Kat discovered she was a full half inch taller than before, meaning her growth rate had effectively doubled. The excitement at the thought she might reach her ideal height even faster now made her do a little dance which only served to highlight a few more things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer magnificent hair, now almost down to her waist and so thick she could lose an arm in it flew out in a wave of shimmering fiery curls as she spun. Her legs seemed to be a little more toned but as a ballerina-in-training she also noticed feeling slightly more balanced and graceful. This was good as for the very first time in her life there was a weight on her chest which affected her center of gravity and didn't entirely stop moving when she did. Bringing her hands up to cup the perky little breasts which projected from her chest in an unfamiliar but extremely pleasant way, Kat grinned broadly and willed the tiny mounds to grow into giant mountains to put the small hills of all of her rivals to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror showed improved facial features, still recognisably hers but more refined. Eyes brighter and wider, nose smaller and slimmer, skin smoother, cheekbones higher, teeth more straight and lips more plump. Alone each trait had barely changed but put together they made Kat a noticeably prettier girl than even just yesterday. Finally she ran questing hands around her hips and over her flat backside and for once there was something pushing them outwards. It was barely there, but there was cushioning flesh where there had been none before.

She saw Jess flinch under the caustic weight of every syllable, the beautiful girl\u2019s ugly words shredding her friend\u2019s already meager self confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRighteous fury erupted inside of Kat, her fingers quivering and clenching with anger. How dare Angelica do this to her friend! Kat was going to put a stop to this right now! She needed to protect Jess. Kat would ensure that <i>she</i> was <i>only</i> one of her circle of friends that Angelica would be confronting from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiery rage stoking her bravery, Kat walked right up to Angelica and slapped her across the face. Hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica looked stunned, as did her circle of sycophants. Kat gulped, a bit shocked at her own actions, but she forced down the momentary uncertainty and looked Angelica squarely in the eye, summoning her fury-fed courage once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngelica, I knew you were a bitch, but this is low even for you! If you have a problem with one of my friends, you take it up with <i>me</i> from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica, caught completely off guard by the smaller girl\u2019s boldness, hesitated, her hand slowly rising to touch her burning cheek. Angelica had not anticipated this turn of events in her wildest imagination. None of her victims had ever fought back like this before. Most of them never fought back at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Angelica could gather herself sufficiently to respond, Kat grabbed her wide-eyed friend\u2019s hand and pulled Jess away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Jess. Let\u2019s get to class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked away, Angelica stared daggers into Kat\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two friends sat down at their desks in first period, Jess turned to Kat and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, Kat! What has gotten into you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat, the vestiges of her anger having faded on their walk to the classroom, was feeling slightly queasy now. She shrugged, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngelica is going to be out for blood now, you know!\u201d said Jess, her brows furrowing in concern for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought Kat\u2019s own blood immediately back to a boil, her anger once again fueling brashness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her then! I\u2019m sick of that bitchy cheerleader thinking she can run the school just because she\u2019s prettier than everyone else. That\u2019s all she has, and she might not even have that for long,\u201d Kat said cryptically. \u201cIf she thinks that gives her the right to say those awful things to you, then I\u2019m going to fight back. I don\u2019t care what she does to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess watched her friend\u2019s impassioned diatribe with awe, but when Kat finished, Jess still looked unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that now\u2026\u201d she whispered to Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her burst of anger once again diminished, Kat gazed at Jess\u2019 concerned expression with a growing sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had gym sixth period, the class she had been avoiding in her thoughts all day. The reason? It was the only class she shared with Angelica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat braced herself as she watched Angelica enter the locker room, preparing for the worst. The buxom girl, however, never so much as glanced at her, walking by without even acknowledging her presence with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat kept sneaking glances at Angelica as their gym teacher instructed them on the basics of volleyball and had them begin to play. Angelica ignored her. For the entire class. Not a look. Not a word. It made Kat far more uncomfortable than if the head cheerleader had simply given her the tongue-lashing she had expected. What was Angelica up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take much longer to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Kat showered, then went back to her locker to change. Her clothes weren\u2019t there. Okay, so it was the ol\u2019 hide the girl\u2019s clothes trick? She wrapped her towel around her and began to search each locker as the room gradually emptied, the other girls heading home for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the flush of a toilet and glanced toward the stalls. Angelica strode out of one of them, giving her an evil smile before strolling out of the locker room, humming one of the insipid chants she had devised for the cheer team as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s stomach dropped. Okay, so Angelica had taken the steal-the-clothes trip up a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the stall and found her clothes swirling in nastiness. Angelica had even thrown her jacket and sweaty gym clothes in. This could be a bit of a problem. She wasn\u2019t about to fish her clothes out of <i>that</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, in the middle of winter, with nothing but a towel to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat frowned. Well, she had said that she was ready for Angelica\u2019s worst. Nothing like putting that to the test right away! She considered for a moment, then pulled her phone from her backpack. At least Angelica had left that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat called her mom, telling her simply that she had <i>lost</i> her clothes. It wasn\u2019t untrue--those clothes were definitely lost to her now. It was preferable to explaining the Angelica situation to her mother. That would result in calls to the school and the complete loss of status that would come from involving parents and school officials in her little feud. No, she needed to abide by her peers\u2019 unwritten rules of social war. Involving parents would be the equivalent of a social war crime. She needed to handle this on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited for her mom to arrive, she loosened the towel and set it on a bench. She examined herself in the mirror of the empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another day of growth, she was looking better than ever. Her lush mane seemed to glow with vibrant health as her eyes traveled its length to the small of her back. Its rich, sanguine color flickered and glimmered as it swayed with her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face looked a bit more refined and was beginning to border on pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty,\u201d she said, noticing, now that she was really paying attention, the ever more melodic lilt of her voice. She also savored the word itself. It was a word she never thought she could use to describe herself. Yet, as her eyes took in her larger breasts, closing in on a B-cup now; her still-slender, if a bit soft, waist; her increasingly shapely backside; and her longer, more curvaceous legs, the word suited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ding of the text message on her phone broke her reverie, and she checked it. Her mom was there. Kat again wrapped herself in the towel, scrambling to put on her shoes and backpack before running out to the waiting car. Her mom sat inside, a less-than-pleased look pursing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made it back to her room, she immediately walked to the book on her desk, knowing that her best revenge was to unseat Angelica from her perch at the top of the school\u2019s beauty scale. She flipped to a story she had not yet read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tralina\u2019s Tiny, Toned Tummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Tralina traveled the terrible track, trying to trace her target, a team of torch-toting tutors. They had taken the talent of taste from the teen\u2019s tongue, and Tralina toured the territory, tasked to take ten tutors to trial for their terrible transgression. Tralina turned, taking time to...  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced toward the mirror, a look of satisfaction on her face, knowing that her reflection the next morning would bring her one step closer to taking down her rival.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat began her morning with her now standard full body inspection with twirl-for-effect. Hair healthier, check. Height higher, check. Breasts bouncier, butt bigger, check check. Beauty blossoming, legs lengthening and tummy toning, check check check. The fact that some of her clothes now felt tighter, particularly in the chest, only added to the developing girl's delight. Kat was a full B-cup now and the perky mounds swiftly introducing themselves to the world would soon require actual bras. That was a rite of passage she had never undergone and where once she would have dreaded the need to spend any more time than absolutely necessary shopping with her Mom, Kat now thought such an outing might involve slightly less harsh criticism and slightly more mother-daughter bonding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can go shopping for bras,\" her Mom replied with a sweet little smile that stopped Kat in her tracks for a moment. She hadn't seen her mother make such a genuine expression of affection since she was a little girl. It seemed like her Mom had been waiting for a day like this to arrive, as though one of the joys of having a daughter was watching her grow into a woman. Kat had never developed anything like an adult figure and so her Mom had been denied the pleasure of milestones like taking her daughter shopping for her first bra. Until now. After a moment Kat smiled back and hoped this might be the start of a better relationship with her Mom.<br>\r\n\"While we're at it we can do something about your wardrobe. You have far too many jeans and t-shirts and not nearly enough blouses, skirts and dresses. You're growing at last and I'm going to make sure you become not just a woman but a lady if it's the last thing I do!\" There it was, the old fire was back, but somehow it was warmer. Her Mom was so enthusiastic about doing the best she could for her daughter that Kat couldn't bring herself to oppose it. Besides, she reasoned, if she kept getting taller and leggier then skirts and dresses would be much more forgiving. She'd have to buy a new pair of jeans every time she grew another inch otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect of having wardrobe trouble because she was growing taller and bustier put a smile on Kat's face and a spring in her step which lasted the entire way to school. In fact, she was still humming a merry tune and practically skipping through the halls on the way to her locker when a long arm shot out of the doorway she'd just passed and a strong hand grasped the back of her collar. Kat's forward motion was suddenly arrested from the top, sending her legs flying out from under her and then swinging back until she hung, dangling by the neck of her shirt, in the iron grip of Herr Kaufmann the music teacher.<br>\r\n\"Do zat again,\" he barked in his thick German accent. This was a problem for Kat since she couldn't tell if he was being serious or sarcastic. Did he actually want her to do whatever it was again or was he metaphorically daring her to continue her alleged rule-breaking to see what her punishment would be?<br>\r\n\"Umm, do vot? Oh! I mean do what?\" She corrected quickly, copying his pronunciation accidentally. He didn't seem to even notice.<br>\r\n\"Ze singing girl, ze pure vocalisation I haf just heard. More! Schnell!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure. Uh... can you, um... put me down though?\" She gasped out after a moment. Hanging by her shirt meant most of her body weight was held up by fabric bunched right around her throat. Kat didn't weigh much but it was still not the position most conducive to singing.<br>\r\n\"Vot?\" Herr Kaufmann bent his arm and swung her dangling form around to face him, then seemed to realise her predicament and lowered her to the ground where he loomed over her from his 6'4\" height. \"Ja, of course,\" he mumbled in something that almost resembled an apology.<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Um, you want me to sing?\" she asked quietly, still a bit bewildered by the entire encounter.<br>\r\n\"Ja. I heard only a little but it vos the clearest tone I haf heard in years. I must know if you haf ze gift!\" He glowered at her from under bushy grey eyebrows in grumpy expectation. Embarrassed and more than a little scared, Kat hummed a few bars from a pop song that had been playing on the bus earlier.<br>\r\n\"Yessss!\" Herr Kaufmann exulted. The light flashed off his round spectacles and the fist that no longer held Kat was clenched before him in victory like an evil mastermind whose scheme had come to fruition. \"It is raw, untrained, but such clarity, such potential!\" He hardly seemed to be speaking to her at all anymore. \"Ze plans must be redrafted, ze positions reassigned. Zere is so much to be done!\" Seeming to remember she was still present, the towering music teacher looked down at Kat again. \"Be here after school. Do not be late! You are in ze choir now.\" So saying, he turned on his heel and stalked back into the music room, the door closing with a sharp <i>click</i> behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been a question or an offer, it was a statement of fact. Apparently Kat didn't get a say in whether or not she joined the choir, it had been decided. That was Herr Kaufmann's other role, she remembered. He taught music but he was also the school's choir director. Kat had sometimes wondered why the choir never lacked members despite its director's famously strict requirements and difficult temperament. Now she had some insight into his method of recruitment. Whether deliberately or not, Herr Kaufmann seemed to be using his intimidating manner for the benefit of the choir program. Talented singers were not too scared to join the choir, they were probably conscripted and were then too scared to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kat was one of them whether she liked it or not. She could only hope that choir practice didn't clash with ballet or her Mom would burst a vein trying to decide which elegant pastime was more ladylike and should be pursued at the expense of the other. For now though, Kat had a full day ahead of her and there was still an angry queen bitch to deal with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the end of her final period, Kat approached the choir room for the rehearsal that Herr Kaufmann had made clear was mandatory. She supposed that she could have shirked the responsibility and slipped away after gym class, \u2026but she didn\u2019t really want to. She <i>was</i> looking forward to her first bra fitting almost as much as her mother seemed to be, but there would still be time for that after rehearsing with the choir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Herr Kaufmann\u2019s comments about the quality of her voice had intrigued her. She knew that she owed her increasingly mellifluous voice to <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>, and she also knew that the improvements were likely to continue. She smiled. If he thought her voice was good now, just wait\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat\u2019s imagination ran wild with fantasies of taking Broadway by storm with her amazing voice, graceful dancer\u2019s legs, and model-level beauty, she pulled open the heavy door to the choir room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerr Kaufmann\u2019s bushy eyebrows were bouncing up and down over the rims of his glasses as he ranted to the students about the need to take choir <i>much</i> more seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMusik ist serious business, no matter vot you all zink! Bah!\u201d he said in exasperation as he turned from the group, mumbling under his breath. \u201c...faule Sch\u00fcler, die nie \u00fcben\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door clicked shut behind Kat, Herr Kaufmann\u2019s eyes snapped, predator-quick to her tense, wide-eyed visage. He paused, his expression softening, gray mustache twitching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, Kat! Zank you for joining us, ja? Hier, hier\u2026\u201d he picked up a booklet of sheet music and carried it over to the reticent girl. As he handed her the music, he put a large hand in the middle of her back and pushed her lightly toward the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat stumbled forward, not sure whether this had been such a good idea after all. Her eyes scanned the students in the group until they found Jess\u2019. Jess\u2019 questioning look made Kat feel a bit guilty. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to tell Jess about her encounter with Herr Kaufmann this morning, but she could have at least sent a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerr Kaufmann seemed to sense Kat\u2019s reluctance, and he increased the pressure on her back a bit. Kat staggered forward again on stiff, resistant legs. She inhaled then let out the breath slowly, steeling her resolve. Okay, she was going to do this! Feelings of determination settling in, Kat\u2019s shoulders relaxed and she walked the rest of the way voluntarily, coming to a stop next to her petite friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat looked up, she thought she saw the hint of a smile under Herr Kaufman\u2019s bristly mustache. She quickly discarded the thought. Everyone knew that the man was incapable of smiling. Kat looked down at the stapled booklet in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</i>. Mozart &amp; Schikaneder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrawled in messy handwriting and highlighted on her copy was a name--at least she thought it was a name. Pamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this? It wasn\u2019t even in English! She shot Jess a pleading glance. Her friend moved her lips to Kat\u2019s ear and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opera in German that Herr Kaufmann wants us to perform next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opera? Kat had never even been to the opera. She didn\u2019t know <i>anything</i> about operas. She wondered again what she had gotten herself into. She whispered back to Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 so what does \u201cPamina\u201d mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess gaped, then took Kat\u2019s music to examine it. She opened it, seeing certain sections of arias highlighted, then slapped it shut. She said nothing, simply staring at the handwritten scribble on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What is it, Jess?\u201d Kat whispered to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Herr Kaufmann intends for you to play the part of Pamina,\u201d her friend responded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s the female lead, for a soprano. It goes really high too. I hope you\u2019re ready for this, Kat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s felt her stomach drop. This didn\u2019t sound good\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Jess, I can\u2019t even read music!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll help you. When the notes go higher on these five lines here, move your voice higher. When they go down, go down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that didn\u2019t seem too bad. She could do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerr Kaufmann shuffled some papers on the music stand in front of him, then raised his hands, thumbs and forefingers pinched together. As he swung his arms down, the choir began to sing. Kat simply stood there, agog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess nudged Kat with her tiny elbow. Kat started, then began to sing softly. She started on the wrong note, but within a couple of measures, she seemed to be in tune with the others. She looked up from the paper and noticed that the German choir director was staring right at her, the spark of delight in his steel blue eye. Did that mean he <i>liked</i> what she was doing? Maybe it did! Kat began to sing with more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, however, the rest of the singers stopped, and she was the only one left singing. She continued on. Her voice <i>did</i> sound pretty good, she thought. After a moment, though, the piano accompaniment changed, and the notes began to go really high. She panicked, not sure how this part was supposed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat stopped, the instrumental accompaniment continuing for a few more bars until it, too, came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVat\u2019s vrong?\u201d asked Herr Kaufmann, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, um, can\u2019t really read music,\u201d said Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d said the German giant, tapping his foot, his finger rubbing his chin. \u201cVell, ve shall haf to remedy zat, now von\u2019t ve?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgen komm\u2026 uh... in ze morning before class tomorrow, come to mein office und I shall instruct you,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now, all of you sing Pamina\u2019s zolos. Drop down an octaf oder zwei if you must. Now, MACH LOS!!!\u201d he cried, his sudden directive causing a tremor to ripple through the students in the choir as the music suddenly resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat made it through the rest of rehearsal until she finally departed with Jess under the stern, steady, wire-rimmed gaze of Herr Kaufman, his dense mustache framing pursed lips.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mother tapped her watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat took you so long, Kat? Don\u2019t you remember? We talked about this. I\u2019m taking you for a bra fitting this evening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, mom. See, the choir director came to me this morning and kinda strong-armed me into being in the choir. He wants me to be the lead in this opera that they\u2019re doing, and...\u201d Kat trailed off as she watched her mother\u2019s expression change. Her mature eyebrows shifted from a furrow to a suprised arch; her lips, from a frown to a slowly blossoming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lead? In the choir?\u201d The woman clapped her hands together and bounced on the balls of her feet, her delight evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so, dear? My daughter\u2026 the lead in an opera\u2026\u201d Kat\u2019s mother seemed to be testing the never before spoken phrases on her tongue. Judging by her widening smile\u2014now Cheshire sized\u2014she must have liked their flavor. Her eyes sparkled with eager energy like a Kardashian in front of a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s shoulders slumped in relief. This news seemed to be going over rather well. Kat supposed she shouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised. Her mother was the driving force behind her ballet lessons, as much as Kat hated them. She typically liked any activities that were geared toward developing her daughter into an elegant and refined lady. Kat knew that her mother\u2019s intentions were noble. She simply wanted the best for her daughter. That was her notion of \u201cbest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just that sometimes Kat didn\u2019t feel the desire to be an elegant, refined lady. Sometimes, she just wanted to simply relax, be herself, to do her own thing. Still, her developing body and improving voice seemed tailor made for the choir/ballet activity combination that her mom so clearly desired for her. If she were really good at them both\u2014good enough to make Vanessa, Angelica, and others of their ilk respect her\u2014maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Maybe it would even be a chance to get even with those other girls, to beat them at their own games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s mom opened the front door, motioning for Kat to go through. As Kat walked out to the car, she felt an arm come around her, then a kiss atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t say it enough, but I\u2019m proud of you, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s eyes began to well with emotion. It was rare for her mother to express such a sentiment. Kat spun from her grasp, then dove in to hug her mother. The two stood there for a brief moment before parting. Kat wiped away the tears that were threatening to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat and her mom were chatting away, bonding in a way they never had before, as they arrived at the mall and entered the lingerie shop. Something, however, caught the corner of Kat\u2019s eye, however\u2026 Rather, someone. She gasped as she turned and saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Angelica. She was wearing a name badge and holding a measuring tape. Did she <i>work</i> here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her lips formed a sneer that was tempered only by the fact that Kat\u2019s mother was standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God! Why did </i>Angelica <i>have to be here for this! It should be her moment of triumph and instead it was far more likely to be another complete humiliation to add to her collection...</i> Kat thought, warily walking to meet her arch enemy on, apparently, <i>her</i> territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are <i>you</i> here?\u201d Angelica asked, looking down her nose at Kat\u2019s eyes, not bothering to cast a glance to her improving body.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll ever need a bra with those bee stings you call breasts,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of greeting is that? You work here, right? Ever heard of customer service?\u201d said Kat\u2019s mother in an outraged tone. \u201cPlease treat my daughter with some respect, or I\u2019ll see that your manager knows about your attitude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat smiled inside. Her mom didn\u2019t even know anything about Angelica\u2019s bullying, but she was upset at even this relatively minor show of disrespect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, she clearly needs a bra--just look at her chest!\u201d said her mother testily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica\u2019s eyes bulged as she actually did as Kat\u2019s mom demanded. There were actually swells in the thin top Kat had worn for the momentous occasion. Angelica couldn\u2019t believe it, but the girl really was in need of a bra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica grudgingly pulled out her tape measure and measured Kat\u2019s rib cage. 26 inches. She pulled it around the fullest point of her breasts. 27 3/4 inches. She sniffed, didn\u2019t say a word, and walked to the back and selected several 30B options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica gave Kat a cold look, wound up to throw the bras at her, then glanced to her mother\u2019s stern face. Kat\u2019s mother tapped her toe as she gave Angelica a warning look. Angelica scowled, then handed the bras to Kat, pointing her finger toward the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nodded, again amused at her mom\u2019s uncanny ability to handle the bitchy girl, and pulled the door closed behind her. She tried on the bras, and they all seemed to fit. They were maybe a little oversized in the cups, but when she reached into the bra and pulled her breasts up and out in the cups, then smooshed the cups of the bra together a bit. Her breasts seemed to fill them well enough. Besides, a little room was probably a good thing. As long as the book continued to work its magic, she would likely need that much room and more in the coming days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror, seeing her proper breasts in a proper bra and smiled. She never thought she would see the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it going, dear?\u201d she heard from outside the fitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, pulling the door open, a bit self-conscious showing herself in nothing but a bra. She just hoped Angelica wasn\u2019t watching. She knew, however, that her mom would insist anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother\u2019s eyes seemed to illuminate as she gasped in maternal pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re perfect, Kat! You really are developing into a pretty young woman,\u201d she said as if stating it out loud would make it more real somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat blushed at her mom\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Stop it! You\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been waiting for this for so long\u2026 I\u2019ll give you your privacy now. Just make sure to get at least five. Then, your embarrassment will be over,\u201d she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat couldn\u2019t believe it. Her mother had never winked at her in her entire life! Confused at what this new mannerism actually meant, Kat shut the door. She picked out her favorite five and exited the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t see Angelica around, thankfully. As she followed her mother to the cash register, she surreptitiously snagged two 30Cs from a display, trading it out for two of her five. At the rate she was growing, she was probably going to need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother paid for the bras and squeezed her shoulder as they left in a wordless sign of affection while Angelica brooded, watching them from a crack in the door to the back room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, Kat left choir rehearsal feeling great about having nailed the high notes. She was beginning to be able to read the music as well, after a few somewhat scary coaching sessions from Herr Kaufmann. She could swear she saw the uncharacteristic hint of a smile under his bristly salt-and-pepper mustache as he had given her a slight nod on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat hurried home to change. She had ballet tonight, and she needed to change quickly so that her mom could drop her off. She stripped, then glanced at the mirror as she grabbed her leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell beyond \u201cpretty\u201d now, Kat was moving boldly into \u201cbeautiful\u201d territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was absolutely jaw dropping. As she shook the lavish tumble of shimmering copper ringlets that now reached the sexy swell of her rather breathtaking derriere, she plucked a few voluminous tresses away from her face. She had honestly never seen such devastatingly gorgeous hair on anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes sparkled as she rotated her face, examining its now-elegant lines and healthy complexion. Her viridian eyes seemed larger and more expressive, her every thought seeming to flow out of them. They currently beamed in happy satisfaction, brightening as they began the downward journey along her rapidly improving assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with full lips to reveal brilliantly white teeth, Kat\u2019s eyes lingered on her firm and athletic, yet still willowy and feminine arms. She raised them above her head as she executed a graceful pirouette. Her mom would be so proud. Another inch of height gained through her lengthening legs was beginning to give her body the sleek lines of a proper ballerina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her white tights upward over her long, sinuous legs to her toned stomach. Her abs weren\u2019t visible, but she had a line of definition beginning to form down the middle. She stepped into her green leotard, her calves swelling into smooth hardness as she pointed her toes and pushed each leg through the holes. She could feel the firm muscles of her stomach working as she wriggled the tight leotard over her torso, lining up the padded cups over her ever larger and prouder breasts. Today at school, she had needed to break out the C-cups for the first time. They were a little large still, but the Bs were just becoming so tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped the straps over each shoulder, then twisted to admire the radiant skin of her contoured back in the mirror, appreciating the fact that she had chosen the open-back \u2018tard for today\u2019s class. Her body had to be nearly as shapely as Vanessa\u2019s now. She was still several inches shorter, but her hair blew the taller girl\u2019s out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the book, she was definitely catching up. Another class or two, and she would definitely have Vanessa eclipsed. Next stop\u2026 Angelica! She smiled at the mere thought of surpassing the most gorgeous girl in school. If the changes continued, however, it was only a matter of time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Kat! We\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Kat heard her mom call from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrambled down the stairs, enjoying her mother\u2019s brightening expression as the older woman eyed Kat\u2019s attractive form beaming with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat entered the class, she nodded to Miss Clara, the instructor. Vanessa eyed her carefully with a scowl, as she laced her pointe shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Clara lined them up for centre practice, beginning with the Adagio for their upcoming performance. Kat easily performed the movements, her body seeming stronger and more graceful than ever as she flowed through the positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came time for the jumps, she managed increased height and newfound confidence in the landings that had previously stricken fear into her heart. She looked up to see Miss Clara returning what she knew must be a radiant smile as she had her best day of class ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they took a brief water break, Kat saw Vanessa whispering to her gaggle of swans in the back. She wondered what they were discussing but didn\u2019t think too much of it. She wanted to enjoy the first ballet class she could truly be proud of...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat soon discovered what Vanessa's whispered planning session had been about. Miss Clara called the group together and announced that they would be doing barre work, at which point Vanessa's clique sprang into action. In the blink of an eye the lot of them had lined up by the barre on the wall and Vanessa had taken the last spot at the end, leaving one conspicuous space immediately ahead of her which Kat would be forced to take. Clearly something was up but the redhead figured it was probably just so Vanessa could whisper insults and barbs to her far from the ears of their instructor. Newly confident in herself, Kat entered the trap and nonchalantly took her place beside her smiling nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went well for a time and Kat found her taller, more slender form and longer, lightly muscled legs gave her a grace and strength she'd never had before. She was able to perform better than ever and hold poses for longer than she thought possible. The irritated noises coming from behind her were music to Kat's ears as she outperformed Vanessa in every exercise. It was wonderful, but it couldn't last. With one leg up on the barre and most of her weight on the other, Kat suddenly felt her foot swept out from under her and she went crashing to the ground, looking up from the floor at Vanessa who was the picture of innocence as the teacher came to help Kat to her feet. The rest of Vanessa's cronies ahead of her giggled cruelly as Kat dusted herself off and once Miss Clara was gone their leader hissed into the redhead's ear.<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the view? Get used to it because that's where you'll always be; looking up at me standing above you after you crash and burn!\" She punctuated the last word with a vicious tug on Kat's fiery red hair, snapping the girl's head back harshly. Kat could only glare at her and wait for the class to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a bit better when the time came to change from their leotards back into ordinary clothes. Kat could feel the eyes of the other girls on her and decided to take some extra time fussing with her clothes to give everyone in the room as much time as they liked to spy on her new and improved body. Just to add insult to injury, as she deliberately put on her smaller bra which was still in her bag she made sure to mutter quietly to herself, perfectly loud enough for everyone in the room to hear and with a bit of emphasis for good measure. \"Looks like you girls can't be contained by those <i>little</i> B-cups anymore, huh?\" she asked her breasts, looking down at the supple flesh clearly overpowering the bra she was trying to stuff them into. \"Onto <i>bigger</i> and <i>better</i> things it seems. Hope you're <i>enjoying the view</i> over those cups because we'll have you under wraps again in some nice <i>C-cups</i> in no time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally putting on her shirt, Kat gathered her things and turned around to face the room. Vanessa, who Kat was fully aware wore the B-cups she had just referred to as 'little', was seething. Some of the other girls were shocked. Kat couldn't be bustier than them, it went against the natural order of things. But the tight t-shirt she'd had since before her recent growth spurt was riding up from her waist, the extra fabric taken up with being stretched over an ample chest which hadn't been there just a short time ago. Totally ignoring the fact that she was the center of attention, Kat was the picture of innocence as she strolled past the stunned crowd towards the door. As she passed Vanessa though, Kat made sure to gather up her glorious red mane and toss it over her shoulder in such a way that its heavy length swung around and slapped her nemesis in the face. It was done in such a way that it might have been an accident, but not a single person in the room thought it was. This was a new Kat and she had grown not just boobs, but claws.</span></div></div>",

She opened the locker, and the envelope dropped and slapped the ground more heavily than expected. She bent and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name appeared in hastily scrawled handwriting on the center of the envelope. She flipped it over and used a fingernail to pry open the seal. It was a card! She extracted it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cover was an artfully painted heart design that stated: \u201cFrom a Secret Admirer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened it to find printed words wishing her a happy Valentine\u2019s Day. Below it was written a single sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I ask you to the midwinter dance, please don\u2019t say no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card warmed Kat\u2019s heart. The cursive line spoke of a cute, timid person that she now <i>had</i> to meet. She resolved to answer \u201cyes\u201d no matter who the writer of the card turned out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Angelica appeared, stopping uncomfortably close to Kat to lord her still significant height advantage over the redhead. She seemed to be trying harder than ever to emphasize her beauty advantage over Kat as well, though it had clearly diminished, with caked-on makeup, revealing clothes, and new jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. What have we here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat should have anticipated Angelica\u2019s lightning-quick grab for the card, but she didn\u2019t, and Angelica snatched it out of her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA secret admirer, eh? Who\u2019s going to ask you to the dance? I wonder who that could be\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and flipped the open card over her shoulder, sending it fluttering to the floor behind her. She walked away, still sounding amused, her flock following closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat narrowed her eyes at the other girl in suspicion. What was Angelica up to now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still focused on Angelica as she strolled around a corner out of sight, Jess came up behind Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat, you\u2019re looking amazing today!\u201d Jess gushed. Even with the obscuring effect of the book, her appearance was now easily attractive enough to draw attention. The thought reminded her of how hard Angelica seemed to be trying with her appearance today. It brought a smile to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just</i> try to <i>keep up, Angelica.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat reached down for the card once more. As she rose, she noticed that Jess was attempting to suppress a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know, Jess? Spill!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing! I swear!\u201d she said with a broad and growing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeeeessssss....\u201d Kat said in a bitonal warning. \u201cI know where you\u2019re ticklish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jess shrieked, the threat of a full-on tickle attack more than she could handle. \u201cOkay, okay! I know who your secret admirer is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeesssss?\u201d Kat said, this time in a slowly rising pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Rick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom choir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, eying me for my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cute! Quiet and introverted, but friendly. Kat couldn\u2019t help but smile at the prospect of a cute guy being into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess giggled as she saw my reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Kat said, eyes alight with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess only giggled that much louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school and a choir rehearsal in which Herr Kaufmann closed his eyes in pleasure as Kat\u2019s increasingly divine voice flowed through the challenging arias of <i>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</i>, Kat hustled out to the hallway to catch up with Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Rick had chickened out on asking her to the dance, or he was having second thoughts. She intended to create the perfect opportunity for him to ask her. Or not. She hoped it was the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew roughly where Rick\u2019s locker was, but as she rounded the corner to the hallway where it was located, she screeched to an abrupt halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica was standing before him, back turned to Kat, leaning toward him to give him a view of the cavernous cleavage on display in her slutty top. When she placed her hand on the boy\u2019s arm, Kat knew for certain she was flirting with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? She must have found out who the card was from? Maybe one of her minions had overheard her conversation with Jess? She didn\u2019t know. Right now, she didn\u2019t even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out of the school all the way home. When she made it to her room, she flung the door closed and collapsed face-first on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes, welling with tears before, let loose a flood now. Her shoulders rose and fell as her sobs began in earnest. Angelica\u2019s other pranks hadn\u2019t been fun, but they hadn\u2019t hurt like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be angry, but she couldn\u2019t. At the moment, her heart was too wounded to feel anything but the aching darkness of extinguished romantic hope.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat had no idea how long she lay there face down and sobbing into her pillow but it wasn't dark outside when she flopped onto the bed, so there was that. There had been knocking and voices a while ago but the distraught girl had not had the mental capacity to process anything other than despair at the time. Looking up through bleary eyes she saw a little note on the ground where it had been slipped under the door. Knowing her mom it probably read 'dinner in the fridge when you're ready' or something similar. When she wasn't tutting over her daughter's choices, or her appearance or some other criticism of her behavior, Kat's mom could be very considerate ...sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way back from the note to her tear-soaked pillow, Kat's eyes fell on a red envelope lying on her desk where she had carelessly thrown it before she collapsed. The sight of her secret admirer's card caused her to choke up again as it conjured the memory of Angelica leaning in towards Rick and her imagination filled in the rest of the scene with the worst possible outcome. The shadowy depths of the school queen's cleavage captured his undivided attention while she ran delicate fingertips adorned with perfectly manicured nails lightly over his bicep and laughed musically at whatever he'd just said. While his gaze was fixed on her impressive bust, Angelica's glossy pink lips parted in a cruel smile as she gloated over how easy it was. No boy could resist her at the best of times and certainly not when she was so close that he could probably feel the body heat of her glorious bust radiating onto his chest and every breath nearly brought them into tantalizing contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene playing out in her mind's eye was almost enough to make Kat break out in floods of tears all over again but she was distracted by what lay beside the card. <i>The Burgeoning Book</i> sat quietly on her desk, the light glinting off its gold-edged pages. The gears in Kat's mind began to turn. Angelica was asserting her dominance. She was trying to crush Kat by taking away something she wanted. Her makeup had been extra thick and her clothes particularly slutty today. She was emphasising her (remaining) superiority in beauty and boobs. Angelica didn't try to steal the admirers of every girl in school, this was different. Kat was becoming a rival to her and she didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if Kat's development caused fear in Angelica then Kat needed to develop more, faster and better. If Angelica was going to use her boobs to entice Kat's admirer away from her then Kat's boobs needed to develop enough to bring him back. Her once tearful expression hardening, Kat rose from her bed for the first time in hours and flipped open the leather bound tome on her desk. Searching through the pages she thought about her experience with the book so far. The two stories which increased her height and improved her legs were making her taller faster than either one would have alone, so she knew their effects could be combined. Kat wanted to go one step further though. Now it was time to find out if reading the same story twice would double its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh smile formed on the redhead's own pretty features as her eyes alighted on the flowing script of a familiar title: <i>Chelsea's Charming Chest</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica was in for some interesting times of her own.</span></div></div>",

Her hands couldn't fully cover them anymore. She popped out of bed and quickly stripped out of her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself straight on, then in profile. They were definitely larger. But how much? Had the repeat reading of the story worked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling one of her 32Cs from the dresser, she put it on, pulling her breasts into the cups and wiggling the bra a bit until it fit her as best it could. The bottom of the bra pushed out from her ribcage by at least half an inch, and there was a slight bulge of flesh over the top of the cups. Yesterday morning there had been room to spare. Now? She needed a D cup and could probably fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full cup size in a single day. The second reading of <i>Chelsea's Charming Chest</i> must have worked! She could read a story multiple times and increase the effect! Kat licked her lips, eyes darting to the book on her desk, as she considered the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror with a critical eye. It was impossible not to notice her hair first. It looked as if the early morning sun had been captured spilled over her head, fracturing its brilliant rays into ringlets of fire that cascaded down her toned shoulders and back. The gorgeous mass shifted in a serpentine wave with every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kat mused that if nothing else, the book had probably given her a future career in hair commercials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge, aquamarine eyes framed by bold, coppery lashes stripped the smile from Kat's face, causing her to let out her breath slowly. Her eyes were dazzling. When had that happened? With the myriad changes to her body, she hadn't properly appreciated quite how captivating her eyes had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA perfect complexion, carved cheekbones, and a pert nose kept her youthful look but gave it a new air of elegance. Lush, dark magenta lips pursed as she visually explored her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dramatically feminine shape of her voluptuous breasts effortlessly drew the eye to her womanly chest, especially as the line of her body drew to her taut, tiny waist. Ample hips, a supple derriere, and lean, coltish legs rounded out the athletic but curvaceous contours of her alluring form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts may not be quite as large as Angelica's but they were not far off now. The rest of her was now a pretty fair match, other than a couple of inches of height. And her hair was far superior to that of the blonde bitch. It might be superior to any model's at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling darkly, Kat thought of the day her appearance would be superior in every way to that of her rival. It was not, now, far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat rifled through the clothes in her closet. What could she wear to further accentuate her ascending beauty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled on a green scoop-neck skater dress to accent her eyes, show off her larger breasts, and put her now-proper ballerina legs on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping it on, she struggled to get it over her new cleavage, its tightness pulling her breasts up and together. It made for an impressive look. Hell, they looked pretty close to Angelica's when bulging out of the undersized neckline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cinched the thin belt into her tight tummy, then executed a quick pirouette, her skirt flowing over luscious thighs. Yes, this was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put in matching emerald earrings, squirted three puffs of perfume on her neck and wrists, then stepped into her black Mary Jane flats. She was ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very nearly Angelica's equal, but that wouldn't cause her to shy away in her war with the evil witch. The taller girl had fired salvo after vicious salvo at Kat. It was time that Kat returned fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vanessa stood to her left, snickering. Angelica to her right with a broad smile. Both dropped her empty bucket to clatter on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly water-resistant eyeliner and mascara streamed into Kat\u2019s eyes, stinging and burning them red. Her vibrant, shimmering hair, so beautiful when she had primped it in the mirror this morning, hung in stringy tentacles over her eyes. She blinked furiously, eyes tearing up ostensibly from the makeup, but more truly from the shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she have walked right into <i>this</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, her rivals had stripped her of her newfound confidence in the span of a heartbeat. She was right back to her pre-book, mousy self. She pulled the curtain of soaked hair away from her eyes to see the two girls prancing in delight at her misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment and humiliation turned to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat screamed and lunged for Angelica. The beautiful blonde\u2019s eyes widened in shock as Kat drove her to the wall, small fingers clenching wads of fabric in each hand. Kat slammed the stunned girl into the wall several times before hands reached around her and pulled her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling against the hands, Kat saw nothing but red. The color was both figurative and literal this time, her dripping hair whipping splatters of water all around her during the struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her surge of anger faded, she watched Angelica don the cloak of the victim, performing exaggerated sobs and pointing at Kat. Two teachers came to her aid, rubbing her shoulders to console her. Kat rolled her eyes, when she heard Vanessa behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just an accident. Angelica and I were just doing our duty with the National Honor Society to clean the school windows when Angie slipped and accidentally splashed some water on Kat. We tried to apologize, but Kat just went crazy and started attacking Angelica. It was only an <i>accident!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard overacted sniffles and sobs burst from Vanessa as well. Hearing the concerned reactions of the teachers, she knew that this battle was lost. She began to feel the hollow regret that came with allowing anger to consume her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for being ready to fight back. She had just been resoundingly defeated by the unlikely alliance of her two rivals. With both of their words\u2014and acting chops\u2014against hers, she didn\u2019t stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a less than pleasant conversation with the principal, Kat walked sullenly home, knowing she would have to deal with her mother, who would be the supremely unhappy recipient of an email from the school\u2019s administrator informing her of Kat\u2019s three-day suspension for fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home, Kat flopped on her bed and pulled her pillow over her head. This day had started so promisingly! At some point, she dozed off, because she awoke to loud, urgent knocking on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou open this door NOW, young lady!\u201d came her mother\u2019s voice. Kat considered leaving it locked to avoid her mother\u2019s wrath, but she knew that would only make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slunk over to her bedroom door and opened it. Her mom, red-faced, steam coming out of each ear, stormed in, brushing right past Kat before she whirled and pointed at her daughter with a trembling finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but I will not stand for it, Kat!\u201d her mother\u2019s voice shook with fury. \u201cFighting! At school! That is NOT how I raised you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat hung her head, knowing tears would be coming soon. Her mother breathed out in a growl and began to pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve gone so wrong! I thought things were going <i>well!</i> Your ballet instructor told me she was impressed with your progress. You joined the choir. You\u2019ve been doing <i>so well</i>. Then THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surge of anger quivered her mother\u2019s lips, but the older woman kept an icy calmness this time\u2014 the only thing worse than the yelling. Kat felt the first of the tears roll down her face, along the side of her nose. She tasted salt as it ran over her mouth. She couldn\u2019t meet her mother\u2019s furious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to do with you, Kat. What. Should. I. Do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat opened her mouth to speak, but the lump in her throat wouldn\u2019t allow it. She couldn\u2019t make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to be angry at Angelica and Vanessa. She thought that might be able to get her through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t even muster the desire to be angry with them right now. She felt so guilty about putting her mother through this. How had she let them win like this? How had she lost her cool so completely? Her mother was right. It <i>had</i> been her fault. She could have responded in many different ways to their bullying, and she had chosen the worst possible option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would not happen again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Kat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother began to cry, walking toward her and giving her a gentle hug, all anger evaporating with the gesture. The older woman and her daughter shook as they cried in each other\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat looked in the mirror at the results of her handiwork. She had spent her suspension reading each story in the book again, and within the span of three days at her magnified rate of growth, she had become truly breathtaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had wanted to be more beautiful than Angelica, and she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still a few inches shorter, but in every other respect, she was now either superior or <i>far</i> superior to her rival. A serious expression gracing her flawless complexion, seductive, sensual eyes studied the magnificent image in the mirror. Her skin seemed to glow, radiating health and vitality. She wouldn\u2019t need foundation any longer. It could only detract from her beauty now. Her pink lips beckoned to be kissed. She could feel the appeal herself\u2014it was difficult to imagine what someone else must feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were full and lush, barely contained in her new 32DDD bra, her arms willowy but toned and defined. Her slender waist was packed with firm muscle, sexy lines engraved down their length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to view her profile, the curvaceous bulges of her calves clenched and released with the movement. Her ass divine in its voluptuous swells from the curve of her lower back before tapering into slim, polished thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression severe, fluffing her sumptuously shimmering copper mane, her slender, feminine fingers lost in its vibrant mass, she considered whether she was as beautiful as the women in swimsuit magazines. As she contemplated, she revised the question to how much <i>more</i> beautiful she was than the women in those magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her plump lips remained frozen in a slight frown. She was bent on standing up to the two girls that had ambushed her and dented her already rocky relationship with her mother. Until she got some measure of revenge, she would not smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat?\u201d came her mother\u2019s voice from outside her closed bedroom door. \u201cYou have a visitor\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s frown deepened. Visitor? Who could that be? Jess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a robe and pulled the door open. Her mom stood behind Rick, who stood there with a small stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I brought you your assignments for the days you were gone,\u201d he said, punctuating it with an audible gulp as his eyes darted to her vivid eyes then away several times, as if afraid to lose himself in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that nice of him?\u201d commented Kat\u2019s mom. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to catch up,\u201d she said with a quick smile, then turned and descended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat let Rick inside, her cognitive wheels turning as he brushed past her. She closed the door and nearly gave him a forbidden smile as her eyes lit with the plan that was forming in her mind. Rick had been Angelica\u2019s symbolic conquest, stripping Kat of the potential for blossoming love on Valentine\u2019s Day. Rick had been her way of showing Kat she could have whatever she wanted of Kat\u2019s most valued possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick wasn\u2019t a possession, and she didn\u2019t want to view him that way, but if he had dropped his interest in her at the flutter of a prettier girl\u2019s eyelashes, then turnabout was fair play, wasn\u2019t it? Besides if he were originally interested in her, but drawn to the most attractive woman around, he should be doubly satisfied if he had both at once. She didn\u2019t believe he would have any complaints about what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Game on,</i> she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so considerate of you, Rick,\u201d Kat said, putting her dulcet, seductive voice to work in a soft purr. She saw a visible tremor run through him at the sound and gave a soft smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoosening the tie on the robe, she approached him slowly, running her fingers down his arm until they clasped the papers he held. Her eyes never left his as she set them on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I repay you the favor?\u201d she said as her robe fell open to reveal her luscious, scantily-clad form. She watched with satisfaction as his eyes drifted downward, widening along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a growing girl,\u201d she said, fingertips rising along his arm once more as she did her absolute best to seduce the young man with what she\u2019d seen on movies and television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d she said coquettishly. \u201cDo you like my <i>new developments?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be a little much, but she was new to this kind of thing, and, with the way he was looking at her, she was gaining confidence in her sex appeal by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so Rick wasn\u2019t at his most eloquent right now. But that was a good thing, right? Kat slipped off the rest of the robe, putting her whole, delicious body on display, aside from bra and panties. She gave him a meaningful look before marching over to her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous day, she had bought an evening gown that fit her, just in case the occasion presented itself. And it had. It was a black, floor-length gown with a long slit, almost to the hip, and a single shoulder cut. Both sexy and sophisticated, she had been hoping to wear it to the spring formal next week as part of her plan\u2026 of course, by then, it may not fit her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it would impress Rick, though, and she intended to make a show of putting it on. She slipped it off the hanger, turned to face him, and, watching his roaming eyes, unzipped the back, stepped into it, then shimmied the tight fabric slowly over her swaying, supple hips. She pulled the single shoulder over her toned flesh, walked toward him, and turned. She gathered her thick, ginger tresses and splashed them over a svelte shoulder. She looked over the other shoulder, eyes meeting those of the speechless boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind?\u201d she asked, flicking her eyes down to her back as she twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d said Rick, too entranced by her show to understand what she was indicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZip me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh. Right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out a trembling hand and raised the zipper deliberately upward until it reached her sculpted upper back. When she heard it stop, Kat whirled around, brushing her large breasts against his arm and chest with the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d she said, before giving him a big hug\u2014and pressing as much of her sinuous body against him as she could. His arms timidly snaked behind her before pulling her even more tightly toward him. As they released the hug, Kat commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm. You\u2019ve been working out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt one of his biceps and broadened her smile, watching beads of sweat appear on his forehead. She backed up and twirled, putting her pirouette skills from ballet to use. As she finished, she placed her hands on her hips, eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think? Will this make a good dress for the spring dance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be attempting to speak, but no words were coming out. Kat decided to help him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, if you asked me to the dance, would you be pleased to have me on your arm wearing this?\u201d She gave him a long-lashed wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d he croaked. \u201cOh, yes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased, she gave a little hop, then twirled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think? Wouldn\u2019t you like to go with me, Ricky? I don\u2019t think Angelica can fill out a dress quite like this, can she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no... I mean yes! I mean no about Angelica, and, uh, yes about going. To the dance, I mean.\u201d came the raspy, flustered response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat clapped her hands together, again hoping she wasn\u2019t overdoing it, and hugged him again. Mission accomplished. It was time for Angelica to experience life in <i>her</i> wake for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to go with you. Thanks again for the assignments! See you at school tomorrow!\u201d she said before walking the hormone-addled boy out of her bedroom and shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile, mostly just an act for her target, instantly evaporated as she recalculated her plans to get even with Angelica and Vanessa.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her two tormentors were unlikely to rest on their laurels, and after her suspension the school authorities where likely to blame her for any fighting that happened. She would just have to be the bigger woman. In one sense, that was already more than true. The DDD-cup (aka F-cup) bras her mother had bought for her the day before were already visibly too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat spotted her friend over by the lockers and went over to her, \"Hey Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess turned and saw her red headed friend towering over her. It wasn't long ago that the two girls had stood eye to eye, but now Kat was a head taller than the shorter Jess, putting her intimidating bust right at eye level. Jess goggled at the way her once scrawny friend filled out her tight jeans and t-shirt. It was a pretty casual outfit, but the girl wearing it turned it into an erotic costume. \"Hi Kat.\" She said. *I wish I had gotten a monster growth spurt like her. She's the hottest girl in the school now.* She thought to her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didja miss me?\" Kat gave a heart-melting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I wonder if she knows she's that good looking?* Jess thought to herself. \"Of course. Now that you're back, maybe we can ban together against Angelica and Vanessa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have they been giving you trouble?\" Kat asked in concern. She had to protect her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we join you?\" Kevin heard a melodious voice ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and saw Kat and Jess standing behind him. His eyes skimmed over Jess, dismissing her as a nerd at the bottom of the social heap, but they locked on to Kat's fiery mane and voluptuous body. \"Sure.\" Replied the football player. He knew that there was some tension between his girlfriend Vanessa and Kat, but he figured he owed any girl with a body like hers a conversation at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them chatted awkwardly for a few minutes, but the conversation picked up when a handful of Rick's teammates walked by and Kat called out for them to pull up chairs. All of them found reasons to spend some time with the gorgeous red head. Their obvious enthusiasm for anything she had to say soon gave Kat a bit more confidence and it wasn't long before she was flirting lightly with the whole lot of them. The conversation turned to cheerleaders and Kat said, \"I've never really thought of doing it before, but it does sound kind of fun. I'm a dancer, so I bet there is a lot of crossover. What do you think boys, would I look good in a uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kevin and the rest enthusiastically replied, Vanessa and Angelica came up to the group. \"Kevin, what are you doing with her?\" Vanessa snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you guys want to join us?\" Kat made a big show of looking around, \"I don't think there is enough space.\" It was true, the football players had really crowded in to get to talk to the new and improved Kat, \"Sorry.\" She said, giving a cute little pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's blood boiled, \"Come on Kevin.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin reddened and started to get up, \"You just going to let her order you around like that?\" Kat taunted, \"She's your girlfriend, not your owner.\" One of his teammates mimed cracking a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's jaw muscle twitched. \"Sorry Vanessa, I'm having fun hanging out with the team. I'm staying here.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa and Angelica turned and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school that day Kat was ecstatic. She had finally put those bitches in their place! She started to get worried when she remembered their trick with the water. They were willing to get quite nasty. Maybe being miles hotter than them wouldn't be enough. She needed to be able to win against them both if things got physical. If only there was a story that could help her with that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something about that motion seemed change the stories available because all the titles shifted when her finger got halfway down the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first story was called \"Wendy's Wondrous Wardrobe\". Kat smiled, \"Well, I bet that will make it easier to find stuff that fits.\" She said, cupping her rip breasts. She began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wendy was always wondering what it would be like to wear the most wondrous clothes. When she wandered westward she was want to wile away her days watching wanton ladies. Wendy wanted to wear wonders...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was about a girl with such an obsession with pretty and sexy clothes that she discovered and cast a spell on herself which allowed her to transform her clothes at will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat put the book down and looked in the mirror. She focused on her too-tight bra and watched in delight as it loosened enough to fit her almost perfectly. She kind of like the way her breasts looked when they were bulging up over the top of the garment, so she left it a little tight on purpose. \"Awesome.\" She breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ability would have been great to have when the other girls soaked her. She could have just willed her clothes dry, or ducked into the bathroom and pretend that she had brought a change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shifted out outfit rapidly between a collection of dresses, skirts, tops, and pants, admiring her full figure in each one of the different outfits. As she shifted outfits she had a delicious idea. She wondered how Angelica would feel about playing a never-ending game of who wore it better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could not wait for 1st period to show off in from of Angelica.  Suddenly, a look of fear became scrawled across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God!  I forgot we have a test in Geometry first period!\u201d With all the excitement of the book, Kat had completely forgotten all about the test as well as her tenuous A- grade in the class.  A bad grade on the test, and Kat could be facing her first high school <i>B</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless\u2026\u201d Kat whispered with a grin as she turned to spy the Burgeoning Book on her bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful leap, Kat crashed onto her bed and opened the book, rapidly turning to the index page.  Biting her lower lip, Kat traced her finger down the list, the stories titles magically reconfiguring to another new set of tales.  She grinned like the cat who ate the canary as her fingertip paused next to a new story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that should do nicely!\u201d Kat said aloud as she began to read <u>Isabel\u2019s Invigorating Intelligence</u>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Isabel, irritated that her inexperience and innocence implied ignorance, often itched to increase her intermediate IQ.  In fact, she intermittently intimated to individuals that invigorating intelligence would be incredible..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s body shivered with excitement as she read the tale of a young farmer\u2019s daughter who wished upon a star one night and became a genius inventor who designed all kinds of crazy gadgets to save the family farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat closed the book, she felt a slight tingle, almost like a static shock. Almost instantly, she felt...different. Everything was suddenly clearer to her. More organized in her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, she grabbed her Geometry book and turned to a random page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalculate the median of an equilateral triangle with sides equal to 2 times the square root of 3 over 3....  Easy!  That\u2019s one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s mouth was agape as she tried to suppress her laughter. She didn\u2019t even think about it.  She just knew it.  Instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to another page, she repeated the exercise.  \u201cIn triangle ABC, the measure of angle A is x^2 + 2, angle B is 2x + 4, angle C is 3x + 124.  What are the measures of each angle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat blinked her eyes and smiled, her neurons firing at light speed, as she said the answer aloud without even pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty-seven, Fourteen, and One Twenty-Nine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t bother looking at her answer key.  She knew she was right.  Kat giggled as she spied her calculator and typed in 12674.5633 randomly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne hundred twelve point five eight one three six three zero two two four\u201d she whispered nonchalantly as she bit her lower lip and pressed the square root function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s flashed a predatory grin as she read the same digits she recited verbatim.  That was the final test...she was now a freaking genius!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s new super-enhanced mind raced at the new possibilities.  She could now ace her Geometry test tomorrow.  Heck, she might even be able to ace all her tests without even studying.  And even better, she could now challenge Angelica to be the class valedictorian.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat flopped back onto the bed and clutched the book tightly to her bountiful chest.  She couldn\u2019t wait for school tomorrow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even so, she felt too excited to go to bed quite yet. Maybe she could read just one more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the index and saw a story called Felicity's Freakish Flexibility. Kat dropped into a split, or tried to. She was nearly able to make it, but there were still a few inches to spare. Her dancing had already made her pretty flexible, so she wondered what she would be able to do after she read this next story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Felicity found few feelings more fallow than following her friend Fen on stage. Her fellow contortionist formed fantastic shapes with her fit frame. Felicity practiced for fourteen full...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was about a contortionist who, driven by competitiveness, pushed herself to every greater feats of flexibility until she could cross her legs behind her back beneath her arms, stuff herself into a tiny barrel, and fold her spine backwards at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished reading Kat felt her whole body tingle for a moment.  \"Ok, that was weird.\" She said. She wasn't sure she needed to be able to sit on her head, but she had a feeling that she would be able to in a few days. \"I guess flexibility is sexy?\" She said, standing up and dropping into a split. This time she had no trouble at all. \"It will make me a better dancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I really should get to bed.* If she kept reading, it wouldn't matter how pretty the book had made her, she would look like a zombie the next day. Still, Kat couldn't help but feel excited to have found a whole new set of stories to read, especially because they seemed to be about giving her new abilities and talents. A few weeks ago Kat never would have thought that she would feel pretty enough, but now she was pretty confident that she checked the box of hottest girl in the school and was well on her way to being the hottest girl in the world. It was good to diversify her amazingness. But first she had to go to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His body language was closed off and he kept taking little half-steps away from her as she walked him down. Her full breasts were thrust right under his face, but he didn't seem to be paying them any attention. Her makeup was caked on thickly, giving her a desperate appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat approached them, taking particular note of Angelica's outfit.  She wore a pair of tight white short shorts and a tight red blouse that exposed a few inches of cleavage. With a thought, Kat morphed the clothes under her long trench coat to exactly match Angelica's.  Of course, shorts that were tight on Angelica's ass were stretched to semi-translucence over Kat's divine derri\u00e8re and a top that showed off Angelica's DD cups looked criminally tiny on Kat's G-cups. \"Hey guys, how's it going?\" Kat asked cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost-\" Angelica started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Kat cut her off, \"You won't believe it Angelica, but we're wearing the same thing!\" Kat said, opening her coat to show the other girl. \"That is too funny!\" She gave a fake giggle.  Turning to Rick as she took off her coat she said, \"What do you think Rick? Who wears it better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked back and forth between the two girls. Angelica had been the hottest girl in the school for as long as he could remember, but she still looked like a person you might actually encounter in everyday life. Kat now looked somehow more. She still wasn't quite as tall as Angelica, but the way her hair cascaded down around her shoulders in a fiery waterfall or her breathtaking face alone would have been enough to make her the hottest girl in the school, and her body was just unreal. The top looked hot on Angelica. On Kat it looked sexy enough that Rick doubted he would think of anything else while he masturbated for at least six months. Letting his eyes wander down to their waists he thought that Angelica's was the kind of waist that boys would lust after and other girls would envy, but Kat's was the kind that demanded instant attention. That held true for their hips and legs as well. Kat was just better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, you Kat.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat covered her mouth in mock horror, \"Oh no, you aren't supposed to actually tell us what you think! It's just supposed to be a joke.\" She laughed. Angelica didn't seem to think it was funny. Instead of laughing along, she just stared resentfully at Kat's heavy breasts as they jiggled hypnotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This is so unfair.* Angelica thought *How can that nerd have a growth spurt and end up with better tits, better hair, a better ass, a hotter waist, and a sexier voice?* \"I-I have to go.\" She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick finally realized that Kat was deliberately trying to humiliate Angelica, and that she was using him to do it. He didn't like being used, but then again he was pretty sure that Kat had a good reason for it. He also found, to his surprise, that watching Kat humiliate Angelica was turning him on. After Angelica had left he said, \"Wow, what did she do to you to make you go all Alpha Bitch on her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat laughed, \"Alpha Bitch. I like that.\" She smiled at him, \"Telling you everything she's done to me would take far too long, but let's just say I have my reasons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat went about the rest of her day happily. She had always been a fantastic student, but now her schoolwork was so effortless that she had finished all of her homework for each class before class was even over. She finished an English essay while being an active participant in a discussion over the reading, appearing to be doodling as she was actually writing up a brilliant analysis. The limiting factor for her math homework was her writing speed. *I wonder if I can boost my dexterity.* She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, she went back home and immediately went back up to her room to take out the book. She had plenty of time before bed, and her recent intelligence boost had given her a much faster reading speed, so she expected to be able to finish a lot of stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat story does she read next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she hadn't read<br>\r\nIsabel's Invigorating Intelligence already, she wasn't sure she would<br>\r\nhave been able to handle all of the new sensations, but she quickly<br>\r\nlearned to incorporate them into her existence.

She was NOT going to be the shortest of the three sisters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the family finished eating, and their mother and father began to clean up the table, Lisa followed Jessica up the stairs. Lisa tried to follow Jessica into her room, but Jessica shoved her away and quickly closed and locked her door. Jessica stumbled back, unaccustomed to her formerly tiny little sister being able to do that to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t push me around anymore, Lisa! I\u2019m not a <i>dwarfling</i> any more. I\u2019m bigger than you, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me!\u201d Jessica said mockingly from the safety of her locked room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa growled and, fuming, went to her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica opened the book again. Every page was still blank. No more stories. Then, she heard a knock at her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Megan, Jess. Do you have a minute to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica unlocked her door and opened it, allowing Megan inside. Worried that Lisa would force her way in, Jessica quickly closed and locked it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess, how on earth did you grow seven inches in one afternoon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Jessica protested. She considered whether to tell Megan about her suspicions, finally deciding that she needed to tell someone. Megan had always been her nicer sister, so Jessica decided to confide her thoughts in her. \u201cBut I think it has something to do with this book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked over to her dresser, grabbed the book, and handed it to Megan. Megan\u2019s face scrunched in curiosity, then she opened it. She leafed through the pages, seeing dozens of short stories within the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica noticed that her sister seemed to be seeing something on the pages, so she walked around to the same side as her sister, so that she could see what her sister saw\u2026 Jessica still saw blank pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe book had stories in it when I first bought it. I read one of them, then fell asleep. When I woke up, it was blank, and I was bigger!\u201d Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then the stories came back? I mean, they\u2019re here now.\u201d Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jessica said in confusion. \u201cNo they\u2019re not. The pages are still blank. Can\u2019t you see them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do see them. And they are <i>not</i> blank!\u201d Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the stories?\u201d Jessica asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You don\u2019t\u2026 even right now?\u201d Megan asked, astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan thought for a moment. \u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re right. There is definitely something about this book...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared at the book a moment more. \u201cJess, do you mind if I read one of the stories in here, and see if what happened to you happens to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, still looking at what appeared to her to be blank pages, said, \u201cSure! I can\u2019t seem to use it again for now, at least. If you grow too, we\u2019ll know that the book was really what caused it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan took the book back to her room, and began to flip through the stories. What did she want to read\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she found it. The story was called:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Belinda and the Burgeoning Bustline</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan read for fifteen minutes to the end of the story. She walked over to the mirror, trying to gauge her height. She didn\u2019t think that she was any taller. Maybe it took a minute. Then she felt something in her chest. She looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Megan said aloud in a soft voice, as her breasts began to expand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa opened her bedroom door. She was going to talk to Megan. By her calculations, she and Megan needed to figure out how Jessica grew so much in one afternoon! She was <i>NOT</i> going to stand for her little sister shoving her around. This had to change <i>RIGHT NOW</i>, she decided. The balance of power between the sisters had shifted, and she didn't like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked over to Megan's room and peered through the doorway. She saw Megan in front of the mirror, and did a double take. Her sister's breasts were <i>growing before her eyes!</i> Lisa's jaw dropped. Megan's A-cup breasts became Bs, going from small bumps in her t-shirt to aesthetically pleasing swells. They continued to push the cotton fabric further away from her body as they grew, filling out to curvaceous Cs as the hooks on the back of her bra bent and snapped. Still, her breasts grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's breasts finally stopped at voluptuous D-cups. She pulled off her shirt to get a better look. Her modest bumps were now stunning swells of feminine flesh, jutting proudly in front of her still relatively small body. She slid the broken, outclassed bra off her shoulders and onto the floor. These things were amazing! Full and firm, they were perfect hemispheres on her 5'4\" frame. She turned slightly to each side to admire her beautiful new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt jealousy surge within her. First, Jessica grew taller than her. Now, Megan passes her in bust size? Her B-cups had been a source of pride, the largest of the three sisters. Now, however, they looked insignificant and vastly inferior to those of her older sister. Lisa realized with horror that she was the smallest and possibly the least developed of all three sisters! How was this happening?!? She needed to learn their secret. She needed to be better than her sisters. She <i>had</i> to figure this out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's eyes scanned the room. What was new? What was different? Finally, they landed on the book. It was a large, leather-bound tome that she didn't remember seeing before. She thought back. Wasn't that the same book that she had seen Jessica place on her dresser when Jessica had arrived home today. Lisa was fairly certain that it was. That book must be doing this! She had to get her hands on the thing. She needed her body to surpass those of her sisters again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Megan to notice her, Lisa slipped quietly away from her doorway and back to her room. She plotted what she would do to get the book back after her older sister had fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after Jessica, Megan, and her parents were fast asleep, Lisa remained away, biding her time staring at the ceiling in her room. She listened for sounds through the wall in Megan's room next door that might indicate that her sister was awake. Hearing nothing for a good hour, she decided that it was time. She slipped out of bed and crept quietly to the hallway. She approached Megan's room and quietly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hinge on the door squeaked! She stopped, cursing silently. After a moment, she pushed the door open a bit more. Then a bit more. Finally, she pushed it open enough to slip through. She darted quietly into her sister's room. Her eyes struggled to see in the darkness, but they saw her sister's now-curvaceous form in the bed, under the blankets, eyes closed. Whew! She looked to Megan's desk. The book was still there. Good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crept to the desk and slid the book slowly into her hands. Clutching the book, she crept back out of Megan's room and quietly closed her door. She went back to her own room and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping onto her bed, she opened the book and flipped through its pages. In the middle, she glanced down at her body several times as she leafed through the book, but nothing seemed to be changing. Maybe she had to read a story? She turned the page to the start of one of the short stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Long-Legged Lucy</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to read. Shen she finished the story, she glanced down at her body again. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Her legs began to feel tingly. She watched her bare legs with fascination as she felt them begin to grow. They grew longer, shaplier, more muscular, smoother, sexier. She watched four inches of luscious length grow, making her already short pajama boxers look tiny as they revealed more and more of her polished upper thighs. Her calves were firm and curved. Her new legs looked as if she had played soccer and danced ballet for the past five years to sculpt them into perfect feminine form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smirked in satisfaction, as she thought of the short skirts she would be wearing to show them off. Her smirk turned beatific as she thought of how she was going to rub her new, superior height and gorgeous gams into Jessica's face in the morning. If she could just match Megan's new breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked in the book again, but she frowned as she realized that all of the pages were now blank. Could she only use the book once? Would it recharge at some point? She didn't know. But she would definitely find out. She took the book and put it in the top drawer of her dresser, piling clothes above and around it until it was completely hidden. Then, she went back to her bed and fell asleep, thoughts of showing off in tantalizing short skirts in front of the cutest boys at school coloring her dreams.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa woke up and rushed to the mirror. Yes! Her long, sinuous legs were just as long and sexy as they had been last night. She showered and dressed, putting on a black spaghetti strap tank and a bright red mini that ended at creamy upper thigh. The skirt had been short when she bought it at her previous 5'3\" height. On her leggy 5'7\" frame, it was scandalously so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her look in the mirror, she went down to breakfast, eager to show off her new height and legs to her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached, Jessica's eyes grew wide, traveling up to meet those of her sister. \"How did you?\" Then, her look turned knowing. \"So <i>you</i> took the book from Megan's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, dwarfling! You were shorter than me before, and you're shorter than me now, thanks to these endless and sexy legs of mine. You might be a little taller, but not taller than me. And certainly not as sexy either!\" With that Lisa, shoved her B-cup breasts into Jessica's AAs and knocked her back to her seat at the breakfast table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you sexy,\" came a voice from behind her. Megan had appeared in a scoop-neck skater dress, showing off acres of luscious cleavage. \"I see that you're the one who stole my book, <i>Lisa</i>,\" she sneered as she said her sister's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your</i> book? It's <i>my</i> book! I bought it!\" Jessica chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what you guys are talking about,\" Lisa huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. Jessica ran to get it. It was Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Jess...\" she trailed off. \"Are you... <i>bigger</i>?\" she asked before she could think better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jessica said with a giggle. \"I have something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked over to Megan and whispered something in her ear, while Lisa sat down to eat breakfast, smoothing out the skirt that had risen to dangerous levels on her silky upper thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica circled to one side of Lisa, Megan to the other. Suddenly both of them pounced. Megan held her right arm and right shoulder, forcing her down on the chair. Megan did the same on her left. Jessica called over to Emily. \"Em, I can't explain everything right now, but Lisa stole a book from us, a book that help us all grow. It made me bigger, Megan bustier, and Lisa leggier. Once we read the story and changed, though, the stories disappeared. Anyway, I need you to search Lisa's room while we hold her down. Get the book. You can read a story from it and grow too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked shocked. She was certainly not expecting all of this when she came over to her friends house to walk to the mall! She took it all in, though, and nodded at Jessica. She dropped her bag and ran up the stairs to enter Lisa's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around. She didn't see a book anywhere. She opened the drawers of Lisa's desk, looked in her closet, then began opening her dresser drawers one at a time. She rifled around in each, finally finding the book amongst Lisa's tops in the top drawer of her dresser. She pulled it out and flipped it open. There was an extremely short one-page story. She knew that her friends were holding their sister downstairs and that she needed to hurry, but the story was only one page long. She wanted to see if it would change her as it changed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Tess and the Transforming Tube</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's eyes scanned the lines of the story to the finish. She looked down at her body. Had it transformed? It didn't seem like it. She walked over to Lisa's mirror. No changes as far as she could tell. As she looked in the mirror, however, she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. She looked toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a human-sized semicircular glass tube in the corner of Lisa's room. The front side was open, but the back half was a half-circle of glass. The air inside seemed to sparkle with pink and silver flashes, as if someone had flung glitter inside with a fan at the bottom keeping it afloat in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at the tube in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the quick thumping of feet running up the stairs and turned to see who was coming up. Lisa must have escaped from the other girls, as she was the first to arrive back in her room. The other sisters, however, arrived right behind her. All of them instantly noticed the tube and stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is <i>that</i>?\" Lisa asked in wonder and she slowly walked toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I read a story,\" said Emily, walking toward the tube herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it made that thing?\" said Megan. \"It didn't do anything like that for us. It just changed our bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, having reached the tube now, ran her fingers along the outside of the glass. Should she go inside it like the girl in the story had? The girl in the story had grown cat ears and a tail! She didn't want that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt a hand on her back pushing her forward into the tube. She whirled as she felt a strange tingling sensation all over her body. Lisa had pushed her into the cylinder where the sparkling air swirled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily watched the three sisters gasp as she felt something happening to her body. She jumped out of the tube and ran back to Lisa's mirror. She was a couple of inches taller, but that was the least of the changes. Her body was ripped! She looked like an Olympic gymnast, with striations of muscle popping and disappearing all over her body as she moved. She jumped up and rose two feet into the air! These muscles weren't just for show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is going to make cheerleading so much easier,</i> she thought. She couldn't wait to show the cheer squad her new abilities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned from Emily to the tube and stepped into it also. The other three girls watched, as her ebony hair grew longer, thicker, fuller. Now, she had a long, luxuriant mane to match her long, sexy legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Megan looked at each other, both silently wondering what the tube might do to them and trying to decide whether they wanted to risk it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica steeled her nerves. She was bigger than she used to be, but she was back to being shorter than her other two sisters. Only an inch shorter than Megan, but several inches shorter than long-legged Lisa. She decided to risk the tube. Before she could think better of it, she entered the tube. The sparkling light bathed her body, and she felt her face changing. Her throat felt different as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily squealed in delight for her friend. Lisa scowled. Megan looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? What happened?\" asked Jessica, instantly noticing that her voice had changed. Where it had previously been high and squeaky, it was still a high soprano. However, it was rich and melodic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did my voice change?\" Jessica asked her friend and sisters, but it was already clear that it had. Emily stared at her while she nodded. Megan still just looked stunned and didn't say anything. Lisa just looked angry at her sister receiving more gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica began to sing a few bars of Mozart's <i>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</i> that the choir was going to be performing this year at school. Her voice was amazing--clear, brilliant, and beautiful. She stopped singing and broke into a delighted giggle. She couldn't wait to audition for parts this year! She would get Pamina for sure! The best singers in the choir had always made fun of her for her squeaky, scratchy voice. Those days were over now! <i>Eat your heart out, girls!</i> she thought. <i>My voice is better than any of yours now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a broad smile, she skipped over to the mirror to see if anything else had changed. She was quite certain there were some physical changes as well, since the other girls had reacted before she had said anything. She looked at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body looked the same, but her face had become beautiful. Maybe not quite gorgeous, but far beyond what she was used to seeing in her reflection. Her cheekbones were pronounced, causing her cheeks to sweep inward a little. It gave her face a refined air. Her eyes were larger, their brown color deepening to a rich, dark chocolate color. Their almond shape and arching eyebrows made them expressive and riveting. Her lips had puffed up a bit too, going from thin to full. Her teeth seemed whiter, straigher, her nose seemed upturned and slightly smaller. She couldn't believe it. She was pretty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan watched her youngest sister admiring her now-alluring features in the mirror and turned her attention back to the tube. She decided she would risk the changes, whatever they might be. She walked toward the tube. She just hoped it didn't take away her wonderful new breasts. She was really proud of them now and didn't want to give them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan approached the tube, Lisa suddenly moved, lunging toward her older sister and shoving her out of the way, shoulder first. Megan slammed into the wall from the force of Lisa's shove and watched Lisa enter the tube again instead. The other girls watched as Lisa's breasts grew and her overall size waned. Her legs remained proportionately long and sexy. Her hair was still full, thick, and gorgeous, but she looked as if a magnifying glass were flipped backward. The same, just smaller. Except for her breasts, that is. Those swelled in proportion to her smaller frame, filling in with firm, well-formed flesh until they were even larger than Megan's, at least in proportion to her petite 4'9\" body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Lisa, you're tiny! Now your'e the dwarfling!\" Jessica said, with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your body is amazing!\" said Megan, looking over her sister's proportionately long, shapely legs and full, dynamic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't know what to think. She was happy for the huge breasts, but she was a good seven inches shorter than her other sister's now. She wasn't going to be able to shove Megan or Jessica around any more. She had a better body than either of her sisters now, though her face was not a match for Jessica's newly improved visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you two can only dream of having my sexy bod,\" Lisa said, trying to satisfy herself with that as she looked up at all the other girls that now towered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You're a very pretty little midget!\" said Jessica, beginning to laugh. Emily laughed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa scowled as anger at being mocked rose within her. She thought about going into the tube for a third time, weighing the possible risks with the possible rewards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had always been fascinated by the idea of girls growing more developed and prettier, and the book seems to have a number of those types of stories in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made him think of his relationship with Emma. She was a year older than her was, the same age as Emma's sister Emily. Maybe that had doomed the romance from the start. Emma had been small and underdeveloped like Emily when they had first started dating, but over the course of that year, she had grown five inches from 4'11\" to 5'4\". Her face had cleared and grown prettier as it matured. Her breasts had bloomed into nice B-cups. She had been promoted from the JV to varsity cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had loved every moment of it--Emma's development. However, once he had become accustomed to the pride of having a pretty girlfriend on his arm, she had dumped him and leveraged her new beauty to replace him with Tad, the running back on the football team. Jake was still bitter about it. He had never seen it coming, though in retrospect, he should have. When he had been over at her house, she had seemed less and less interested in him over the course of the year. He had actually spent more time with Emily and her friends than with Emma by the last month of their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and her friends were in his grade, and he shared various classes with them in school. All of them were even smaller than Emma had been before she had developed in her junior year. He hoped that they would see the same kind of growth that Emma had over the course of the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake arrived at home and went to his room to check out his new leather-bound acquisition. Leafing through the stories, they all seemed pretty interesting to him. He set the book down and resolved to read the first short story tonight before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, he was supposed to join some other friends and play the latest coop video game. He sat down in front of the TV and grabbed his controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, in his pajamas, Jake climbed into bed and grabbed the book. Turning the knob on his lamp, he set the book on his chest and began to read.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat arrived at ballet class the next morning. During the summer, she and her classmates had morning classes. They would switch to evenings during the school year. It was likely because their instructor, Miss Lexington, wanted to be done with work early in the day during the summer months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had woken up late that morning, barely managing to shower and get dressed before she had to hop into the car and practice driving with her mom in the passenger seat. Kat\u2019s acne had been particularly bad, her ginger hair was wet, stringy, and dripping onto her spandex dance clothes. Most of the other girls were pretty, their skin mostly clear, their hair done in buns, and their bodies developing the sleek lines and curves expected of a ballet dancer. Kat\u2019s small, ironing board body definitely didn\u2019t fit in with the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the Kat that dragged in,\u201d Rebecca said, amused by her own clever turn of phrase. Several of the other girls snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was used to this kind of thing. As the odd girl out, she was hazed by the others relentlessly during class. She said nothing and walked to her usual corner, pulling her ballet shoes out of her bag to begin putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder your sticks for legs can hold you up at all, let alone dance. Of course, that\u2019s probably why you <i>can\u2019t</i> dance, Kitty Kat,\u201d said Rebecca, trying to get rise out of Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat continued to ignore her, and Rebecca began to whisper and giggle with the other girls. Kat hoped that they weren\u2019t talking about her or plotting against her, but there really wasn\u2019t anything that she could do about it, so she tried not to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls lined up for their barre exercises. Kat finished putting on her shoes and joined them. Kat always struggled at barre, and today started as she was used to. When the girls began to practice their form and movements, however, it began to feel easier and easier to her. Plie, releve, plie, releve. Rise, lower, Rise, lower. Her legs were feeling stronger and stronger as class went on. The class moved on to practicing saute (jumping), something that Kat normally stumbled out of when her legs were tired at the end of class. Today, however, her legs didn\u2019t feel tired at all. They felt strong. She performed every saute flawlessly. When they finished with tourne (turns), Kat was smiling broadly, knowing that this was the best she had ever done. She noticed that the other girls, even Miss Lexington, were giving her confused looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of class, Kat ran over to her bag, changed her shoes, then darted out of class. She always tried to leave quickly so that the other girls didn\u2019t have a chance to pick on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped in the car with her mom, her mom looking at her phone the whole time. She drove them both home. Still feeling great from her better-than-normal performance in ballet today, she took a quick shower, wrapped a towel around herself, then went to her room to get dressed. She put on her panties and her training bra before she finally noticed something unusual. She couldn\u2019t clasp her bra in back. It was as if had shrunk\u2026 or she had grown? She turned to finally look in the mirror, something she typically tried to avoid other than when absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the small lumps on her chest. She had boobs! AA\u2019s? A\u2019s, maybe? Definitely too big for her training bra. Her eyes drifted over the rest of her body as well. She still seemed slim, with a dancer\u2019s build. However, she was looking more like Rebecca than like herself. Small breasts, a slim toned waist, slender but curvy hips. Her face even looked a bit clearer, with fewer red splotches decorating her skin. Her legs had changed the most, though. They seemed longer and more muscular. The lean legs of a real ballet dancer! She laughed as she executed one more tourne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure how this had happened during class, but she was sure happy that it had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake woke up in the mid-morning, tired from reading when he should have been sleeping last night. He had fallen asleep with the book on his chest. He lifted it up and looked at the ending sentences of the story again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe twirled and danced upon the stage, her now-beautiful form capturing the eye of the village lord. The lord courted her until they agreed to marry. And they lived happily ever after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at the cheesy ending, closed the book and went to the bathroom to get ready for the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to read <b><i>The New Dress of the Princess</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily finished up at cheer camp, with one of the other girls, Carly, making fun of her pathetic athletic ability the whole time. She ran to their car, her mom waiting for her. She hopped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright, hun?\u201d Asked Emiily\u2019s mother, sensing that her daughter was upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, mom. Sometimes I just wish I were bigger and prettier like the other girls,\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily, there will always be a bigger, prettier girl out there. You are my lovely young daughter, and I love you. Don\u2019t forget that. Things will work out as they should. It just doesn\u2019t always seem like that in high school. I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mom,\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Emily called Maria to go with her to the mall. The cheerleaders were expected to go to the homecoming dance in a few weeks, and Emily felt like looking for a dress at the mall today. Maybe it would make her feel prettier after being called short and ugly all day at cheer camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Maria met at the mall.  They decided to go the high end department store and look at the dresses there. Both girls tried on dresses, Maria, a bright red number, and Emily, a slinky black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came out of the changing room and stepped in front of the mirror and her friend, she twirled, imagining herself growing taller and more beautiful as she modeled the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s jaw dropped and eyes widened as Emily\u2019s dress expanded at the bust and rose up Emily\u2019s thigh. Emily gained about four inches of height, mostly in her longer, shapelier legs. Her breasts swelled into a nice B cup. The skin of her face cleared, and its shape improved, giving her enough of an improvement to be called cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily noticed her friend\u2019s face before she noticed the changes in the mirror as she twirled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria didn\u2019t say anything. She just pointed at Emily. Emily turned and looked at her reflection. She gasped, then smiled. Her wish! It had come true!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got boobs and legs and then the popular girls went and sucked her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie sighed. 5\u20192 and an A cup. She clearly picked the short straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie closed her locker to find her only other friend on the other side of the door. Brian. He was the only person that made Brie feel tall. He was only 5\u2019 solid and who knows if he\u2019d get much taller. He had a goofy smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see it last night?\u201d Brian asked excitedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Brie replies as she tried her best to expel out her train of thought with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe latest episode of Archie!

The rich kids all had cars and the popular kids (who were, let\u2019s be real, also mostly rich) grabbed rides with friends. Another year of budget cuts had left Brian and Brie without a bus to ride and walking home wasn\u2019t terribly feasible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian certainly didn\u2019t mind this. This was the part of the day that he had Brie all to himself. No school bells to separate them. No tall jocks for Brie to quietly side-eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely no Jillian. She had become a real piece-of-work since she got hot. Brie wasn\u2019t the only one Jillian abandoned. She never tried to make up with Brian. She just used him as a punching bag. She loved pointing out how small Brian was and how...proportional that must\u2019ve made him. Brian had been in the locker room. He certainly didn\u2019t measure up to the bigger guys down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie turned around to fetch something from her bag and Brian snapped from his trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to see this book,\u201d Brie said, her short brunette hair doing a small toss as she turned around to retrieve the book. \u201cIt\u2019s so old and ornate. Weighs a ton. I found it lying on the ground outside the track\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Brian replied, \u201cthis looks like something from a crypt. Don\u2019t read it aloud or you\u2019ll unleash the Mummy\u2019s Curse\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian flipped through the pages but was compelled towards the first story. \u201cThe Couple that Grows Together, Stays Together.\u201d There was so much of that sentiment that he wished could be true between him and Brie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s read this one!\u201d Brie said as she began to read aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl. They would grow up to be the sexiest people alive. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly Shakespeare,\u201d Brian joked. The language seemed quite strange for such a old book. Far too modern and sensual for such an old book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clearly erotic novel didn\u2019t bother of the two of them. They laughed through it all. They took turns reading the next several pages, as they learned about the growing, beautiful voluptuous woman and the man who was in love with her. As if the heavens commanded it, he began to grow more muscular, grow a cock fit for a horse, grow talle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP! BEEP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked up to see Brian\u2019s mom sitting in the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s my ride. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d Brian said as he grabbed his things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few more pages in the story,\u201d Brie protested. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to finish it with me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian shrugged and went for the car. Brie sat alone and finished the story. </span></div></div>",

She was normally a groggy sleeper and this was a strange feeling to start the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, world!\u201d Brie said to herself as she bounded out of bed. This energy was very unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie put on her glasses and looked into her mirror so she could see herself. She didn\u2019t look that bad for once. Sure, she was a little pudgy and she had no curves. But, she wasn\u2019t looking too bad today! Her hair had a little more glow than usual. Maybe it was just the sun though. Her freckles popped a little more than usual. That could\u2019ve just been from all the sun yesterday. Did her cheekbones look a little different? Or maybe her lips? Honestly, she was just seeing things at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie started getting changed and put a pair of jeans on. \u201cDamn it, shrunk in the wash,\u201d Brie sighed. \u201cMy favorite pair too.\u201d The jeans were a little short in the legs and a little snug in the butt. All good jeans come to an end, she supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came a bra. The usual A cup. She knew she could get away with going braless, but it just didn\u2019t feel proper. Bras were what made her a girl. It felt...not quite tight, but snug. It wasn\u2019t her time of the month. Maybe she was finally growing some boobs. About time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA t-shirt and socks later and Brie skipped out of her room with a smile on her face. Today was going to be a good day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was in pain. There was no other way to describe it. He woke up with his usual morning wood but this one was...different. He didn\u2019t know if he had ever been this hard in his life. It was painful, as if his dick was trying to escape from his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian inspected himself. Everything looked the same. Same, small body. Same slight pudge. Same, incredibly small cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it didn\u2019t look quite as small today. Brian was usually 2.5in long. Of course he measured. What kind of guy doesn\u2019t measure? He didn\u2019t have a micropenis, but it was close. It wasn\u2019t impressive at all. When flaccid, you couldn\u2019t really see his shaft. Today though...it looked bigger. Maybe not much bigger, but it was something. He was pretty sure it was bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian headed off to school feeling just a little more confident than his usual rock-bottom. </span></div></div>",

She playfully stomped her legs as she exaggerated her complaint to her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting it just fine,\u201d Brian teased. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do that badly on the test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays Mr. A- over here. Some of us have to work to make sure we don\u2019t fail the class,\u201d Brie retorted as she moved some of her vibrant red hair behind her ear. It was starting to get quite long. She liked keeping it right above her shoulder. Over the past month, it had grown to a couple inches below the shoulder. Her lightly wavy hair had been looking so good lately that it felt like a shame to cut it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s good at something. Maybe it\u2019s just not chemistry for you!\u201d Brian said as he shut the locker. He looked up into Brie\u2019s eyes. 4 inches. That was the difference between them. Brie had grown 2 whole inches in the last month. She moved up the ranks from short to average height at 5\u20194. And with that, she changed ranks from \u201ccomparable size with Brian\u201d to \u201cclearly taller than him\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian tried not to think about their newly diverging bodies. He didn\u2019t want to be mad at Brie. Especially for something she had no control over. But...he was frustrated. She definitely didn\u2019t need the extra height. 5\u20192 was a very acceptable height for a woman! They used to be practically the same height! \u201cNow...just ugh...how could she ever see me...\u201d Brian thought as his brain began to dwell on topics he tried to avoid thinking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear Hey There, Tuesday is having a reunion tour?\u201d Brie said filling the space as Brian zoned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. I can\u2019t wait for them to release the list of cities. I hope they\u2019ll play near us,\u201d Brian responded, jolting out of his daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie quietly fiddled with the cups on her bra as discretely as she could. It had been getting really tight. She was outgrowing a B cup. Wild. She actually had honest-to-god curves. She was probably tied with her aunt for biggest boobs in the family right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*ring*, *ring*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m off this way,\u201d Brie said as she began to split from Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian waved back, darted his eyes around, and quietly adjusted himself. Sure, he wasn\u2019t any taller. But, he had grown a bit. 4 inches hard now. Still below average. But, a whole lot bigger than he had a month ago. He had a shaft now. He could solidly grip himself with one hand. That made him feel like more of a man. </span></div></div>",

This one is really tight too,\u201d Brie said as she passed the bra over the changing room door to her mother. Brie had been putting off clothing shopping for so long. It wasn\u2019t an activity that she enjoyed doing. She didn\u2019t like trying on all the clothes, examining herself in the changing room, never finding anything that flattered her body. But, at this point, she needed an entirely new wardrobe. Her pants were starting to look like capris and everything else was a combination of too tight or too baggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry this one. It\u2019s not too pretty, but it\u2019s the only one I saw in the next size up,\u201d her mom said as she passed a plain beige bra over the door. Brie put the bra on, fastened the back and braved herself to look at the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the harsh dressing room lighting, Brie had to admit that she looked good. She stood in the full length mirror wearing nothing more than a bra and panties. Her pudge had melted away to reveal a fairly flat stomach. For once, she had a waist! And hips! She had a true hourglass body. Her longer legs had slimmed down, revealing a gap that highlighted what was inside her sky blue panties. Her latest 2 inches - bringing her to a solid 5\u20196 - were nothing but legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mane of thick, luscious red hair went right to her chest and illustrated the biggest change she had gone through. The bra she was wearing was a 30DD. There was no way around it. She was busty. The padding on the bra seemed excessive. She poked her chest and felt them jiggle. There was so much more than there was a couple months ago. She was one of the biggest girls in her class now! The bra covered up her surprisingly large nipples that almost felt too big for her sizable chest. She loved tweaking them and feeling the pleasure course through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at the image she saw. Her dimples looked great. Her plump red lips emphasized her pearly white smile. She really loved the woman she was becoming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, lets get this one. It fits great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nBrian took some deep breaths as he tried to lower his heart rate. He had just gone to completion for the third time that day. He was acting like the stereotype of a horny teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just couldn\u2019t help himself. Every time he thought of his growth, it made him horny. 5 and. A half inches long. As thick as a roll of quarters. He was average! It was an astounding change from just two months ago. He just felt so powerful. This must be how everyone else in the locker room feels all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 times today, he had been thinking about Brie. She had gotten ridiculously hot in the past couple months. She had gotten Jillian hot. Honestly, she looked better than Jillian now. He imagined taking his cock and pounding Brie\u2019s cute sensitive pussy as he groped her big boobs. What must her nipples look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel himself getting hard for the fourth time today. That would be a record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to imagine taking a shower with her. The two of them caressing each other\u2019s bodies, standing as they...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so much taller than him in his fantasies. That\u2019s because she was so much taller than him in real life. She was officially half-a-foot taller than Brian. He felt his erection began to subside as the erotic thoughts were being flushed away by the jealousy and frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still 5 feet tall. Just 5 feet tall. He was glad for the bigger penis, but some more growth would be nice. Brie seems to be getting a full body transformation. It would be sure nice if he could too. </span></div></div>",

But this was Brie, his bestie! If there anyone that should say yes, it should be her. He had been developing a crush on her for a while... since well before she had started her recent growth spurt to rival Jillian.  Why hadn't he asked her <i>before</i> she started to become more beautiful? What if she rejected him now? He might have had a chance with her then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a long, slow breath. He had to stop thinking like this! If he didn't, he was never going to ask her out. And he wanted to. He <i>sooooo</i> wanted to. He imagined the girl on his arm. Her long, flowing red hair. The cute spray of little freckles that splashed across her nose. Her increasingly spectacular breasts. Her longer, shapelier legs. He felt a wave of desire wash over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care what his chances were with Brie now. He needed to give this a try. He wanted her, and he began to gain a strange feeling of confidence that he would have her. <i>This</i> was the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brian entered the school, he walked straight toward Brie\u2019s locker. No excuses, no delays\u2014he was going to walk up to his friend, look her right in her beautiful eyes, and ask her to the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strode confidently and quickly toward her, closing in. Closer\u2026 Closer\u2026 Her eyes turned his way, and she smiled. He began to open his mouth to speak, just a few steps away from her now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jim, the varsity quarterback, stepped right in front of him. Brian\u2019s smashed into the huge, bounced off, and fell backwards to the floor. The quarterback didn\u2019t even seem to notice, or, at least, care. Brian listened as Jim asked Brie to the dance, and his heart dropped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brie sat on her bed and fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Jim had indeed gone on their mini-golf date that weekend. Brie had managed to <i>just</i> squeeze herself into the 30DD bras that just a week before had seemed to fit perfectly, then into a dress that was demure enough to get past her mom, but with a secret button she could undo to unleash her frankly incredible cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she hadn't even had to use it. From the moment he laid eyes on her, Jim's gaze had been locked, immovably, on her boobs. She wasn't sure he'd even managed to look her in the eyes once, or that he's heard a single thing she said to him as she tried to flirt a little around their 18 holes of putt-putt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" \"Yep.\" \"I know.\" \"Huh.\" \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was a known boob-hound, sure, but this...! She didn't feel like she'd gone on a date as much as guided a gargoyle around the course. <i>And</i> apparently he had thought it'd gone swimmingly -- he groped her boob on the 18th hole, then had spent the entire next week blowing up her phone asking when she wanted to go see a movie. Begrudgingly, she'd agreed, and he took her to see some boring romantic comedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresumably he picked it because he thought that it'd be quiet enough to not be distracting, since not five minutes in he started pawing at her boobs, at first subtly, then much less so. Brie kept pushing his hands away, and eventually he got the hint, but not before letting out an enormous sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, here she was, two weeks out from the dance, and Jim still bothering her every day about going on a \"third date ;)\" and not-so-subtly asking for topless pics. The star quarterback was an absolute pig!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, more practically at the moment, she didn't have anything to wear. None of her favorite dresses fit right anymore, not since she'd sprouted up another inch and a half, putting her to nearly 5'8\", and gained another few inches around on her bust and hips to boot. She'd just measured herself in the mirror and came up with an astonishing 30G cupsize, which honestly looked even better on her than 30DD had -- her nipples seemed proportional, finally, and while they dominated her torso they didn't sag or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was she going to do about Jim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian stared at his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never wanted to be, well, huge. Average had always seemed like it was going to be a struggle, so he had been overjoyed when he'd made it to four inches. And then it had just kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd measured again this morning and it capped out at eight full inches long, and he'd been unable to close his thumb and index finger around it at its girthiest point. When hard, it slapped up against his stomach and stood like a flagpole, completely unmovable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd had to discreetly ask the gym teacher for a bigger cup the other day, and even that felt cramped the moment he came out of the dressing room and caught sight of Brie standing among the girls in his class, smiling at some joke. Even more than her body, which Brian would be the first to admit was beautiful, her face seemed to have grown even more enchanting over the last month, turning his long-time friend into one of the most gorgeous girls in the entire school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here he was, turning into a freak. His cock was already way bigger than normal, but nothing else about him was changing -- still the same old dweeb he'd always been. No wonder Brie was dating Jim now.</span></div></div>",

Not only had she lost her \"most beautiful girl in school\" status to her former bestie, Brie, but she had lost the star quarterback to the upstart hottie as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian wished there was something that she could do to take Brie down a peg... but what? The girl was insanely beautiful now, and she seemed to grow more beautiful by the day. If she couldn't take back her status and couldn't have Jim, what else was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally thought of the answer. <i>Brian!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian had stuck with Brie after Jillian had distanced herself from the two of them. Likely, Brie's burgeoning beauty and affections for Jim were driving a wedge between the two, a wedge that Jillian intended to turn into a chasm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brian closed his locker and turned to go home, he startled as Jillian was standing right in front of him. He eyed her suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jillian! What are you doing here?\" Brian asked, preparing for yet another of her jabs about his stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Brian! I just wanted to apologize for how I've been treating you these last few months. I suppose that I wasn't properly appreciating your friendship, and I'd like to make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian stepped into Brian, her scoop neck blouse giving him a perfect view of her luscious cleavage. She touched a manicured nail lightly to the top of his chest and gradually slid it down, as she gazed at him with large, coquettish eyes. She bit her full lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian felt his massive package twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never forgot about you, you know. I guess that my making fun was a way to deal with my attraction to you...\" Jillian breathed, her voice tinged with husky desire. She touched her breasts slightly against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian's cock began its ascent, the pleasant sensation of Jillian's chest sending pulses of pleasure through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I am attracted to you, Brian. I was such a fool to let us fall out of touch.\" Jillian pressed fully into him, her breasts bulging from the pressure against Brian's chest, sending them overflowing to neck level on the smaller boy. If he tilted his face downward, his mouth would be in her cleavage. She pressed her sexy, rounded hips into his abdomen, causing Brian's erection to spring to full steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian leaned down to kiss Brian as she felt his prodigious shaft press upward into her hips and lower abs. Her mind informed her that this boy was HUGE, even as she continued her seduction. Wow! Maybe she would have to take Brian for a spin before she was finished with him, she thought. But first things first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian moved her soft lips against Brian's in a kiss that was neither hungry, nor chaste. She just needed to give him a taste. She was in the middle of school after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian smelled her perfume, tasted her lipstick, felt her beautiful body against him. The combination was electric. He had never been so aroused. He lost himself in the sensations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian released the kiss and backed up, leaving her breasts a millimeter from Brian's body, just close enough that the electric current of arousal would continue to flow between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was wondering if you would go to the dance with me...\" Jillian asked him breathily, with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was stunned. This was about the last thing he would have expected when he came to school today. He gazed into Jillian's beautiful eyes for an interminable moment, until he realized that she was waiting for him to speak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Absolutely!\" Brian said, before he could even think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! It's a date!\" said Jillian, skipping away in delight, her large breasts bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left, the girls in the surrounding area were staring at Brian. He looked around, seeing a dozen girls' eyes focused on him. But not on his face for some reason... oh my God! He realized what they were staring at. His huge penis was rock hard and so large that it was pressing the bottom of his shirt outward in an obvious display. His cheeks flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly put his backpack in front of him to hide his massive endowment and began to walk down the hall, way from the scene of his embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, he began to hear the whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder Jillian is going out with Brian. Did you see the size of his... you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God! That boy is massive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that? I thought that thing was going to rip through his shirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew that little guy was packing megadick in there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Lord! By tomorrow this would be everywhere in school! Brian's small form seemed to shrink further still. Well, he thought. I suppose there are worse things to be known for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just came back to the image of Brian\u2019s cock poking itself over his jeans. In public. Where everyone could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tiny dweeb! How could he possibly be hiding something that big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian has seen other men naked before and they were...fine. There was absolutely nothing wrong with them. But Brian...she was excited about Brian. She wanted nothing more than to run her hands up his immense shaft and...do some other stuff to him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled into her driveway and snapped out of her autopilot daydreaming. She whipped out a text to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How about a study date Thursday night? My parents won\u2019t be home until super late.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian couldn\u2019t have texted back a yes fast enough. It was his first date after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nThursday night rolled around. Jillian finished applying her eye shadow, blush, and her favorite deep-red lipstick. She was trying to go for a study-buddy look. She didn\u2019t want to make it look like she was trying too hard, but she also didn\u2019t want Brian going soft at any point during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her favorite pair of yoga pants, the push-up bra that made her Ds look like DDs and a \u201cHey Tuesday\u201d tank top from the concert Brian, Jillian, and Brie all went to together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian looked at herself in the floor-length mirror. The T-Shirt gave her...feelings. The three of them used to be inseparable. She had enough dirt on Brie to destroy her life five times over. She knew Brie had slept with Mr.Snuggles from the moment Jillian gave him to her at Brie\u2019s fifth birthday party until Brie was almost thirteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian sighed and started to fan herself. She didn\u2019t need tears ruining her makeup, even if her mascara was waterproof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian went to find a different shirt to change into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ring, ring</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door. \u201cHey, cutie,\u201d she said with a big grin before she immediately pulled Brian into a bear hug. He could feel Jillian\u2019s plump tits push into the top of his chest and the bottom of his face. A reminder that Jillian had several inches on him easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI brought you some flowers,\u201d Brian said, his hand slightly trembling as he handed the bouquet off to Jillian. His entire body seemed wrapped in nervous energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian smiled and giggled. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. Come on in and I\u2019ll find a vase or something for these.\u201d She sauntered off to the kitchen as Brian entered the two-story foyer and took his shoes off underneath the brass chandelier. Not that he was paying any attention. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Jillian\u2019s butt, clothed and conformed by her yoga pants. He could see each cheek individually jiggle as she walked. She had a surprisingly big butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel himself getting hard. \u201cDeep breaths,\u201d Brian thought to himself. \u201cDon\u2019t get horny.\u201d He had been getting so many text messages from classmates ever since his incident earlier in the week. It had made it hard to stop thinking about sexual situations. He had taken to changing in a bathroom stall during gym class just to give himself a bit of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, um, house you live in,\u201d Brian quietly chimes in, unclear how to handle date small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here like a million times,\u201d Jillian chuckled. \u201cIt has been a while though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian walked into the kitchen as Jillian finished putting the the flowers in an oversized mug. \u201cIt was all I could find,\u201d she lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian couldn\u2019t help but be astounded by Jillian. He had forgotten how beautiful she had become over the years. Ripe, red lips. Deep blue eyes. Long, sleek blonde hair. Long, thick legs supporting her firm ass. And boobs. Did she ever have boobs. They weren\u2019t Brie sized, but they were still amazing. The tank-top left nothing to the imagination and the \u201cHey Tuesday\u201d logo was distorted by their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a fun concert,\u201d Brian said as he felt his heart rate push upwards. His pants became more constricted and he didn\u2019t know if he could stop his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Jillian said. \u201cI really love their music. That was...\u201d Jillian paused. \u201cThat was a really fun night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian went behind the counter to fetch himself a glass of water. He didn\u2019t want Jillian to see his body and have a repeat of last time. Even if he had gotten a lot better at figuring out how to position his cock since last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to study some chemistry?\u201d Brian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian smirked. \u201cSure.

The closet door was shut, the makeup was neatly organized on the desk, the white carpeted floor was spotless, and the folded bed had only a chemistry book and a binder on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour room hasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d Brian timidly commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I like it this way. Purple suits me.\u201d Jillian responded in an equally timid way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped up on the bed and patted the spot next to her. \u201cChemistry time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian hopped up next to her. Sitting next to each other, their six inch height difference didn\u2019t seem quite as large. Brian wished he could adjust himself, but he could bear through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the teacher said we\u2019d be talking about organic...,\u201d Brian started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s my idea for a game,\u201d Jillian jumped in. \u201cLet\u2019s quiz each other. Make up questions and see who gets the most right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, that sounds fun,\u201d Brian tepidly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, we need a prize. What should the prize be?\u201d Jillian asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner buys pizza?\u201d Brian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s boring,\u201d Jillian responded. She paused, and then jumped back in just a little too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we get a little naughty? Every time I get a question right, you take off a piece of clothing and every time you get a question right, I\u2019ll take off a piece of clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um...I, um,\u201d Brian stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sounds like a great plan. Let\u2019s do it. C\u2019mon, you know your gonna kick my butt. And then you\u2019ll get to see my butt. Maybe I\u2019ll even give you something if you win,\u201d Jillian winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian could feel himself getting hard as he imagined Jillian\u2019s curvy body without any clothes on. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s...lets do it,\u201d Brian said, still nervous from the thought of Jillian seeing him naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go first. Avagadro\u2019s Number?\u201d Jillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c6.02x10 to the 23rd,\u201d Brian shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect!\u201d Jillian responded. She placed her feet up on the bed, removed her socks, and begin to sit cross-legged. Her dainty feet looked to have a fresh coat of purple nail polish on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm...my turn then. What\u2019s the most abundant element in the universe?\u201d Brian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelium.\u201d Jillian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it\u2019s hydrogen.\u201d Brian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian silently cursed to herself. She forgot how bad she was at chemistry. She was a smart girl, but she just never put the time into her science classes. It was gonna be hard to get Brian to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn. What temperature is absolute zero?\u201d Jillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZero Kelvin, -273 Celsius,\u201d Brian said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian smiled and began to remove her shirt. Brian stared slack-eyed at her. She was wearing a lacy purple bra underneath it. Brian could feel himself getting aroused. Her breasts were clearly more than a handful a piece. He could see just a bit of strain as her bra seemed to thrust her chest directly towards him. He saw the slightest jiggle as her chest reacted to the movement of removing her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta give me a chance to get some of these right,\u201d Jillian flirted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the only one naked tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian tried to change up his sitting position. He could feel himself going rock-hard and there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for all of him. He wished he could adjust himself to make more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm...,\u201d Brian grimaced, \u201cwhat does an atomic number mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe number of...neutrons?\u201d Jillian guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s protons.\u201d Brian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it. My turn. What are the building blocks of alcohols?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen.\u201d Brian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian smiled, reached her hands around her back, unclipped her bra, and let it fall to her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian always knew he was a boob-guy. But, he realized it now more than ever. Jillian\u2019s tits were beautiful. She had the cutest red eraser nipples that just further emphasized her size. They had no sag and we\u2019re just begging to be touched. Jillian\u2019s crossed legs framed them and they ever so slightly overflowed her petite frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was in absolute pain. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being this hard before. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being this big before. His dick was trying it\u2019s hardest to break the stitching of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should call you the winner. I\u2019m gonna give you your prize now,\u201d Jillian said with a smile. She got off the bed and proceeded to remove Brian\u2019s belt and pull down his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s boxers don\u2019t fit very well,\u201d Jillian cooed. \u201cAnd it looks like somebody has a gift for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to slowly remove his boxers. She stood there in amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking huge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the size of my forearm,\u201d she said both amazed and horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s cock was gigantic. She couldn\u2019t reach her hands around it fully and she could fit both hands on his shaft. He had a slight upward curve and two hen\u2019s eggs attached at the bottom. Jillian began to stroke him with both hands as she wrapped her mouth around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a big man, aren\u2019t you Brian? You\u2019re such a big man,\u201d she said seductively as she began to insert him into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...ungh...\u201d Brian tried to articulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that. Brian got everywhere. He got all over Jillian\u2019s face, all over her chest. He just couldn\u2019t control himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to get better at that,\u201d Jillian giggled. \u201cI\u2019m excited to teach you a lot.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brie confidently walked into school wearing a black blouse and black yoga pants. She had taken to the color over the past couple weeks. It was supposed to be a slimming color after all. She was an incredibly slim girl, but she was hoping that dark colors would slim down her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5\u201910, she was officially the tallest girl in school. Which also made her the leggiest girl in school too. Her long legs led to a pair of wide hips and an ass the size of bowling balls. Her yoga pants could hardly contain them. Her bright red ponytail was inches above her butt, as if to frame its perfection. She had no idea how her hair had grown so long so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skinny torso led to her most defining feature. Her breasts were simply out-of-control. They might\u2019ve been proportional to her frame, but as a 30J cup, they took up a large portion of her torso. Despite their evident perkiness, she couldn\u2019t cover a single one with both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face and smile looked more refined than ever, but it was hard for anybody to look past her body made for sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim ran up to her, clearly waiting for her arrival. \u201cHey, I know that -\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie cut him off. \u201cWe\u2019re done Jim. Get over it.\u201d She continued to walk to her locker, as she tried to avert his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey broke up weeks ago, but Jim was clearly not over her boobs. On date number three, he was able to talk Brie into giving her first blowjob. Brie had done enough internet research to know that Jim wasn\u2019t packing much downstairs. It was barely bigger than her index finger. Which was fine. He finished all over her chest, which he had been mauling during the entire interaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie just couldn\u2019t handle the festishization anymore. She was a person and all Jim noticed was her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie grabbed her books and shut her locker slowly. She was hoping to see Brian on the other side just like in the old days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down the hallway and saw Brian and Jillian laughing outside of Jillian\u2019s locker. The two of them were holding hands and chatting. Brian got up on his tippy-toes, planted a kiss on Jillian\u2019s lips (and a long one at that, Brie thought. Get a room!), and started to walk down towards his social studies class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie sped-walked over, trying to catch Brian mid-commute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey friend! It\u2019s been too long!\u201d Brie said, just a little too over-eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey,\u201d Brian mumbled. \u201cYeah, it has been. How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe height difference between them had become ridiculous. Brian\u2019s head was now at the level of Brie\u2019s chest (and just barely). He had to take a step or two back so that he could look into Brie\u2019s eyes without her prodigious chest blocking his view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been good. Jim and I broke up a week or two ago. Just trying to get through school and the like,\u201d Brie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s okay. He wasn\u2019t my type anyways. He thought a snitch was a tattle-take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...you and Jillian...\u201d Brie said slyly as she playfully elbowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she asked me out a couple weeks ago. I thought it was a joke at first. Or she wanted science help or something. But, we\u2019re almost at our one month anniversary. The three of us should hang out sometime! She definitely knows a snitch is worth a 150 points,\u201d Brian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Brie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Brian a big hug. His face went straight into her chest. It was a luxurious feeling he\u2019d never felt before. He could feel the body heat radiating off of them. He knew Brie had become big, but he didn\u2019t realize just how big until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself become hard. Very hard. He had been doing such a good job controlling himself. Well, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really have missed you,\u201d Brie softly said in their embrace. \u201cI know things have been weird with us the past little while, but I don\u2019t want them to be that way.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie let go as the bell rang. Brian\u2019s face was bright red. He nodded and ran away. Brie thought she saw something under his shirt. It was at the bottom, past his belly button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard the rumors. They seemed crazy. And mean. But...could they be...true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie walked to class. Her perfect face was bright red as she unclothed Brian in her mind  </span></div></div>",

She knew exactly why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe,\u201d she said playfully as she kissed Brian on the cheek. He had taken to waiting by her locker before school had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSucks your parents made you bail on mini-golf last night,\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, family time is a dumb excuse. I don\u2019t think you really minded it though.\u201d Jillian responded with a wink. The two of them sexted all night long. Jillian was quite the self-photographer and Brian had quite the vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe going off-campus for lunch?\u201d Jillian asked. \u201cI\u2019m really in the mood for pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if it\u2019s pepperoni -\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd pineapple,\u201d Jillian finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian got up on his tippy toes and planted a deep kiss on Jillian. Jillian pulled him closer into her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ring, ring</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian let go and started down the hallway. Jillian watched him prance away and blushed. She couldn\u2019t believe that this short dweeb was her boyfriend. She couldn\u2019t believe how much she had fallen for him. She adored his cute butt and his cute eyes and his cute smile and his cute...other parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Brie chat up Brian down the hall. The height difference between the two of them was almost comical. Jillian realized that she missed Brie. She resolved to talk with her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond period just ended. Students started streaming through the hallways. Jillian spotted Brie in the distance. Tall redheads stuck out in a crowd. Well, every part of Brie stuck out in a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brie!\u201d Jillian shouted across the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie turned around. She was surprised to see Jillian walking up to her. She hadn\u2019t realized their height disparities until now. She was almost a head taller than Jillian. It was a weird feeling seeing the tables turn so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jillian...\u201d Brie said with hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too long,\u201d Jillian said. \u201cWhat have you been up to? We never chat anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fine. Just trying to survive school and a couple shifts at the ice-cream place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you and Jim broke up. Sorry to hear that,\u201d Jillian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t even dating really. It\u2019s more than fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ring, ring</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen,\u201d Jillian said quickly, \u201cI haven\u2019t been a great friend to you lately. I want to change that. How\u2019d you like to have a girls\u2019 night tonight? Just you and me.\u201d Jillian smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie was torn. She was still mad over Jillian\u2019s past silence. She was still mad over Jillian\u2019s gossip. But, this Jillian...she seemed different. Brie saw echoes of her old friend. If Brian could trust Jillian, why couldn\u2019t she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2018ve got to go to the mall after school. Want to come with?\u201d Brie asked with a hesitant smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more. Let\u2019s meet up right after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, just let me see it!\u201d Jillian said from the next changing room over. \u201cYou\u2019ve got such a killer body! You might as well flaunt it a bit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much more skin than I like. It doesn\u2019t even fit me well!\u201d Brie protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to show off some skin! That\u2019s the whole idea. Let everyone see those amazing abs of yours!\u201d Jillian insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is showing off so much more than my abs!\u201d Brie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here but you and me! Just let me see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian walked out of her changing room wearing a ruby red crop top. It covered half her torso, leaving her toned stomach visible. The top button was left open, revealing an opening of cleavage trying to push its way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie walked out wearing the same top. Despite being a size bigger, it clearly was a poor fit. The top was barely a bra on Brie...and not a well-fitting one at that. Cleavage was exploding out of the top and bottom of the top. Brie\u2019s nipples tented our from either side. The tension on the top made it so sheer that Brie felt like she could see the freckles on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire stomach was revealed. She had an amazingly slim figure (slimmer than Jillian), that made her wide hips that much more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, you weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d Jillian joked. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ll be breaking hearts wearing that. I thought I had nice tits, but you\u2019re making me reconsider.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie blushed, as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a bad thing!\u201d Jillian insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute bombshell. We\u2019ve just got to find some clothes that fit you. You\u2019re body type is just a little different from mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try a different store and, in the mean time, you\u2019re gonna tell me how to make my tits pop like yours do. My boyfriend is a bit of a boob-man\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie giggled. \u201cEwww, don\u2019t tell me things like that about Brian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\nThe two of them sat cross-legged on Jillian\u2019s bed. Jillian\u2019s parents weren\u2019t around, so the two of them were home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so not cool!\u201d Jillian giggled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t once compliment you in your first date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t once look me in the eyes,\u201d Brie responded. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of...\u201d Brie pointed down her shirt and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is such a pig!\u201d Jillian giggled. \u201cYou definitely broke him. He\u2019ll never find another girl like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get over his oral fixation eventually,\u201d Brie quipped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust in time to be a butt guy!\u201d The two of them laughed hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, was he big...you know...\u201d Jillian made a motion towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww, Jillian,\u201d Brie blushed as she playfully hit Jillian\u2019s arm with a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, you know everybody wants to know!\u201d Jillian protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was fine. He was...you know, fine. Maybe a little, you know, not quite as...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jillian gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that!\u201d Brie insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but being big is like...Jim\u2019s whole thing!\u201d Jillian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think his whole thing is sucking at mini-golf,\u201d Brie quipped. The two of the erupted in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they settled down, the conversation took a lull. The two of them looked at each other.</span></div></div>",

As she started to imagine what they felt like, she felt herself slowly leaning towards Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, Brie pulled Jillian towards her and they kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian loved way Brie\u2019s lips felt. She loved the way their long hair entangled together. She loved feeling Brie\u2019s melons envelop her body, as her own breasts tried to carouse Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Jillian said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you into girls?\u201d Brie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019m into you. You\u2019re...you really turn me on,\u201d Jillian blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d Brie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence filled the room. A buzz from Jillian\u2019s phone broke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mind if Brian comes over? We were gonna hang tonight, but he\u2019s love to hang with you too.\u201d Jillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sounds great.\u201d Brie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like that, the moment passed. The conversation started flowing again. Neither of them brought the kiss back up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<b>ding, dong</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must be Brian. I\u2019m gonna go grab him,\u201d Jillian said, as she slid off the bed and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie looked around the empty room. It was nice to be back here after so long. She picked out the shade of purple together with Jillian all those years ago. The gerbil cage was stacked in the corner, still empty after Brie and Jillian accidentally set the gerbil free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hamper was filled to the brim with all kinds of colorful, small, tight clothing. Brie felt envious. Clothing shopping was becoming harder and harder by the day. There weren\u2019t many stores selling cute clothing for her body type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found him!\u201d Jillian said as she led Brian into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI stole a bottle of wine from my parents. They\u2019ll never notice. Maybe we could have a little fun tonight?\u201d Brian asked mischievously. Brie nodded. Looks like Jillian was starting to rub off on the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are really cute together,\u201d Brie commented, halfway through her second glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww thanks,\u201d Brian said as he rested his head on Jillian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit of a unlikely couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, cheerleaders are supposed to date football players,\u201d Jillian giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s play a game or something,\u201d Brian insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jillian said with a devilish smile. \u201cLet\u2019s play Truth or Dare!\u201d </span></div></div>",

I want to get an idea of Jillian\u2019s real favorite part of your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian carefully negotiated his jeans off to reveal his blue boxers. They were stuffed full. The two girls would practically see the veins on his oversized cock. It was almost peeking out the far side of his boxers until Brian made a discrete adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie felt her eyes go wide. It was true. He was gigantic. She was almost salivating at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn, Brie. Truth or dare?\u201d Brian asked. He made no effort to hide his partially clothed bottom from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh....truth,\u201d Brie said, clearly preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you ever want them bigger?\u201d Brian darted in, clearly preoccupied on a particular topic himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie looked down and averted her gaze as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re so big already! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d want to be even bigger than that!\u201d Jillian shouted at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie blushed some more. \u201cI like big boobs! They make me feel womanly. I always wanted to be tall and busty. Well, curvy. But, mostly busty. I just like the way they make me feel. What would you want to look like?\u201d Brie asked, hoping to get the attention off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking that as my truth. I\u2019d want to be really tall. With a really big ass. But mostly, just really tall. I like being noticed,\u201d Jillian smiled. She had clearly put some thought into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie and Jillian both turned their attention to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDare again.\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boxers come off,\u201d Brie said without an ounce of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian took his boxers off. His cock sprung to attention. It looked ridiculously large to be coming off such a small body. It was closer in size to Jillian\u2019s forearm than a regular penis. The head was bright red and seem to gravitate upwards with a slight curve directly towards Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls couldn\u2019t help but stare at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you to poke it,\u201d Jillian said to Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie took out her reformed hands and poked it with a single finger. It barely budged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you to stroke it\u201d Brie said to Jillian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I haven\u2019t done that before.\u201d Jillian took both hands and placed one at the base, wrapped as far around as she could and slowly stroked half way. She took her second hand and did the same to the front. She could feel it pulsate with excitement. Brie saw it twitch in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you both to take your tops off.\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian started. Her yellow top came off to reveal a lacy red number. It perfectly enclosed her perky breasts, each slightly larger than her hand. Off it came, as her chest slightly bounced. Her eraser sized nipples were fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie went next. She carefully pulled her black t-shirt off, revealing an industrial black bra that had cleavage exploding from every direction. Five hooks later, the bra came off, revealing a giant pair of tits. Each one jiggled from Brie\u2019s slightest movement. Each of her nipples was larger than her thumb, perfectly in size with her torso covering boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jillian and Brian were in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a lucky girl, I know.\u201d Brie smiled with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you to let us touch them,\u201d Jillian said. Brie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian caressed Brie\u2019s left nipple while Jillian started man-handling Brie\u2019s right breast with both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian, I dare you to try and fit your third arm between my breasts,\u201d Brie said as she laid down. Her tits covered part of her arms when she laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian moved towards her and began to feed himself through her cleavage. It disappeared, only to reappear on the other side, near her mouth. Brie began to slowly lick the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was almost in a state of pain. He had never been this turned on in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie grabbed Jillian\u2019s hand and shoved it down her pants. Jillian began to slowly caress Brie the same way she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie moaned from feeling pleasure from head to toe. The three of them continued all night, as more and more clothes were taken off. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t remember how many times Brian and Brie had made her cum. Both of them just had bodies built for pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed something strange lying next to the sidewalk. It was a large, ornate book. The cover had jewels encrusted all over it. \u201cThe Burgeoning Book,\u201d read the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian picked it up. It was as heavy as its size suggested.

The big dance was just a couple weeks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many months of changes, a sense of normalcy had finally over washed over Brie, Jillian, and Brian. Their changes had finally stopped and they had become adjusted to their new lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie laid across Brian\u2019s bed, screaming from pleasure. She had grown a couple more inches to 5\u201911, but the difference was hardly noticeable to Brian. Her face had softened up, making her look younger than her 18 years old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had changed most dramatically were her breasts. At 30P, she was probably the largest girl in the state. They covered her entire torso. They were so perky and firm that Brie had given up bras and allowed her pinky-sized nipples to poke through her daily wardrobe. They rested on every table-top surface she sat near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie loved them so much. She loved the way she bounced when Brian jammed his monster dick into her. She loved the way that her chest tried to explode out of every piece of clothing she owned. She liked being tall too, but she was all about the curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian continued to pound his cock into Brie as she screamed in ecstasy. He was still the same. Still the same 5-foot-nothing scrawny kid from the beginning of the year. His changes had continued throughout the year though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12-and-a-half-inches. Very much in the freakishly huge range. Nobody would dare make fun of him in school anymore. Two hands were the minimum to jerk him off now. Flaccid, he still had the biggest cock in school. He absolutely loved it. Brie had been practicing trying to take all of him. Only Jillian could at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeard you two having fun. Up for a third?\u201d Jillian said as she walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian\u2019s head grazed the top of the door frame as she walked in the room. She had the most changes happen over the last four months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started the day after she found the book. She woke up an inch taller and her ass practically exploding out of her pants. By the end of that week, she was 3 inches taller and buying jeans at a plus-sized store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast-forward 4 months later, and she was 6\u20199\u201d tall. The tallest person in school by far. She liked the idea of 7\u2019 tall, but she liked the number 69 so much more. All of her growth came in her legs. Her legs now went up to Brian\u2019s chin. He had become a bit of a leg guy over the past couple months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd an ass-guy. Jillian\u2019s wife hips led to an ass that could only be described as watermelons made from boulders. Brian adored letting Jillian go soggy style so he could watch the motion ripple through the greatest butt he\u2019d ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian\u2019s chest had grown a little bigger (F cups now), and her face looked like a supermodel. Her strong cheeks, bright blue eyes, and sultry lips made both Brian and Brie horny at a single sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie hopped off Brian as her and Jillian began to stroke his manhood. It was a three-hand job to do it properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian and Brian\u2019s relationship had melded into a threesome over the past several months. Nobody at school could understand how the short dweeb could get the two hottest girls in school simultaneously. The three of them were practically inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s Jillian\u2019s turn to try you out,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI need to study up some more to understand how she gets all of you in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the extra nine inches,\u201d Brie laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room in there.\u201d</span></div></div>",

There was only a week or so left in the school year, and then they'd all be scattered off to the winds, everyone headed to different colleges...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and Susan would never be able to ogle any of them again, or dream about what it'd be like to be so mind-blowingly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted all of it: Jillian's heartstopping height and ass, Brie's mindblowing boobs, to have a boyfriend with what was rumored to be the biggest, hardest cock in the state, to have multiple girlfriends of her own -- Susan wanted everything the trio had and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she was, in her mind, completely average: B-cups, 5'4\", pancake ass, stubby legs... and no boyfriend or girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and she made her way up to the library for her independent study hour, leaving Brie, Brian, and Jillian to make their own way to class. Dropping her backpack in a corner, she scanned through a pile of books left out on one of the library tables to see if anyone had been reading anything interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne old-looking leatherbound book caught her eye: \"The Burgeoning Book\".

She spotted a book on his desk. It's cover said, <i>The Burgeoning Book</i>. She looked over to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Brian looked at the book Jillian was holding. \"Oh yeah! It's some book Brie was showing me. We started to read it together, but never finished. It's kinda weird. I think she brought it back over to let me finish reading it, but I never really got around to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian opened it. There was a slip of paper marking one particular story, \"The Couple that Grows Together, Stays Together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right! That was weird. It's pretty hot, though,\" Jillian said, fanning herself. \"It kinda turned me on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you said something about showing me something before?\" asked Brian, eager for Jillian to pick up where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh, yes. Let's see... where was I?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you were going to teach me how to get better at... you know...\" A blush crept up Brian's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian sauntered over to Brian, feeling <i>remarkably</i> sexy. She wasn't sure why the book had turned her on so much, but aroused she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned Brian around and began to massage his neck and shoulders. She leaned forward, and nearly touched her luscious lips to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step 1: Relax, Brian!\" she whispered sensuously. She nipped his ear with her teeth, sending electric sensations firing down the rest of body. Jillian pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step 2: Set the mood,\" she said in a low purr. She walked over to her bag, linked her phone to Brian's bluetooth speaker and played her favorite sultry song, setting it to repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step 3: Close your eyes\" she said. She brushed closed his eyes, kissing each eyelid. She slowly, painstakingly removed his clothes, her fingers sliding against his skin at every possibility. Brian shuddered with rapidly rising desire at her temptingly delcious touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jillian finished removing his clothes, she took his hand and guided him to his bed. She lay him down, dragging her red, French manicured nail down his chest. Brian shivered in anticipation. How was Jillian making him feel this way without even touching his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step 4: Enjoy...\" she said, cutting off Brian's passing thought as she climbed over him, long. limber legs folded on each side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down, touching her vermillion lips to his neck. She kissed him there. Brian began to squirm, ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian touched her white teeth to the skin there, biting softly to get a sliver of skin between them. She ground her teeth together, not hard--very lightly. Brian's body began to writhe in the ecstasy of the sensation. How was she doing this? It felt soooo amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian released Brian's neck, trailing those plump lips downward to his nipples. She gave each a suck with her pillowy lips and a nip from her perfect teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed down his stomach, moving to the side of his rapidly growing cock. Clearly, he was ready for another round. But Jillian wanted him as hopelessly aroused as she was. She wanted him to desire her, to want her so badly he ached for her. She smiled as she kissed his sensitive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back, it wasn't yet time for her to go down on him, it was time to escalate her foreplay a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her tongue and licked slowly from his base to his tip, giving the slightest twirl at the top. Brian's quiver as she finished, told her he was well on his way to where she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched her fingernail to the base of his shaft, then traced circles on the underside of it, slow, arcing motions that elicited a moan from Brian. She looked up at his face. He was completely lost in the haze of desire, a marionette. She held all the strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished with her fingernail, Brian's throaty growls escaping without his knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed his tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exploded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to open his eyes and rise. She placed a slender finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh...\" she whispered. She placed a hand on his chest and pressed him back down to the bed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her race car zoomed down the final stretch of track, overtaking cars with all the leftover nitro she'd scored earlier. She felt a tense rush pass through her body as she seemed to inch closer and closer to the race leader. Her eyes narrowed, as if her added focus would somehow make her car go faster. Each second seemed an eternity to the 15-year-old girl, as she hoped and prayed faster than the speed of light that her car would somehow, some way make it over the finish line a little ahead of her competitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the music stopped. Kate glanced at the car beside her. She was among the top two cars, but she seemed to have finished in a dead heat with the other car. Kate gulped. Was she going to come second? For a frightening moment, Kate felt that she hadn't made it, and would just have to accept the silver trophy. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WINNER!\" flashed brightly on the screen in golden letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Kate cheered loudly, standing up from the arcade machine. With pride, she entered \"KTE\" into the archaic box using her archaic joystick. Nobody really knew why the colossal old arcade machine was still operational at the southern end of the mall - Katie had all the high scores on all the machines, mostly because she was the only one who still inserted coins into them. If she had saved up instead, perhaps she'd have been able to purchase a new console or even a gaming PC. But Katie was happy to be the best at something. After all, she didn't have much else going for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her pocket, Katie noticed she was out of coins. With a frown and a sigh, she walked away from the otherwise-deserted southern end, towards the carpark to the mall's east. There was an on-duty security guard, dressed in his uniform and standing around bored. Most of the shops had either closed already or were in the process of shutting down. Outside it was dark - just as well, Katie thought, that she ran out of coins. She didn't want to be too tired for school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carpark and mall were built adjoining the town library, which was often open until a little later. Katie was tired, but seeing the library was still open, she wondered if she couldn't find something to read before she went back home. After all, books were one of the few things she could do at home without her dad taking much notice of her. Her dad was a violent man, and Katie had learnt it was best to avoid him. Her mum, a drug addict, was usually too busy in her own world to take any notice of her. It was her older brother who once read to her as a child, but now he had moved in with his girlfriend on the other side of town, and Katie rarely saw him. Mostly, she was on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library had large windows at the front, covered with motivational posters and encouragements for people to read more books. Katie agreed wholeheartedly with the posters. She wasn't the best reader, but reading books was a pastime she enjoyed anyway. As she went inside, she quickly checked her reflection in the window. Yip, same old plain-Jane with no sexy features to speak of. Same dirty old school uniform because she kept wasting her laundromat money on arcade machines. She'd lost her shoes some weeks earlier, so she walked around bare-footed, but at least she still had her nerdy-looking glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Katie heard the loud hum of an air-conditioner. The temperature was mild, and the lighting was soft yellow. Rows of books stood on end, waiting to be read. Katie went directly to the restricted section, her personal favorite. There were no children's books in this section, other than a few collections of nursery rhymes dating to the 1700s. Most books were leather-bound, many with gold-foil lettering. Katie loved the moldy smell and thick paper of these books, and sometimes sought to sneak a few out of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes continued along the bookshelf with wonderment, they suddenly stopped as Katie gasped. There in front of her was a particularly large and important-looking book, bound with leather and shiny gems along the spine. There were two rows of heavy metallic bands which held down clamps to keep the book securely shut, as though the publisher had gone to great lengths to avoid the book opening accidentally. However, Katie could immediately see a small latch that allowed the book to be opened with ease. It was sitting on a high shelf, but Katie saw that she could reach it. And on the spine, in proud and very fine lettering, Katie could see the title spelled out with beautiful crystals:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b><i><div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">The</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Burgeoning</font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Book</font></div></i></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mouth still agape, Katie found herself unable to look away from the book. A strange breeze, running counter to the direction of the air-conditioner, suddenly filled the room. Katie's hand began to tremble, and she found herself slowly reaching out for the book. In her mind, Katie was in a trance, with the sounds of beautiful female voices echoing in her mind, all saying \"read me ... read me ... read me ...\" - before long, Katie saw that her hand was no more than an inch away from the book, before her trance was suddenly and violently broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom just behind her, a cane whacked Katie's outstretched hand. Katie whirred around to see an elderly man there, wearing a bow tie suit and a name tag indicating that he was the head librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" asked Katie indignantly.<br>\r\nThe man replied first by whacking her hand again for good measure. \"Back in my day, you'd have had it a lot worse for putting your grubby paws on my restricted books!\"<br>\r\nKatie looked outraged. \"I was just trying to read it!\"<br>\r\nThis seemed to surprise the old gentleman. He peered at Katie, and his grey eyes seemed to stare into her soul. For a moment, Katie felt as though the man were somehow reading her mind. But that was impossible ... wasn't it? The only way Katie could describe it was like his eyes were fountains of water, going through her eyes and right through the circuits her brain. It was dizzying, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... read books?\" asked the old man.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" said Katie matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man broke his gaze and looked at the ground. \"You have something of a gift\" he said in a low voice \"Very soon, nobody will read books anymore. Libraries are dying. It's all these fancy new e-readers and technology, I say!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't afford an e-book reader\"<br>\r\n\"Well - it's better that way, kid. These books - \" he pointed his cane dramatically \" - are each little shards of power. Whether they take you to other worlds or teach you ancient secrets, they have an experience your so-called e-book readers can never replicate. Yes, my girl ... all books are magic books ... and some are particularly dangerous ones, because the magic in them is particularly real.\"<br>\r\n\"So ... can I borrow this one then?\"<br>\r\nThe old man hit the girl with his cane a third time. \"You want to read these books? First read the sign - \" he pointed his cane to the restricted sign above the shelf \" - as you can see, these books cannot be issued. They are all very rare and old. What book did you want anyway, perhaps I can get you something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, Katie pointed behind her at the leather-bound, gem-studded masterwork sitting on the shelf. A long silent moment passed as the old man looked up at the book through the dustiness and soft yellow light of the room. His face looked at though he were suddenly recalling a distant memory. It was hard to tell whether it was a happy or a sad memory. Katie immediately saw that the librarian knew something of important about the book, such as a secret. Along with the book, she wondered what was giving the old man such pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ... that one?\" said Katie, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man still did not speak. He leaned on his cane, and turned away from Katie, deep in thought and reflection. Katie wondered if he was simply having a senior moment. But she felt an unnatural presence in the air, something akin to being watched by a thousand eyes. The whispers she heard before were starting to call to her again, and the old man's ears pricked as though he could hear them too. Katie had never had an experience like this before. She no longer felt like a little pawn to be neglected by her family and bullied at school. Now she was something still more insignificant, a pawn among the great and powerful forces of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me\" said the old man, almost in a low whisper \"If I could grant you one wish ... any wish at all ... what would you wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Katie's turn to be quiet in thought. Being wealthy came to mind ... or being popular. Then she thought about being smarter, but although she wasn't the best at school, Katie was already called a nerd often enough. She thought about being stronger or more athletic, but wondered if being a jock was just more ammunition for the bullies. Besides, she already had some hobbies that she really enjoyed. If she had two wishes, then her answer would be simple - she'd wish for both a new family, and for friends at school. Perhaps with money she could buy her way to independence? But then, she realized, she'd still be self-conscious because in some ways, her bullies were right. She wasn't pretty, she wasn't sexy, she was just a scrawny little nerd. And then, she thought, perhaps if she was pretty, people would like her, she would like herself, she could land jobs as a cute young actress and make lots of money ... and then she could manage her family problems a bit. It wasn't a flawless plan, but it was a plan anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'd wish to be beautiful\" Katie said wistfully \"Like ... long legs, bubble butt, hourglass figure, toned in all the right places, large boobs, long hair, a face so pretty that nobody would ignore me ever again...\"<br>\r\nThe old librarian cut her off in a low, thoughtful voice: \"That book is not one you would choose to read. The book has chosen you. I will let you borrow it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you\" said Katie, feeling strangely relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talk with the old man had been intense, unlike any she'd ever had before. She turned around and reached out once more for the book, with both hands this time, half expecting the old man to hit one of them with his cane again. But he didn't. As her hands inched closer towards the book, she felt a great hesitation in them, as though she was clawing at the book not through air but through some thick liquid. She actually had to use a lot of physical strength to reach out at the book, and an even greater amount of willpower. The voices in the air became louder the closer she reached towards the book. With less than an inch between her fingers and the book, she felt a heavy wind around her, and screaming in her mind. Her trembling fingers pushed through what felt like thick dough, as she became increasingly desperate to hold the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her fingers touched the leather gently, and the whole feeling went away. Suddenly she was just a little girl in the library again, doing a very dramatic pose to hold a book. It was as easy as touching any other book. Quickly, she took it down from the shelf and hugged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the book likes you\" said the old man \"Very strange ... very strange indeed.\"<br>\r\nKatie thought this was an odd comment to make about a book. \"Thanks, I guess\" she said, shrugging. And with that, she began to walk off, saying: \"I'll return it in a couple of days, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man tapped his cane on her shoulder. \"One last thing before you go\" he said, so forcefully that Katie almost involuntarily turned around. Once again, the old man's eyes seemed to see into her very soul, penetrating every fiber of her mind. \"Be very careful. If anything strange happens, tell me at once. Probably even before you see a doctor. You'll understand what I mean soon enough. There are few books more dangerous than the one you hold now ... it is a strange fate that such a mighty artifact should bond so readily with a girl such as yourself. I know not what its motivations might be. As I say, be very, very careful. Also, you might want to run home rather than just walk tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie shrugged again. \"Catch you later\" she said, as she walked out of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow it was now very dark outside, and the moon and stars were only occasionally visible among black clouds rolling across the sky. The air outside was cold, but brisk and fresh. Katie's tattered, unwashed uniform offered little protection, and her bare feet were getting especially cold. She couldn't get home soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust beyond the library and mall carpark was a major street that ran between the highway and the middle of the city. There were no cars on it, which told Katie almost everybody had to be already at home with their families. She jaywalked across the street, clasping the leather-bound book firmly against her chest, right underneath her underdeveloped breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the road, she saw a man wearing a trenchcoat. He was behind her, walking the same direction along the footpath at some distance. \"Girl!\" he called out to her aggressively \"What are you holding?\"<br>\r\nKatie ignored him and quickened her pace. Suddenly, she heard the man running towards her. Looking behind quickly, she saw that his shadowy figure was moving almost unnaturally fast. She remembered the old librarian's advice that it might be better to run home ... was he some kind of fortune teller? Or mind reader ... or both? In any event, Katie knew there was one thing for it. Stretching out her short stubby legs, she ran as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right by a three-way intersection with a pretty old church on the corner. She ran across the road as a truck honked loudly and braked, narrowly avoiding her. Katie kept running, clutching at the book, past a row of smaller shops and towards some suburban townhouses behind. As she ran, she was dimly aware that there seemed to be little electric sparks coming out of the book and contacting her skin. It didn't strike her as odd that she ran past the townhouses and turned into her home street, without feeling the least bit tired. She ran and ran, but her breaths were light, and her bare feet not the least bit sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house was at the very far end of the street, over a slight hill. As she ran, Katie closed her eyes and imagined it was like in her arcade game. She felt the wind tug at her unwashed hair and imagined she was a race car, zooming past her opponents as she ran at top speed. She imagined her house as the finish line ... and she was almost there, but so was the man chasing her. She had to win. She had to. It wasn't far now. She clenched every muscle in her body in hopes of making it far ahead of her competitors, focusing with all her power as she felt her legs rush up the hill and down the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was home. She'd made it. And looking behind her, the mysterious man who had chased her was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie turned to her house, a white, small, run-down cottage. The lights were on and she could hear the sounds of her dad and his friends partying, with beer bottles obviously being a major feature of the party from the sound. Katie walked around to the back of her house, where there was an empty section with a cheap, rarely-used clothes line. The house had a small rear entrance that was right by Katie's room, which she often used to avoid attracting attention at these kinds of gatherings her parents hosted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud creak, Katie opened the door and tried to sneak inside.<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\" demanded her dad.<br>\r\n\"The ... the library\" stuttered Katie, holding up the leather-bound book as proof.<br>\r\nHer dad's friend Toby was beside him in the hallway. There were other guys in the living room, seemingly having a good time. They often hung out there if they were removed from bars.<br>\r\n\"What a nerd\" said Toby \"My boy Andrew says he caught her playing those old arcade games again.\"<br>\r\n\"Those coins are my beer money! Girl, if you do this tomorrow, you're getting hurt, you understand?\" said her dad, which made Katie aware of the fact that strangely, despite being just hit by a cane several times, her hand no longer hurt at all.<br>\r\nKatie nodded. \"I'm going to bed\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the relative safety of her bedroom, Katie lit a candle. Her bedroom didn't have a light, because it was broken and her family didn't want to fix it. Inside was her mattress, a pile of clothes, a few old arcade game guides, and some old gossip magazines she'd read a thousand times over. The walls were featureless asbestos, which explained why nobody else wanted to live in the house. For her parents, all that mattered was that the rent was cheap ... more money for drinks and smokes, as her mum had explained to her. Her mum had looked so proud that day, as though she'd made an investment to put economists to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her mattress, which wasn't very comfortable, was a blanket that was slightly too small for her. Katie wrapped her cold feet in it and laid down, not bothering to disrobe. She was more excited to read the book. The strange voices she'd heard in the library and the man chasing her all seemed to lead up to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore opening the book, Katie took another moment to admire the cover. The gems sparkled and seemed to light up the whole room with color. The flickering candle-light, combined with the glowing gemstones, filled the made the whole area seem somehow magical. For whatever reason, the multicolored refracted light from the gems seemed to fall mostly on Katie's body, and her eyes were wide open with wonder. But the most remarkable thing about the book cover, only visible in the dark (though it had escaped Katie's notice before) was that the title was written in glow-in-the-dark red ink, that shone like glitter in the darkness. It was easily the most beautiful book Katie had ever seen. She felt unworthy to read it, but somehow aware that it was a book of great power, and that there was nothing more she wanted now than to taste this power for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, and with much trepidation, Katie unlocked the metal clamps and turned the heavy front cover. The pages were not as sparkly as the cover, but they had their own shine to them, printed on thick parchment that made them easy to read even in the dim light. The first page only repeated the title, and it crossed Katie's mind (for the first time) to consider what the book's subject might be. She wondered if it would be a non-fiction book, like a recipe book or a self-help book. Perhaps it was a story, or perhaps it was mostly in another language. The old librarian mentioned that the book itself was powerful, but Katie had no idea what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the front cover, several previous owners of the book had written their names in faint pencil. Some looked similar to Chinese or ancient Egyptian, and all of them were names Katie didn't recognise. Regardless, Katie pulled a golf pencil from under her mattress and added her name to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your secrets?\" she whispered aloud to the book as she turned the page again. This page was full of writing, without so much as a table of contents of chapter header. The font was gothic, almost appearing hand-lettered. It was quite small print, but it was legible even for Katie with her poor eyesight. With her anticipation now reaching boiling point, Katie began to read...</span></div></div>",
