Buneary looked at Pikachu, imagining herself and Pikachu as fatties. \"Why don't we do that too?\" she said. \"Meh, why not.\" Pikachu said. \"Yeah!\" said Aipom. \"It's not like we've got anything better to do today.\" </span></div></div>",

So, I have a little special training start off.\" He pulled out a pokeblock. \"See this, it is a special pokeblock I made for all of yall. It'll help you gain 300 pounds. Careful though, too many, and you could end up as big as the three pokemon down the road.\" He said. \"Is he talking about lucario, mewtwo, and mew?\" Pikachu whispered to chimchar. \"Yep.\" chimchar agreed.

This truck was absolutely enormous and looked like it held enough pokeblocks to make all of the pokemon in the group as big as Mew! Maybe even more! *beep* *beep* *beep*. The truck's annoyingly beeped as it slowly backed up to the pokemon. Charley opened the the door and stepped out. \"Hey guys, ready for <i>this</i>?\" He patted the side of the truck. Mew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gonna love it\" she said. Charley lifted an opening in the back revealing two tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright who do we have here?\" he said as he un-wound the tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have Buneary.\" Mew pointed to Buneary. \"She's the one who suggested this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it was nothing.\" Buneary said with a little shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there we have Aipalm\" She pointed to Aipalm. \"He's also seems pretty eager! To his right is Sudowoodo. Next we have...\" Mew looked around \"Hey, where's Pikachu?\" She then felt a small poke on her massive belly, so she looked down to find that it was Pikachu that was poking her belly with curiosity. \"There's Pikachu,\" she said while laughing. Buneary looked at Pikachu with jealousy of Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Pikachu?\" Buneary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Huh?\" Pikachu responded with his finger still on Mew's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your still poking mew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. Anyway, we also have Sarevia.\" Starevia was in the air over the truck so she could get a better view of its size. \"There's Squirtle, over there.\" Squirtle was still staring at the truck with a blank look on his face. \"Happiny is right here, trying to climb up me. I don't know if she'll make it. And Chimchar, Turtwig, and Buizel. I know it's a lot of pokemon but it looks like you have more than enough pokebl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what about me?\" Pachirisu interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry! And Pachirisu is right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharley stood there with a dumbfounded look on his face. \"That... That's a lot of pokemon. I only wish I'd brought more tubes for you guys!\" Charley lifted the tubes up to eye level. \"Alrighty then, who's first? You? Or You?\" He points the tubes towards Pikachu and Buneary.

It had more than enough room for all of them if they all got to Mew's size, and tubes to feed them so they didn't tire out from using their arms, which would ultimately make them lazier, not to mention \"gainer chairs\" which included a combination toilet and bidet. The tubes hung into each of the gainer chairs, and a massive orb hung in the air, connected to all the tubes. It was marked \"Eat Me Pokeblocks\". Everyone sat down. Charley asked Mew if she could connect everyone with telepathy, in case they wanted to stop at some point, or if they wanted to talk during it.

They seemed to be loving getting fatter. He felt a little left out, but then he wondered what was going on. What was this? And why were they getting so fat so fast? Still, he could tell from the way they were moaning with delight, and the way they were mentally begging him to join, or at least turn up the output, that they were really good...
