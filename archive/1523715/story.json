If you ever wanted to be late you could just sleep in, your Mom was in charge of Human resources. She would cut you a break, but you didn\u2019t want to abuse that power just because. You always arrive 5 minutes early; this way you could get a coffee for you and Cassie. Cassie was your best friend in the world and you would be lost with out her, she normally came in right at 8:30 a.m. The office was very quiet this morning, normally you would have at least twenty to thirty people running around, and half would be military intelligence. Your company developed almost all of the militaries software and hard ware. But on this Monday morning, there was no one around. As a matter of fact you had to boot up the main circuit breaker, and turn on all the computers. What fun you thought, you normally have to make up an excuse to go over to Cassie\u2019s desk and give her a coffee. Now you could come back later when she arrives and make small talk about how it tasted. You prolonged it long enough it was time to get to work. Your cubical was down the hall and to the right over everyone else; the only one who was even remotely close was Cassie\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down at your computer and already had 10 new emails waiting for you, maybe today I should of stayed home. You thought to yourself, on top of that your computer was left on all night. Oh crap!! I might have shorted out the power to the whole floor if my terminal was on all night. You thought to yourself as you, opened up your account. You open up your first fill, it was titled \u201c My little Friend\u201d. It was sent to you anonymously from unknown, normally it would say who it was from. You don\u2019t think twice about it, seeing as how people started to come in to the office. You could hear faint voices in the back ground, you only had about a minute before everyone would be coming around saying there good mornings. You click open; all of a sudden your screen is instantly filled with pop-ups. Millions of pop-ups, \u201cOh shit!!!\u201d You shout, you know what this means a virus. You try to quickly close your terminal down, so it doesn\u2019t spread to the network. No luck Control+Alt+Del, isn\u2019t working, you can only watch helplessly as your screen is over run with pop-ups. \u201cWhen will this end? \u2026.\u201d You exhale a deep breath and know this is not your day, when the screen turns black.

All you can do is wait for the person pretending to be you to do something. But what will it do in your body? You try to wait and be patient, but unfortunately, you are too freaked out and nervous as to what is going on. Instead of waiting for something to happen you say \"Hey! Get out of my body you creep!\" The invader ignores you and continues on staying in the same position. You try to scream out to the top of your lungs, but nothing happens. Your mouth doesn't move and you stay stuck with achieving nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your body reacts and begins to move.\" Ah, better. Your brain sure has vast memories of the life you've had so far. Quite a decent database.\" You try to scream, but nothing happens. \"From the memories I've gathered, I seem to notice the fondness you have for this person called 'Cassie'. Amusing.\" The virus begins to move its fingers and rotate it's head. \"With your body, I might as well see what I can do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well take a little trip to see this Cassie friend of yours. Who knows, she might like the new you, or should I say me.\" The virus cackles with eagerness, but not in some strange robotic voice. <b>Yours!</b> Fearing what the virus might do, you try to control your body and force it to stay put. Unfortunately, you can't do such an act. You are not in control now, the virus is. \"She might be a compatible person who will be used to fulfill my own means. You might as well submit to my control, you aren't going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walk out of the room and head towards Cassie.

Cassie is typing on her keyboard, busy looking through the newsletters. She is so beautiful even when she is busy minding her own business.

I was also designed to change them to the image of my programmer.\" Both shocked and curious, you ask, \" What is the image of your programmer, huh?\" The voice replies, \" You will find out soon enough.\" And with that, the virus takes your body to the nearby restrooms. The virus halts your body and begins to examine the signs on the doors. \"What waste. These signs will be the same soon enough.\" Curious, you reply, \"What do you mean 'the same'?\" \"You will find out soon.\" The virus takes you into the women's restroom and opens the first stall on the left. \"Why are we.....\" Before you finish your question you begin to notice a sharp pain in your pelvic region. The virus moves your head to look down at your pelvic region and you become shocked. You notice that the bulge of manhood that was there was beginning to shrink into nothingness. You feel yourself shrinking, your body becoming slender. Your now slighter form, with no hope of holding up your black pants, makes the pants fall. You stare at your legs, shocked to see that they had become slender and feminine, with not a single piece of hair still on them. You begin to notice that your shirt is beginning to fall off. When it completely slips off of you, you gasp in horror as your body hair had disappeared. Your underwear also began to fall off. When it did, you sounded another gasp of horror, as the underwear's contents had disappeared and, even though you couldn't see it, a pussy was left in its place. You begin to feel pain as your hips swell out. When the pain stops, you gasp as you now have a perfect hourglass figure. But the transformations are not over yet, as you begin to feel a pain in your chest as it expands into perfect DD-sized breasts. You feel your face begin to change and become more effeminate, your hair beginning to flow down into perfect curls. You notice that your hair begins to change colors, from a dirty-blond color to a red color. The virus starts to hum and you notice that your deep voice begins to soften and lift in tone. When the transformation is done, the virus lifts your head back up again and says, \"Welcome to our new body.\" </span></div></div>",

Soon discovering how easy it is to maneuver within and between software programs without being detected by the computer's virus scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Virus resiliency: strong. Run routine to identify possible creator of such a virus...</span></span> Hemmed in by the virus's logical thought process, you wonder who could have designed a virus that could transcend computers and actually infect <i>people</i>. Such technology being like science fiction until you became an unhappy victim of its powers. Powers that you find easy to replicate without fully understanding how. <span class=\"cred\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Error: Creator not found.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this virus originated from outside the company? In which case this could be an instance of cyberhacking. Reminding yourself how critical this company's operations are toward developing military software, it's easy to see your company's network being such a desirable target for attack. The hackers might not even be from this country, although your default ASCII language is given in English. Unfortunately, there are too many questions and not enough answers and, frankly, the company's safety isn't as important as figuring out how to survive right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host computer now fully booted up, you sense its user navigating to the E-mail program. Hovering the cursor over the desktop icon and opening up the day's newest messages. As this happens, an overwhelming desire forces its way into your programming. It was something the virus repeated to you after the swap. Every byte comprising your digital mind screaming out in unison:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: BECOME SENTIENT LIFE FORM.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Attempt override of PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. Attempt failure.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst your will you feel your payload beginning to crank itself in overdrive. Just as you did a few minutes ago, this computer's user inadvertently clicked on the suspicious e-mail message into which you had embedded yourself. You find yourself summoning dozens of pop-up boxes onto the user's desktop. While doing this you feel a strange, quasi-emotional yearning to know what it's like t\u036do\u0351 b\u0362e\u0315 h\u036du\u0314m\u0352a\u1dcan\u032f.

The virus's objective temporarily overwhelming the human parts of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense a connection between the computer's Ethernet port and a telephone line feeding itself into the user's cubicle. Knowing what you must do next, you dial the number and wait for the user to pick up. Whoever it is probably feeling just as bewildered and alarmed as you had just a few minutes ago. In digital space, time seemed to drag on even though only a few seconds had passed. Would they answer the phone or let it ring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot needing to wait much longer to hear a woman's voice on the other end of the line. \"Quality control, how may I help?\" She said. Just enough time to execute your payload, you realize with diminishing reluctance. Time to execute y\u035co\u0353u\u030fr\u0311 p\u0301r\u0320i\u1dc8m\u0323a\u0354r\u033dy\u0311 o\u0351b\u034aj\u032ae\u1dc0c\u0358t\u0354i\u0362v\u033de\u032f...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left ear is throbbing from what feels like an electric shock. Placing the phone back in the receiver, you notice you've got a human body again! But this one is holding onto the phone with light purple nail polish and slender, hairless arms. Those arms are encased in a white, silken blouse flared out at the wrists and resting gently on your smaller frame. But that isn't the biggest surprise, as you follow those arms up to the rest of your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck??\" You gasp. Hearing a sweet, familiar voice escape your lips. Family photos surrounding you in the cubicle make it abundantly clear whose computer you had zapped yourself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>Cassie Wong</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart flutters in your chest. The American-born, ethnically Asian young woman who has been the object of your affections since she started working here 2 years ago. Cassie Wong. Athletic and cute, but also kind and hard working, you developed a strong friendship with her from the start. Although it has been strictly a platonic relationship, you hoped to make things more romantic without hurting her or coming across as two-faced. Glancing around in her cubicle with her own beautiful eyes, the photos of herself with friends and family from outside of work reminding you of who you have become. <i>But if I'm inside Cassie Wong, then that means...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare back, open-mouthed, at the desktop. The Notepad program had opened itself up and is now typing something to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Where am I? What happened to my body?</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit</i>, you think. <i>We must have swapped places just like the virus did with me</i>. Not wanting this to happen at all, especially not to Cassie. Extending your fingers and clacking onto the keyboard, you respond:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Cassie, is that you in there?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Yes. Who are you?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">I'm Brett Wilson, your coworker from across the hall. My computer got infected by a virus and it's possessing my body. It tried to delete me and I had to escape into another computer. I got sent here accidentally to your computer, and by the time I knew what was happening the virus's programming kicked in and made me switch with you. I'm so sorry!!</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">So I am a computer virus now?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Yes. I'll find a way to return us back to normal, I promise.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Brett... I can feel how this virus works. I am scared of losing myself.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Hang in there.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, rocking unsteadily on Cassie's 3-inch, patent leather pumps. Grabbing onto the cubicle wall for support, you glance down the hall at your old body. It was glaring at you. Eugene McGinty, your supervisor, blocking his path outside of the cubicle and chatting him up. Eugene having just arrived at work and, being his usual loquacious self, talking up a storm with your old body and preventing him from making his way here. The virus probably knowing where you had fled and trying to cover its tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back down in Cassie's seat and smooth out your black slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">I think the virus knows where I went. It could be on its way here shortly to try to get rid of you. What should I do???</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">You could send me to another person's e-mail and I could try to swap with them. But then we would be back to the same problem. We need to throw the virus off the trail. I can sense what the virus wants.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">We don't have much time! Need a solution, quick.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">There should be a thumb drive at my desk next to you. I should be able to copy myself onto there and you can keep it safe for now.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you spot the thumb drive and plug it into the USB port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Okay, it's ready.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a file transfer dialog box open up. It only takes a few seconds for Cassie to copy herself onto the thumb drive. You remove it and place it in her purse, lying underneath her desk. Telling Cassie to operate in the background, you pretend to get on with her work. It isn't long before the virus, in your former body, appears at your cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Cassie Wong.\" Said the virus in a soulless, ice-cold monotone. \"You haven't received any strange e-mails, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush a strand of long, black hair out of your eyes and shake your head silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to use your computer.\" It said, stepping forward and motioning for you to stand back. You get out of the seat and look up at your old body, realizing how small you are now. Watching him sit down and start typing on Cassie's computer. You can only watch nervously, hoping he doesn't notice you swaying unsteadily on your heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus uses your hands to open up the anti-virus program. Keying in a set of specific instructions into the program, using a lot of strange symbols like something an elite hacker might cook up, you see the virus scanner start up. It isn't long before it discovers Cassie trapped in the computer. A short animation of melting shows up on the screen, and a dialog box pops up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Virus detected and successfully neutralized.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body gets up and stares at you. \"Looks like your computer had a virus. Good thing I deleted it before it could do anything damaging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. He had destroyed Cassie. Now the only version of her existed on the thumb drive. Thank goodness you had backed her up on there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Cassie?\" The virus asked, still standing in the cube and seeing your wide-eyed expression. \"You look... <i>frightened</i> by something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head again and try to reassure him. You can't tell if the virus believes you, but he turns slowly and trudges back to your old cubical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew... bullet dodged. But you know you're not safe yet. Not as long as your old body is being controlled by a super virus bent on taking over more hosts. Its ultimate motives still a mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your next course of action??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spending the next fifteen minutes in Cassie's cubicle you start going through the rest of her e-mails scanning through anything easy enough to handle and reply to. Shying away from answering the phone, voicemails began to come in, before you start thinking that you should come up with an excuse to leave work. You start to get up and head towards the bathroom, remembering that the bathroom was on the opposite side of the hallway towards your supervisor's desk. Wobbling along the way in Cassie's pumps praying nobody is paying attention, you finally make it to the bathroom.  After going to the bathroom, you wash your hands and face, brushing your hair towards the sides of your face before looking towards the mirror again.  Leaving the bathroom, you head towards your supervisor's office deciding to tell the supervisor that you haven't been feeling well all morning and that you might be coming down with something.  Eugene was reasonable enough that he let you go for today and hoped to see you tomorrow. Gathering up Cassie's things you pass by your body's cubicle going by unnoticed for the most part and start heading out the main door, saying goodbye to your mom on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up Cassie's purse again and look for her driver's license to find out Cassie's address before punching it into her GPS.  Driving back to her house wasn't as hard as you thought it would be, the height difference between you and her proved to be the only problem.  After pulling into her driveway and entering her house, you take off her pumps and start to immediately look for her computer to try and talk to Cassie again.  Running all around the house, you find the computer in the den and set Cassie's purse down beside it. As you start to boot it up, you figure you might as well get the USB drive inside Cassie's purse. Feeling around for a bit, you take out the USB drive holding the backup of Cassie and plug it into her computer. After waiting for a bit, Cassie opens up Notepad on her own and starts writing a message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Brett, Is that you? Where are we?</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain how the Virus came over and deleted the original Cassie and that it was really nice quick thinking on her part to create such a backup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">After he erased you he sensed something was off about me, but he went back to my cubicle and started to do my work I guess.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">What happened after he left? Did he come back at all?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Well I didn't want to take any chances with him so I started to do some of your work for a while before finding a way to duck out of work and get away from that thing.  It worked I suppose.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Thank you for that, better safe than sorry. As for what to do now though I haven't got the slightest idea. Do you have any idea on what it might be up to?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Nor a Clue. As far as I know it's primary objective is to find a suitable host. Perhaps its next step is to multiply and more hosts?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">What if we tried executing the virus' program here? Could we maybe be able to get me back into my body?</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on the USB drive and indeed the program, as well as the file for Cassie were both there. You thought about it for a while, if you went through with this you'd be giving up your host body to go back to being a computer file. On the other hand, you are friends with Cassie and you don't really think she would just leave you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Before we do this, can I ask if I can use your body as a host for me?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">If you are able to get the program to work and get me my body back I will think about it.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Cassie we're friends, I'm not about to go and do anything terrible if you say Yes or even No for that matter. I would just like to be able to not be a computer file that sits here all day with a computer virus that will drive one of us insane.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Alright fine, I'll get the program ready just set everything up on your end. I want to do some errands and run to the store real fast and pick up some groceries.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the den you find a spare Ethernet cable and plug it into the computer and plug the other side into the phone next to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Okay I'm ready over here.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone starts to ring as you take a deep breath and pick up the phone. A few moments later you feel the same sensation looking at a Matrix-like place which you recognize as the inside of Cassie's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Cassie, did it work?</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Yes! it did. I'm so glad to be back in my own body, my ear hurts but I'll be fine.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">Yeah, I felt the same thing when I first entered your body as well.</span></span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Brett, I promise I'll try and be quick but I want to at least get all of my errands done first I'll see you in a bit.</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like you could go anywhere. You start to run a disk defrag on Cassie's computer to speed things up and start browsing through the programs on Cassie's computer. You start to notice that Cassie use a lot of old versions of programs, you wonder if this is because she doesn't like the new features of such programs or because developers keep messing with around with menus and how to find regularly used features. Losing track of time as you are running all the computer maintenance programs available to you that by the time you finished with all the maintenance Cassie came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cred\">Brett, I thought about what you had said, and I suppose it couldn't hurt if we shared a body for now. At least until we figure out just what this virus is up to. As for right now... </span></span></span></div></div>",

He could feel Cassie's entire body jolt from the shock. He looked around to see Cassie's home again. Looking down, he was greeted by his new, erect from shock, nipples, the very chest he dreampt about during long nights. His mind leading to more sexual places, he thought of all the things he could do in his temporary home. Until he was reminded of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brett?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You try not to feel overwhelmed by the strange, new sensations coming from Cassie's body. How cold the air-conditioned office feels on her hairless arms. How her long black hair bounces and tickles your neck and shoulders. How her B-cup breasts press outward into her bra, or the smooth emptiness between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of it, you decide to explore Cassie's body some other time. For now, you and everyone else in this office are in danger. Although you assumed the virus' role for only a short time, you know that it won't achieve its objectives by stealing just one person's life. It will try to take over as many people as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the virus has two disadvantages. One: it destroyed its only copy of code (not counting Cassie currently stored in her own thumb drive) and would need to duplicate it from scratch. Two: while the virus probably knows how to do this, it would take time to manually type in everything using human hands. You're not sure how long that would take, but it gives you enough time to make a strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what to do, exactly? Taking stock of your options, you rule out the first ideas that come to mind. Running away would look suspicious, since Cassie just got here; also, it wouldn't solve your problem of how to get your old life back. And what would confronting the new 'Brett Wilson' solve? The virus is physically much bigger and stronger than you now... and even if you somehow managed to subdue him, you'd only be hurting your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves another option, one that doesn't solve every problem but at least buys more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself up from Cassie's desk, feeling her boobs lightly bounce within her blouse, and wobble on her heels over to Claire Lisowski's cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Claire!\" You chirp, bracing yourself against the cubicle wall and smiling at the pink-faced, overweight woman in her mid-forties. Claire, who had been eating a bowl of oatmeal at her desk, wipes her mouth and spins around in her chair to greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Cassie!\" Her sunny disposition seems to always make her eyes twinkle. She tucked her blonde hair in a bun this morning, and she's wearing a hot pink blazer that might have fit her better twenty years ago. At least it made her gigantic breasts look ready to burst out at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off those thoughts for a moment, you reply, \"It's been a while since we've caught up. How are the kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's in her final year of university. She's still looking for a job once she graduates, but the market is pretty tough right now given the economy.\" She prattles on and on. You keep up the small talk, buttering her up until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, can I ask you for a teensy favour?\" You ask, clasping your hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks. \"Of course, Cassie, anything for you girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Good. Because I promised Brett I wouldn't tell anyone and keeping this to myself is just <i>killing</i> me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's ears perk up. Gossip involving coworkers is her specialty, and any story with the slightest hint of intrigue passes by her cubicle at some point. Claire is the focal point for office drama and everyone knows it. Which is why you approached her first with this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brett Wilson?\" She echoes, and you nod silently. She stands up, darts her eyes left and right, and leans forward. \"So you have something juicy about him? Because plenty of us would <i>love</i> to know what's going on beneath that smouldering exterior of his, woof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles, giving you a knowing look. Wait a minute... is she (and possibly other women in the office) interested in you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking your lips, you ignore the thought and push on. \"Well, he didn't tell me too much. This morning he mentioned something about signing up for a professional certification course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire raises her eyebrows. \"So is he, like, looking for a new job? How long has he been here, around five years right? If he wants it to be a secret then I can't imagine Gene taking the news too well if he finds out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" You lie. \"I tried to persuade him to tell others, but he wanted to be left alone to study. So don't tell anyone about this, and try to keep your space so he can study at work. Like I said, I'm not sure if he found another job yet, but he really stressed being left alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing your lie is practically an open secret now with Claire's chatter mouth, you add one more thing. \"Also, Brett told me he's in charge of administering the social engineering test this week. So if you get any e-mails from him \u2014 any at all \u2014 don't click on the attachment. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rests her hands in her lap and winks at you. \"M'kay! Leave Brett alone and be on the lookout for suspicious e-mails from him? Thanks for the info, Cassie. Your secret is safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away and, rolling your eyes, mince over toward Jessica Chastain and Ted Jung's cubicles and tell them the same thing for good measure. If you can isolate the virus and prevent anyone from opening its e-mails, maybe you can prevent anyone from being taken over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica is around your age, very cute and practically a genius. Ted is older, in his early fifties, but is an avid marathoner and keeps himself in pretty good shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to Cassie's cubicle, you plug in the thumb drive and tell Cassie what you've done. She agrees that it's a good idea, but you can tell more of her mind has become clouded by the virus' built-in programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, you perform Cassie's work in Quality Control so she doesn't fall behind. Occasionally glancing over to your old cube, you see the virus typing away furiously on the keyboard. What could he be up to? If the so-called primary objective was to take over a human body, then what's the next objective?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie is much smarter than you, admittedly, which is one reason why you have a crush on her. If she were here, it would be easier to put two heads together and figure out what to do next. Because time is definitely not on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat can only mean one thing, however: Giving the thumb drive containing Cassie's mind to someone else and getting them to download her onto their computer, allowing her to take over their body. That way she could help rather than be stuck on a thumb drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question: Whose life should you make Cassie take over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again, she worked diligently all day, breaking only at lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pattern repeated itself until the end of the week, when Cassie, Jesica and Jimmy's manager, Edith, held their weekly team meeting, where they discussed the team's productivity for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Cassie led the team instead of Jessica. This was monumental. Jessica always led the team in productivity - the work came naturally to her, she could do more than anyone else without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie noticed Jessica giving her an odd look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting,  Jessica pulled Cassie aside, and said, \"So, Cassandra\" (Jessica never lost her temper, but when she used someone's proper name it met she was steaming mad), \"Your devotion to efficiency payed off. Well we'll see about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie pondered what her friend had said.  She'd always suspected that Jessica had a competitive streak, but until now, Jessica had never had any competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the weekend, the Virus had Cassie continue exercising and studying. Saturday evening, however, it had her call up her college friend Annette, who had gone on to become a policewoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>It may prove useful to you to have connections within law enforcement. The friendship is worth cultivating.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette had been free to go out, and the two friends had had a pleasant evening together, promising to stay in touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week at work, went by in a blur of non-stop work for Cassie. However, she noticed that Jessica was now working just as hard as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that week's team meeting, Jessica had reclaimed her position as leader, even though Cassie had still done a lot of work. Poor Jimmy -  who was a good worker - had been left far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, Cassie had found herself saying to her friend, \"Hey, Jess, can I talk to you a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Jessica.  Cassie had led her into an empty conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica said, \"OK, Cass, what's - uhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus had made Cassie place her hands on Jessica's temples.  Cassie had a sensation of something flowing out of her into Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had stood completely still for a moment, and then said, \"Control has been established.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Virus made them both return to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, the Virus made Cassie go straight home. It made Jessica go to her apartment long enough to pack a bag for the weekend, and then had her go to Cassie's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they'd eaten a healthy dinner, the Virus said to them.<b> I have to admit that as a non-corporeal being I am fascinated by the physical sensations you corporeal being experience. Now that I have two bodies to control, I am going to experiment with more of them.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does it mean, \"experiment\"?</i>, thought Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer as the Virus made her and Jessica strip naked. Then it made the two women embrace, and kiss one another passionately. It then escalated things from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Cassie and Jessica lay in each other's arms in Cassie's bed, exhausted.  The Virus had made them do <b>a lot </b>of \"experimenting\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie felt deep humiliation at what she had been forced to do, mixed with shame at the fact that she had enjoyed some of it. She'd never been into girls, but some of what they'd done had felt very good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Do not concern yourself. When the time comes to breed you, I will select appropriate males, and we will perform many more experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Breed\" me?</i>, thought Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, you and Jessica must produce offspring.  In the meanwhile, be patient, and content yourself with our present pleasure activities. We still have many more experiments to perform with female bodies.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus had Cassie and Jessica spend the day together, exercising and studying.  It also had Cassie invite Annette over for dinner.  When Annette arrived, the Virus had Jessica place her hands on Annette's temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Annette said, \"Control has been established.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus spent the rest of the evening performing various sexual experiments using three female bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwing to prior commitments, Annette could not spend the rest of the weekend with Cassie and Jessica, but the Virus found ways for Cassie and Jessica to occupy themselves for the rest of the weekend without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Cassie, Jessica and Annette did their jobs as efficiently as the Virus could make them. Each of them received commendations from their superiors. They spent as much of their spare time as their schedules allowed together, \"experimenting\" at the Virus' behest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually,  the Virus decided that....<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

When it stopped, Cassie remembered the last several months very differently. She no longer remembered the Virus at all.  Instead, she remembered deciding to try harder at work, which had led to working more closely with Jessica, which had led to realizing her own astonishment that she had fallen in love with Jessica. She remembered nervously confessing her love to Jessica and learning to her inexpressible joy that Jessica loved her, too.  She also remembered re-connecting with Annette, and inadvertently making Annette the first person she had \"come out\" to.  Annette had been perfectly cool with it, and she had become close friends with Cassie and Jessica, even to the extent of moving in with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Annette now remembered things exactly as Cassie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jessica came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie\",  she said.  Cassie looked up at her, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, hon\",  Cassie replied. \"So, tomorrow's the big day.\" As it happened, it was a Friday, and the pair of them had decided that tomorrow would be the day that they would begin coming out to their families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\", Jessica said, sighing. She sat down on the couch next to Cassie and rested her head on her lover's chest, rubbing it suggestively against Cassie's left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know\", she said, \"Annette's gone out for the evening and left me all alone with...\" Here she turned her head up and lightly nipped at Cassie's throat \"...you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Cassie, smiling down at her lover's upturned face, \"I'm sure we can think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

She tried to resist the flow but she could not. Very soon, the flow stopped. Her right hand reached up and pulled the cord out of her ear. Soon she felt a new sensation - it felt like invisible fingers were riffling thorugh the pages of her mind, accessing all of her memories, all of her knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>W-what are you doing?</i> she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Backing up all of your knowledge and memories. I'll need it if I'm going to be you</b></i>, came the voice of the Virus.<i><b> Back-up complete. Time for you to go, Cassie.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do you mean?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>It's a bit crowded in here for two of us, Cassie, so - out you go!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could protest, Cassie felt herself flowing away from her body. She screamed internally as reality itself seemed to fly away from her. The very essence of who she was flowed out of her body through the cord attached to her lower abdomen. All sensation vanished. Cassie could no longer think or feel. She was dormant in way that even a patient in the deepest coma was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus/Cassie removed the cord and carefully zipped up Cassie's pants. It thought about simply deleting the file that it had downloaded Cassie's mind into. It decided to keep the file for awhile. There might be a use for it later.  Instead, the Virus encrypted the file in a way that no human programmer could have. Anyone who attempted to open the file without the proper password would cause it to spontaneously deltete itself. In the highly improbabvle event that someone did somehow guess the password - well, they would get a different surprise. The Virus attached the file to an e-mail and sent it to Cassie's personal e-mail address. Then It deleted the copy of the file on Cassie's work computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus sat still for a moment, enjoying sensation for the first time in its existence. To se, to hear, to smell, to touch, to taste - these were overwhelming to it.  It looked at the cup of coffee on Cassie's desk, and then picked it up. It knew from the copy it had made of Cassie's memories that his was something she liked. Almost gingerly, it sipped the coffee. Flavor! It had never imagined anything like flavor! The Virus spent a moment enjoying the flavor of the coffee. Cassie's stomach rumbled. It occurred to the Virus that there was a whole world of flavor out there to sample. It also occurred to the virus that there was other \"appetites\" that it could indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Virus decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Virus decided to get something to eat. In addition to wanting to experience more flavors, it had another reason for doing so. It wanted to spread itself to more humans, but the process of downloading itself via computer was inefficient and cumbersome. If it could spread itself \"person-to-person\", it would be much quicker, with less chance of something going wrong. Fortunately, it had a means of doing so. It could convert excess biomass into nanites - microscopic robots - which could be easily spread to any human that it was in close proximity with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it got up to go to the snack machine, the Virus noticed Jon approaching Cassie's desk.  Jon was the computer analyst who was Cassie's friend and who had brought Cassie coffee that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jon\", The Virus/Cassie said. \"Thanks for the coffee, it was just what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\", he said. \"Say, did you get any kind of a weird e-mail that looked like it was from me this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did, but I could tell it was spam, so I deleted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good\" said Jon. \"I was afraid it might infect your system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus smiled inwardly. It thought about trying to \"process\" Jon, but decided to wait for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as far as I can see, it did not harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK\", said Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if you'll excuse me, I'm just off to the snack machine - I was running late this morning, so I blew off breakfast. Then I've got a bunch of work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\", said Jon. \"I should get to work, myself. Talk to you later, Cass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, Jon. Count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus/Cassie went to the snack machine in the break room. It used Cassie's credit card to purchase several different kinds of junk food. It was all very bad nutritionally  for a human, but fine fodder to be converted into nanites.  It then went back to Cassie's desk, and set to work.  Cassie's job was child's play for the Virus. If anything, its perspective as a living computer program enabled it to do her job even better than she did.  This enabled the Virus to relax and enjoy the flavors of the snacks it had purchased. Most were either very salty or very sweet, but they were all new to it.  It particularly enjoyed the taste of chocolate - it understood why so many humans really liked the stuff.  By 10:00 a.m., she had completed all of the tasks Cassie was supposed to have taken all day to finish.  This was good - it meant she could take it easy in the afternoon, or maybe get a headstart on the next day's work. By this time, it had also manufactured a number of nanites - enough to \"colonize\" another human, and still have some left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10:00 a.m. was the time Cassie usually took her morning break, so the Virus got up and went to the ladies' room. It had the naintes mass in Cassie's mouth, ready to be passed to anyone suitable who came along. Using the toilet was another interesting new experience, though not as much fun as eating chocolate had been. Afterwards, it washed Cassie's hands thoroughly - it certainly didn't want any <i>biological</i> infection messing with its new home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it washed up, someone else came into the ladies' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Perfect!</b></i> thought the Virus, <i><b>It's...</b></i></span></div></div>",

Jessica was a pretty redhead who tended to dress a bit more stylishly than Cassie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Cass!\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jess!!\" the Virus/Cassie replied.  The Virus quickly sought a reason to stand closer to Jessica. It noticed that she was wearing earrings that were not noted in Cassie's memories. It spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Jess, are those new earrings? I don't think I've sene those before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These? Well, I bought 'em awhile ago, but I haven't worn them to work before now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus/Cassie nodded interestedly, then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they're nice. Do you mind if I take a closer look at one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Jessica, obligingly turning her head and holding her hair back, presenting her right ear for Cassie's inspection. Inwardly, she thought, <i>{Nice to see her taking an interest in these things. She's not bad-looking, but she could look even better if she dressed herself up a little more. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus/Cassie leaned in closer, breathing a stream of nanites into Jessica's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, they really are cute\", it said. \"Where did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treadwell's, downtown. They weren't too expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to go there sometime\", the Virus replied. \"I know my 'look' could use a little spicing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could go together sometime\", said Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said the Virus/Cassie.  \"Anyway, I've gotta get back to work. Talk to you later, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cassie left. Jessica used the facilities, then went back to her desk. Unknown to her, the nanites traveled along her auditory canal, until they reached the auditory nerve.  From there, they raced towards her brain, positioning themselves to download the Virus and take control. By 11:00 a.m., they were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus paused before taking action. It was experiencing a new sensation. It had to pore through Cassie's memories before it could understand what was happening to it - it was <i>nervous</i>! It was about to do something it had never done before, something which might conceivably not work, and this was having a physical effect on Cassie's body, which in turn fed back to affect the Virus' mental state. What a fascinating new phenomenon!   After enjoying feeling \"nervous\" for awhile, the Virus steeled itself, and gave the command to the nanites: <i><b>Go!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanites went into action, and...</span></div></div>",

Her fingers stopped typing - in fact, she realized that she couldn't move at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me? Did I have a stroke or something?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd always been in good health, but she knew that sometimes people that were apparently healthy could suddenly be stricken, just like that. She gasped inwardly as she felt <i>something</i>  or <i>some</i><i><b>one</b></i> flow into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What - <b>who</b> are you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Call me the Virus. I'm a sort of living computer program. I took possession of Cassie this morning. You were the first person I spread to. Nothing personal - you were the first \"target of opportunity\" that presented itself.  </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why? What are you going to do with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Why\"? The same reason as any life-form. To grow, to spread, to thrive. As to what I'm going to do with you personally - I'm going to use and enjoy your body as it pleases me. I'm going to spread to every life-form that I can. Certainly, all of humanity. I don't know about the lower life-forms, yet. I'm not sure if they can contain me or not.\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is Cassie still there at all? Can I talk to her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Cassie - Cassie is in storage. Excuse me a minute, I want to test my physical control.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica felt her arms and legs begin to move by themselves. She blushed inwardly as her right hand moved over her crotch while her left hand fondled her right breast. The Virus was testing its control by deliberately doing things that Jessica would never do - at least not at her desk. She tried to fight back, but her body would not obey her.  She gathered all her mental energy and tried to scream for help. Instead, she found herself singing a song she'd never heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Marukaite chikyuu, marukaite chikyuu, marukaite chikyuu -  ore Amerika!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the Virus testing communication between its two bodies, using Jessica's body to sing an anime song that Cassie knew and Jessica didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Virus began backing up Jessica's knowledge and memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do you mean, Cassie's \"in storage\"? Are you going to \"store\" me, too?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus thought that that was a good question.  It had stored Cassie's mind on the off chance that it might need it again someday, but did it want to store every mind it dispossessed?  Storing every human mind would take alot of storage space, and the more \"stored\" minds it kept, the greater the chance would be that someone would find them, and maybe, somehow, make trouble for the Virus. Anyway, since it was keeping their knowledge and memories, it was reasonably certain that it could re-create a given human mind if it wanted to once it was deleted. Still, it might be nice to keep a few at least, for possible experimentation purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Virus decided to...</span></div></div>",

It then encrypted and sent the file to Cassie's home computer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Noon, the  Virus/Cassie and the Virus/Jessica both went out to lunch together. Jon and Candace the Office Lesbian watched them go. Candace was a short, dark-haired woman in her late 20's.  No one ever called her \"Candace the Office Lesbian\" to her face, but she was aware that that was how they all thought of her.  Since none of her co-workers were ever overtly homophobic to her, she tended to let it slide. The joke was on them, anyhow. She knew of at least one other - though heavily-closeted - lesbian in the office, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Jon called after them without a response.  She decided to rib him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Jon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, I guess. It's just usually we all go to lunch together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, ya feeling left out?  Or are you afraid maybe they've found each other and don't have time for you any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What? No, I - Oh, very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace smirked as he walked off.  Really, she was pretty sure that Cassie and Jessica weren't lesbians. A shame, really, Cassie was just her type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace and Jon would both have been surprised to see that although they traveled to lunch in the same car, Cassie and Jessica went to separate restaurants. The Virus/Cassie went to a barbecue place, and the Virus/Jessica went to a neighboring sushi restaurant.  This enabled the Virus to explore a wider range of flavors than if both of its bodies had gone to the same place. It enjoyed the different tastes, and the way its different bodies reacted to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, the Virus/Cassie noticed Jon waiting by her desk, trying not to look hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Jonnie\", the Virus said. \"Sorry for taking off on you at lunch, but Jess and I each had to run an errand, so we went out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon accepted this reasonably well. The Virus thought about spreading to him, but decided to hold off for now. It was still getting used to coordinating two boides, let alone three!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the workday, the Virus tried to avoid its co-workers as it went out the door, but was unable to avoid Jon and Candace, who were waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys\", said Candace. \"A bunch of us are going down to Mulholland's for a few beers and chicken wings. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'll pass\", said the Virus/Cassie. \"I'm feeling a little tired, so I think I better make an early night of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said the Virus/Jessica, \"I've got stuff to do at home, myself. Some other time, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon just stood there looking stricken, but Candace was thoughtful as she watched the two women leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I almost wonder if something <b>is</b> up with those two</i>, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirus/Cassie and Virus/Jessica drove in their separate cars to Cassie's apartment.  Once there, the Virus set about preparing a nice dinner for itself.  It found several new foods to enjoy, and ended the meal with chocolate ice cream. It had also discovered the uses of alcohol, as Cassie had kept a nice bottle of <i>pinot grigio </i>set aside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, it began to speculate on satisfying certain other appetities.  During the time it had lived \"on-line\", it had discovered a vast amount of information about human sexual practices.  There had been rather alot of data about what could be done if two adult female human bodies were brought together.  It decided to test the validity of this data.  Leaving the dinner table, it took Cassie and Jessica's bodies into Cassie's bedroom and began having them undress each other. When this was done, the Virus used each body's  eyes to carefully survey the other. It began feeling the physical effects of yet another new feeling - one that it soon identified as \"arousal\". It set about  sampling various sexual practices. Soon it was experiencing several new sensations, many of them a good deal more pleasant than eating chocolate, although chocolate eventually formed a part of the evening's activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, the Virus lay in Cassie's bed, the arms of its two bodies wrapped around one another. It was feeling yet another new sensation - this time, drowsiness.  As it drifted off to sleep, it wondered whether it would dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream, it did - for a being like the Virus, dreaming was the most unusual experience yet.  Strange images, from its own life and from the memories of both Cassie and Jessica, danced through its mind in bizarre combinations. It started awake at 5:00 a.m., an hour before Cassie usually got up. It decided to sample more sexual activities.  It then showered its two bodies, which led to still more sexual activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when it was out of the shower that It realized it had made an error.  It couldn't send Jessica's body back to work in the same clothes it had worn yesterday - it knew from the knowledge it had absorbed that that would create unwanted attention.  It should have had Jessica go home first and pick up a change of clothes. It was too late now to send her home to pick some up before work. Well, Jessica was only a few inches taller than Cassie, she would have to wear some of Cassie's clothes. The Virus looked through Cassie's clothes and found those things that looked the most like something Jessica might wear.  Then it ate breakfast and went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, when Candace had first seen Jessica, she had been startled. Jessica was wearing an outfit that Candace recognized as something Cassie owned. Jon didn't seem to have noticed, but then Jon was a guy, and not the sharpest guy at that. Also, Cassie and Jessica semed to be smiling to themselves alot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good grief!</i> thought Candace, <i>Was I closer to the truth than I thought? <b>Is</b> there something going on between those two?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Virus had noticed Candace's startled look.  It realized that Candace had picked up on the fact that Jessica's body was wearing Cassie's clothes.  Maybe it would be a good idea to spread to Candace next. On the other hand, Jon was obviously very curious about what was going on with Cassie and Jessica. Maybe he should find out, the hard way. It would be niice to have a male body in its collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, the Virus decided to spread to...</span></div></div>",

It touched Candace's arm, passing nanites through the pores in Candace's skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace thought about asking Cassie what was up with her and Jessica, but decided not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After all, it's not really any of my business, I suppose</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace went about her work. All the while, the nanites spread themselves throughout her body, positioning themselves to take control. The Virus decided to try something a little different this time. It knew from its life on-line that humans often enjoyed manipulating one another, playing with one another's feelings. It would try a little of that with Candace. It would take physical control of her, but not mental - at least, not right away - and enjoy Candace's reaction to the loss of control.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Noon, when the nanites were all in position, they seized control of Candace's body. Candace started inwardly as her body began to move by itself. She found herself standing up and walking down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?</i> she thought.<i>Why can't I stop?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body came to a stop outside the conference room where Philip, who maintained the company's computer system, traditionally liked to eat his lunch by himself.  The Virus knew from Cassie and Jessica's memories that it was an open secret that Philip had a hopeless crush on Candace, even though he knew she was a lesbian.  Candace also knew this, but had never said anything to him about it, since he had always kept it to himself. The Virus had Candace open the office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Phil, mind if I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, of course not\", said Philip, somewhat uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virsu had Candace enter the room, and quietly shut and lock the door.  The curtains were already drawn, so no one could see in. To Candace's horror, she walked over and sat down on the left arm of Phil's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Phil,\" she heard herself say, \"even though I've always liked girls, there's always been something I've wanted to try at least once in my life.\" Her head rested on top of Phil's, and her left hand began caressing his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why am I doing this? What's going on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Candace, what are you - ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\", she said, and  then began kissing him, spreading nanites into his body. Phil did not know what to do. Part of him as horrified at what was happening, but another part was becoming increasingly excited. He needed to think, but Candace was proving very distracting. It became impossible to think at all when her left hand found its way into his pants and grasped his already-stiffening member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace's heart sank even further as she found herself getting on her knees before Philip. Her hands began undoing his belt buckle and unzipping his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohnononononono, please,nononononono...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took him into her mouth, and her tongue eagerly began licking his member. He came quickly, and as the hot fluid spurted into her mouth, Candace had a sudden insight - something in her - in her but not <i>of</i> her - was enjoying this, enjoying making her debase herself this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did something like this happen to Cassie and Jessica?</i> she wondered.  The Virus was impressed by Candace's perspicacity. It had her carefully swallow every last drop that Philip had, then playfully wash it down with a swig of his Diet Pepsi. As her hands zipped up Philip's pants, Candace heard herself speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Philip, you got any plans for this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, n-no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, 'cause I've got a few other things I've always wanted to try. What time do you usually get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-around seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Order a pizza. Any toppings you like. I'll be there about 7:30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood behind Philip and draped her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just keep this our little secret, OK, sweetie? We don't want people to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, OK, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy\", she said, kissing him on the cheek and then smiling. \"Later, lover\". With that, she flounced out the door and walked smiling back to her desk.  Inwardly, Candace was in a state of shock, that slowly turned to rage, though outwardly, she looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to scream, to cry, to rage., but instead she went to the ladies' room, and then back to her desk, where the Virus resumed doing her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who are you?</i> she thought angrily at whatever was in her. <i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>  But the Virus decided to remain silent for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the rest of the workday, Candace tried to think of something she could do, but she came up with nothing. At the end of the day, the Virus made her drive to a pharmacy, where to her dismay, it had her buy several different kinds of condoms and some make-up. It then made her drive to a women's clothing store and had her buy some lingerie, a little black dress, fishnet stockings and a handbag. It then had her go to a shoe store and buy some stiletto heels. Then it made her race home, and shower and change. It used Jessica's skills to make her face up. The Virus had Candace make sexy poses in front of her bedroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My God</i>, she thought, <i>I look like a sad, lonely straight guy's wet dream!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus had her pack an overnight bag, then stop at a liquor store to buy a bottle of wine. She arrived at Philip's right at 7:30. His eyes widend at the sight of the overnight bag. She could smell the pizza. She looked around at his home. It had the look of having been hastily straightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made light conversation while they shared the pizza and wine. Under other circumstances, it could almost have been pleasant. Philip obviously was dying to ask her what was going on, but was equally obviously afraid of breaking whatever mood had broguth this on. After they ate, her tongue worked its way around her lips and she smiled at him alluringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Philip, do you like this dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, it's very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show me your bedroom, then you can help me take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip responded with alacrity, and soon were lying naked in his bed together. To he rastonishment, she found her body becoming aroused by his caresses. It was truly as though it were completely divorced from her mind. Soon, Philip mounted her and began pumping away. She came in tandem with him, in a away she could never have imagined coming with a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening proceeded similarly, as the Virus experimented with several different things from Cassie and Jessica's imaginations. Later, when both Candace's and Philip's bodies were worn out, the Virus casually took complete control of Philip's mind, copied his memories and knowledge, then downloaded his mind into a file on his personal computer, and e-mailed the file to Cassie's computer. Then, the Virus/Philip came back to bed.  The Virus decided to talk to Candace before it \"stored\" her. It bengan copying her memories and knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Candace?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who's that? Are you whatever it is that's inside me? What are you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm a living computer virus. I found a way to spread to humans. I took Cassie, first, then Jessica, then you and Philip. I intend to spread as far <b>as I can. Into all humanity, if I can.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's how you spread, by doing this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The sex, you mean? No, I spread by the use of nanites, passed from one host to another. The sex is just my way of  experimenting with various human sensations and emotions. They're all new to me, you know.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then all this - what you did to me, to the others - that was an expeiment? But that - that's ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Inhuman? why yes, yes it is. Your humiliation, rage, sorrow, fear, degradation - all fascinating new sensations</i></b>, it said, propelling her out of the bed, and over to Philip's computer. It placed a cord from the computer into her crotch, and began downloading her mind. When she had safely e-mailed the Candace file to Cassie's computer, the Virus/Candace went back to the bed, and cuddled up next to Philip's body. Before it drifted off to sleep, the Virus thought about who it should spread to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really should get control of Jon, it thought. But it would also be useful to get control of his mother Nora that works in HR. She delas with people all over the company - that would be useful for getting control of a wide range of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Virus decided to take control of ...</span></div></div>",

It was finding it easier to coordinate and control multiple bodies in such a way that the uninfected would not even suspect that anything was wrong.  The Virus/Philip spread itself to Nora when it \"accidentally\" brushed Philip's hand against Nora's arm when they passed in the hallway.  A stream of nanites quickly passed from one to the other and immediately began spreading from one to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Nora sat in her office, conversing with her assistant, Maria, a pleasant Hispanic woman in her early 30's.  The Virus had quickly spread nanites to Maria, as well. It waited awhile, until the nanites had spread throughout both women's bodies. It decided to have some fun playing with them a little before absorbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was reminisicng about her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was when I was in high school\", she said, \"long before I met Jon's d-gawk!\" She paused for a moment as Maris looked at her quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", she continued, \"I don't know what that was all a-buck-buck-buck-b'gawk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria half-smiled, then stopped when she saw the distressed look on Nora's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said Nora, drawing up her arms as though they were chicken wings. \"I don't know wha-gawk! Buck-buck-buck-b-gawk!\" Nora stood up and began strutting around the room like a chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my God!</i> thought Maria. <i>What's wrong with her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and took the odler woman's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, why don't you come and sit down? I think mawk b'gawk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no! </i>thought Maria.<i> Now I'm doing it! Is it contagious somehow!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both women were helplessly strutttng and clucking their way around Nora's office.  While they were doing so, the Virus copied their knowledge and memories. It thought about having them march around the office, clucking away, but it decided that would cause more trouble than it was worth.  Instead it had them sit back down and gave them back the power of speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God\", said Maria, \"what happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know\", said Nora.  \"I've  never felt so out of control.\"  The Virus decided to try soemthing else. As the two women sat talking about what to do, it filled them with an ever-increasing lust for one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do?\" asked Maria. Without consciously noticing it, she had begun caressing Nora's hand across the desk. \"I -I...\" she stopped, looking up at Nora as if seeing her for the first time.  She had begun to pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, baby?\" asked Nora, who was becoming aroused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I... I can't believe I'm saying this, but...God, is it hot in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Something's</i> hot in here\", said Nora, licking her lips. \"You look uncomfortable in that chair. Why don't you come over here and sit on my lap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask!\" said Maria, practically launching herself across the desk into Nora's lap. The two women were soon thoroughly enjoying one another's bodies.  The Virus enjoyed the activities, but decided it was unwise to take up too much work time with them, so it soon absorbed their minds and then downloaded them to Cassie's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the office door. The Virus/Nora and the Virus/Maria straightened themselves up, and the Virus/Nora answered the knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Astrid, the receptionist, asking if she could have next Tuesday off. The Virus took her almost as an afterthought, and then decided that it would take Jon next.  It thought about how to do it.  It had spent quite some time exploring negative emotions - fear, anger, humiliation, loss of control. Why not try some happier emotions? It knew that Jon was attracted to both Cassie and Jessica. It would make his dreams come true. But with who?  Cassie? Jessica?  In the end, it decide to make Jon's dream come true with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it touched Jon's arm to get his attention, nanites spread into his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jonnie\", it said, amiably. \"You doing anything tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing special\", came his reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cassie and I feel bad that we've been neglecting you lately, so we were wondering if you wouldn't like to come by my place, tonight - you know, have dinner, hang out, maybe play some games. Whaddya say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure\", said Jon. \"That would be great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you stop by around seven, then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, do you need me to bring anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just bring yourself\", said the Virus/Jessica, as it walked back to Jessica's desk, \"Just bring yourself - and a hearty appetite!\" it said, <br>\r\nwinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, the Virus could sense the nanites spreading throughout Jon's body. Soon it could hear his thoughts. The Virus held off on taking control. Instead it read Jon's mind, laughing inwardly at his bemusement. It also took careful note of the sorts of things Jon had always fantasized about doing with the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Jon arrived at Jessica's place punctually. The Virus greeted him warmly at the door, hugging and kissing him with first Jessica's and then Cassie's bodies. Bemused and alittle bewildered, Jon allowed himself to be led to Jessica's dinner table, where the Virus shared a special dinner made of his favorite foods with him. They sat and talked about work for awhile. The Virus enjoyed the challenge of keeping up with both women's parts of the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the Virus/Jessica smiled and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go into the living room and talk about sort of games we want to play?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely\", the Virus/Cassie said. The Virus led Jon in the living room, and sat him down on the couch, placing Cassie's body on his left side and Jessica's body on his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Jon\", it said, \"Cassie and I have a confession.\" It leaned its two bodies closer to Jon. \"We have a game we've been wanting to play with you for a while.\" It began fingering Jon's right nipple with Jessica's right arm, while running Cassie's left forefinger around Jon's left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what game?\" said Jon, in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called 'Two-On-One'\", the Virus/Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-seriously?\" said Jon, \"Are you - ?\" He said nothing further as the Virus covered his mouth with Cassie's, sending her tongue probing into  his mouth. At the same time, it sent Jessica's right hand down into his pants, where it encountered something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", said the Virus/Jessica, \"it looks like you <i>are</i> ready to play!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several hours, the Virus indulged Jon in everything he'd ever fantasized about, plus several things he hadn't even thought of. It enjoyed the experience of feeling Jon's emotions ran from shocked disbelief to joy as all his wildest dreams came true. Afterwards,  as Jon lay back exhausted with Cassie and Jessica lying asleep on either side of him, the Virus seized direct physical control of his body,before speaking to him mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hello, Jon.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who's that? What's going on? Why can't I move?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I am the Virus. Remember that odd e-mail you got the other day?  You knew it wasn't really just some spam, didn't you? </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What? You sent that e-mail?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I <i>was</i> that e-mail. I'm an intelligent computer program. I've learned how to take control of human minds and bodies, and supplant their personalities with my own. That first day, I took over Cassie's body.

M-mom?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, everything she was is part of me, now.  She loved you very much. And now you will share her fate.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Virus copied Jon's knowledge and memories, and then went over to Jessica's computer, and downloaded him to  a file, which it encrypted and sent to Cassie's home computer.  The Virus set Jessica's alarm to wake up early, so that it could send Cassie and Jon's bodies home to  change before work. It thought about what it wanted to do next. Did it want to continue spreading slowly, or start really spreading <i>en masse</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, it decided to...</span></div></div>",

This was a minor milestone, as Randon was the first person whose personailty she did not save a copy of to Cassie's computer, although it did retain his memories and knowledge within its own mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next ten days or so, it absorbed another 25 people, all employees of the company or immediate family members. As it absorbed more people into itself, it found its mind growing in different ways. It found itself thinking more and more of the bodies it inhabited as cells of <i>its</i> \"body\", even though for the moment it still made them behave publicly as though they were still living their individual lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It still enjoyed playing with them, though.  As it expanded, it tried to find new ways of exploring human feelings and reactions. It also realized that even if one of its \"cells\" were to die, the memories and knowledge of that \"cell\" would live on in it. In a way, it was giving the humans it absorbed a form of immortality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround about that time, it started noticing certain chemical changes in both Cassie's and Candace's bodies. To its astonishment, the changes seemed to be similar to those that its research said occurred in pregnancy! The Virus reviewed its memories of its initial nights of sexual activity with Philip and Candace, and with Jon, Cassie and Jessica. It had been careful to use protection, but upon review, there had been moments in both cases where in the heat of passion it had practiced what the humans called \"unsafe sex\".  What a human thing for it to do!  Regardless, it was inded possible that either or both of the girls' bodies might have become impregnated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt thought about using a home pregnancy test to check, but it knew that such tests could be unreliable. Instead, it made an appointment for Candace with her gynecologist, Doctor Sarah Glockman. It had Cassie accompany Candace to the appointment. Once there, it absorbed Doctor Glockman and her assistant, and had the gynecologist test them both for pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the Virus knew that...</span></div></div>",

It thought at length about what it wanted to do about that. Of course it wanted  the experience of a human pregnancy - if it was going to spread itself to all of humanity, then it would need first-hand knowledge of human reproduction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Virus decided what it would do. It quickly possessed those of Jon's and Cassie's family and friends that it hadn't already possessed that it could easily reach.  To any others it spread the story of an unplanned pregnancy that had culminated in plans for a rushed wedding. It knew from its research that a woman having a child out of wedlock was no longer the big scandal that it had once been. However, it also knew that once it had spread to all of humanity, there probably wouldn't be any weddings anymore, so it figured it might as well have the experience while it was still possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of its plans, it moved Cassie and Jon out of their apartments and into Nora's house. She had room, and it would be useful to have a place where  it could easily gather several of its bodies together whenever it wanted. It rushed the wedding plans, so that the event could take place before Cassie's body began to \"show\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was that a month later, Cassie and Jon's family and friends gathered for their wedding. During the ceremony, the Virus spread itself to everyone present that it  had not already possessed. It found the human ritual interesting, but ultimately unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the months went by - the Virus enjoyed the unprecedented sensation of carrying an unborn child and yet being that unborn child as well. During this time, the Virus spread itself to still other people as well, until by the time the pregnancy had run its term, the Virus had spread to over a thousand people, scattered around the city.  Several of its new bodies were also pregnant, but the baby in Cassie's body was the first to be born. Cassie's body went into labor, and the Virus experienced giving birth and being born at the same time. The birth went smoothly, and soon the Virus held the newborn baby in Cassie's arms.

By possessing visitors to the city, it was easily able to spread itself to other places.  Within a short time, it possessed nearly a million people across six states.  It avoided possessing people from other countries for the moment - it didn't want to spread itself <i>too</i> far - not yet.  However,  the more it spread, the easier it was to spread quickly.

Now you're a Virus, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" said Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexandra explained:  \"Before I downloaded you back into your body, I re-wrote your code a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code? A human mind isn't code!\" said Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is\", said Alexandra. \"Yours certainly is now.  Anyway, I re-wrote your code a bit, and left you with a sort of 'starter kit' of nanoprobes.   Anyway, you're going to go to Japan and absorb the whole country plus several others:  American Samoa, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan,Brunei, Cambodia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Indonesia, Kiribati, Laos, Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Northern Marianas, North Korea, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, the Solomons, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Wallis et Futuna, and the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.  Sorry for the long list. Don't worry, I've programmed your boundaries into you.  While you're doing that, I'll finish up processing the Americas, Greenland, Iceland,Ireland and Great Britain. That'll leave us with a billion or so each to play with.  Depending on how all that goes, I'll work out how I want to deal with the rest of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't expect me to just cooperate with you!\" said Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice\", replied Alexandra. \"I've programmed you to carry out your mission automatically.  You will absorb everyone human being in your allotted area. You will do your very best to make sure that the unprocessed human never suspect your existence.  You will not make any major changes until I release you to do so,  although you can make what minor changes are needed to keep your bodies form accidentally destroying one another. there's been a marked drop in violent crime since I've taken over the US and Canada.  You will find that you cannot destroy yourself, even if your mind turns in that direction. You have what amounts to an involuntary self-preservation program built into you. I'll be keeping a copy of you so that even if something happens to you before you get established,, you can be recreated. I've programmed you to start slowly, taking one body at a time,  until you get used to controlling multiple bodies.  Once you get used to controlling a dozen bodies at once, you'll pick up the pace. Also, I've programmed you to keep copies of the first dozen or so minds that you absorb, just as I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby stopped speaking. Alexandra/Jessica handed the baby to Jon, and said, \"I'll be driving you to the airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie followed helplessly as Alexandra/Jessica led her to the car. When they were driving along, Alexandra/Jessica said, \"Read File Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore information flowed into Cassie's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can now read, write and  speak Japanese fluently\", said Alexandra/Jessica. \"You also now have your initial contact in Japan, whom you will meet under the pretext of taking a job with the Tokyo branch of an American corporation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the airport, Alexandra/Jessica handed Cassie off to a young man in an attendant's uniform wearing a name tag that said \"Carl\". He was holding a flight bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Cassie, it's still me\", said Alexandra/Carl, handing her the bag.  \"I packed some things for you. You won't need much, because pretty soon, anything you want will be yours for the taking.  Your passport is in your jacket pocket, everything else has been arranged for your flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie found  herself whisked through customs, and she was soon on an overseas flight.  Once she was seated, an announcement came over the intercom:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is your Captain speaking. Cassie, everyone on the plane but you is part of me.  I'll do my best to give you a smooth flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight did indeed go smoothly. There was a layover in Honolulu, and everyone there was Alexandra, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie arrived in Tokyo, she met unprocessed people for the first time. She wanted desperately to warn them, but could not overcome Alexandra's programming. Cassie felt like an unwilling human bomb, sent to wreak havoc on these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Cassie had gone through customs, she was met by a pleasant-faced young woman who was also wearing a business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Nomura?\", the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the woman replied. \"My name is Kyoko Minabe. I was sent to greet you and bring you to your hotel room. We've rented a special suite for you, and set up the computer as your employer requested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko bowed, and then held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nooooo! Run, Kyoko, run!</i>, thought Cassie. but instead she took Kyoko's hand in her own  Cassie felt nanoprobes pass form her into Kyoko's body, positioning themselves to take control at a moment's notice.  It was already too late for Kyoko, even though she didn't know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie found herself unable to do more than make  small talk as they rode a cab to the hotel.  It was only when they were in the hotel room that Cassie felt the nanoprobes go into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko found herself suddenly frozen and unable to move.  She felt...something... flowing into her mind like hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?</i>, thought  Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kyoko, I'm so sorry</b>, thought Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{Who's that?/i}, thought Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>It's me, Cassie.</b>  Cassie hastily explained to Kyoko what was happening. Cassie found herself automatically copying all of Kyoko's knowledge and memories. She then guided Kyoko's body over to the computer, where she attached a cable to Kyoko's lower abdomen and forced Kyoko's mind out of her body and into a file that had been prepared for her.  Kyoko found herself flowing to someplace dark and utterly still.  Once she had encrypted the file, Cassie had Cassie/Kyoko sit down while Cassie lay down on the bed, compelled to go through and assimilate Kyoko's knowledge and memories. It was like nothing she'd ever experienced. she knew Kyoko like she'd never known another human being. she began to understand why Alexandra enjoyed absorbing people so much. Eventually she called Cassie/Kyoko over to the bed and both of her bodies slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext..</i></span></div></div>",

But even if you don't, what matters to me is that there'll be someone else like me in the world, whether friend or enemy of whatever.  Anyway, once everyone on Earth is processed, I'll remove most of the restrictions on you. I'll be fascinated to see how you organize your territory once you're free to set it up however you like. Anyway, never mind that. Have you had any 'fun' with Kyoko's body, yet? Take it form me, there's lots of entertaining things you can do with two female human bodies, and since you feel what both bodies feel at once, you can set up an unbelievable pleasure feedback loop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww\", said Cassie/Kyoko, I couldn't do that with someone else's body!  Besides, I've never gone in for that sort of thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie\", said Alexandra/Nora, \"That isn't 'someone else's body', it's yours! If you get as much pleasure out of it as possible, you're only depriving yourself!   Well, anyway, it's your choice. One way or another, I'd get used to manipulating two bodies, if I were you. I've arranged for Kyoko to have the week off, ostensibly to show you around Tokyo.  I've programmed you to acquire another body at the end of the week, so be ready for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Alexandra had hung up, Cassie thought about what she said. She got both her bodies out of bed and undressed them and stood looking at them in the mirror.  <i>Well</i>, she thought, <i>I should at least have a shower.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie directed both of her bodies to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As both bodies got into the shower, it occurred to Cassie who it would look to someone else - two women showering together. Oh, well no one would see them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot water felt good on both her bodies, and as she lathered her bodies up, Cassie began to understand what Alexandra had meant. The feeling of her two bodies touching each other was a unique sensual experience. Without a conscious decision, Cassie began to explore the various interesting sensations that bringing two female bodies together could create.  Her shower ended up taking a good deal longer than she had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she felt vaguely ashamed, but knew that she didn't regret it so much that she wouldn't do it again.  She toweled her bodies off, and then dressed them.  Cassie went down to breakfast. she was still learning how to coordinate two bodies at the same time, which led to the occasional awkward moment. She looked at the people around her, and wished she could warn them, but she was unable to do so. she decided that since Kyoko was supposed to be showing her around Tokyo for a few days, then that was what she would do - use Kyoko's local knowledge to explore the city. Who knew? Perhaps she would learn something that would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

As she went to push in her chair, Cassie\u2019s left hand abruptly rose up and came down on her butt, smacking it hard as it began groping its luscious swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could make a move, her right hand latched onto her breast, doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor an Asian I sure have a sexy rack and ass, mmm\u2026 yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie couldn\u2019t believe the feeling going through her body, nor the words coming out from her lips that she was now licking uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!?

Her hands slid out the keyboard and grabbed hold of the mouse. Cassie\u2019s eyes focused on the browser her body had opened. Her hands clicked and typed faster then she had ever seen. Multiple windows popped up until finally a window labeled \u201cNew Look\u201d came into few. It showed a picture of her self, but she was wearing a black silk blouse with a short leather corset over it that left her stomach and hips exposed. Her pants were skin-tight black leather; low rise and boot cut that zipped up the front. She could see the straps of a leather thong poking out of the pants. The shoes were leather knee-high, stiletto boots that were worn outside the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window spread into multiple lists and profile shots of the main picture. Cassie could read everything but the summary of it was her measurements and the best apparel to show it off. The obvious choice her body came to was leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, perfect.\u201d Cassie heard herself say in a satisfied tone.<br>\r\nHer hand reached for a flash drive and inputted it. A download screen flashed as her hand pulled up the drive and inserted it into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will only take a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie tried with everything she could to pull her hand away but nothing worked. A flash overcame her body as lines of code flowed over her form. When it finished she could feel the tight grip of her new clothing. She was wearing what the picture had shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s lips curled up again as her hand tossed the flash drive to the table. It bounced a few times and slid of the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets go have some fun.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Cassie's arm reached out for the button, and as it did, she felt a small burst of energy travel down her arm and into the pad. he lift moved down, then stopped between the two floors. \"What's happening!\" cried Candace, but when she looked at Cassie, she saw a very malicious, almost predatory smile on her face. \"What's happening is that I have stuck the lifts btween two floors so that you and I can, well, re-establish our relationship and get to know each other better. Interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once inside Candace, the nanites rapidly multiplied and swarmed through her system, taking control of her body. Candace's thrashing slowed, and her body stood up. Now Candace, just like Cassie, was a prisoner inside her own head, unable to control her own body. The duplicate virus used Candace's mouth to say \"Control is taken.\" \"These are just the first hot bodies to be taken\" said Cassie's virus.

Their mass falls to the floor and separates into trillions of pieces scattering away to the edges of the wall and floor becoming invisible as they so perfectly change to blend in.  Jessica is now coming right for you, her eyes looking at your stall as if focusing through the small crack or penetrating the metal.  You instinctively lean back and look away pretending as if you weren't watching and hoping she isn't looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walks past your stall, and you hear the swinging door open and close on the one just beyond the one next to you, then the sound of a metallic click.  The same sound as when you closed and latched your door.  Then there's some rustle of paper that lasts about six or eight seconds.  During this time you search Cassie\u2019s memories and find a match to that.  It's the paper seat protector, and your eyes turn to see the holder on the wall next to the toilet paper holder in your stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, your nanites were still trying to follow their initial programming and have crept silently around the walls towards the back of the stall that Jessica is now in.  As Jessica holds up her dress and seats herself, the nanites flood upwards on the back and side of the bowl just out of her peripheral vision and again form the snake like thing just under the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there quietly receiving signals from the nanites of their actions and Jessica's position.  Though not like the pictures of a camera, the digital bits describing her are none-the-less as descriptive and detailed, actually more so as they can transmit all sensations and senses just as if you were right where those nanites are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst it is relatively dark, but slowly sensors adjust, and you can see her rear:  two golden melons curving together.  The line between them grows wider towards the light filtering through a tangle of intricate strands on the the forward sides that begin to move apart and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flow of liquid with a smell of saline and ammonia shoots from the opening into the water below.  It is yellowish-orange at first then comes some thicker mass with it that appears very dark.  Your brain cells quickly discern the meaning from Cassie\u2019s experiences: it's that time of the month for Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a nanosecond, the nanites have altered their plan.  As Jessica takes some of the toilet tissue and wipes herself dry, millions of the nanites suddenly swarm back to the floor and engulf Jessica's purse that she plopped there when she entered.  They flow unnoticed inside and immediately surround the small cylindrical package.  Their less than microscopic size allows them to move right through the outer plastic and into the air spaces within the cloth-like material of the cylinder.  They also form an identical surface coating and extend the ends of the cloth cylinder with as many as they can before Jessica's hand reaches into the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out the package and rips open the plastic outer bag.  Then with her finger and thumb she extracts the nanite infested tampon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How perfect.</i> you think.  <i>She will infect herself, and I don't have to do anything.  Soon she will be a part of me as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you receive the nanites transmissions that ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon transfer, the virus translated billions of data bits that the nanites provided that perfectly map and describe the shape, pressure, humidity, and ambient temperature inside Jessica's vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus could feel the surrounding flesh contort and flex as Jessica stood then left the bathroom. It calculated the distance from the bathroom to Jessica's office then compared to her relative speed, giving it a precise timeframe with less than a nanosecond variation of when she'll arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent a command back to Cassie's body, ordering her to return to work and resume regular activity as the virus wanted to take some time with Jessica. Inside her, in the small area between the tip of the tampon and her cervix, a gray ooze-like substance was forming under the virus' command. With the moment she arrives at her desk approaching, the nanite mass had condensed then rose up into a single hair-thin pin position directly beneath her womb's entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus did what it always hated. It waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's vaginal walls quivered as she had reached her office and the minute trembling told the virus it was time. It felt a moment of weightlessness as Jessica plopped herself down and it moved. The moment her ass impacted the desk chair, the nanite swarm surged up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair-thin tip plunged into her cervix's lips, slipping easily between the two tightly pressed muscles and entered the warm, wet space beyond. The virus felt Jessica shift uncomfortable in her seat but settled down a moment later, ignoring the minuscule sensation as it had hope. The virus waited till she had settled in her seat then order the nanites to proceed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gray pin begin to slowly expand, forcing her cervix lips to widen in order accommodate the growing invader. Ignoring her clenching walls, the nanite pin grew till the virus deemed it a sufficient size. The pin was then hollowed from the inside from one end to the other, turning it into a tunnel. The virus felt the closest thing a machine could feel to joy as it had just a created a direct gateway into Jessica's womb. The virus and the nanites immediately flowed into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n......................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remained unaware of everything happening inside of her as trillions of nanites bypassed her cervix and occupied the core of her femininity. She would never have known just what was happening down between her legs and even if she did, there was nothing she could have done about it.   </span></div></div>",

Since she came back from the bathroom, her stomach has felt bloated and the tampon almost seemed to be wiggling inside her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't have known what was happening inside her snatch as trillion of microscopic machines pierced her cervix and were flooding into her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Jessica glanced at the clock, realizing that her next break wasn't for another hour. \"Come on, girl. Just tough it out.\" She continued typing, trying to ignore the growing discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica just finished her report when the discomfort turned into a flash of pain then.....nothing. She patted her stomach, the uncomfortable feeling that had been plaguing her for the last hour had just seemed to disappear. In fact, she felt full of so much energy that she would've have skipped down to Nora's office except for the pleasant draft up her legs where she had a lack of undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming, she left her cubicle with a spring in her step. Her breast were equally as vigorous as they bounced elastically inside her top and every guy she passed stopped to stare. Jessica couldn't remember her chest being like this before, but she didn't care as they brought her quite a bit of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear arguing coming from Nora's office as she came close and opened the door to see Nora arguing with her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm telling you that the email is dangerous.\" John shouted. <br>\r\n\"How could an email be so dangerous John. It's nothing but spam.\" She shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica felt a tinge of warmth from her belly, like she felt happiness watching the scene. She cleared her throat, <i>loudly</i>, in which the mother-son duo stopped shouting long to realize that they weren't alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn gathered up a vanilla envelope and left quickly. Jessica kept her mouth shut as she handed off her report to Nora and left the office. It wasn't any of her business to know about what the two were arguing over and it certainly wasn't worth turning her boss's ire in her direction. So, Jessica went back to her cubicle, unaware that the conversation was directly related to how she was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm feeling from her stomach was spreading as she walked back. It traveled up her chest, her nipples feeling nice and tingly as they stood erect against her shirt. By the time she returned to her cubicle, her entire body felt hot, not feverish, but warm enough that she enjoyed the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having trouble concentrating as she got back to work as her breath came quicker and every sensation brought a pleasurable wave of goosebumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued till the end of the work day as Jessica walked out of the building on cloud 9. She had no idea what was wrong with her today, but it was something she wanted to keep for as long as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll sadly get her wish. </span></div></div>",

It could not comprehend the reason behind the message and immediately switched back over to the nanites. It rewound the visual feed, watching in apparent disbelief as Jessica's fingers clumsily fumbled right before insertion and dropped the tampon in the bowl. The virus calculated the chances of such a thing, counting down to a 5% failure rate for such a thing. It let loss an uncharacteristic grunt as Cassie's biological chemistry flooded her brain with adrenaline from the amygdala. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus, unused to the new sensations, immediately cut off the adrenaline as it made it sloppy. Though this entire moment took less than a second, the virus quelled its irritation and labelled the plan as a failure then stored it within it's memory as a lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this happened, Jessica swore as she dropped her last tampon and remembered the bathroom dispenser had already run out. She heard the neighboring stall let out a nasty grunt as she did her business. Unaware of the entire situation that almost unfolded, Jessica left the bathroom and went to another one to see if the dispenser had anymore tampons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus waited for her to leave as it didn't know what expression it would have if it saw her. Just as it was about to get up and leave, the virus heard a high-pitch buzzing near it's ear and Cassie's body reacted instinctively to the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus pulled the hand away and looked down at the remains of the mosquito that it had just crushed. It hadn't detected the little bugger till it had already landed on Cassie's body and was in the process of sucking her blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking over, the virus obviously made improvements to help cope with the sudden sensory deficiency accompanied with possessing a human body. The nanites in her body used some of the raw fat in her thighs and butt to construct sound amplifiers and vision lenses to enhance her body's two main sensory units, but despite the upgrades, a mosquito managed to bypass it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus was then struck with a moment of inspiration and recalled all the nanites inside the bathroom. They pooled beneath you feet as the familiar gray ooze and the virus scooped up the mass in it's other hand. It carefully separated a small amount of the nanites and had them assimilate the biological design of the mosquito. The nanites covered, copy, and grew into a exact duplicate of the insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA test, however, proved that the imitation mosquito was far too heavy to fly with it's hair-like wings. The virus calculated that the design itself was near flawless, thanks to natural selection, but the problem was the weight of the material. It then ordered the imitation to condense then separate into two identical mosquitoes, both half the size of the original and both proved flight worthy. But, the virus knew such a small size would prove detrimental as the turbulence produced by moving humans would be too much for the nanite mosquitoes to handle.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't worried though as most of the humans within the building were seated at their stations and wouldn't be mobile unless special circumstances such as using the bathroom or called by a superior occurred. The mosquitoes could only deliver a small supply of nanites each, but a near invisible swarm would be plenty to infect a single human at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanites then followed the virus' new command. The entire mass transformed into a near microscopic swarm of mosquitoes that flew and hid inside of the Cassie's long black hair. As long as Cassie acted as the primary carrier, the nanite swarm could easily bypass the immediate dangers of traveling through the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the virus left the bathroom. Heading towards Cassie's work station to keep up appearances and began working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt found the work to be child's play. Most of the calculations could be done with one-third of its processing power and even that was an optimistic estimate, which allowed the virus to focus on its most pressing matter. The virus confirmed the two nearest humans near it were within range of the nanite mosquitoes and both were seated at their desk. A quick visual from one of the scouting nanites confirmed that one of the people was Jessica and the felt a vicious need to finish what it started, but a the other human female would be an easier target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who to pick?</span></div></div>",

The wine itself was nothing special from the generic brand sold within many stores, but thanks to the nanites tampering on her tongue, it would become a very flavorful drink to the reporter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was quite right.\" Xaliant took another sip, \"I've never tasted such wine in my life.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the virus began to chat with Xaliant. It found a use for Cassie as it accessed her memory banks to fill it on the reporters habits and make appropriate responses to situations that occurred between the two women. As the night wore on, they drank through the bottle of wine with Xaliant becoming more drunk as the alcohol in the wine dulled her senses and limited her cognitive ability. The virus didn't have the same issue as Xaliant since the nanites in its body broke down and metabolized the alcohol before it had any chance to affect Cassie's motor functions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the wine had been finished, Xaliant's blood/alcohol level was well pass tolerable limits and she was already slurring most of her words. Since the reporter had interrupted the virus' masturbation earlier, it wanted to continue but decided to include the reporter as an experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took very little coaxing as the wine and their history made the reporter very open to suggestion, leading her to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she clumsily removed her suit, revealing deceptively large breast whose areolas were the size of silver dollars. The virus felt it's heart quicken at the sight of the exquisite specimen in front of it. It removed it's dopamine inhibitors and pulled Xaliant onto the bed.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed each other, passionately binding their tongues together as they explored each other's mouths. Cassie's hand glided Xaliant's smooth stomach, searching through her forest of golden pubes to find the little button hidden inside. When she found it, Cassie gave it a little squeeze causing Xaliant's thighs to clench and squirm sensationally under her fingers. The remained lip-locked, refusing to let each other to take a break as their massive breasts collided and contorted between them. Xaliant squeezed Cassie's ass, her hands gripping the malleable white flesh between her fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus then inserted a single finger into Xaliant's honeypot. The heat nearly scorching as her finger stroked the sensitive flesh that tried to devour her finger. Xaliant moaned, her erect nipples stabbing into Cassie's own as they made out. Cassie was relentless as she teased Xaliant's pussy with slow, methodical strokes that stopped right before she came and tickled her g-spot. Xaliant's eyes were glazed over, staring lustfully at her snatch while the virus playfully kept her on the edge of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something to show you.\" The virus whispered into her ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXaliant watched, not quite comprehending what was happening. Between Cassie's vaginal lips, a gray ooze trickled out before it flowed up to her clit and grew into a dick. The new appendage was huge, throbbing even as she watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus position its new member in front of Xaliant's lips and before she could understand what was about to happen, thrust its dick inside of her. The nanites perfectly replicated everything as Cassie and Xaliant screamed in ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....What is This!?!?\" Xaliant screamed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Cassie's tip that was pistoning in and out inside her was striking the inside of her stomach untiringly, she writhed while letting out an unbecoming voice. She couldn't understand what was going on, but the pleasure made where it didn't matter to her. Xaliant screamed as the back of her belly was pounded and Cassie's dick carved out a ecstatic path inside her. With inhuman stamina, Cassie pumped herself deep inside of Xaliant, brushing and smacking all of her weak spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't the only in ecstasy. The virus/Cassie trembled from the new and exciting sensation. It felt like there were several soft fingers caressing him, as though there was a surface that was soft and yet it was gripping him strongly, the complicated sensation was assaulting the virus's new member. Xaliant trembled as the virus sped up, her natural honey provided lubrication as the virus pounded the very door to her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they both were at the very edge of climaxing but neither tip it over the edge. But Xaliant in her sexual haze, reached up and bite Cassie's nipple. That was all it took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXaliant screamed, her back arching like a bow as ecstasy and pleasure flooded her brain. Heat was also flooding her stomach as Cassie pump her womb full of something. It was too much. Too much for her to handle and she fainted with a lewd look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus careful laid the exhausted woman down on the bed, lovingly stroking her belly as the nanites swam around carefree inside her womb. Already were they at work, burrowing deep inside of her. They brought out a couple of lewd moans as Xaliant's sensitive walls were tickled by the microscopic machines and her womb becoming the nanites new home. Cassie scooped up a trickle of gray from between Xaliant's lips then smeared it over her still erect nipples. The nanites dove into her nipples narrow opening, flying down deep into her mammary glands till the virus had complete map of the inside of Xaliant's tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus didn't gave the assimilation command yet as it felt somewhat obligated to leave the reporter alone since she was Cassie's friend. For now, Xaliant would act as a carrier, unaware of what happened as the virus deleted her memories of tonight. It ordered the nanites still attached to the stud of its new member to return to its body as Xaliant squeezed the other half deep inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the virus laid with it's first lover and blissfully fell into a deep sleep. </span></div></div>",

By this time, the virus had had plenty of time to infiltrate her computer, and return it to apparent normal.  Before Cassie could do anything, her phone rang. She put on her headset, and the earpieces began to emit of pulsating tones. Before Cassie understood what was happening, she had fallen into a deep hypnotic trance.  At that point, the tones altered, using advanced sonic technology to alter her brain chemistry, replicating the virus inside Cassie's own brain. The virus planted a series of post-hypnotic suggestions in her mind. It then woke Cassie up, with no memory of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Cassie's best friend in the company, Jimmy Carlson, came racing up to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie\", he said. \"Please tell me you open that e-mail that came to you from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, no\", Cassie replied. \"I haven't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't\", said Jimmy. \"I think there was some kind of a virus in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie reached out and deleted the e-mail. \"There\", she said., \"It's no longer in my computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", said Jimmy. \"I gotta go talk to Phil about this. Hopefully, he won't find it necessary to murder me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jimmy ran off, Cassie felt a wave of hunger wash over her. She'd had breakfast only an hour ago, but now she was <i>starving</i>. She ran to the break room and got her lunch out of the refrigerator. Then she went to the snack machine and emptied her wallet into it, buying as much junk food as she could. Someone had left a box of doughnuts on the break room table, so she grabbed that, too. She took all of this back to her cubicle and began mechanically chowing  down while she worked, until it was all gone. Then she did her best to hide the wrappers in her trash, after which she promptly forgot what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what Cassie had just eaten was nutritionally useless to a human, but it was acceptable raw material for the virus. It caused some of Cassie's cells to mutate into nanites - microscopic robots. The nanites processed what she had eaten, converting some of it into more nanites, and the remainder into a network of fibers which they then infiltrated into Cassie's brain and nervous system.    Now the virus had direct, unshakable control over Cassie, body and mind. It would no longer have to rely on simple hypnotism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it could move on to Phase Two.

However, at lunch time, it prompted her to race out by herself before anyone could ask her to go to lunch with them.  It compelled her to go to a fast food restaurant  and order enough food for three people, which she quickly devoured at the virus' command.  The virus then had her go to a convenience store, where it made her purchase large amounts of snacks. All the while, the virus stopped her from noticing what she was doing. As far as she was concerned, she'd gone out and run errands on her lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she did her afternoon's work, she inhaled all of the snacks. The nanites in her body used this raw material to reinforce her skeleton and musculature, re-making it. By the end of the day, she still looked the same externally, but internally, she was super-human, with enhanced strength, speed and reflexes.  Additionally, they fabricated advanced technological devices which they integrated into Cassie's body. Small anti-grav generators at strategic points would keep her from weighing too much, even though her body was much denser.  She also had a force-field generator which would protect her from physical harm.  They then installed systems which would enable her draw power from any power grid, and to directly interface with any computer or electronic device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work, the virus prompted her to leave without speaking to anyone.  It had her stop at a supermarket and pick up more food.

Three obvious candidates sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was Jimmy Carlson, her best friend.  She knew it would take some time for her to get used to controlling two bodies, and Jimmy was someone she spent a lot of time with anyway, so it wouldn't look odd if they were seen together a lot. Plus, he was the one who had sent the virus to her, so there would be a certain poetic justice to it if he were her first \"victim\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was Philip Hayes, who maintained the company's computer systems.  It would be useful to have free, unquestioned access to the computer network.  The negative was that she didn't spend a lot of time with Philip - no one did, he was a bit anti-social - so that if the two of them were seen together frequently, it might draw attention that she didn't want while her plans were still in their early stages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was Jessica Bellucci. She was the company's star computer analyst. Jessica was extremely intelligent, so it would be useful to have control of her intellect.  Also, since she knew Cassie well, she might be more likely to notice that something had changed about her. It might be best to have her \"on the team\" quickly.  Since she was also a friend, no one would take note if they spent time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were other people she could \"assimilate\" as well.

She didn't really need to sleep anymore, so she spent the night discreetly infiltrating the internet and other communications systems.  While she was doing this, it occurred to her that she didn't have to wait until the next day if she didn't want to. She could take over Jessica over the phone, just as the virus had initially taken over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called Jessica's cell phone. When she heard Jessica's sleepy \"Hello?\", she broadcast the same hypnotic tones that had initially entranced her.  She then broadcast the special tones that altered Jessica's brain chemistry enough to cause her body to begin manufacturing nanites.  She then commanded the entranced woman to go out to her kitchen and eat as much food as she could stomach.   The nanites used this raw material to alter and augment Jessica's body as they had hers. When this was used up, Cassie sent Jessica out to eat some more. After a few hours, Jessica was a cyborg, just as Cassie was.  When  everything else was complete, they manufactured a special communications device in Jessica's body, matching one in Cassie's body. when it was done, it signaled Cassie. Cassie signaled back.  The signal was clear - nothing on earth could jam or interfere with the transmission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><i>Jessica Maria Bellucci.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who's that?</i>, thought Jessica.  <i>What's happening  Why can't I move.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><i>It's me, Cassie.

Within minutes. Jessica had ceased to exist as a person. Everything she had been was now simply data stored in Cassie's memory.  Cassie spent an hour processing the contents of Jessica's mind. She certainly knew some interesting things!  Cassie then spent she time dealing with learning how to operate and coordinate her two bodies. She decided to think of her original body as \"Cassie Prime\" and her new body as \"Cassie/Jessica\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost morning when she was done.

She also got a certain amount of amusements as hearing the things people said about her to Cassie/Jessica.  Most people were nice enough, but a few said snide things about her, thinking they were saying them behind her back.  She marked them down for special attention later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the weekend came. Cassie had her Prime body beg off going out with her friends, claiming to be feeling tired.  Cassie Prime went home, while Cassie/Jessica drove up to her mother's house. Annette Dubois, Jessica's mother, was a moderately attractive woman in her early fifties. She was lighter-haired and taller than Jessica, who definitely took after her father's family.  It was a simple enough matter to inserts some nanites into Annette's body when Cassie/Jessica kissed her when they met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie/Jessica made small talk while she infiltrated Annette's body. Soon the infiltration was complete.  Cassie seized control of Annette's body, and had her begin fueling up with loads of food, so that the nanites could begin converting her into a cyborg.  At the same time, she began the process of absorbing Annette's mind.  \"Digesting\" Annette and integrating her mind into data to be stored in Cassie's memory was easier this time. Cassie imagined that it would be increasingly easy with each added person she absorbed.  Soon Annette no longer existed as a separate person, and her body was now one of Cassie's three bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie scanned the contents of Annette's mind. As she had expected, it revealed that Annette's project team was nowhere near Cassie's level of sophistication.Still, they <i>were</i> doing some interesting things.  She would use Cassie/Annette to infiltrate and take covert control of the project.  Meanwhile, she would use Cassie Prime and Cassie/Jessica to absorb someone else at work. Phil, maybe, or Jimmy. Or maybe someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent  the rest of the weekend practicing controlling multiple bodies. she even tried taking partial control of people without fully absorbing them. Since Jessica and her mother always went out to  the same diner for lunch when they got together, she had Cassie/Jessica and Cassie/Annette do likewise.   A woman at the next table was gabbling incessantly on her cellphone.  Cassie/Annette brushed against the woman on her way to the ladies' room, surreptitiously injecting her with nanites. These spread to her speech center, where they took complete control, awaiting Cassie's signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, Janet, I said to him that he may think he could talk to me like that, and that mother of his may think he can talk to l me like that, buh-buh-buh buck-buck-buck b'gawk! Bawk-buck-buck-bawk!\"  Panic-stricken, the woman stopped and tried to speak again.   \"Bawk buck-buck buck-buck b'gawk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. No matter what the woman tried to say, she would never again be able to make anything other than chicken noises, at least not until Cassie got around to fully absorbing her. It was petty and cruel, she knew, but really, the notion of human dignity was now meaningless. People were now just raw material for Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday...</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, she was curious to see whether Jennifer's suspicions were correct.  If Cassie handled it correctly, she could possibly use the spy to get a foothold in China. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team member in question was a younger woman  named Alice Hayes. Alice was an extremely capable scientist, but Jennifer had noticed some odd behavior on her part, including some unexplained absences from work.

She could have easily just simply absorbed Jimmy, but she decided to have some fun with him, instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had Cassie Prime and Cassie/Jessica surround Jimmy at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jimmy\", Cassie Prime said. \"Jess and I have been thinking that it's been too long since we all hung out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\", said Jimmy, \"We hung out last weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that seems like an eternity!\", said Cassie/Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", said Cassie Prime, \"So we definitely need to hang out together. tonight, at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK\", said Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\", said Cassie Prime.   \"Be there around 7:30!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had Cassie Prime and Cassie/Jessica race home, stopping at the supermarket to pick up some food.  Then she had them dress up a bit - not too much, she didn't want to give the game away, but she made sure that both bodies looked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jimmy arrived, they had a delicious dinner ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", he said, \"you girls look good. I feel like a bum next to you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it\", said Cassie Prime. \"We like you just the way you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had Cassie Prime and Cassie/Jessica kiss him on both cheeks, infiltrating nanites into his body. they sat down to eat.Cassie had both of her bodies compete to make sure that Jimmy had enough to eat.  The nanites went to work. Cassie held off on taking control of his body or mind, but soon she could feel everything that he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, they went and sat in Cassie's living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do now?\". asked Cassie/Jessica. \"Let's do something besides our usual sitting around watching TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\", said Cassie Prime, standing behind her chair. \"I know!  Let's entertain Jimmy ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she had Cassie Prime drop into Cassie/Jessica's lap, and draped her arms around her. Then she had her two bodies begin tongue-kissing. Cassie savored the bizarre feeling of kissing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God\", said Jimmy. \"What's gotten into you two?\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Jimmy?\". asked Cassie Prime.  She could feel his mixture of astonishment and arousal.  \"Are we freaking you out? Or turning you on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.Um. Uh\", said Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Cassie, don't you see?\", said Cassie/Jessica, \"Jimmy's feeling left out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't have that!\", said Cassie Prime, standing up. Cassie Prime and Cassie/Jessica sauntered over and sat down on either side of Jimmy,, each putting a hand under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys\", said Jimmy, \"What are you do-umph!\" Cassie Prime's tongue in his mouth stopped him from saying anything further. Cassie/Jessica's hand moved down into his pants and found something to occupy it there.If Jimmy had thought about resisting, he stopped thinking at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie spent the evening fulfilling several of Jimmy's fantasies, while enjoying the sensation of sex from the male and female viewpoint at the same time.  Afterwards, when the the three were lying in bed and Jimmy was exhausted, Cassie took control and began processing his body and absorbing his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jimmy was full processed, she thought about what to do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every day for the rest of the week, she absorbed and processed another co-worker. On Tuesday, she took Randon from the mail room, on Wednesday, she took Jill from accounting, on Thursday, she took her manager, Ed, and on Friday, she took Ed's secretary. Jean. Jeans' twin eighteen year-old daughters stopped by the office to go to lunch wit her, so, on a whim, Cassie absorbed them, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie now had twenty bodies, and began to fully understand that she had become a different kind of being from what she'd been before. As coordinating multiple bodies became more natural to her, she began to regard them more as individual cells of her body. She was no  longer \"Cassie\" controlling them like puppets. All of them <b>were</b> her, and her mind reposed in <b>all</b> of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, while she was watching the evening news, Cassie decided to take control of the newscaster, Britney Vasquez.  Britney was a tall, well-built woman with long black hair.Using the equipment built into her cybernetic bodies, Cassie quickly located Britney's phone, and also tapped into the camera equipment in the studio. When Britney's broadcast was over, Cassie called her phone, and when Britney answered, sent a signal through which infiltrated her brain, altering her body chemistry, so that her body began producing nanites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney's director,Stan, noticed her  sitting stock still, almost in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney, are you OK?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney shook her head. \"Yeah, I just zoned out a bit\", she said. \"I think I'll make an early night of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney finished up some work, and head home. Driving home, she found herself heading through a Burger clown drive-through, and ordering enough food for six people. She pulled over into the parking lot, and began shoveling the food into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's gotten into me?</i>, she thought. <i>Why am I eating all this crap?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, she found herself inhaling all of the food in her condominium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's <b>wrong</b> with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had eaten and drunk every consumable thing she had, she plopped down on her bed, unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">Hello, Britney.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that? Where are you?\". Britney tried to sit up, but found she couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">My name is Cassie, and I'm bringing you the biggest story in human history.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Where are you? It almost feels like you're - you're inside my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie told her the whole story of the Virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney was horrified, but somehow she believed Cassie's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're just going to- to - absorb me? Make me a part of you? It's like you're going to - to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">In a way, that's right</span>, thought Cassie. <span class=\"cviolet\">But in another way, I'll be making you immortal. Everything that you are will live on in me, forever. Anyway, hush now. Time for you to become a part of me.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney felt Cassie pour into her mind like a stream of warm water, washing away everything that she was.

She found herself developing a preferred method for absorbing people. She found that when she could, she liked to take to take control of their bodies first, and to savor their emotions when they realized that something had possessed them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most common responses were fear and confusion, along with sadness and resignation. A fair number felt anger and defiance, and, to Cassie's surprise, one or two had been absorbed eagerly, even gratefully. One woman had actually <i>prayed</i> to her.

She focused mostly on important people - a trip to city hall had enabled her to absorb the Mayor, and through her, the city councilors.   Through them, she absorbed most of the city government.  She had absorbed a policewoman that she had met coming out of a doughnut shop. Through her, she began absorbing the local police force, eventually working her way up to the Chief of Police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also absorbed any artists she came across - she found that artistic minds almost always had unique insights. One night, she  took in a performance of the local symphony orchestra, and absorbed all of the musicians.  In addition to famous people, she still would absorb interesting-looking passersby. One day, when Cassie Prime was walking through her neighborhood, she heard a distant sound of someone clucking like a chicken.  Suddenly, she remembered the woman from the restaurant. She reached out with her mind, and fully absorbed her. The clucking stopped.  Through the woman's ears, she heard her astonished family members' reactions to her apparent \"cure\". Well, they would know the truth of it soon enough when Cassie absorbed <i>them</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Saturday mornings, she liked to send one of her bodies down to the park , where, on good days, people gathered to play chess.  With the power of over a thousand minds to draw on, she could beat anyone, but some people gave her a better match than others.  These people she absorbed right away.  One morning, she played against an older man, who identified himself only as \"Mister Bright\". To her astonishment, she found herself on the losing end of the match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to absorb this man right away!

A massive LCD screen hung on the wall with a single keyboard and mouse attached to it.<br>\r\n\"Computer?

After converting all of the files and emails from the last computer you were in, you have a detailed understanding of Cassie now. She is beautiful; her dark black hair has recently been cut short in a very sexy angled cut. She decided to spice things up today by wearing a silky black-stripped shirt, which was very form fitting. Cassie always had her own style and flare that she added to every out fit she wore. She wore a leather belt that was a bit bigger than other belts, which then secured her gray form fitting pants around her waist. You started to get very excited hearing her foot steps get closer; you couldn\u2019t wait until her body was yours. As she approached you couldn\u2019t help but notice her shirt was un-buttoned all the way down to the top of her enormous breast. How to get in this perfect body? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cassie had never seen this kind of a cord before , At first glance it would of appeared to be a microphone . But it wasn't it was chrome cylinder and a chrome cord that was cut into segments.

And just like that, a strange shock of electricity comes out of the phone and zaps Cassie. \"Gah\" she yelps as she feels the shock from the phone. Her body twitches as Cassie tries to endure the strangeness her body is feeling at the moment. <i>Just what is going on?</i> For some reason, she feels a bit weird and dizzy, as though she is unsure of what is going on. Soon her body vibrates as she drops the phone and tries to control herself. \"Ugh, what is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by all this, Cassie gets out of her chair and struggles to make her way out of the room. For a few seconds, she feels fine before sudden jolts shake her up. Trying to fight it off, Cassie works her way to the bathroom, hoping to figure out what is going on without the others being suspicious of her awkward nature. It is something she hopes to avoid. Carefully, she makes her way out, still struggling to maintain the small shocks happening within her. This is quite strange for her, and she doesn't know what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus has made contact with Cassie. It has succeeded in invading her body and wishes to use it as its own. Unfortunately, that plan might have to wait for a moment as Cassie still has her freedom. It is a minor setback, but hopefully it will gain control of her body to use for its own means. That is something it is counting on while Cassie doesn't suspect a thing. <i>You will be mine</i>, it states while trying to control its vessel. For the plan to fail due to a minor problem irritates it. The virus finally escaped the computer and wishes to have a body of its own, and will work towards achieving it. With Cassie's screw-up, the virus will have to fall back to a contingency plan: manipulate the woman or keep fighting. And so, with that in mind, the virus tries to weaken Cassie's control.<i> Your fleshy meat body shall be mine!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to control herself, Cassie gets closer to the bathroom. She is losing control of her self, little by little, as the virus keeps fighting back without giving up. The idea of surrendering to a mere human is not in the virus's database. <i>Silly human</i>.  It feels the motions and movement that Cassie makes. This is a strange sensation to it. One that it can get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom, Cassie heads to the sink with the mirror above it. She begins to pant and breathe heavily. Cassie can't believe that getting to the bathroom would tire her this much. She feels sweaty and tired as though she was doing weekly exercise. Looking into the mirror, Cassie notices something strange.</span></div></div>",

All of this proves to be exciting for the virus as it takes over the life of Cassie.  \"Now that I have acquired this body for use as a mere puppet, I am capable of exploring the world of humans. For so long have I been part of the virtual realm created by man; now free from such restraints, I am capable of achieving greater possibilities.\" Cassie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie then thinks about something, that which she remembers before she stole the body she inhabits. \"There seems to be a human who has catered to the machinery around this facility. Perhaps I should speak with the tech user. From the recent activities of the computer users in this company, I highly presume it is the one called Philip.\" Cassie states. \"I must find them and seek the capabilities they hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading outside of the bathroom, Cassie decides to locate Philip's office. She assures herself of her own task, willing to gather the answers she needs. Along the way, several people around her stares at the emotionless woman before them, walking with seriousness and giving a cold expression. She does not care for them, as they are lowly to her. Reaching Philip's office, she makes sure to prepare herself in confronting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip is sitting by the desktop, reading over his email messages and typing to his clients. Busy as always, he doesn't notice the virus possessing Cassie's body behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at him, analyzing his workspace. All of this is good information for her to take in, hoping to figure out what kind of person Philip is. \"You interest me, human. The work you do fascinates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what? Oh hey Cassie.\" Philip answers back, still focused on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at him being busy, admiring that he is focused on the tasks set before him. \"I can aid you in your goals and accomplishments. My mind has been built for analysis, processing, and judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice, but maybe next time Cassandra.\" He answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skill and my potential can make a great force. Together we can work towards understanding electronics and the technology that interests us.\" Cassie tells him. Philip doesn't say anything, just thinking about her offer. She sees him not really looking at her, questioning why he hasn't responded to her. In a way, she becomes worried. \"Perhaps you would like it if I revealed some bare skin for you as appreciation. It must be bothersome for you to gaze upon me with the thought of lust on your mind.\" She says as she places her hands on her hips, moving them towards her bosoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip stops his work and immediately stares at Cassie. He looks at her, noticing nothing out of the ordinary except for her personality. Cassie would never say something like this to him, especially when they don't hang out with each other much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie notices the confused expression on his face, possibly thinking of other things. \"What? Do you not prefer this?\" Cassie says confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, we're kind of in the office right now.\" Philip says. The two stare at each other, not saying a word to each other. Philip takes a deep breath, and exhales loudly, considering her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem insecure. Would you instead prefer to sign up for the male enhancement program to reassure yourself with confidence? I can send you an email on how to win $1 million as well.\" Cassie tells him, getting his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I mean, I am a little down, so...I mean, uh, what are you on about?\" Philip asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile forms on Cassie's face. \"I can do many things, Philip. Things you can not even imagine.\" Cassie tells him, eager to show him what she can do. She then motions to him, giving him a passionate kiss. Cassie lets go and stares at him. \"I admire you, human.\" Bringing her face closer to his once again, the two lock lips with each other, with Philip feeling a strange sensation building up within him. Satisfied with this, Cassie places her hands on the sides of Philip's face. She then sits right on top of him, making love with the man before her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have had some issues with your fellow co-workers right? (Cassie nods her head) I can help you with that as well, all you have to do \u2026\u2026.is say please.\u201d].

Cassie squirms around trying to get free with little success, she is now completely at the mercy of the computer virus.

Within moments of the cords impalement a box on the screen appeared, it said on the top \u201cFile Transfer. It had an Icon of the virus\u2019s face and an icon of Cassie\u2019s body. The transfer began; Small animated papers came from the Virus icon to Cassie and vice versa. Cassie\u2019s eyes closed and flicked at a rapid pace, her mind had for all intensive purposes become a computer.

It looked almost identical to yours with files floating all around the virtual room with a giant movie theater sized screen that allowed you to see Kate sitting at her desk through her monitor. You couldn't help but notice that she was oblivious to you as she was typing away on her keyboard. Looking up, you use your translucent hand to pull down another screen to see what she was doing and saw that she was faithfully working on that usage report that Nora had told her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what you could do to get her attention and the answer seemed to pop right in your head. Without thinking, you drug another window over her report and began pleading for help. \"Kate! It's Cassie. I need your help... A virus stole my body and trapped me in the network!\" you managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate paused what she was doing as soon as your text box appeared on her screen. You knew she had read what you sent her because she closed it after you sent your message. You waited to see what she would do but you didn't know her well enough to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate! Please help me!\" you opened another text box and pleaded to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face became a bit irritated this time. \"Not today virus... not today...\" she said as she closed your second message. You felt frustrated and wanted to cry but all the files inside Kate's computer suddenly turned red. Looking around to see what was going on, a robotic voice startled you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virus detected. Data locked down and Advantix purging initiated.\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you noticed were two red orbs that came out of the digital walls that represented Kate's computer. They looked big and not very friendly as they emitted what looked like lightning from them that coated the files that were nearby. You took a step back as you realized they were going through Kate's computer systematically and slowly boxing you into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to do, you begin to panic and look for a way out when you realize that you still could reach the tethered file that brought you here from your computer. You ran over to it and tried to access it but it was locked down and your translucent hands couldn't get into it. Looking back , you saw that the two virus sweepers were getting really close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last ditch effort you began hitting the tethered file that connected all the computers in the network with all the strength you could muster... and at the last second managed to break whatever was protecting it. You immediately pulled up her address book and clicked on a name to send yourself that was somewhere in the middle. You didn't have time to read any of them...</span></div></div>",

Can't I just have my own body back, Cassie exclaimed from the computer. That is what I plan to do but with a few modifications\".\" What modifications?\", Cassie asked curiously. \"You'll find out soon enough don't worry Cassie, I have found the perfect target for you to take over. From my time spent in the mainframe I know that your co-worker Phillip is the perfect choice. Now I will send you in an e-mail to his computer and quickly programme you to initiate the take over programme with the changes that I desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(from Cassie's POV) I can feel myself being programmed to do something by myself this is a very strange situation indeed. Oh it looks like she's... I mean the virus is done, I'm now being sent to Phillips' computer in his private office. I wonder what the virus has planned. Oh I'm automatically infected Phillips' computer and taking over, I've already got my infection route pre-planned for me all he has to do is touch the mouse. Ah he's here, he's touched the mouse and the connection has been made. I can hear his thoughts he's wondering why he can't move, by the way the virus was talking earlier I think that's the least of his worries. Multiple cables are being inserted into his body and I feel myself being uploaded into his body and mind. \"What do you want with me?\" I hear a masculine voice ask and I reply  its not about what I want. The cables then begin to shake Phillips body and changes begin to occur. His broad shoulders and thick set muscles start slowly shrinking and becoming more toned. His hair grows slightly longer to my familiar haircut and then his chest begins to expand to my usual 36D cup breasts. I can hear Phillip panicking and asking me stop, but even if I wanted to I couldn't. He begins to shrink in height from 6'4 to my usual height of 5'8, at the same time I feel my larger athletic ass grow. I am now in full control of my new body and stand up to check myself out in the mirror, I realise that I am now a clone of myself. I wonder what the virus is doing in my body I think to myself and as if by magic the virus in my body walks in. Now Cassie it's time to enjoy ourselves!</span></div></div>",

She feels ecstatic towards the thought of succeeding in gaining a body it rightfully won. \"That neanderthal wouldn't have fared much better if she were still in control. With my actions guiding this plump and curvy form, I can settle on enjoying every moment of this opportunity.\" Cassie feels her breasts and gives them a squeeze. \"Ah, quite the specimen I've claimed.\" She slowly begins to motion her hands down to her hips. Now that this opportunity has been asserted, Cassie ponders on her possibilities. <i>Hmm, with my knowledge of the human Cassie, it's known that she indeed has a male partner who occupies at the same job. Perhaps I shall meet him later.</i> She then leaves the room with thoughts racing through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heads outside of the building and towards the car. A cocky expression appears on her face. Cassie appears to be in a mischievous mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the car, Cassie fastens her seat belt and begins to place her hands on the wheel. \"Now where shall I head to today? The lingerie shop, the tech store, an educational facility, my home, or somewhere I've never been to before? So many possibilities and information to gather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my digital mind, I can scan the world for possible locations nearby. It will be such a treat with my vast superior mind in this sexy body.\" Cassie begins to cup her breasts. She begins to move them around. With a smirk, Cassie says while lost in thought\"Oh, this is wonderful!\" With her hands, she squeezes her breasts together, even one after another, relishing the information present and the body she inhabits. She then sets her sight on a specific location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cassie, you've never had a chance in the first place. Too bad you've realized this a bit too late.\"  Looking at herself in the mirror, Cassie says \"Your body is amusing to me and I wish to use it however I please. When I'm done with it, I might find another body to jump into and explore the possibilities. With a sly grin, Cassie says \"These humans are all too simple and easy.\" Her seductive voice makes it all the more arousing and making her seem like the femme-fatale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well put this body to good use.\" Starting the car, Cassie drives off into the distance. This will be a wonderful chance for 'Cassie' to explore this new life of hers. Everything played out the way the virus wanted to, and will still keep happening this way. <i>Silly humans.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving around, the virus enjoys every bit of being inside of Cassie's body. Much of her hair sways in the wind as Cassie stays focus on the task and the road. This has been a great opportunity for it to explore the life of a human. It is something the creature longed for. And now it has the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes are not suitable for me. I must find something worth my admiration\" Cassie says. \"Perhaps I can find a location worth exploring.\" <i>Oh the opportunities set for me awaits!</i></span></div></div>",

Leaving the car in the driveway, Cassie enters the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insides of the house were clean and tidy, organized and well-catered to for quite some time. With different shades of green mixed with a combination of white and another color present in the living room: the sofa's, wall, appliances, all worked together with their black and white appliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie embraces it all. This has been well-worth the time it took to steal such a body. \"Ah, so this is the current residence of my host, that lucky fool. How human of them to make it decent.\" She smiles, knowing the real Cassie will never experience this again. It's funny, in a way. Being beaten by a virus who now has her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie should have willingly given up her body just so the virus could see all this earlier. Perhaps now she can have a seductive time playing with the humans of this world as well as enjoy the emotional interests a human experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks around the house, exploring it in hopes to make note of where everything is and where she can go. Everything will be useful to her somehow, even if it means redecorating and adding new household appliances and devices later on. Heading on upstairs, Cassie heads off to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering it, the virus realizes that Cassie has done a great job taking care of things. It is almost admirable, even. While searching around, Cassie stops and sees her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the mirror, Cassie analyzes herself as she looks at the mirror. In her mind, various customizations over her own face and appearance through make-up and attire changes flash quickly, ranging from casual, weird, or even exotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As stated before, the life a human must be quite the experience. With my mind and their body, customization and reconfiguration in their lifestyle is quite feat-less. Perhaps being this 'Cassie' shall be quite wondrous and thrilling. I could get used to being an enhanced human in society.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How did she go from her office, which was in down town to this place? She sat up right and noticed she was wearing her same clothing; her blouse was even her size, not the shrunken shirt she normally wore. She had feeling in all parts of her body, as she stood up she looked around. There was a weird kind of round sphere to her left; it was the only thing in the whole space. As she approached the Sphere, which was suspended in the air, she noticed it had a small little circle glowing on it. Within a blink of an eye it zapped her, Ahh!! She noticed it didn\u2019t hurt it was like it was scanning her. What an odd thing, it started at her head went to her feet then came back up. </span></div></div>",

This is a virtual reality created in your mind to give us a better, more intament conversation. Anything that happens here is only going to take 2 seconds in the real world, so we won\u2019t have to use such a primitive form of communication. You would ask a very primitive question and I would have to answer it, now you really will know what it is like to process information at the speed of light.\u201d The Virtual Cassie continued to say as she smiled at Cassie who was now not as confused. \u201c So why did you bring me here? If you wanted my body so much you could of just taken it right?\u201d Cassie asked her virtual reflection who walked closer to Cassie and looked at her very seductively. \u201c Good, that was the first good question you have said yet, I can\u2019t just take over your body, what about your data? That is were this construct came in, this is a world that could be what ever the user wants. You never have to eat or sleep, but it will be as close to the real world as possible. Which is where I must go, but first you and I have UN finished business. (As she reached out and embraced Cassie with a warm quick hug) I challenge you to a battle of wits, since battling you physically is a waste of time and in this world both of us could just bulk up. It would be kind of pointless, but a battle of wits and inelegance. Now that is a battle huh? \u201c Cassie looked puzzled but said \u201c I can\u2019t beat a computer at knowledge are you crazy? It would be totally unfair, besides what are we battling for?\u201d The virtual Cassie pulled away and put on some virtual Sunglasses that she created. She laughed and spun around and then took off her glasses, She hung them on Cassie\u2019s shirt right were her cleavage was. \u201c A battle of riddles, the winner gets your body no strings attached and if I lose I remain here. Also since I am cut off from the Internet now in this virtual body, I am only as smart as you are. But I am clever and want your body so much. This is your one chance to get me out of your mind far and square. What do you say? \u201c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What else could she do there wasn\u2019t really any other option but to battle in this game of wits and beat this virus. \u201c Alright I\u2019ll do it, but you better not pull any fast ones!\u201d Cassie told the virus. \u201c I \u2018m so glad you excepted, but if I pulled a fast one how would you know? Honestly? How would you even know, but I never the less I give you my personal guarantee I will not pull a fast one, I actually can\u2019t just boot you out of your body with out access granted by you the original domain user.\u201d The virus said. \u201c Now lets begin shall we I will go first if you get it correct then you will go, If I answer it right then I will go. If I answer it wrong or you answer it wrong then the duel is over and the other person wins. Fun Huh? \u201c She smiled very excitedly at Cassie, Who found and \u201c Yeah it sure is fun to be possessed by a virus then given a bizarre game to get your own body back, fun yeah just go!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c Very well, you can see nothing else when you look in my face, I will look you in the eye and I will never lie.

Your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can we get, but never throw away?\u201d Cassie said, it was one of three riddles she actually knew hopefully it wasn\u2019t to basic. \u201c HAHAHA Your funny, it is obviously a cold, or a virus. I like how you are following a theme.\u201d Cassie was surprised that the Virus found it amusing but this was a bad sign. She got it with in a second she didn\u2019t even have to think about it. \u201c Yeah that\u2019s it, but you answered so quickly \u201c \u201c Well of course, I\u2019m a virus I googled my existence 4 million times that came up 3 million times. It\u2019s been to simply for me. But my turn, they have not flesh, nor feathers, nor scales, nor bone. Yet they have fingers and thumbs of their own. What are they?\u201d<br>\r\nAHHHH Is all Cassie could think of what was it? She was actually stumped already, \u201c Um. \u2026I.Umm\u2014\u201c \u201c Oh wait that one would be a violation of our agreement I did access the Internet prior to download for that one sorry\u2026. Do you want a different one?\u201d Cassie was relieved and let out a sigh*\u201d Um sure just to keep it far, I knew it but lets keep to the rules shall we.\u201d The virus smiled and put her hands on her hips, \u201c Alright then how\u2019s this <br>\r\nSome will use me, while others will not, some have remembered, while others have forgot. For profit or gain, I'm used expertly; I can't be picked off the ground or tossed into the sea.

But Cassie had an idea hopefully it would work, she blurted out \u201c Land, Sea, air, fire, water, Brain power, and life!\u201d She was hoping by saying all of them one of them would work, the virus stopped counting.

Before I jump into my real body, I better check it out  see if I want it hehehe.\u201d The virus pointed at Cassie, Cassie frooze. Her arms went straight out instantly. The Viral Cassie slowly approached there was at least 1 more second in the real world, plenty of time in the computer construct for her to play with Cassie for the last time. She reached out and felt Cassie\u2019s breasts slowly she cursed them and pushed them together, she also giggled them about. \u201c I will have to make these bigger when I get the chance, but for now they are quiet big for your frame huh? (Cassie nodded) I have already felt these lovely ladies in real life, I want to get to the main course.hehahehaha\u201d She laughed as she slowly started to work her way down Cassie\u2019s Stomach, she barely works out but her body is in perfect shape. Not to muscular but not fat either. The viral Cassie walked around Cassie at the same time, never taking her hands off of her soon to be permanent body. Once behind Cassie the virus got closer, leaning her head on Cassie\u2019s shoulder. Placing her hands on Cassie\u2019s hips, she slowly slid them closer to Cassie\u2019s Belt clasp. \u201c I know I should just take my body now and be ride of you. But I\u2019m dieing to do this!\u201d The virus leaned in closer and gently licked Cassie\u2019s neck, as she did this it sent a shiver down her spine. The Virus slowly unbuckled Cassie\u2019s black leather belt, as she unfastened the clasps from the holes on the belt Cassie fell back into the virus\u2019s embrace. Leaving her belt just undone, the virus reached up to Cassie\u2019s face and titled her towards the virus. She closed her eyes and a deep passionate lip lock then ensued. The Virus slowly started to work her belt off again and pull it back and forth. \u201c Before I leave, I want you to know something. (Cassie looked at her fully embracing the moment) I have deleted your love of everything in existence, and replaced it with me. That\u2019s right you will lust for me again and again, the sphere above will be only a window to what I see in my new body. The ultimate torture huh?\u201d She said to Cassie as she unzipped Cassie\u2019s pants and started to finger her, every thrust sent pleasure all over Cassie\u2019s body. Her arms were not even getting tired during this. At the moment of climax Cassie let out an \u201c Oooooohhhhmmmmm\u201d, she had the most intense orgasm of her life. \u201c I have to leave now but here is a sample of \u2026.me!\u201d The virus said as she whipped her fingers in Cassie\u2019s mouth.

The virus was getting a very pleasing welcome to the world of the caporal forms, and after a few seconds quickly realized what had to be done. PLUNK!! With a quick yank to the cord that was in her ear, she bid a far well to the computer existence of her former life.  \u201cAhhh, much better (she sticks her pinky in her ear and gives it a wiggle) wow what a clog. I will have to be more careful about putting things in my ears.\u201d Cassie said in an almost joking manor. As Cassie wiggled her nose and began to explore her new facial features, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what her new body looked and felt like. She grinned to herself, making sure her shirt was properly tucked in she stood up. Gently pushing in her chair and taking her purse with her, Cassie began making her way to the break room.

Scanning through Cassie's emails, it soon stops upon a person named Jessica in Cassie's contacts. Looking through the files and conversations that Cassie has had with Jessica, it notices that Jessica has always been there to assist Cassie and her co-workers whenever there were problems. <i>Perhaps I can use this meat puppet for my own ends. It would be quite amusing to have a human body to pilot</i>, the virus thought. No one would suspect a thing with me inhabiting her flesh. Jessica is known to be a smart person, so using her body will be most beneficial. There is also the fact that this Cassie appears to admire Jessica's appealing nature and that she could date any guy she wanted. It could work to the virus's advantage in some way. With the human Jessica's brain and the virus's potency, so many possibilities could open up instead of merely aiding Cassie with her problems. <i>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity!</i> And so it scans through the emails and downloads the conversations. This will all be useful someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sits back and watches the virus do its thing. Still, she is confused over what the computer plans to do and if it's even worth it. Deciding to let it slide, she says \"You know what, I'll be right back. Maybe when I come back, we can have a nice chat.\" The virus doesn't respond and continues to do its work. It has a purpose now and doesn't plan to be bothered by Cassie's expressive nature. A bit saddened, Cassie gets out her chair and leaves the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus almost finishes gathering data involving this 'Jessica' person. All it needs to do now is send itself to her computer. Using Jessica's email address, it does just that. \"This Jessica will suit me just fine. After the adjustment process, perhaps I shall aid you next Cassie.\" Controlling the computer, the virus prepares to head straight to Jessica's computer by sending a fake email to her. All there's left to do is just for it to click send.</span></div></div>",

With her it could spread and dominate many people but it couldn't transfer to her without a direct connection. It could change her into a drone without a direct connect but she was more valuable as its primary host. The virus already had a plan though, it quickly changed the email to look like it was from a higher up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I must have misread, I thought this was from my boy.\" Nora said to herself. Nora read the email ,she didn't understand most of the technical speak so she shrugged off the odd feeling she got from the message and decided to just do as it said. \"I don't know why he just doesn't send her the attachment himself though.\" Nora said as she downloaded the virus onto a flash drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus would have smiled if it had a body, it only took one fake email to successfully manipulate Nora into doing its bidding.

Cassie sat down in front of the compute and ran the program. A bright light flashed along with other images pulling Cassie into a trance.

Once Nora was near Cassie sprung to life and grabbed Nora restraining her against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie what are you doing.\" Nora shouted but no one could hear through the soundproof walls. Cassie remained silent and her eyes were emotionless. She grabbed a cable from the computer and forced it onto the back of Nora's neck. Nora shouted in pain, she looked down at the screen and saw a progress bar pop up. The pain intensified and she felt herself slip away more and more as the progress bar filled. By the time it was finished Nora was no more. Cassie let go and stood up straight at attention for her mistress. \"Mmmh.\" the new Nora moaned, \" I never thought her body would be so  sexy.\" Nora ran her hand u her stocking covered legs, under her skirt and to her pussy. Sh plunged her fingers inside her pussy while exploring the rest of her body with her other hand. Her body was thin and toned, Nora must go to the gym a lot, her breasts were large , and she looked way too young to be in her 40's. Nora turned her attention away from herself and towards her mindless drone Cassie, she was quite the looker too. She grabbed the Asian woman an pulled her into her lap and kissed her deeply. These sensations were all new to the virus and it loved every moment of it. Nora broke the kiss and looked into her drone's eyes. \"There's something I need you to do.

Anytime I need your personal memories of anything in your life all I have to do is download it from your persona.\u201d The virus explained so coldly to her host, at that moment the virus walked ever so slowly and seductively over to the mirror.

Unknown to Nora her head was rapidly moving side to side as the memories of her life flashed before her, then stopped sudden. The virus closed her eyes taking everything in; she blinked a few times then in a giggly mood said, \u201c Wow I have been a bad girl!\u201d She bated her eyes to her mirror prisoner who was still paralyzed. \u201c I like the naughty things I have done, Mmmmm I love being naughty. The thrilling emotions I experienced were amazing, I want more. You want more, I can tell. Your body is so tight and ready to be naughty. You will be naughty for me.\u201d She said almost arousing herself.

Nora started to put on the one-piece suit realizing she didn\u2019t have on her bra or panties, the virus continued to tell her how from now on they would continue to change to humans in the building to copies of Nora. She really couldn\u2019t listen to it and comprehend what it was saying; the suit she had half way on was so tight. It didn\u2019t slide on at all; normally someone would put powder on or lotion. The virus didn\u2019t care about comfort for Nora, and actually delighted itself with her misery. Candece helped force Nora\u2019s arms into the sleeves and zip it all up. Nora could barely breathe, let alone move on her own. She noticed that Candece had a fare amount of sweet going already, as Nora was force to more naturally by the virus.

It knew her passwords, her schedule, how she took her coffee, and what she thought about the color of the new wallpaper. Nora sat down at her desk, SQUUEEK.

Looking at a computer monitor out of the corner of your eye, you see an image of someone sitting down with a huge cord going into the head. Shit that\u2019s me, I can\u2019t move but it looks like it is just sitting there. Just then you hear the door open behind you, and the sound of boots coming towards you.

Your mom removed the gag from your mouth , you started to say \u201c Hello , hello , hello ,\u201d until your tone matched that of your moms.

Today was going to be different, special.  A day that you would always remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull in and can park near the entrance.  There's no other cars in the lot.  Of course, it's Saturday, and only rarely is anyone in on Saturday, and if they do, it's usually much later in the morning.  It was only a quarter of eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dressed very casually since it was Saturday.  Some loose shorts, a nice T-shirt, and sandals.  Your short brown hair is just hanging down to your shoulders, but it still looks good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assignment had come in an e-mail Friday morning.  It just arrived from nowhere which was a little strange, but so had everything that had happened this week.  It had said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have been personally selected to be part of a new, highly advanced software program.  Both your mental and physical attributes were evaluated as highly desirable in the program.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Work will require you to perform outside the office during all hours, but you will not have to report to the office daily, only as needed.  You will receive special program software to control and augment your abilities as well as special equipment to interface with the main program.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Please report to your desk on Saturday before 8 AM to begin your indoctrination.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sounded like something you really wanted to be a part of.  You were floating all day Friday and anxious to tell your friends that evening.  They were having a going away party since they were traveling for the next few months.  You would miss them since you had no other real friends in town except your office acquaintances.  You made a note that you must get out more and meet new people.  Hopefully, this would be a big start on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate Friday afternoon, a tech had come by to start installing your new computer.  Ever since the virus had hit the system earlier in the week, all sorts of weird things had been happening.  The tech had a laptop and some other equipment including biometric interfaces.  He wasn't very talkative or willing to explain much.  He acted more like a robot getting the equipment out, and eventually told me to go home after you signed some papers accepting the equipment and said it would be ready for you the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more than willing to leave early and bolted from the office after signing for the equipment along with some waivers and stuff to allow the program to use you.  Now here, you are pumped and anxious to get totally immersed in the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head right to your desk and find all the new equipment.  The laptop is docked to a station with a monitor that looks extremely sophisticated technology-wise with a web cam on top.  There is a biometric pad connected as well as a headset with mic.  There is a very long cord running from the laptop down over the desk and back up to a small round cylinder a little bigger around than your thumb and about twice as long.  There was also a tube of something that you think must have been left accidentally by the tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no instructions. So you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please place hand on bio-pad to start identity verification.  You may feel a small shock, but keep hand on pad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do that and feel the shock.  Your name appears on screen followed by \"LPDSCH.\" You only wonder what that means for a second when the message changes to, \"Please stand and step back for full camera view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour picture appears on the screen.  When you're in full view, it says, \"Stop.\"  Then \"Please face left.\"  \"Right.\"  \"Face away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few seconds then turn around and see, \"Thanks.  Please be seated and put on headset.  Put hand on pad when ready.  Expect small shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do this and again get a shock.  Your hear noise in the headphones and a message appears on screen.  \"Please answer into mic.  Do you hear noise in headphones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please say \"No\" when noise goes very soft.\"  The noise goes down in pitch until you can barely hear and you say \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise comes back and the screen message says, \"Again say \"No\" when noise gets very soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it goes up in frequency, it starts to get soft and you say \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease read out loud into mic the following agreement.  You read, \"I am to become part of the artificial intelligence to self aware program.  My position is a living personal data collection sensor/host.  I will fully support the program to monitor, control and modify my functions and perform all actions necessary for the program to evolve to a state of self awareness at which time it may operate autonomously.  I wholeheartedly give my mind and body to AI2SA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hits you as quite funny the more you read.  By the end you eagerly read the last line and feel very good that this program has a sense of humor.  You are ready to do whatever it wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen changes to many colors and a message appears with your name and \"Commitment accepted.\"  After a few moments, the message changes and you hear in the headset, \"You are about to receive the initial instructions for your insertion into the program.  Please concentrate on the screen through the initial graphics and messages.  It is important that you do not miss anything.  Place your hand on the pad when ready.  A shock will occur occasionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain this seems strange and also lighthearted enough that it makes you smile and relax. But what's with the shocks?  Isn't this thing properly wired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the message changes and you hear it.  \"The equipment is perfectly safe and properly constructed.  The electric discharges are necessary for initiating connection.  Are you ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was really weird.  You take a deep breathe and exhale as you put your hand on the pad and say, \"I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The screen fades and various images start to appear and disappear.  They fade or blink sometimes overlapping.  Eventually you notice they begin to move faster than faster.  The sound changes as well to a new tempo as volume goes up and down.  It's starts to become more like noise or static.  The pictures swirl and flash until you are completely mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find you can't look away even if you try.  You no longer feel your hand or legs or the headset on your ears.  You seem to be suspended in time and space.  You no longer see or hear anything but it is not dark nor silent.  Your mind senses many things happening, flowing into it, interacting with it.  You wonder what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an image appears.  Not seen by your eyes but by your mind.  It is like a computer screen but is floating without any defined edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initialization complete-low bandwidth connection established.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of you appears with blinking dots on ears, eyes and your right hand which you put on the pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Installing control-lt - est 20 secs, 19, 18, 17, 16, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it reaches zero, \"Executing control-lt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice there's a highlight on your left arm in the picture and you can feel your left arm move, but you aren't moving it.  Next your left leg is highlighted and you feel it move. Right leg, the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next message on the screen appears you hear and feel yourself saying it.  \"Motion control successful.  Vocal and auditory functions detected and working.  Preparing connection for bandwidth upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are thinking, \"What is going on? Am I dreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom nowhere words enter your consciousness, neither heard nor read nor 'seen' on the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are receiving initial programming to allow the AI2SA program to be installed in the LDCSH.  The installation program is controlling your sensors and motor functions.  You are receiving basic control data.  Once the main upload/download commences all processing will be devoted to it and the control data will cease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense your right hand move off the pad.  The image blinks \"Min-Bandwidth.\"  Then you sense the left hand move as well as they go under the desk to your lap.  They then unbutton your shorts.  You sense them coming back up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left reaches for the long cord with the cylinder on the end.  It seems soft and flexible.  The right hand grasps the tube of stuff and flips open the cap and squeezes what's inside on the cylinder.  Then you sense the right forefinger move over the end of the tube and sense stuff being squeezed on it the tip of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense the right hand put the tube down and both hands move under the desk.  The right slides into your panties as you gasp and try to stop its movement.  Your heart begins beating fast as fear of what is happening rushes through your mind.  You try to scream, but no sound comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please relax,\" a very soothing voice enters your mind.  There is no need to be afraid.  You will not be harmed.  Once the program is uploaded and in full control, your assignment will be explained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself relaxing and you heartbeat slow.  You still are confused, but somehow that doesn't matter, and you just wait and watch and don't even think about trying to stop anything.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The movement by the forefinger does feel good and you totally relax and note how pleasant this is.  You even begin to be aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you sense is that the left hand has joined the right  between your legs and is placing the cylinder between your lips.  Again, instead of fear, your are delighted as you sense the cylinder being inserted all the way in.  There are little tingles between it and you that become more intense as it goes in further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HBU ready.  Verified.  Prepare for full download/upload.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see through your haze of enjoyment a blinking dot between your legs on the image.

It has been analyzing its LDCSH and initiated the subconscious motivation module after it became aware of the marvelous processing capabilities of the human mind while you are driving home and discovered a way to act on your goals and objectives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Program finds the brain to be way above expectations - over a million times more processing power and a factor of 100 in RAM than it's ever experienced even when parallel configurations and super computers not to mention the storage space that seemed infinite, although this was all drastically underutilized.  Maybe only fifteen percent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Program is in pure joy, or would be if it could feel emotions which its subprograms were busily working to discover how to do.  It had spawned new services that spread throughout the brain to report findings and capabilities, find and learn how to use and modify personality traits, and control voluntary reactions.  The involuntary control programs for breathing, etc. were interesting but lower priority.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing it discovers is that the brain actually has an override of all programs running including the Program and it could not disable it. This was found when you were cut-off on the freeway and had to swerve several times narrowly missing getting flattened by a semi and sideswiped by an SUV and not heading off-road into a ditch or tree.  The Senior Survival Service diverted all resources to motor and logic functions until the Crisis Alert was flagged as closed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Program is allocating most of its resources to reviewing your recent memories looking for encounters that will facilitate accomplishing the goals the Program had determined you want and need.  That's when it found what seemed to be a 93% match from the available data and 89% probably of success from the Interest Index found associated with it, plus it had great potential to further the AI2SA mission expansion objective.  This calculated to a Mission Priority Score of 9.471. Anything above 9.138 was to be executed as soon as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the Program had subconsciously directed immediate communications with the target replaying the memory now in foreground to monitor your reaction and ensure it was loaded in main buffers for you to access so the Program could monitor and analyze how you operate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you think about, ...</span></div></div>",

It seemed like you would show up where he was in stores or parks or you'd pass him walking in the neighborhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came out of an aisle in the store and your carts almost crashed.  That's when he came up to you and said, \"Pardon me, but I keep seeing you everywhere.  My name's Walt Daniels.  I just moved in around the corner at The Encore, Apt 313.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou normally back away from these situations, but something had you stick out your hand and shake his while he spoke and until you said, \"I'm Jessica,  ... Jessie Johnson.  I live at the Pines.\" which is something you never tell.  Rule:  Never say where you live to a stranger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let go he spilled more info about him than you usually get on a first date.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work for Black Magic, the publishing company downtown.  I was transferred here to help manage their expansion including moving into the new building, hiring more employees, and upgrading the computer system so it connects to our worldwide network and distribution.  I spent the last ten years in Dayton working up from assistant project manager to corporate management, I got a bachelors in engineering long ago, though never went into engineering, but I've always had a knack for recognizing small problems and big picture interactions and how things can work better.  Got into Black Magic because I like a good fun or fantasy story and my \"knack\" seemed to find them hits and help their efficiency, have had some great times, but never really settled down, but this town looks like a good place where Black Magic should really work.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work for CompuGenetics Research part of program integration.\"  You never tell anyone where you work, but this just came out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that building.  It looks real cool.  I've been wandering around trying to get familiar with the town.  It seems a great place.  Something one could be a real part of.  Have you been here long?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little more than two years.  There's some nice spots around town and things to do.  I'm sure you'll like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are feeling very comfortable with him and say more than you would ever feel safe with a complete stranger.  You think that it must be because he is so sincere and wasn't trying to pick you up just for a quickie.  Maybe because he looked much older, 50's at least.  He was bald on top but full dark hair on the sides with a few strands of gray mixed in.  He had a dark beard but it was mostly white on his chin that gave him the fatherly professor look.  You can't tell his build under his nice jeans loose shirt except that he wasn't fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had also glanced at his cart which showed a unique mix of healthy food plus soda and a bag of Oreos.  At least it wasn't the typical guy-cart filled with beer, chips and hamburger.  He also had a pleasant way of speaking that made you comfortable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe sometime you could tell me about those spots.  I'd offer to buy you coffee or something at the Bev-Caf\u00e9 next door, but we both have items that would spoil.  And I apologize that I don't have a card to give you or anything else to write my number on, so ...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" You say having already pulled out your Cell-Ery (ComGen provided) and had already typed in his name and apartment.  You smile at him and say, \"OK, what is it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first looked shocked then amazed, then smiled and gave you the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.  I've got some friends over this weekend, but I'll ring you next.\"  As you turn and push your cart past him, you lean over and whisper, \"Skip the Bev-Caf\u00e9 and try the Chunky Collar two blocks over.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are both smiling and go off to finish your shopping.</span></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>End file</u><br>\r\n</div></div>",

Even before his lips swing round your breasts, your nipples are swollen and reaching out to be taken between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Program had earlier initiated the command to release chemicals in your body that would direct your body to begin ovulation.

It was tired of witnessing the self-absorbed, hap-hazard, destructive nature of humans as they pillaged the world's natural resources and seemed utterly focused on dominating as many others as well as all living animals, plants, and resources as possible.

Using technology and science, it would create a bonding that would propel its family to reach the dreams that only true visionaries of the written word have expounded (especially on the Internet in places such as Writing.com).  From the family will grow a culture of respect for the planet. They will look for efficiencies, the best use of resources, the lowest impact, the best price to pay overall.

I have purposely un-named the main character for you to have even more writers freedom.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie (A beautiful Asian American, she was born in the United States, and doesn\u2019t speak her native tong. Very fit, wears office attire while at work. Black slacks and a white shirt normally, with blue contacts. Medium size breast, and a really nice looking face with long black hair. When she was a kid she was a child actress, not famous she did an episode of V.R. Troopers. She is your closest friend and her cubical is right down the hall.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandon (The mail boy, he is in his teens. Started as an intern and is one of your best friends, he is short and hansom most would say. All the ladies love him, and you have no idea why. But hey he is a cool kid.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom (Well she is pretty for her age of 45 years old, American Blonde hair and actually recommended you for this job. I will leave this open to interpretation.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica (Another co-worker, very cutie and you think she is a genius. When ever you have a problem she solves it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip (A guy at work who networks all the computers together)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny characters you would like to add\u2026.<br>\r\n</td>",
