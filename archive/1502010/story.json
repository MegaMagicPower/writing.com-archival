A few weeks ago, to your surprise, you have been accepted to work at Fukujima Technologies in Tokyo, Japan. Strangely, though you had never heard of Fukujima Technologies or an application to them, you still gleefully accepted the job offer, and dragged your girlfriend, Julianne Byron, in tow, quite reluctantly to a foreign land where you have never been to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in Tokyo, you were approached by a representative of your employer, Dr. Motoko Kijima, an attractive woman who also happens to be lead researcher at Fukujima. Captivated by her beauty at first sight, you did not realise your nature of your job until you finally learn a bit of Japanese: you had been accepted as a \"test subject\" for their experiments! Apparently, you were the only \"dumb\" applicant who agreed to take on the potentially dangerous experiments. The only upside is your pay: you were receiving 100,000 yen per month. If you survive, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks go by, and you had been put through loads of experiments by the Japanese research lab. Some were quite pleasant, but most of them were torturing, both physically and mentally. Your relation with Julianne went downhill as you constantly shouted at her for even the slightest thing, especially when the tests went bad. Your dream job in Japan had been a nightmare, both to your career and your relationship with Julianne. If matters could not get worse, Fukujima Technologies is nearing the brink of collapse due to overspending on the part of researchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, Dr. Kijima woke you up in your sleep in the lab, and asked you to help her out for one last experiment: a shrink ray. Dr. Kijima explained that this could be all or nothing for Fukujima, and if this \"last\" experiment fails, you are out of a job, along with everyone else here. Reluctantly, you accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were asked to sit down on a metal chair, while Dr. Kijima worked on the shrink ray. When it was finally operational, the ray was fired at you. It was a very unpleasant experience, with you feeling like your whole body was suffering frostbite. In addition, you WEREN'T shrinking at all! Desperate, Dr. Kijima added more power to the shrink ray, causing the machine to overload, thick smoke billowing from the machine. The fire alarm was triggered, but for you, you could hardly escape, your body fully worn out from the \"shrinking\" experience, and the thick smoke made it impossible for you to escape. Just like that, you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you find yourself on the floor of what remains of the research lab. You looked at yourself, and surprisingly, the painful frostbite sensation was gone. Your body is intact. The first thing on your mind was to sue Dr. Kijima and Fukujima Technologies, but it was when you started walking to the door did you realise that the door was MUCH BIGGER than before. Sensing something amiss, you looked around, and you saw the remnants of the shrink ray, all blown to bits, but MUCH BIGGER than when you were first hit by it. It then hit you: the shrink ray worked, but now you have been reduced to a mere height of 2 inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to get help,one way or another. There is no telling what might happen to you if you stay this small. You pondered your options, and decided to ...</span></div></div>",

She entered the lab, nearly stepping on you on the way. You managed to avoid her gargantuan pumps before she actually dropped it on you. It was clear that she didn't see you: from your eyes, all you see was the gigantic researcher looking at the damaged shrinking machine, and giving out a big sigh. She was clearly disappointed that her machine failed, and to top it off, you were also missing. With a very depressed heart, she makes for the lab exit, nearly stepping on you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you saw her taking massive strides out of the research lab, you decided to follow her. One, to show her that her machine works, and two, perhaps a way to get out of this \"mess\". You ran after, and surprisingly, you could catch up with her. You realised that though the shrink ray had physically reduced your size, much of your strength and stamina were retained, so you were literally superhuman. A really small superhuman. You managed to reach and grabbed onto her left pump heel, and continued holding on despite the number of tremors you feel from her footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were definitely not prepared to stay her any longer, so you reached up and climbed her heel, and reached her sole. Going further, you climbed up her ankle, and continued up ler lower leg. Looking up, you can clearly see her panties. Blushing a little, you continued making your journey up. Dr. Kijima could feel a small itch on her lower left leg. Did she ...</span></div></div>",

You proceeded to climb up her stomach, and taking a detour, you went around the left of her body, and proceeded to climb from her back. Your reason: she might feel you for real if you go anywhere near her breasts. Despite the ticklish feeling caused from your \"mountaineering\", she still didn't feel you crawling up her body. Obviously she was still reeling from the whole shrink ray experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, she arrived at her home, the same time you managed to climb onto her left shoulder, avoiding her hair from getting too close to you. You then saw where she lived, a typical Japanese apartment in suburban Tokyo. Resting on her shoulder, avoiding the constant itchiness of her hair, you followed her home, literally.

I will take care of things, and I will explain the matter to Mr. Hartley's family and girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the good news, Dr. Kijima reverted her body back up straight, only to bow down again, this time in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you very much, Fukujima-san! I will do my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she bowed in gratitute, you were being jerked around by the little loose thread on Dr. Kijima's blouse quite violently. Your hands had felt like jelly when she lowered her head, but this is now going too far. You hands were on the verge of slipping. Did you let go?</span></div></div>",

Before you could get a good look around your surroundings, a huge face appeared in front of you. It was the face of a woman, in her mid-20s, with shoulder-length brown hair with a blue headband. She had large but beautiful brown eyes, and pink glossy lips. Although she wasn't going to harm you, her sudden appearance did cause a shock to you. You stood still, frozen by the sight in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're OK.\" The giantess spoke in English. You tried to scream, but nothing comes out of your mouth, and your legs finally give way. You fell down, and hit your head, taking her by surprise for a while. Your head hurts, but as you get a closer look at the giantess, you finally identify her as Junko, a researcher at your workplace. The features on her face and her voice confirmed her identity. In a strange turn of events, your fear of her face just suddenly disappeared when you finally know who she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junko?\" You asked in English. \"You ... saved me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and you were such in a bad shape. Sorry for the scare back then; I just wanted to make sure that you're OK.\" Junko replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

You can say I'm the type who still likes dollhouses and making little clothes. I just can't get enough of it.\" Junko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have weird interests, but that's cool. I'm OK with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko then picked up up with her right hand, and takes you to her desk, where she puts you down.

Mainly, what's up with the online job offer, and how you got to work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant to tell you this Hartley-san, but I'm afraid you might get angry with what I'm about to say. The \"job offer\" was actually a joke gone bad. It was my friend Saki who placed the weird ad, hoping to attract someone, and only you took the bait. I apologize on Saki's behalf, because I don't know about this until Dr. Kijima told me about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You know Dr. Kijima?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I started work at Fukujima Technologies after I graduated from Tokyo University, but compared to Saki or Dr. Kijima, I'm not as bright or innovative as them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko gave a sheepish look, after admitting that she was not very bright as compared to her friend and your employer. She then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea about the shrink ray until Saki told me that the lab was about to shut down. I'm only concerned that I might lose my job, the only one I had for almost a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko was about to cry, but you went forward, and gently stroked her cheek. You know the exact pain of losing something close to you, and your gentleman instincts kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine. I know what you're going through. You're a strong woman, I'm sure you will find another job elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hartley-san. You are a kind man. I would kiss you, but I worry I might smother you in saliva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it gets late at night, Junko gave a loud yawn, showing signs that she is tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late. I have to sleep soon. By the way, Hartley-san, where do you want to sleep tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour answer?</span></div></div>",

You looked up, and you saw a very tall female figure towering over you. You could only see a pair of blue pumps, and her face is shrouded by the waviness of her skirt. As the skirt stops waving, you recognise the face as that of Junko Kawakami, a researcher who seems to have a soft spot for you. She could have seen you, but then again, maybe she had not. You can also try to make a dash past her feet to avoid being caught, and she might just take you for a rat.</span></div></div>",

Desperate, you tell him to hurry up and tell him the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my nano shield is almost low on power, so I can't depend on it. I have been dying to test these running shoes, though. I trust my shoes enough to run all the way to Saki's mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, whatever! Just do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki activated his nano shield, which looks like a sphere with blue hexacombs all over it, with you inside, of course. As Saki's stomach juice starts to flood the place, you notice that the shield is repelling the acid, meaning you won't get digested. Then comes the next part: getting out of Saki's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki is still lying down on her stomach, so climbing out is not an issue, but the muscles inside the esophagus still poses a threat. A wrong move and you will end up into the nasty stomach juice. Hiroki triggered his running shoes, causing yellowish jet streams to erupt from behind. Unable to fully control the speed and direction, you grabbed Hiroki before he rocketed off towards the esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hiroki ran, you see that his nano shield is fighting back the muscles inside Saki's esophagus. Normally, you would be in awe of what Hiroki had developed, but he is too focused on getting out and his face had been deformed by the speed of his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, his footsteps began to tickle Saki's throat, causing her to start coughing. Inside, as you and Hiroki made the dash towards her mouth, an unexpected help came as a huge air flow came behind, boosting your speed. As Saki starts coughing, Hiroki and you manage to successfully escape, though the shoes started to lose steam and the nano shield faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon impact onto Saki's carpet, the two of you have little time to ponder about your options. Saki had seen the two of you fly out of her mouth, and is really mad that the two of you had escaped. She got up to her full height, looking to squash you under her foot. Making matters worse, Hiroki's shoes had a LONG reload time, and he is already exhausted from the running and his (obvious) lack of physical activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saki's foot looms closer, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

By the way, who is your friend over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, him. He's one of my colleagues. His name is Jon. I 'picked him up' on the way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks cute, and hungry. Stay here, while I try to fix something up for you. No funny business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess gets up and walks away, your mind still could not piece together the clues presented to you.

On one, a small pot with hot water, and in the other, a few grains of rice and a bits of leftover fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all I can provide this late at night.

Could you care to explain exactly what you meant by that? I'm curious, because I thought your company was the only one who developed that shrink ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll confess. I was a victim of being shrunk as well. It was during my high school days. My nemesis tricked me into drinking tea spiked with a shrinking formula. Though I was able to get back to normal, my main purpose now is try and reverse that shrinking formula before it strikes again. That's my reason to join Fukujima Technologies in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that the reason you developed the nano shield and your running shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the nano shield was a joint project by Dr. Kijima and myself. The running shoes was my own creation, and as you can see, I suck at running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggles, but continued soaking yourself in the warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you plan to stop Saki or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your little bath and a good meal, the two of you headed back to Hiroki's room. You look around, and you are amazed to see a lot of figurines from various anime. It seems Hiroki and Saki had a lot in common, yet somehow Hiroki got swallowed. You did not think much, as you soon found yourself a bit tired. Hiroki was on his now-massive bed, and asked you to join him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his bed, Hiroki showed you your corner of the bed, and you both said your goodnights.

Reaching for his pocket, he pulled out an object that looked like a laser pointer, and aimed it at you. The device gave off a rather awful sound, like sirens from police cruisers, fire engines and ambulances combined. You wanted to clasp your ears, but the noise suddenly stopped as soon as they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you may talk\". The Japanese man said, surprisingly in English! You could not believe your ears, as earlier on he was speaking in his native tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha ... what happened?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A special sonic I invented to destroy language barriers. After you hear this, anything I say will be translated into your native tongue. Likewise, anything you say now will be Japanese in my ears. Care to continue, Mr. Hartley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed and a bit  upset that he did not use the device any sooner, but you still popped the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know a way out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, at least not up to her mouth. However, I think there IS a way out, but you might not like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take me there. I'm desperate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki reopened his nano shield, covering the both of you. Then, he beckoned you to follow him, as the shield needs you now to move along with Hiroki. Following Hiroki, you forced your way through Saki's pyloric canal, and went down inside her small intestine. It was a long and tiring walk inside Saki's small intestine, but under the protection of the nano shield, you could see exactly how the small intestine works as the mucus-like liquid being absorbed inside the intestine wall. If you were digested back at the stomach, this would be the fate awaiting your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The small intestine is about 6m long. At our size, we would be taking a LONG walk ... really long ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing, and continued walking. Eventually, you guys reached the end of the small intestine, and entered the large intestine. It was a horrid place to say, which was like a dark and stinky tunnel, if you were not in the comfort of the nano shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is full of bacteria and bacterial gases. Let's hustle, before the bacteria attempts to penetrate the shield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, you were hardly breaking a sweat, and you could still continue moving, as your body was getting used to this size. The two of you then reached the rectum, and ahead of you would be the \"exit\" Hiroki was talking about. As you prepare to leave Saki's body, did anything happen?</span></div></div>",

Let's go! We don't have another chance than now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, you faced forward again, and the two of you then literally walked through Saki's rectum, and out through her anus, all while being protected by Hiroki's nano shield. You came out of Saki's anus and came face to face with a large fabric in front of you. You immediately knew what that was: her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki switched off his nano shield, and told you to follow him. The two of you crept about inside Saki's panties like ninjas, trying to avoid disturbing the giantess. The two of you managed to crawl out of Saki's panties, and when you finally came out, it was already late into the night. Saki was fast asleep, which explains the lack of movement even while you guys were finding your way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may be asleep, but we better get out of here fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki reached inside his coat, and pulled out a remote-control like device, and started pushing some buttons. In an instant, strange things started \"growing\" out of Hiroki's clothes, but when it was finally complete, you saw that it looked like a device for flying. Hiroki told you to hold on to him, as he prepared to fly out of here. As much as you didn't like the idea of holding another man, there was really no other way. You grabbed him, and following that, jets started flaring below Hiroki's shoes, and after a while, you were off the ground. Hiroki did not stop pushing the jets up until he was parallel to the closest open window, and after that, the two of you flew out of Saki's apartment, with the giantess who ate you earlier still in a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guys were safe in a way, but at your size, you were easy prey for any flying insects or even worse, birds.

By then, the machine had lost all power, and the both of you started plummeting down, and landed, luckily, on something soft. It was still dark, but the moon was still illuminating through the window, so you can still have a look around. You felt the \"ground\" you are on, and found it surprisingly soft.

Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then did you finally realize where you are: on a person's bed. There was a person sleeping on the bed, a young Japanese woman in her early 20s. Her titanic sleeping face was a beautiful sight, even to your eyes. She had shiny jet black hair, which fell onto the blanket covering her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! She's beautiful!

Wasting no time, you followed him, and at your current size, you could easily slip inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you entered, your thoughts of getting out of the blanket were thrown out altogether. Yuriko had the perfect body covered by the blanket, and making things better, she was sleeping naked, without any undergarments!

Saki had a bad breakup recently, making her resent all men, so she intends to just shrink all men in Japan to nothingness as punishment for breaking her heart. Dr. Kijima had came close to testing Saki's shrink ray, and YOU were her hope of actually stopping Saki's mad plan. The man, revealing himself as Hiroki, saw Saki sabotaging Dr. Kijima's shrink ray before she tested it. However, Saki spotted him, and promptly shrunk him down and swallowed him, explaining why he is here. If not for his nano shield (he reveals that he is a researcher at the lab as well), he would not be here anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused about what Hiroki had told you about Saki and her mad ambition to shrink all men in Japan, you decided that you have to help Hiroki out.

Saki's stomach now feels like a giant cavern, and the stomach acid now looks more intimidating than ever. On the upside, you are now the same size as Hiroki, so he won't see you as a giant anymore. Hiroki also reveals that the conditions inside the human stomach can accelerate the shrink ray effect. His nano shield is the only barrier negating the shrinking effects. Before you start shrinking again, he wraps is shield around you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued with the main subject in hand, and luckily, Hiroki reveals that Saki should be asleep by now, as signs show that her stomach is acting up, since it is revealed that sleeping can actually aid digestion. Hiroki says that the two of you only have one shot at using the nano shield as cover, race up her esophagus, and escape through her mouth. The only problem is: the nano shield is nearly low on power, and should it deactivate at the wrong time, you and Hiroki will only be pushed back into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Hiroki are pretty much enhanced by the powers of the shrink ray, so running is not a problem. Even as the muscles inside Saki's esophagus try to push you two back into the stomach, the blue nano shield seems to work. You asked Hiroki why he didn't do this sooner, and he replied that he had not thought about getting by Saki's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then reached your destination: Saki's mouth. She is snoring, a good and bad sign at the same time. If the timing is right, you and Hiroki can easily escape her mouth and make an escape. However, should her loud noise and the air get in the way, both of you will only end up deeper into Saki, and it's not just her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nano shield begins to fade, you and Hiroki closed your eyes, and made a leap of faith.

You know that even in your enhanced state, falling down from this height is certain death. Hiroki, however, seems rather calm and composed as you make your fall. You wondered if Hiroki is a genius or he had lost his mind, but you closed your eyes, and braced for impact, and maybe a quick death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki and you made impact after a fall like that, but to your luck, you landed onto something soft.

It was then you realised that you had fallen onto Dr. Kijima's left breast. As much as you want to enjoy this softness, you noticed that Hiroki is poking at her breast, obviously trying to get some attention.

Look here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor turned around to look, and made the biggest mistake of his life. He saw one of his employees, Saki Yamamoto, flying a experimental helicopter based on the UH-1 Iroquois chassis, with a nose mounted beam cannon. The next moment, he was shot by the beam, and started reducing in size, and he didn't stop until he shrunk down to 1/4 of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki's helicopter started firing the shrink beam randomly at any man she sees, and Prof. Fukujima, your big boss, was just one of her victims.

Using her right hand, she used her thumb and index finger to grab on the device, and ripped off the shrink beam right off the nose of the helicopter. She then used her fingers to forcefully open the cockpit, and pulled out a tiny Saki from it. Despite being brought forward to her face, and with millions of Japanese people looking at her, Saki remains defiant in the face of the giantess who had her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motoko!

NEVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki reaches for the back of her coat, and pulls out an odd-looking pistol. She then threatened Dr. Kijima with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You underestimated me, Motoko! You thought that I only developed a shrink beam just so I could shrink all the men in Japan? You were wrong! I have more than just shrink beams in my pistol, which I was planning to use on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the drama with some panic in your heart.

Unfortunately, the pistol itself lies on the road where Dr. Kijima and Saki are having their brawl. It's too dangerous to try and grab the pistol, but it may be the only way out of this.

The impact caused Saki to crouch down to grab her leg, hurt from the shells of the tanks, avoiding the grenades from the sky. The SDF tanks didn't stop even after she crouched down. They fired a second volley of shells, hurting her arm this time, crippling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you and Dr. Kijima can do is watch the military bring Saki down to their level, and heave a sigh of relief that Dr. Kijima was not involved. However, it appears that the SDF is not done yet, as the commander is signalling for something to come in. It looks like a secret weapon of sorts, but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Pick a choice.

When you turned around to have a look, you saw something that is really too much even for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"secret weapon\" appears to be a 100ft tall robot, but built in the appearance of a young lady in a Western style school uniform. While she looks like a typical Japanese girl, she is definitely mechanical, as shown by her walking and her size. In her hand is a katana of epic proportions, but looks like a regular katana to \"her\". As the robot stomped forward, causing the ground to tremble, the SDF commander ordered the troops to withdraw, and signalled for you and Dr. Kijima to get away. Dr. Kijima and you did exactly as you were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Can you please explain to me what on earth is going on? Another thing, what is that ... monster anyway?\" You asked in a rather agitated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That robot is our last line of defense,\" the SDF commander, Colonel Kawakami explained. \"It's named Sakura-chan, and it is intended to help boost our men's morale in times of need. I have never seen it in action, until now. For one, it is quite ridiculous for its size, and our designers have ... issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time for anymore chit chat, as it looks like Saki had got up back on her feet, and preparing to fight \"Sakura-chan\". Next thing you knew, they started fighting. Saki had trouble at first, as Sakura-chan is quite heavily armored, and the katana almost cut her on a few occassions. However, in time, the tide soon turned, as it looks like Saki had gained the advantage, and knocked Sakura-chan's katana off her hands, causing the giant blade to literally slice an apartment block as it crashes down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dr. Kijima had rejoined Hiroki at his \"prime location\", and continued observing this \"titanic\" battle of flesh against machine. After a while, it looks like the fight is about to reach its climax. As both Saki and Sakura-chan delivered one final blow into the face of each other, only 1 will remain standing after this. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

They look terrifying for starters, and it looks like there is no pilot for these mechanized walking machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Wait! Aren't those the Damiyo-class robots that I designed and then turned down by the government?\" Dr. Kijima exclaimed, upon seeing the machines. You gave her a look, but said nothing. You don't want to know what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Damiyo robots then lowered their bulky shoulders, similar to how football players when they try and tackle down other players. The next thing you knew, all 3 robots began to charge forward with such speed, and rammed Saki's right leg with their bulky shoulders. The impace of the \"collision\" caused Saki to lose balance, and she fell to the ground with a huge thud. The boulevard and some nearby buildings crumbled and quivered under Saki's huge weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki didn't get up from that massive fall, and you realise that she had fainted, though she is still physically OK. The SDF is not taking chances however, as the helicopters above started rappeling down infantry. On the ground, IFVs drove in, and infantry started pouring out. They carried some large cables with them, and they started swarming Saki's body like tiny insects. As they moved around, they started tying down Saki with the cables. The process went by for 30 minutes, and by then, Saki had been firmly tied down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki got up, and found herself pinned down by some strong cables. She had a look at the cables, and the infantry around her, and felt a bit of irony, as the cables were manufactured by Fukujima, and she had a hand in helping to develop these super-strong cables. Now she is caught in her own product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, it took a while for you to explain the entire situation to the SDF commander, while Dr. Kijima fixed the beam pistol. After some persuasive words and some effort, the SDF commander believed your story, and Dr. Kijima had fixed the pistol. She gave it to you, and told you to shrink her back down.

Saki had left behind a huge mess, with this district of Tokyo in crumbles due to the weight of both giant women during the \"brawl\". On top of that, there are still shrunken people that have yet to be found. It will take some time to locate and resize them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no point waiting. Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kijima then handed over two magnifying glasses, one each for you and Hiroki. The task: locate any shrunken people, and gather them together so they can be properly resized. The task to locate, rally and resize the victims was completed in 3 hours, luckily due to the fact that Saki didn't have much time before Dr. Kijima stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken victims returned back to normal size to find their district in crumbles, and find their main road with a human-shaped sized \"hole\" with fissures all around it.

Leaving behind friends in Japan, and the loss of your girlfriend, it was quite an emotional loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 years later, you had found a decent job, and you decided to revisit your friends in Japan. Upon arrival, you were surprised that Dr. Kijima and Hiroki have married, and are expecting their first child soon. Dr. Kijima now works as a researcher for the Self-Defense Forces, helping to perfect the Damiyo-class robots she had created. Hiroki now runs a small manga store in suburban Japan. While it took a while to start his business, Hiroki stated that he preferred it this way, and he lost his craving for science after spending time in Saki's stomach. When you enquired about Saki, things took a downturn. Upon further enquires, Saki had been branded \"too dangerous\" for the government, and even though she showed remorse for her actions, her fate now remains unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever questions, whatever outcomes, it is all too late for Saki, it seems. Even your request to see her had been turned down by the SDF. You had come a long way since accepting the offer to become a \"test-subject\". Only time will tell if the world will ever forgive Saki, and whether you will find yourself a new girlfriend.

Immediately, she lunged straight at you, and looks like she wants to do something terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Dr. Kijima saw the commotion, and managed to lift Saki back up to her face before she can do anything drastic.

I SPENT 6 WHOLE MONTHS FOR THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki yelled at the top of her lungs, still refusing to admit defeat. Dr. Kijima could only look at her in sympathy.

You know if you get in the crossfire, you would surely end up like a squashed fruit, so you decided to wait for the pistol to be kicked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in their scuffle, Dr. Kijima accidently stepped on the pistol, causing it to break into tiny fragments in the pavement. Hiroki and you watched in horror as your only ticket to end this fiasco was smashed to bits right in front of your eyes. Making matters worse, Saki lunged a fist towards Dr. Kijima, but missed and struck the building where Hiroki was. The roof of the building was destroyed, and Hiroki barely made it downstairs to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"That was a close one!\" Hiroki exclaimed, still panting from the mad dash down the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, you heard voices coming from the distance, in two directions to be exact. You looked to one side, and you saw 2 Japanese ladies, waving and calling out to Hiroki. On the other side, a very familiar voice called out to you, in a rather angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JON HARTLEY! YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Julianne, your long neglected girlfriend, and she is really angry with you. It turns out the hotel you booked in was caught in the scuffle, and after Julianne evacuated from the building, she saw you watching the two giant ladies fight and now she wants a piece of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the worst place you have ever brought me to! First, you hauled me off with you to this crazy country they call Japan, then you neglected me and now THIS! If I wasn't in great danger, I'd have dumped your sorry a** by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hartley-san! Who's that woman? Why is she yelling at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hiroki, this is my soon-to-be ex-girlfriend, Julianne. I kinda neglected her while working, so ... who are those two anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, meet my sister Reiko and my childhood friend, Yuriko. I too have a lot of explaining to do ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5 of you were about to start a loud din, but it looks like the giantess fight is getting closer than expected.

By a coincidence, Hiroki lived in the west, so you can calmly approach this problem without the fight getting in your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Iketanis' residence, all 5 of you got into Hiroki's room for a \"discussion\". Looking at Hiroki's room, you could finally understand why he looked like that. He had countless manga volumes piled up on his shelves, and lots of figurines of anime girls and robots, all of which he painted himself. His room was also filled with posters of various anime you had came in contact with. Though the room was small, it was big enough to squeeze all of you into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dialogue in Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, please tell me this had nothing to do with shrink rays, tiny men or giant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Reiko, it is. OK, so now it seems our only ticket to stop this madness had been destroyed by the two giantesses, one of which is my superior. If we are to stop them, we need another shrink ray device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have another one, Hiroki. Especially after the whole Technology Club incident years ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Yuriko, we have one option left. You still remember when Saki was flying that helicopter around with the huge shrink ray? Even though Dr. Kijima had ripped it off the helicopter, the device is still intact. We can use it to shrink them both down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, that device looked much heavier than I thought. How are you going to move it around, let alone use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hartley-san, please! I worked at the lab longer than you, so I know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver tube-like object out of his pocket. It looked like a typical laser pointer, but you can tell it isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a resizing device of my own, but this only works on machinery. You can pick any of my robots on my shelf. I've already modified them to move ever since I got myself shrunk back in high school. It may be our only key out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne was still unhappy with you, but since she's been dragged into this mess, she agreed to help. It was time to pick one of Hiroki's robots, and two attracted your eyes. You can pick the red one labelled \"Akakaze\" (Japanese: Red Wind) or the white one labelled \"Byakurai\" (Japanese: White Lightning).</span></div></div>",

After all, you were the one who brought her and life as a test subject also caused you to neglect and yell at her after you had a rough day. Still, if it were any other girl in her place, she would have dumped your sorry butt and moved on already, so there still might be a faint chance of reconcillation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm still going to dump you after all this mess is over, right?\" Julianne sarcastically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I also know that no matter what I do to make it up to you, nothing will work. Our relationship is as good as over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it wasn't an entire waste of time here. While you were away at work, I went outside to have a look at this country for myself and made friends with Miss Yuriko over there. She showed me around, and even comforted me after you kept yelling at me after a bad day. Though I would like to stay here, I think I'm going straight home once all this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I dated you in the first place. You were pretty hardy and independent, which was what I liked about you. I'm sure you will find a better person once you get home. Until then, would you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? I already lost all my luggage when the giantess punched the hotel block. It couldn't get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two embrace each other, but you didn't have time to enjoy this as Hiroki called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Hartley-san!

It felt like those old TV shows you watched in the past, only it's for real and YOU are the \"hero\" of this. As the two women waved goodbye to you guys, the two mechs (Hiroki picked the \"Byakurai\") lifted off and headed towards Tokyo to stop the giantess fight.</span></div></div>",

You seem to know quite a lot about the shrink ray project, and judging from the time I found you in Saki's stomach, you seem to know quite a lot about being shrunk. Please, tell me your story. I need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki hesitated for a while, but eventually answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but what I'm about to say might puzzle and even be labelled unbelieveable, but it's all the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening, and so is Julianne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my high school days, I got into an encounter with the Technology Club at school, and got shrunk in the process. I was almost squashed and even eaten on one occassion, but they didn't stop me. Eventually, I entered their headquarters in school and found myself a cure,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it end there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish, but it didn't. The Technology Club Chairman was so angry when I screwed up her \"Shrink All\" project, that she turned the device on herself and grew into a near 100ft tall giantess. I had to stop her, and I found her prototype mechs in the garage, which I later used to build these. I stopped her, but much of my school was ruined in the process. Somehow, Saki also found the blueprints for her shrink ray, which I think she found from the ruins. She used to study there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how come after all that, nothing was ever reported outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our government decided that it was too dangerous to allow the outside world to know about all this advanced technology lest it falls into the wrong hands, so the matter was deemed \"Top Secret\" and everyone was given the silence order and a bribe of sorts to firmly keep open mouths shut. I never spoke about my high school life to anyone ... until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused after hearing Hiroki's tale. It was quite unbelieveable, and even Julianne was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm directly responsible for what happened to you, and I'm sorry for that. Before you two start pounding me into dust, let's focus on stopping the two giantesses straight ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking with Hiroki, you didn't realize your mechs had already arrived in central Tokyo, where the scuffle is.

Find that shrink ray and use it on Saki! I'll handle her! GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed, and turned around to scour the city for the device while Hiroki kept the pressure on Saki.

I think I see something shiny over to your west.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! Take us there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Akakaze flew westward, and Julianne stopped the mech at where she saw the shiny object.

You were skilled in electronics, but this was the first time you had ever handled something like this. Eventually, you managed to plug the device into the Akakaze, but before you could get back to help Hiroki, you got a shock as you see the Byakurai being flung towards you like a rag doll. Hiroki's mech didn't stop until it hit the tall building behind you. Before your eyes, you can see Saki's huge body walking closer and closer towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiroki, come in!

You took a chance, and now you have a much BIGGER problem in front of you.Saki now seemed like over half a mile tall compared to you at normal height. Even Dr. Kijima at her present height felt like a dwarf compared to Saki's height now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I'm the biggest being on Earth! Allow me to show you my gratitude, Hartley-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you try to run away, but in the end, it was all for nothing. As Yuriko and Reiko finally arrived at the scene, all they see was a foot the size of a stadium hovering over them before flattening everything underneath it. Both the Akakaze and the Byakurai, along with most of western Tokyo, were flattened underneath just one footstep. The main casualties are Professor Takenori Fukujima (at 1/4 of an inch, didn't escape), Dr. Motoko Kijima (100ft), Hiroki and Reiko Iketani, Yuriko Takamoto, Julianne Byron and yourself, Jon Hartley. One mistake you made caused the demise of everyone caught under Saki's gigantic foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Saki had gotten accustomed to her supreme height, and soon got bored of Japan.

Dr. Kijima was back to her normal self, though still badly hurt. Hiroki, by this time, had got the Byakurai peeled off the building and is signalling to his sister and Yuriko, who had just arrived by car.

Shrinking her down is still possible, but you'll need stronger energy to counter the growth ray effect all around Saki's body. You'll have to overload the shrink raygun and fire it at her, but that will also mean you'll have to say goodbye to your mechs, Hiroki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no sweat! I can always build another, and these belong to the Technology Club of the past anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Dr. Kijima's words felt like seeing a light after being in darkness for so long.

Let me help too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Byakurai began to feed all its remaining power into the shrink ray, while you worked on the weapons control to divert all power into the shrink ray. Using all power from your Akakaze mech and drawing the reserves from the Byakurai, you fired the shrink ray at Saki, and prayed that a miracle happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrink ray hit Saki, but she still wasn't shrinking. Even with all the power, nothing happened. However, it seems like Saki's body was being electrocuted, as you see electric sparks all over her. In one moment, Saki's body exploded, taking everyone by surprise. After the black smoke had cleared, Saki was badly hurt, but she was clearly shrinking. As the blue ray enveloped Saki's entire body, her hurt body got smaller and smaller, bringig her back down to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all over, you thought to yourself, as you, Julianne and Hiroki evacuated from your now powerless mechs. As you watched Hiroki's mechs descending onto the ground, you can't help but feel a little sorry for Hiroki's mechs. Even though it was fun and all, it still felt like you have lost a friend of sorts. As all 3 of you finally reach the ground, you saw an injured Saki in the distance, and headed forward.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You headed towards a now injured Saki Yamamoto, who was earlier the giantess rampaging Tokyo. Even though she tried to kill you and almost swallowed you into her digestive system, you felt that you have to put an end to all this anyway. As you walked closer, your eyes came upon something within the ruined buildings of Tokyo, and as you got closer, imagine your surprise when you found a gold locket. You opened it, and there was a picture of Saki and, to another surprise, a Japanese-looking version of yourself! Now you know why she resents you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach Saki, all you saw was an injured girl now crying her guts out. She was on top of the world, and now rudely brought back down to size, like in her past relationship. Though still hurt, she was still able to wave her arms and yell the same lines, \"Yujiro, you idiot!\" and \"Why does this happen to me?\". You shook your head, and went towards her, hoping you can calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dialogue Translated)<br>\r\n\"What! What're you here for, Hartley? Came to rub it in my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Saki. Actually, I came here ... to apologize ... All this time, I always thought you're the \"plain-hard to get\" type, but now I understand your motives. But you are doing it in the wrong way, and this may seem strange, but please forgive Yujiro, even though I don't know who he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaki paused, having nothing sarcastic to say about your comment. She stared at you in surprise, but later turned away from you, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have guts, Hartley-san! I like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, and you saw Dr. Kijima walking towards you and Saki. She then handed to you a vial containing some clear-blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a healing formula, but it only cures external injuries. I thought you might need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked Dr. Kijima, and then poured the liquid over Saki's injuries. To your amazement, all her wounds all seem to heal as fast as you can imagine, like super-quick regeneration you saw on TV. She's fine, but she did not get up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really a resemblence to that fool Yujiro, Hartley-san, all the way to his kind personality. I loved him ... but he left me behind after getting a call from an old friend in America. He never came back, so I assumed he dumped me. I was very angry, and I wanted to get back at all men in Japan, so I went back to my old school to salvage anything from the Technology Club fiasco. I found the shrink ray plans, along with a manifest, which made my work easier. When I heard Dr. Kijima there was trying to replicate the shrink ray, I sabotaged her machine and used my device on Hiroki and promptly swallowed him to prevent any leaks to my plan. Honestly, Hartley-san, I never anticipated you getting involved, and you stopped me from making the biggest mistake in my life. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all this talking is making me bored! Jon, even though I said I was going to dump you after all this was over, but seeing you comfort Saki despite all she's done to you reminds me why I fell in love with you in the first place. I don't regret coming to this country, Jon. I'm willing to start anew with you, that is, if you are willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have made many choices in your entire life, but this has to be the biggest and probably, most important, decision you will ever make in life. Which girl do you want to spend time with now? Do you want to stay with Saki and help heal her shattered heart, or do you want to start anew with Julianne, who had somewhat forgiven you by now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Either choice leads to an ending.)</span></div></div>",

There's someone here who needs me more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Jon. Though our relationship is pretty much over, but we can still be friends. Come and see me if you return home, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulianne came up to you and gave you a farewell kiss, before turning around and walking away. Though you believed you made the right choice, you still felt a little sad thinking about the memories you had with her. Though she offered you a new start, you decided not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dialogue translated from Japanese)<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess all this is finally over, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you got a huge shock seeing a red flash behind you and after the flash subsided, you see Professor Takenori Fukujima, back to his normal size. In his hand, he had a small fragment of the destroyed beam pistol, which he probably used to enlarge himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I'm pretty much going to lose my entire fortune to pay for the damages of the city, I'm proud of all of you. Especially you, Hartley-san. I've heard about you from Iketani and Kijima, and honestly, at first I thought you were foolish to fall for Iketani's joke, but after seeing you with Saki, I've changed my mind about you. As an apology for all the troubles I caused, will you let me find you a job here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Prof. Fukujima praising and offering you a new job, you graciously agreed, bowing down repeatedly to Prof. Fukujima and thanking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years later, Tokyo had pretty much recovered from the giantess incident, and it was reported to the outside world that an earthquake had struck Tokyo, causing all the damage. Prof. Fukujima had spent the last of his financial reserves to rebuild the city, effectively ending the existence of Fukujima Technologies. Dr. Kijima and Hiroki have both set up a new research and development institute as a replacement. Dr. Kijima, the new Institute President, still looks pretty as ever, even as she enter her 30s. Hiroki is doing fine as Head Researcher, and looks set to marry his childhood sweetheart, Yuriko Takamoto, later in the year. Saki had fully recovered from her breakup, and in a surprise twist, ended up as your new girlfriend. As for you, your new job had been stable and happy, and you visit your friends often. As for Julianne, she e-mailed you back from home, saying she is fine and had forgiven you completely, and is looking forward to her new life stateside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did a guy who fell for a stupid prank, ended up being shrunk and almost killed on multiple occassions, still end up with a high-paying job and a hot girlfriend? You're just lucky, you guess.</span></div></div>",

Still, even after your \"trials and tribulations\", you still kept your girlfriend and yourself in one piece. Just then, Yuriko's car pulled up from behind you guys, and after the car stopped, three people came out. Reiko, Yuriko and a person who looks just like you, except he looked more Japanese than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Dialogue Translated)<br>\r\n\"Saki-chan? Is that you?\" The man spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a call from him from Narita airport, so I had to make a detour. Luckily, the airport was spared of the damage, so I could fetch him from the airport without much difficulty.\" Yuriko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yu ... Yujiro-kun?\" Saki weakly answered. She tried to get up, but she couldn't. Reiko and Hiroki had to help her up to her feet. Though physically healed, she still felt a \"hangover\" after being exposed to the growth ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I just got back from America, and honestly, I was quite surprised to see Tokyo like this. I know you think I'm a jerk, and I'm sorry about what happened. I was needed at America, and I had no idea I would be held up for a couple of months. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you, but I guess I blew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you were gone, Saki got into one of her tanturms again, and if I wasn't your best friend, Yujiro, I would have repaired one of those broken mechs over there and fired all weapons at you.\" Hiroki replied, adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm sorry. Look, I'll pay for the damage with my money, and I will take care of Saki now. I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still the same, Yujiro,\" Saki smiled. Seeing Yujiro back and knowing he still cared for her seemed to have washed off all her rage and anger, and when you look at her now, you wondered if you had made a mistake by picking Julianne over her. The couple finally embraced, in a similar fashion you had earlier. Tears started streaming from their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me, Yujiro-kun ... never leave my side again ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise ... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the bystanders, yourself included, can't help but feel like watching a dramatic conclusion of a romantic soap opera on TV. Everyone smiled, looking at the happy couples back together. The whole giantess incident had ended in a typical romantic drama ending, only it's for real and you are actually a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, Tokyo was rebuilt with the financial help by Professor Takenori Fukujima, now restored back to his normal self, and Yujiro's huge sum of money. The incident was covered up by the media reporting that an earthquake had struck Tokyo, and that everyone was OK. Though world leaders have their suspicions, everyone stood by the story that it was an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProf. Fukujima had retired and now lived in seclusion, after an illustrous career of being a school principal and the head of a research firm developing cutting-edge technology. Dr. Kijima had taken over the helm of Fukujima Technologies, now renamed the Innovation Institiute. Hiroki and Yujiro now serve under Dr. Kijima as co-Head Researchers (It turns out that Yujiro has an intellect similar to Hiroki), and their relations with their respective girlfriends going strong. As a form of apology, Yujiro had given whatever remains of his earnings in America to you and Julianne, who have a lot of sightseeing to do before you return home stateside. There are so many sights to see in Japan, and you intend to make the best of it with Julianne to make up for neglecting her all this time. Even then, the both of you might even put off plans to go home to stay here with your new friends. All because of a joke ad, it seems.</span></div></div>",

As the 3 of you turn around, all you see is Saki flying what appears to be a highly modified UH-1 helicopter, with a laser weapon mounted on the nose! Hiroki's tale checks out after all, but now you got a bigger problem. Saki fires a red-laser on the roof of Dr. Kijima's office, blowing the entire ceiling off. The 3 of you finally realise the danger you are in. Without hesitation, Dr. Kijima grabbed Hiroki and you with her hand in 1 quick movement, and placed you 2 in her lab pocket, before running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Kijima escape Fukujima Technologies, with Saki flying the helicopter, blasting assorted colored lasers at her, Dr. Kijima races towards a nearby car, with its door wide open.

People tending to their houses, kids playing around, the normal life you had lived before coming to Japan. You have no idea how small you are, but you have the thought that if such a small metropolis already exists on Ayaka's left breast, there are bound to be much more of these cities and towns, maybe even whole civilizations, scattered all over her body.

And we live on this person called Ayaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can deny it as much as you want, but it's the truth. Your world is pretty much alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was about to say something when a loud rumbling sound roared as far as it could go. As you look around, people are starting to panic, which is not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? What's going on?\" Minako asked a passer-by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got problems! A micro-beast is entering our town! Run if you want to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako grabbed you by the hand, and you two left the diner, only to confront the most hideous thing you have ever encountered. The so-called micro-beast had hair all over its main body, walks on 6 legs, had multiple eyes, and a killer instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jon! We have to get away!

Microscopeans aren't affected by soap mainly due to them being cells themselves. Intelligent cells, you might add. Those biology lessons and Dr. Kijima's bio experiments had really helped, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dirt beast left the city, cheers erupted all over the city, the microscopeans overjoyed that nothing had happened to their down.

Although you still could not get Minako off you, it looks like your microscopic adventure had gone off to a good start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the celebrations over your heroic antics with the micro-beasts, you finally get to be alone with Minako, the closest person to you at this time.

If I recall, she didn't really wash her crotch properly, so there might still be some soap residue there, but it is really too far from here. Otherwise, you might have to wait for Ayaka to bath again before you can get any soap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako ponders over it, and says ... </span></div></div>",

Your best option is to forget about your torture here, and ACTUALLY explore Japan from this perspective. Nightfall came, and with nobody around, as the building had been cordoned off, you make your way out of the lab. Outside the lab, it was dark and cold, and everything is still so big. Putting your plans on hold, you dediced to go to sleep. Heading to the tall grass patch, you said a silent prayer, and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you awoke, and you saw a giant shadow looming over you. You rubbed your eyes, and you realised that the giant shadow is a woman, a young lady no more than 21 years. She is wearing a pink top, with her midriff exposed, a white miniskirt and white boots, with long flowing brown hair obscuring your vision to see her face. This young lady has her back turned to you, and blocking out your light. What on earth would a young lady be doing here, you thought to yourself. You went closer to her, only to hear a small humming tune. The voice, to your delight, is audible to your ears. You headed to the base of her left foot, and climbed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you hear loud noises of a motorcyle roaring, the noise deafening to your ears as the monster vehicle (from your point of view) made its way in front of this young lady. You looked up, avoiding the \"pleasure\" inside her skirt, you saw another giant on the motorcycle, a male this time. He removed his helmet, and you can barely see his face, but the features indicate that he is the same age as you.

Natsuko was very agile and quick to respond to the different, but Kazuki was different, missing the tempo on multiple occassions. Natsuko, seeing her boyfriend struggle, giggled a little and continued with her game. For you, it was well at first, though the loud stomping sounds of Natsuko's boot were an annoyance. It was when you climbed near her skirt did you realise that she was beginning to sweat, and the sweat is acting against you. Her left leg was getting slippery.

You were, in a sense, a superhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could exit the door, however, the door opened, and a pair of black boots crashed right in front of you. The impact blew you away several centimeters, and while you were recovering from that shock, you saw a giant shadow in front of you, only it is a real live human, The big shadow then took a big stride over you, and moved towards the shrink ray. The noise of the footsteps were deafening, but you were curious. Who was that, and what is this thing doing this late at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crept close to the rear of the right foot, and you looked up. The giant shadow then removed something black off its head, revealing a shock of long flowing blonde hair. A closer look at the shadow, and you soon realised that it is actually the body of a woman, which was later confirmed when you hear her speak. Strangely, she spoke English, a rarity in this lab where Japanese is the dominant language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the so-called shrink ray.\" She said. You looked up, and you see her pulling out a pair of glasses, with green tint on the lens. She put them on, and continued analysing the shrink ray machine, or what's left of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh! The machine's busted! Nothing I can salvage from this pile of junk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for her hip pocket, and pulled out a walkie-talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Kat! I found the shrink ray, or what's left of it! Over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not help but feel like you are in a spy flick of sorts. Here, above you, is a possible agent from a powerful agency that also seeks the shrink ray. Your curiosity soon took over, and to find out what is going on, you climbed her leather boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I got it! Over and out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then placed the walkie-talkie back into her hip pocket, turned around, and headed to the exit. During this time, you managed to reach the top of her boot, but you cannot rest yet. Exiting the lab, she begins to run, causing you (on her boot) to rock violently. The unstable ground you are on moved about violently as you ...</span></div></div>",

She then entered her vehicle, and left Fukujima Technologies in the dust, with you in tow down her lower right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you realised that she had stopped. You peered around, and you saw that she had arrived at a hotel, though you swore that hotel looked familiar. Still hanging on to her leg, all you could do was to follow her into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, she began to remove her jumpsuit. As she unzipped her jumpsuit, revealing her actual figure, your eyes were glued to her very sexy body. She removed her jumpsuit complete, revealing her true figure. From your estimates, she has a very attractive rack and very slender waist and hips. While doing your \"estimates\", you forgot that you were still on her jumpsuit legging, and when she took them off, she nearly felt you. In that moment, you had managed to avoid being felt by her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back on the floor, you looked up, and you saw her towering naked body (she only wore the jumpsuit, for the record), and your eyes can't help but get glued to her really sexy body.

After that, she takes you to a nearby table, and gently placed you there.

You can't help but get lost in the clouds, thinking about what will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the restaurant, since it was cold, Kat had ordered a dish of sukiyaki (Japanese steamboat) for the both of you. Since your size means it will be difficult to pick out food from the pot, Kat had to pick out the food for you. There was no major problems, despite your small size, as strangely, your appetite remains the same as when you were bigger, and after a while, you were still hungry. While Kat was not looking, you headed to the pot yourself, climbing the mini-stove, and then up to the base of the pot. However, you made a mistake, and you fell into the pot. The soup itself was still boiling hot, and you found yourself stuck literally inside hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you could pass out from the pain from the soup, a giant pair of chopsticks picked you out, just in time.

Don't be afraid, add on to my story!<br>\r\n5. Just because he's invulnerable DOES NOT mean he can't die. Be creative!<br>\r\n6. Last rule: HAVE FUN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have decided to convert this into a character profile page. Anyone who appears in my story will get a spot here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jon Hartley</b> 22 years old. The main character of the story, and the unfortunate (or fortunate?) guy who gets shrunk to 2 inches after being a test subject. You are quite athletic, but are also a closeted pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Motoko Kijima</b> 28 years old. The main person behind the whole shrink ray project. A very beautiful person with long jet-black hair and healthy C-cup breasts, but with very unpredictable tendencies. Some even say she's up to no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Julianne Byron</b> 22 years old. Your accompanying girlfriend, who had felt neglected after you took the job, but still followed you anyway. She has short brown hair and B-cup breasts, and a gentle personality. At least, what you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Natsuko Hasegawa</b> 21 years old. A typical Japanese girl who had just left her teens, and you somehow stumble on her date. She has brown hair and B-cup breasts. In short, a Japanese version of Julianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saki Yamamoto</b> 22 years old. A researcher at Fukujima Technologies. Known to be quite grumpy and resents you for some reason. 5' 7\" frame and minor C-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Junko Kawakami</b> 24 years old. Works as a researcher at Fukujima Technologies.

A reluctant worker, she is actually gentle at heart, but when she gets mad, ruthless to no extent. She had long golden blonde hair and borderline D-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour task is to escape the lab, and venture out into a world of giants to get help, but who knows what might happen to you, out in a world where everyone literally towers over you.</td>",
