Aragorn, heir to Isildur, became part of the Fellowship at the important Council of Elrond many years ago, even though he knew the lineage of his family was weak when it came to the One Ring. Yet he conquered and did not give in, proving that even though the race of men can be easily corrupted, there are some whose strength and will is fierce. Now the One Ring has been destroyed for good, and Aragorn is no longer an heir, he is a noble King, and as always, will remain a part of the race of men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You, too, are of the race of men. The race whose features cannot be guessed until birth, the race whose loyalties are often hard to tell, and the race whose mind can change at any moment, whether for good or evil. And as a part of the race of men, you are not necessarily born a fighter, but when you learn, you are very skilled, and your ability is fatal to those whom you fight. You fought before when Sauron's shadow was looming over Middle Earth, and once again an evil threatens to rule. You know the times have been better than ever, but you know that they will grow weary again. You know the time for resistance is now. The time for plans is now, before another evil wreaks havoc on Middle Earth again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time definitely calls for defense. An evil is lurking about in Middle Earth once again. Its reign is not yet strong, but it is growing. The wicked creature that brings such hate, cruelty, and malice is clever. It is hiding far enough in shadow that its identity has not yet been seen. Yet the remaining orcs and other evil creatures that survived from Sauron's time in power have multiplied, and they have already joined forces with this unknown evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the crowd of various races seat themselves, the rooms goes silent. Elrond's voice fills the open room; you listen attentively, knowing the importance and secrecy of all of his meetings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a great while since I have called a council of such significance. Not since Sauron's threat to overtake Middle Earth has such an evil come unto these lands. We were fortunate enough to know of Sauron's plan to find the One Ring, and we successfully destroyed it. But with this evil, we do not know what its plans are, what it looks like, or even if it has a human form. We call upon the elves, dwarves, wizards, men, and now hobbits,\" Elrond says as he looks over to Frodo, \"as well as any other free people of Middle Earth to defend all that is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Continuing, Elrond says, \"Those who are with us from the Fellowship of The Ring have already vowed to lead this quest, but they cannot do it alone. We need many of you to help, but there are probably few of you who are brave enough to do so.\" He pauses for a moment, with a look of concern on his face, \"I will give you all a few moments to think out your decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you must make your first decision. <i>Will you help defend all that is good in Middle Earth?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div></span></div><script>\n                var x;\n              function numberWithCommas(x) {\n                return x.toString().replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \",\");\n               }\n               var whichChapter;\n            function confirmTip (whichChapter) {\n                var tipAmt = Number($('#gp_tip_' + whichChapter).val().trim().replace(',', ''))\n                var myHtml =\n                    'You are sending <b>' + numberWithCommas(tipAmt) + ' Gift Points</b> to: ';\n                $('#confirmTipButton_' + whichChapter).show();\n\n                if (tipAmt < 100) {\n                    myHtml = \"The minimum amount you can tip is 100 Gift Points.

Aragorn continued to lead you, and brought you over to a seat. As he did this, you began to think about the past, and how close Sauron had come to gaining complete authority over Middle Earth. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You realize that this undefined evil could threaten all that is good, like Sauron had, but this evil unfighted could win. You had already made your mind up, now you just had to wait and see what Elrond was going to say. The room was filled with silence as Elrond walked back in and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All of you who have already cowered down and decided not to help the fate of Middle Earth, please leave now, for I don't have the heart to speak to you, nor see you.\" Elrond ordered. When the last word departed from his lips, not a soul moved. You were surprised, yet pleased to see that everyone was willing to help. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had no doubt that many of you would help, but this many is beyond belief. Certainly this is a miracle.\" Elrond continued, \"We have little or worthless knowledge of what exactly this undefined evil is hoping to achieve. It will take more than brute strength, fighting skills, and clever manuevering with a sword, bow, and an axe to win against this evil creature, although these will help. The only thing we can use now is our minds. We must figure out more before we make our first attack. All of you will travel in groups, you will go to distant lands to uncover more information. And from there, we will get back in touch when we think we've all had enough information revealed to us. Then our strategy for attack will commence.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elrond paused for a moment as if he were deeply troubled. He then took a deep breath and continued. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Form groups of nine now. Only one group already has been decided, the Fellowship of The Ring will travel together, as they once did many years ago. Boromir is no longer with us, so one of you will travel in his place. May his legacy help you travel faster and stronger. Also, I advise you all to bring weapons with you, for we do not know where this evil creature and his followers lurk.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Elrond said this, you were grateful that you had traded your extra cloak for such a sturdy sword. When you glanced up from your sword, you saw Aragorn looked towards you, waiting for your decision. Were you to follow your own path, and make a group of your own? Or would you join Aragorn and the others in the Fellowship?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the long journey to Rivendale, and exhausting council meeting, Daeloth headed to her room to retire for the evening. The night had been filled with memories...good and bad. In the end, Daeloth felt good to be back in the land that she had once called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was just an infant, Gandalf had entrusted her life in the hands of Lady Arwen and her father, Lord Elrond. Lady Arwen unhesitatingly answered the call of adopted mother to her. She taught Daeloth Elvish, as her first language, and taught her about earth and all its wonders and beauties. Lord Elrond took her under his wing, and bestowed upon her the knowledge of his kin in the art of potions. She leard what every weed, root, water, earth, wind, and tree had to offer in the healing relm...as well as the warrior relm. The potions she had learned could heal the sickest of creatures or kill the stronges of life form on Middle Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn then entered her life in her teen years. He taught her survival, fighting, and tracking. After she spent most of her time from dawn until evening learning how to defend herself, Lady Arwen would take her and teach her how to ride stallions across the meadows of Rivendale, ever so mindful of its borders, and the enemies which waited patiently beyond for a stray victim. It was then that she became a Ranger; alone in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made her home in a cave, with winding caversn of granite and limestone, with hot-springs pools and small cold waterfalls that prvided her a place to bathe and obtain fresh water without her having to leave the safety of her shelter in the middle of no where. The caves were located between Roehan and Isengod, near Fangon Forest. She knew most creatures feared the trees of old, but Lord Elrond had entroduced her to Treebeard when she was just a child, and asked him to help protect her if she ever straied into the trees in which he guarded. He agreed, and enjoyed Daeloth's many wonders into his forests. He enjoyed the way she climbed up his branches and swung on his vines. It tickled him, and he grew quite fond of the child, and often put her to sleep with some of his stories of the olden days when he was nuthing more than a sapling. How she longed for a ride in his branches once more, and look at the valley and mountains of Roehan just one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things were now in motions to which she could not turn back no mater what potion she concockted or how hard she prayed. She was to take the place of a Captain, a Warrior, a man in whom she had respected and loved. Boromir had wondered into her cave over fours years ago. It seemed as if it were only yesterday when she had looked into the bule eyes of the handsome Captain of Gundor; wet, half starved, and exhausted from riding. His men, of many hundreds, looked just as pitiful if not worse than he. She offered her cave with its many caverns as a place in which they could find rest, bath, and a hot meal. She had grain also in which the many horses could be nourished as their masters made rest for themselves. She had many bars of soap she had made from dried flowers and boars fat, in which she offered to the men to bathe in the hot-springs in which she had showed them. She gave wool blankets to those whose bedding was saturated from the heavy rains, or to them that had not sheild from the cold in which to warm themselves. She even offered her bed, made of chicken feathers and frames out of golden oak, to Captain Boromir; suggesting that it be she who slept the night on the floor, convincing him that she would be quite warm and comfortable in front of the warm fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the night was completed, where all the men had blankets, bathes, and a hot meal digesting in there malnourished stumaches, Daeloth had made over twenty pots of venicine stew and ten pots of chicken broth for those too sick to hold anything stronger down. She also added the doctors in treating the wounded and ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this, my Lady?\" Boromir asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a time...when I was but a child, in which I too needed the aid of people who were not of my own kin. Without hessitation or question they took me and and saved my live, only asking in return that I too share what I have been graciously blessed with with those in need. I had meat, drink, and a warm place to sape, my Lord. Who am I to deny hungry, tired, and povrished men the comforts of medicine, water, and meal for their horses and themselves?\" Daeloth explained as she put another log on the fire and mixed the red coals, which ignited the dry log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoromir leaned over in his chair and kissed her cheek. \"I thank you, my Lady. Neither I, nor the men of Gundor, will forget your compassion and kindness in which you have showen us this day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will you be staying, my Lord?\" Daeloth asked standing up and returning to her chair opposite of Boromir in front of the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to leave on the morrow, but I fear the storm might prevent this. My surgeons also advise me that the men need rest, or my army will suffer losses not obtained in battle. I do not wish to impose on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, my Lord. I shall offer you all that I have. I believe in what you are doing, and will aid your efforts in protecting our borders from Orci as best I can. I do not have much, but all that I have, please feel free to use, my Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoromir and his men staied for more than three weeks, letting his men get the rest they so deserved and needed before heading out to find his brother Faomir, and attack the Orci who were trying to take ofer the White City. Those were the best weeks of Daeloth's life. She had fallen in love with him, and they were to me wed the following spring. But Boromir's destiny was not to be that shared with Daeloth. He had died before she had the chance to become his bride. After his death, she returned to her cave, not venturing out more than Fangon Forest, where she hunted for food in the protection of Treebeard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was here, in Rivendale for the first time in almost ten years, called by Lord Elrond himself. For what, she did not know until she had been chosen to take the place of Boromir in the Fellowship. These where shoes in which were too big to replace, shoes she didn't want to replace. She loved Boromir, and the thought of sitting in his chair in the Council un-nerved her to the bone. It was then she heard a knock at the door, and turned to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Elrond would like a word with you Daeloth,\" smiled a blond elf as he entered the room and kissed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas!\" she cheered and she swung her arms around him like a child and hugged him. He returned her hug and smiled at her playfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act as if you have not seen me in a decade young one,\" Legolas teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It HAS been a decade since we have seen one another. And I'm not a little girl anymore Legolas,\" she reminded him with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolas took the a dagger out of his waistban sheath and played with its tip. \"When you are as old as I, one is still a baby until they are at least fifteen hundren years old my Lady.\" Both smiled as Daeloth sat down on a chair next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Elrond wants to see me?\" Daeloth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as soon as you can make your way to the Great Hall,\" Legolas informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He asked you to come get me, did he?\" she asked smiling at her old partner in crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I volunteered,\" he grinned and made his way back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right down,\" Daeloth said as she stood up and grabbed her map bag and slung it ofer her shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Middle Earth would be void of the ever loving and beautiful creatures for ever. This had been Daeloth's home for many years, and now she was about to lose everything she held so dear to her. If only she has spent more time here, with her family? Why did she have to wait so long to appreciate the ones who cared for her most, to spend ten years away from Rivendale when it was entering its final days filled with Elvish life? How she longed to be a little girl, curled up in Lady Arwen's arms again, having her comb her hair and tell her stories of her and Prince Legolas growing up. How long would those beloved stories last before fading into legends and mythical tales? What about Frodo and all the adventures of the Hobbits? Would they be forgotten in time too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this proved to be more than Daeloth could bare. Tears began to stream down her face as she sat under Thuja, the Elf tree of life. As the tears made s-curves down her ceeks to the tip of her chin, the cool fall breeze picked up swooping her hair about her face, and causing brown crisp leaves to fall on her lap and top of her head. A gentle hand removed one of the leaves that had fallen on her head and let it go as the wind picked it up and floated it into the land somewhere else in Rivendale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was always your favorite spot,\" a familiar voice spoke as the figure sat down beside Daeloth. \"I remember the first time I lost you. I looked all over Rivendale for you, and lost all hope in finding you. Then what should I find curled up and sleeping under Thuja? You, my beloved child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything was so simple then Lady Arwen,\" Daeloth whimpered as she wiped her runny nose and dried her tears. \"What is to become of us when the Elves leave this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen smiled and held her close. \"We may not be here in body, but the Elf spirit shall be here, and in all of Middle Earth. As long as the humans believe in us and love one another, the Elves shall remain forever in their hearts. Besides, I shall be in Gundor with Aragorn. You will not be alone Daeloth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Elrond is leaving. Who will heal the people of Middle Earth when he is gone? Gandalf will be gone, as well as your grandmother.\" Daeloth stood up and looked to the outer trees of Rivendale, where the sunlight beamed through the leaves, shining rays of light here and there on the green grass covering the floor of Rivendale. \"What is to become of us all...what is to become of the Fellowship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only time will tell. As long as we bind ourselves together in unity, friendship, and love, there will be peace in Middle Earth. When greed, hatred, and bitterness invades our hearts, then all we have worked and died for will be lost. The world will then change, and on that day will the Elves truly leave Middle Earth, for they can not abide in wickedness,\" Arewn explained as she too stood up beside Daeloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What must I do now?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daeloth opened the door to the High-Elven Camber where Lord Elrond stayed. He was leaning over a number of maps, books, journals, and she even thought she might have seen a glimpse of what appeared to be old Bilbo and darling Frodo's book! Not wanting to disturb her Grandfather from his deep meditation, she stepped ever so lightly across the room and stood behind him. Her foot steps were as light as a cool wind blowing across a meadow of green spring grass on a warm day. Her presence sent a rush of warmth over Elrond, and he turned to take her hand into his, and he kissed it with his lips ever so gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, Grandfather?\" Daeloth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are comforting to me. How I've missed the little girl who I use to catch hiding under Thuja!\" he said standing up and embracing her. \"Come, we have much to talk about.\" He led her to a couch made of woven willow and lush green reeds, with pillows laid upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you feeling?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...empty; like a newly constructed home with no tenants to claim me,\" she answered looking out the window into the city of Rivendell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty? Is that all that troubles you?\" he perused. Elrond had a way of looking into the eyes of a person and telling the utter most secrets of the soul. He counted it as a blessing, and at times a curse. He was glad to know when one was trying to be deceitful, yet heavy laden when noticing the hint of betrayal by one he held dear. But, Elrond had lived many years of men and Elves. He knew that in this day and age one could not rely on just feelings alone. One must use the knowledge gained in life to decipher the good with the bad. One must weigh the cost of all choices and their consequences. Elves had a very good way of doing this; seldom offering advice to one without giving them both a yes or no answer. In the end, the Elves knew the decider must choose his own path in which to travel; for Elves, for the most part, did not concern themselves with the worries nor the cares of men. But this was his adopted grand-daughter. He cared for her as much as Arwen and Aragorn did. In a way, he had wished she did not volunteer to take Boromir's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElrond knew Daeloth was more than capable in taking Boromir's place, yet he wanted to protect her. It wasn't like Arwen, who was given the grace of immortality when born. Daeloth was born of men and therefore a mortal life. The thought of loosing her of old age was hard enough to dwell upon then the fact that she could be killed at any moment along the way to the age of wisdom. In the end, Elrond knew that Daeloth did not end up in the Fellowship by chance; like Frodo and the One Ring. There was a purpose to everything; for the universe held a great balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s Boromir. I keep thinking about him...about what could have been...should have been. How am I to rid my dreams of him, and yet be known as the one who has taken his place? I wish I could just return to my cave and not deal with such matters.\" Daeloth put her hands over her eyes and began to rub them. She was weary with thinking. Everything was changing for her. She had known this day would come, but felt insecure in herself. She wasn't sure she could be strong enough to be what was expected of her. Oh, she was physically and mentally strong enough. But her emotions were still that of one who had lost their mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boromir was a good man, Daeloth. He loved you with all his heart, and I would have been proud to have bid him son. But that was not his fate. The Ring had chosen what was to be to be in the end. He died with honour. You must morn him for the man he was my child, but don't live to morn. There is another path your life has taken. One that even I can not entirely see. Boromir will always be with you, for his spirit abides in those that loved him the most. He will watch out for you and come to you in dreams and visions to keep you from all evil. Trust in his, and do not morn his death, but rejoice in his life among the Elves of old who have departed these lands long ago. For he dwells in a new Fellowship now; one that can never be defeated!\" Elrond rose from the couch and went back to his table of maps, books, and journals. \"Come, I have something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth took back her wondering thoughts and tucked them deep inside her heart for now. She then rose and met Elrond at the table. On it laid open an old map of tunnels that appeared to lie beneath Middle Earth. Each tunnel seemed to have and entrance and an exit in some type of earthly vegetation or natural landmark. In some places, there were little towns and villages circled in red ink upon the map. On other parts of the map, there were places of refuge that Daeloth had been shown before when she was young by Elrond circled in green ink. At the top right hand corner of the map was a small drawing of a sceptre which contained an odd coloured jewel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a map of concern for the Fellowship. I have circled the places in red which I have seen in my dream, which appear to be place of uncertainty and mistrust. It is in these places your guard must be at full alert. The ones in green are allies to the Elves and Aragorn. If you need rest, trust these folk; for they would give their lives for the safety of our people, and those in whom the Elves call friend,\" Elrond advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Daeloth pointed to the picture at the top of the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElrond walked around to the other side of the table and poured himself a cup of water and began to take a drink. The cool water was refreshing to him, as he took his seat. \"That is the Sceptre of Edlairth, given to the first wizard born to Middle Earth by the Half-Elves. It is most powerful, and in the wrong hands could be more powerful, more dangerous than the Ring that was cast into Mount Doom. It is this that the Fellowship and the other unified groups of the council must obtain and bring back to Lothlorien! There is much evil that still strides upon Middle Earth. With the Elves leaving the shores to set sail to the East, we must get this sceptre back and it too must go with us on our journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are all these other papers about? Is this all about the sceptre?\" she asked flipping through the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There are other things that must be taken with us. A book of Elendil, the Grail of the Elements, and the Star of Thoure must all too be found and taken with us. Each have been used by the Elves to control potions to cure the sick, but can be used to cause death; used to control the elements of the earth for the good of crops, but can be used to create great famines; used as a portal to travel, however if in the wrong hands no hand will be safe or be able to keep out the evils of the land. We must retain these items, and leave the shores of Middle Earth with the items traveling with us on the high seas to the east.\" Elrond walked over to Daeloth and looked deeply into her eyes, and began talking to her in his mind. \"This will not be an easy task, and the journal is filled with perils. Trust in your instincts and don't give weigh to your emotions. Stay unified in the Fellowship, and all will be assured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth smiled and kissed his cheek. Elrond embraced her and handed her the map. \"It is your turn now. Let the grace of the Elves protect you my grand-daughter. Stay close to the Fellowship, and trust in their council. They will not lead you astray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now, and make ready your journey.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daeloth made her way to what the Halflings called the Great Room, for it was the greatest room of all of Rivendell. There a feast was being partaken in honour of all the counsels chosen to find the lost items of the Rivendell, Lothlorien, and of the Eldamar. All had their own special blessings given to them by the Half-Elven beloved Elbereth, or to the Halflings, Valimar. Though the tools were made during the better peaceful days of old, in a time where dwarfs and elves mingled together in great fellowship, they had now been turned to cause much sorrow across Middle Earth; especially in Osgiliath, and in the lands of the mighty horse lords of the Riddermark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Osgiliath and Rohan had been plagued with famine and with the trials and tribulations caused by the Orcs, that led up to the Final Great War for the One Ring; which led, almost, to the total destruction of Rohan's respected Helm's Deep, and to great peril and destruction of Minas Anor, also known as Minas Tirith in the days of the Great Kings. The people were physically and emotionally famished. They needed time to heal from the loss of their loved ones, for over one third of the Riddermark Marshals were destroyed; King Th\u00e9oden, Lord of the Mark, also fell among the bravest of Rohan leaving his nephew, Eomer, Lord of the Riddermark, and King. Peace had swept across the land, for none had known, save the Lords and Lady of the Elves, that these tools of power lay at rest in Middle Earth. This is why Lord Elrond called counsel once more, to keep this burned secret among the peoples of Middle Earth, and to find the items as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen came up to Daeloth and led her to the table where the Fellowship was feasting. With them sat two other individuals of whom she did not know, for she had seen little of those who lived beyond Rivendell and Fangorn Forest. Daeloth stood before the group as Arwen introduced her adopted daughter to them. \"Daeloth, adopted daughter of Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Arwen Evenstar, daughter of Lord Elrond; meet your new fellowship and family that will lead you through great fears and foes lingering in Middle Earth. Here sits Gimli, son of Gloin, Legoles you know, as well as our beloved Hobbits: Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Frodo. There sits also our allies, and kindred spirits of the Mark, King Eomer, and Lady Eowyn. Gandalf, whom you love is not here, but nigh on the mount. For he has many things, in which to meditate on this night, but will surely join us afterward. Sit now, and make merry with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth bowed and took her seat between Arwen and Eowyn. She and Eowyn began to talk as if they were childhood girlfriends, for they had many of things that were common among them. Eowyn was just a few years older than Daeloth, and also lost her mother as an infant. She did, however have the comfort of her father, yet could not remember him, for he was in constant war to keep the Riddermark free from the terrene of the Orci. She had wanted to make voice with Lord Eomer, but he seemed pre-occupied with the little ones and with his Marshals coming to and fro with counsel of his peoples. She could not help but notice the light that flickered in his hazel-green eyes. Even though his face was smart, his eyes showed great love for his people and his friends. Daeloth hoped that one day she could talk with him and perhaps become a friend to the great Lord of Rohan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, the Hobbits; Merry and Pippin, jumped up on the long feasting table and began to entertain the folk of the fellowship and the Elves. Even dear old Bilbo got up and sang a song, he had just written for the occasion earlier that day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired and full, Daeloth stood up from the feast. \"Please do not get up,\" she told the men, who were starting to stand in respect for the lady. \"I shall retire for the evening. It was wonderful to meet you good dear folk, and I look forward to your counsel and companionship on our journey together. I shall see you in the morrow.\" She the turned to her mother and kissed her delicate hand and bid her good night, in which was returned by Arwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me walk you, my Lady. For I too am exhausted from the journey and of the merriment of the evening,\" said Eomer as he stood from his seat. He then bowed,\u201d I bid you all a good night, and ask your pardon for my leaving the feast so soon. My Lord Aragorn and Lady Arwen,\" he bowed again, in which Aragorn stood and nodded in return. Eomer then took Daeloth's hand and placed it upon his arm and led her out of the Great hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEomer led her up many steps and past many talan before he had reached her room. Without a word the entire way up, he then turned to her and nodded his head as he prepared to leave. \"My Lord, must you go?\" she heard herself ask. Eomer turned, at which she again had seen the sparkle in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you bid me to leave or may I have the treasure of speaking with the grand-daughter of the Mighty Lord Elrond?\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not tease me, my Lord. For I love my grand-father dearly!\" Daeloth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEomer took her hands into his. \"I did not wish to offend, my lady. But I have long wanted to know your thoughts since I first saw you join us in the Great Hall. I regret my evening was filled with business, and I could not enjoy your company 'til now. But it is late, and if you prefer, I can call upon you in the morning, at the wakening of the sparrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daeloth awoke to the sound of gentle breathing by her bed. In one fluid motion she pulled her dagger from beneath her pillow and threw it at her attacker. She heard him dodge and the blade clatter uselessly to the floor. She jumped out of bed, and rushed him trying to strike him with her fist. He grabbed her arm and pulled it above her head, then snagged her waist with his other arm. Holding her thus, he dipped her and pressed a kiss to her mouth. Daeloth's eyes finally adjusted to the strange half-light which was filtering through her room and she recognized....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning my dear.\" Legolas smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? And why are you kissing me?\" Daeloth's temper flared and she stomped on Legolas' instep, then elbowed him in the face, effectively freeing herself from his hold. She walked over to her bureau, pulled out a dressing gown, put it on and began braiding her long auburn hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked again, as she finished braiding two sections of her hair, one on either side of her face, and looped them around her head, leaving the rest cascading like a waterfall down to the middle of her back. She turned impatiently to Legolas and discovered he was gone. She turned in confusion to her bed and saw that there was somebody lying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming Legolas was playing a trick on her, she walked over to it and pulled the covers back. \"Really Lego-\" Daeloth stopped and screamed as she saw that Boromir's body was lying in her bed, covered with dozens of wounds and crawling with larva. Boromir opened his eyes, looked at her and stood up. Daeloth stood frozen in awe-struck horror as he moved toward her, placed his arms around her and leaned in to kiss her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth felt tears fall from her eyes as she whimpered, \"No. Please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the corpse of Boromir was replaced and the Boromir that she remembered was standing in front of her. He had his hand raised in a farewell wave and the smile on his face was the one he had given only to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell my love.\" He whispered softly, and then faded slowly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boromir! BOROMIR!\" Daeloth screamed, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone wrapped their arms around her and soothed, \"Shhhh Daeloth. It's only a dream. Hush dear one. You're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth turned and saw Eomer standing behind her. His eyes captured her as they had at dinner and she heard the whisper of Boromir's voice in her mind~ <i>He will give you strength and grow to love you as you will one day love him. Choose him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his voice faded from her mind, Daeloth awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wrapped tightly in a blanket and someone's arms, being gently rocked back and forth as someone softly sang an elven lullaby to her. It took her a moment to recognize the voice of her father and the arms of her mother. She relaxed and and the rocking and singing stopped.  A candle was lit and by it's light she could see the worried faces of Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond looking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling dear heart?\" Her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to have worried all of you.\" Daeloth murmured softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen hugged her a little tighter and said, \"We love you Daeloth. You needn't apologize.\" She looked at her adopted daughter and tucked a few stray hairs behind her ears. \"It's been years since you have had a vision. What was this one about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth looked at her grandfather. His eyes lit with understanding. \"So it has begun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen and Aragorn looked from Daeloth to Elrond. \"What has begun?\" Aragorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElrond turned to the window. \"I had no wish to tell you this Aragorn, but Daeloth <i>must</i> accompany you. Some of the items you seek can not be found except by those in the other realm. Boromir's love for Daeloth keeps him connected to Middle Earth and it is that connection you will need to use to find some of the objects you seek.\" Elrond faced his family again. \"This is the only way for Boromir's spirit to find peace. If you do not seek his help while completing this task, or seek his help and fail, Boromir will be doomed to dwell forever between this realm and the next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the longer it takes us to find the objects, the more time I have with Boromir.\" Daeloth said slowly, hope rising in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen carefully killed this destructive hope.\"No good can come of keeping him in limbo, dearest. You will not find a way to raise him from the dead, and the time you will spend with him will be in your dreams. You risk separating your body and your consciousness and being doomed forever yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is right, Daeloth. Besides, the longer he is trapped in limbo, the less his grasp of either realm will be. After awhile, he will be of no use to you and you will not be able to redeem him.\" Elrond added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth's head and heart were spinning with everything she had just learned. Visions of Boromir and their time together kept flying through her mind, interrupted more and more frequently by the look in Eomer's eyes as they had said good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arwen sensed her daughter's confusion and motioned for Aragorn and her father to leave. They both gave Daeloth a hug before they left and Aragorn kissed her on the forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well dear heart.\" He murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone at last, Arwen faced her daughter. \"Tell me of the one who has captured your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth raised startled eyes to Arwen's face. \"What?\" She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen tenderly stroked Daeloth's hair. \"I raised you darling. I know you better than you know yourself. There is much confusion in you right now. And it has little to do with Boromir and much to do with a man you have recently met. Have you fallen for Legolas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Daeloth admitted. \"It is...Eomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. Gallent Eomer. I had wondered if he might catch your fancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\" Daeloth protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen shushed her. \"Daeloth, I know Boromir was your first love. But it was not meant to be. I am not saying it is your fault he died, so remove that silly notion from your head.\" Arwen waited until Daeloth nodded and then continued,  \"I think you were meant for another and perhaps it is time for you to stop mourning Boromir and find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful timing Mother. I'm about to set out on a quest I might not return from, guided by the spirit of my dead love. Any man would love to come into a set of circumstances like that and sweep a girl off her feet.\" Daeloth frowned at her mother, increasingly frustrated with the way this night was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eomer understands war, Daeloth and I know that if he did not feel such an obligation to stay with his people, he would be joined the Fellowship. I also noticed the way he was watching you tonight when he was not distracted by messengers, and he watches you much the same way your father used to watch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to, Mother?\" Daeloth questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled fondly in remembrance. \"Yes used to. Before we pledged ourselves to each other, when he still thought I could never love one such as he. Eomer has the same look in his eyes when he gazes at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden Boromir's last words came to her mind. <i>He will give you strength and grow to love you as you will one day love him. Choose him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth bowed her head and said quietly, \"But I still love Boromir.\" A single tear traced a path down her cheek, shining like a diamond in the candlelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen gently placed her hand under Daeloth's chin and raised her eyes to meet her own. \"Oh darling,\" She said. \"You always will. He was your first love and no one can take his place in your heart. But there is room in your heart for another and I think Eomer is the one. Just give him a chance. That's all I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth looked in to her mother's beautiful eyes and felt herself wavering on a tightrope. She was going to fall any second, but it was up to her which side she fell off of.</span></div></div>",

I have its opposite.\" He unbuttons his tunic a little, showing a golden horse with ruby eyes. \"The Sun of Rohan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I cannot accept such a gift. It is too great to take on this journey.\" stuttered Daeloth. \"You must. For not only will this show others of Middle Earth that you know the king of Rohan, but I want you to think of me on your journey.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Daeloth bowed her head gracefully and apologized, \"I regret, my lord that I must leave with the Fellowship on the morrow before the days first light. I tend to eat my morning meal as we make way to the Misty Mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure before your task is finished we shall meet again, my lady.\" Eomer took Daeloth\u2019s hand and kisses it gently as he exited her room and retired for the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth took out the map that Elrond had given her and began to study it. As she unrolled the map, a thin piece of paper fell out of it. Daeloth thought this to be odd because she had watched Elrond roll the map, yet did not see him place anything inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the paper were items written, in old Elfish tongue, ingredients to potions with numbers places on the left side of each. It was extremely had for her to translate, for she had not learned the old Elfish that well. She took out her journal and began to translate as much as she could without having to guess what the words meant. She then looked at the map and noticed something peculiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside meadows, mountains, forests, bodies of water and in desert areas were randomly placed numbers. Daeloth glanced back at the piece of paper that had fallen out of the map and put her finger on the map at the same time. She had come to the conclusion that the numbers on the map clearly had something to do with the items listed on the paper. She did not have much time left in the evening to investigate the similarities of the two, and continued to translate the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her almost four hours before she had finished the task of translating the potions before she felt she had done her best. She went to her pack and stuffed the small journal into one of the outside flaps and shut it. She then went over to her belt and unsheathed her sword and two daggers Elrond had crafted specially for her years ago. The blades had become dull over the usage of the items throughout the many years she had owned them. She took out a stone from a pocked on her trousers and headed to the window sill. As she sat down she gave the stone a good lick with her tongue and began to sharpen her sword. Back and forth she glided the rock up and down the edge until she felt she could get the blade no sharper. She repeated the process two more times with her daggers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter feeling competent that she had made her sword and daggers lethal weapons again, she went to her quiver and counted the arrows that lay inside. She only counted ten, which would not last if the Fellowship were to fall into an ambush. She went to her shrunk, which contained more sticks, already sharpened arrow heads, and Elfish styled golden feathers. She took the bundle of item over to the small rounded wooded table that was placed in the middle of her room and began to piece as many arrows as she could together. Before she could finish the task, her eyes became extremely heavy, and soon she fell fast asleep; feathers and arrow heads in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daeloth, wake up,\" she heard a familiar voice say. Daeloth turned her head to see Samwise Gamgie standing next to her with all her things gathered up and tossed on the little hobbits back. \"The Fellowship is to meet at the Seat of the Counsel before we take off. I tried convincing King Aragorn to let us all have a proper breakfast, so we could have full stomachs to head out if you get my meaning my lady. But, Aragorn insisted we leave before the rise of the blue birds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeloth smiled at her little friend. \"He is very wise, my dear Sam. But in this mater, I think my stomach is in agreement with the hobbits.\" Sam smiled. He was happy that at least one person agreed with his assessment, and headed out of the room with all her things, save her belt and quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the Council, she noticed everyone going over the items they had packed and checking items off the list that Aragorn had made. Gimli insisted on taking a spare axe with him, and the hobbits left behind a change of clothes so they could make more room for food. Legoles took on the burden of an extra quiver saying he was going to make sure he wouldn't run out of arrows. Gimli told him he wouldn't have ran out of arrows the last time if he had taken the time to fetch the arrows out of the dead Orcs the last time. Legoles told Gimli he wouldn't need an extra axe if he learned that axes are made to chop down Orcs and trees and not to try to destroy magic rings and hard rocks. Daeloth always like to listen to Gimli and Legoles bicker with one another. She knew that they both loved one another dearly, but they were both stubborn and very proud of their ancestors and of who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn came over to Daeloth's pack and looked at the items she had packed. Every little item inside was exactly what Aragorn wanted. The only thing in the pack that wasn't on Aragorn's list was the map and journal. Aragorn took out the rolled map and laid it on the stone table in front of Elrond's royal chair. \"Daeloth, what is this you carry, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandfather Elrond gave it to me last night, after supper.\" Daeloth explained as the rest of the Fellowship gathered near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Pippin asked standing on his tip-toes to see the strange map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the Map of Lothlorien. It was a gift given to the Lady of Light many years ago, to guide her people into the safe parts of Middle Earth. The Elves had added to it after Saran made the rings of great evil. It had been kept in hiding, unknown to man, dwarf, Orci, and all other manner of creatures on Middle Earth; for the protection of the Elves,\" Legoles explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandfather said the places circled in green are safe to travel, but he said to be wary of the ones in red, for they are places of great deceit,\" said Daeloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we have this the first time?\" Gimli said rolling his eyes. \"We would have known not to go through Mordor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget that evil creature Shelobe, and that nasty cave. If Mr. Frodo and I never set eyes on that evil place again I will die a happy Hobbit, if you get my meaning!\" exclaimed Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the truth Sam,\" Frodo agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Gandalf bent over and picked up the piece of paper that was rolled up with the map. \"I found that with the map, but I wasn't aware that Grandfather put it in,\" said Daeloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGandalf smiled and looked at it carefully, \"Dear Lord Elrond. He is always helping us without speaking a word. He had pointed out items on the map which may prove to be very useful on our journey. This is very handy indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to translate as much as I could understand last night, and I wrote the items in my journal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Very good, our young friend. You are already proving your worth to us before we have time to test you in combat. We must load up Bill and the rest of the horses. For the sun draws nigh and soon the roads will be unsafe to travel. We must make haste!\" Gandalf ordered, and everyone packed their respective horses to leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Elrond sits at the head of a great table, looking very grave. He motions for all of you to sit down. Everyone obeys, with four on each side and Aragorn sitting across from Elrond. You find yourself in between Pippin and Galdalf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElrond raps on the table for silence. \"I thank you all for coming so quickly. I will get right to the point: a new evil is growing. Middle Earth is depending on you, the Fellowship, to find the source of this evil...and stop it.\" He pauses and seems to look each of you straight in the eyes. \"We have reports of Orcs roaming in the Forgotten Forest.\" On your left, you feel Pippin stiffen, and on your right, Gandalf shifts uneasily. You yourself grip the edge of the table so hard, your knuckles turn white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" continues Elrond, \"from the Mines of Moria come other strange reports. Both are dangerous.

The very next day, the journey begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about a day and a half, all of you ride hard. During this time you learn as much as you can about the Forgotten Forest. You find that it is a dark place, full of unknown creatures. 'Some not so unknown,' you think bitterly of the Orcs. You finger your thin blades---they are strapped in an X across your back, hidden by your cloak. To draw them, you cross your arms over your chest and put one hand on each shoulder...and on each blade. Then you whip them out, much to the surprise of your unfortunate victim! But your twin blades aren't all of your weapons: you also have, hanging on your belt, some daggers which you can throw with deadly accuracy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's night now...the evening of your second day on the trail. Nimli and Sam are trying to make a fire but are having little success. Frodo is frowning---he disagrees that we should stop, but everyone is tired and needs to rest. But you can't sleep. After tossing and turning for a while, you kick off your blanket in disgust. Practice, you decide, will help. So you grab your daggers and head to a little grove of trees about 30 yards away from the camp. It's close enough that you can see the sight, yet far enough that you won't disturb the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour passes as you practice throwing your daggers. You pick different trees and try to hit a particular spot: a leaf, a branch, a crack, and once, a large bug. You are so absorbed in this that you fail to stay on your guard. To your credit there are no snapping twigs, rustling leaves, or anyhting else to warn you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an unseen assailant grabs you around the waist, pinning your arms to your sides. You struggle in vain and open your mouth to scream. A voice whispers, \"Be quiet\", and you...</span></div></div>",

One dagger still hangs from your belt, and you strain to reach it. Your fingertips just brush the handle...got it! Holding the weapon firmly in your hand, you arch your back to give yourself more room. Whoever is holding you is strong but not overpoweringly so. It chuckles softly, and you falter, because the sound is quite familiar. Having just begun the strike with the dagger, your hand slips, and the blade just nicks the attacker's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Daeloth! So this is what happens when someone attacks you from behind...\" You break free from his grasp and whirl around, although you already know who it is. A tall, blond elf holds his scratched hand to his eyes, studying it. With a few whispered words, the wound closes up and disappears. That taken care of, Legolas grins boyishly at you. \"Surprise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are definitley not amused. \"Ha ha, very funny. I could have killed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolas rolls his eyes. \"You only wish, my L\u00f3melith,\" he snorts, using the nickname he gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's you who rolls your eyes. \"What are you doing out here anyway?\" you ask, changing the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the first watch, and when you ran off, I figured you could take care of yourself. But it's been a long time, and I feared you had lost your way.\" Angrily, you start to reply to that, but you catch the glint in his eye and know he is only teasing. Instead you bend down and pick up the dropped dagger. When you straighten up, you find that Legolas has retrieved your two other ones from the trees at which you threw them. You accept them with a murmured word of thanks. \"I suppose we'd better return,\" you remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my watch is going to be over soon,\" Legolas answers. The two of you make your way out of the trees, quietly chatting about the journey. Then Legolas holds up a hand and puts a finger to his lips. You immediately stop talking and peer around him to see what's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see makes you gasp. A band of Orcs is moving towards the camp! Legolas motions to them, and then to the camp. His meaning is clear: one of you will distract the Orcs and the other will warn the camp. Who will do what?</span></div></div>",

Then he is gone, running to warn the Fellowship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you're running too, but in a different direction. When you get near enough to the band, you count and get a rough estimate of about seventy-five. Just enough for this little mission to be classified as \"suicide\". You hold your twin blades firmly in your hands, and they reassure you a bit. Though they make look thin and flimsy, actually they were forged to be unbreakable---within reason, of course. But they are still much stronger than any battle sword Aragorn will ever posess. And as for your daggers: before you left, Elrond placed a spell on them. No matter how far you throw them, the whispered word of \"murisl\" will send them right back into their sheaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Orcs are set on one thing---the camp---so they don't pay any attention to you. Well, you are moving almost in complete silence through the tall grass. Maybe they don't even know you're here, you hope. But the objective of your mission is not to stay hidden. It's to distract the Orcs until the Fellowship comes to your aid. Or leaves to safety. Either one works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ahead of the band now, but not by much. Just ahead of you are some cliffs, with a semi-narrow entrance in between them. You pause...they give you an idea. If you are quick, you can climb up the cliff and cause an avalanche that will make the entrance even smaller and maybe block it off completely. But if you don't do it fast enough, the Orcs could get through and yu would be on the cliffs, powerless to stop them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly seconds remain for you to make your decision.

Your destination is a large boulder, which sits precariously on a ledge that's a little less than halfway up the slope. Once you reach it, you waste no time in getting behind it and firmly planting your feet. A hard shove is all it takes to get it moving, and it tumbles wildly down the cliff.  As you had hoped, it creates a rockslide of other stones and debris. Some Orcs have already made it through the entrance, but they are the first of few. Your makeshift avalanche fills nearly all of the gap, and the crack that's left is barely big enough for two or three Orcs to squeeze in at at a time---and when they do, you will be waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first you must take care of the five that already made it through. Placing your swords down, you grab your daggers and throw them in rapid succession. Two Orcs are down and your daggers are gone. \"Murisl!\" you yell, and just like that, the three daggers are back in their sheaths. \"What do you know...it works!\" Aided by Elrond's spell, you finish off the rest of the Orcs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaggers, though, will not defeat the army. It's time to put your sword-skills to the test. Half-jumping, half-sliding, you make it down the cliff just as two Orcs stumble through the crack. \"Hello,\" you greet them. With a spin and two well-placed thrusts, they fall dead to the ground. \"Goodbye.\" Three more squeeze through, but you dispose of them too. \"Daeloth, this is the best idea you've had in a while,\" you congratulate yourself. Instead of fighting the entire Orc army, you get to take on a few on a time. True, this is still no easy feat; but two or three is better than seventy-five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shout makes you look up. Doing so causes you to lose your concentration, and the Orc you were fighting trips you up. He smashes his ax at you, but you roll to the side and it thuds into the earth. He yanks it up and raises it again---only to stop as an odd look comes over his face. Dropping the ax, he steps back and collapses, an arrow embedded in his chest.

The Orcs stop coming, but your victory is short-lived. A rumbling starts---softly at first, but growing ominously louder. Without warning, your makeshift wall explodes, throwing Aragorn backwards though you manage to hang on. \"What's happening?\" you scream to no one in particular. Your words die in your throat, though, when you see what is behind the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, all you see is the group of Orcs, huddling around something. But as they stop aside, they reveal who is responsible for shattering the wall. A tall man, clothed in a simple black robe, glides out. He holds a staff that's like Gandalf's...a wizard! A dark wizard, to be more exact. You turn to run, but he fixes his gaze on you, and you find that moving is impossible. With a grim smile, he mutters something and waves his staff---and suddenly you are flying through the air, straight towards the Orcs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land hard, and your wind is knocked out. As you lie there gasping, a huge hand grabs your hair, yanking your body upright. It's the lead Orc, and he doesn't look friendly. He growls at you, then at the dark wizard, who simply inclines his head. The Orc bares his teeth in a horrible smile, and you know you have been sentenced to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffortlessly, the Orc hoists you off the ground, still holding you by your hair. The pain brings tears to your eyes but you know it's nothing compared to what you'll probably be enduring in a few moments. He carries you over to one of the scattered trees that dot the field. Before you have time to wonder why, he shoves you against the unyielding bark and places his hand around your throat. You know very well that he could simply snap your neck, but Orcs enjoy seeing their victims suffer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world is going black at the edges. \"No...\" you choke out, but the Orc just growls with pleasure. This is it, you realize, and a wave of sadness sweeps over you.

Mustering all your strength, you try to sit up, but it's no use---you're still too weak to do anything but watch. So that's why you can do nothing, not even shout a warning, as another Orc slips up behind Aragorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouldn't have worried. The second Orc goes down with an arrow between his shoulder blades. \"Thanks, Legolas,\" you breath, quieter than a butterfly's wingbeat. Aragorn swings his sword and takes care of the Orc that tried to kill you. Then he whirls around, and when he sees you, his face softens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daeloth,\" he gasps. \"Are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not dead, if that's what you mean,\" you quip softly. \"But...pretty close.\" You confirm this last statement with a racking cough that almost knocks you out again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of your eye, you see flashes of light, and raise your eyebrows quizzically.

Silent because the three missing members of the band have not returned. You pick miserably at your food, part of the reason being that you're not sure it's edible.

The fact that what may have been your last moments ever with Legolas were spent in unconciousness. Yes, you do feel something for him, deep in a hidden place inside yourself---a place that you haven't brought to light in a very long time. But now that you have admitted your feelings to yourself, it may be too late, and you will never have had the chance to open up your heart.

Your nerves are so frayed, every little noise has you on your toes, ready for a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night goes on, and before you know it, your watch is over. Nimli relieves you, but as you walk away, you hear it----footsteps. You turn silently to Nimli, who grips his ax, letting you know that he head it too.

A race of human-like beings who survive and even thrive in the Forest. They are called the...\" he frowns as he tries to remember. \"The Dennali. 'Dennali' literally does mean 'child of the Forest' in Elvish, so obviously they are a learned people. Or perhaps they are of elven descent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who is this child?\" you break in, tired of this. \"Or, rather, where?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, she's---\" Legolas turns around and does a double-take. \"Where'd she go?\" He begins looking in the thick shrubbery surrounding the clearing. \"Come out,\" he calls softly. \"They are friends of mine.\" There is a slight rustling, but nothing emerges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas,\" you start, \"are you perhaps feeling all right? Did you hit your head on a branch, or...anything like that?\" For truly he is starting to worry you, what with his ramblings of a \"Forest-child\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving. It's true,\" he says stubbornly, but your well-trained eye catches a glimpse of the weariness on his face. He starts to sway back and forth on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to fall down dead, and then you will wish you came with me,\" you tell him. Then you pull out your daggers with a smile to let him know that you are only joking. \"Are my convincing words enough, or do I have to bring you back with brute force?

It wraps its arms around you, and you catch sight of a blade gleaming in the darkness. Instinct takes over, and you duck and roll, trying to flip the thing off. Its hold loosens, and you take advantage of this be arching your back and slamming onto the ground repeatedly. As soon as you feel the hold slacken even more, you grab your dagger and spin over with the point of your blade pointed right at the thing's neck. Then you halt in shock. </span></div></div>",

You take a step back and she springs to her feet, her breath coming in short blasts. She doesn't run off, though, allowing you to thoroughly examine her. At first glance she appeared to be young, maybe only ten or eleven, but now you see that she is in those middle years: the ones between childhood and young-adulthood. Her skin is not pale or even tan, but oddly streaked with shadows and dirt, which allows her to blend in with practically anything. When you look closer you realize that it is part of her natural coloring. Her ragged black hair is cropped close to her chin, and her eyes are darker than a shadowed cave at midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf what race is she? you wonder. As you study her further, it seems that she is part of every one. Her obvious look is human, and yet, she holds herself like royalty---or an elf. Her ears are even slightly pointed. But she is slim and small like a hobbit. It is also clear that she is 'one' with nature, like the dwarves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolas quickly steps up. \"Daeloth,\" he says quietly, \"this is Mexle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-ex-el.\" You try out the odd-sounding name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the Dennali that I rescued from the Orc.\" At this the girl comes alive and turns to Legolas. She starts chattering away in a queer tongue that, again, seems to be a mix of every language. You catch some words that obviously have Elvish, Human and Dwarvish roots; but not enough that you understand what she is saying. Legolas, at least, seems to understand her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mexle says that you are a better fighter than you look,\" Legolas reports when the girl finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unsure whether to be insulted or flattered. You finally decide on, \"Um, can you tell her 'thank you'?...I think,\" you add under your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl--Mexle---turns to you and speaks in a soft, musical voice that seems to have a gritty edge to it. The thing is, she speaks in plain Human. \"You are quite welcome. This is good that you have the mind to know when you have been given a compliment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, not a problem,\" you answer in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this,\" she answers shortly. \"The prince has saved my life from one of the Orrulk that roams this wood. I am in his debt. Anything you wish to know, please ask, and I will answer it to the best of my abilities.\"</span></div></div>",

Chastened, you motion for him to go ahead. He turns back to the Dennali girl and says simply, \"My question was to be what Daeloth just asked. Please answer as though it was I who asked.\" Mexle gazes back at him, a little smile on her face. She seems to be drinking in this moment before she answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, prince. You too, human and dwarf,\" she tells you and Nimli, a little more gruffly than how she said it to Legolas. \"Let's be off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" protests Nimli. \"It's the dead of night, and we're supposed to go running off through this creepy forest with just a little girl as a guide?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMexle glares murderously at him and you, sensing a storm brewing, quickly step in. \"Nimli, perhaps you can go and get Aragorn.

She is always trying to get next to him, to show him something of interest. Yes, it's safe for you to say that she finds herself attracted to the gracious elf. And who wouldn't be? He is the brightest thing in this dreary forest. A kind or funny word is always ready at his lips, and he poses no threat anyone; or so it seems. When he is fighting, he can still take anyone's breath away at how graceful and yet how strong he is. \"Ha,\" you mutter under your breath as Mexle catches Legolas's arm to keep him from brushing up against a thorny bush. You know that however strongly Mexle wishes, they cannot be together. Although Legolas looks just a bit older than Mexle, he is in fact about a thousand years older and wiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in surprise as something occurs to you. He is a thousand years older and wiser than you, too! So if it is impossible for Mexle to be with him...how is it possible for you to be with him? The only way for an elf and a human to live a happily married life is if the elf will give up his or her immortality. And what elf would do that? True, Aragorn and Eowyn are an example of this; but their love was greater than ever seen before. In addition, they had known each other for years before. Legolas and you have only just met a few weeks before. No, more like just one week! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, Daeloth?\" calls Legolas, looking over his shoulder as Mexle hurries him along. \"Wait,\" he tells the Forest-child, \"Daeloth has stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" you answer, unable to look Legolas in the eye. \"I am but tired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Mexle's face clearly tells you exactly what she thinks of that. Legolas catches the expression and turns on her. \"She is still weak from an Orc attack that happened a day ago. She saved the Fellowship with her quick thinking and sharp fighting.\" His voice holds admiration for you, and you can't stop an embarrassed blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Mexle shoots you a look of pure venom, and you almost laugh at the realization that bursts into your head---she is jealous, and considers you competition for Legolas' affections. With an effort, she pastes on a smile and glances back at Legolas. \"So,\" she purrs, \"who is this... Fellowship?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss a look at Legolas, hoping that he knows enough not to relay all of your information: why you are here, who the Fellowship really is, etc. </span></div></div>",

You are pleased to see a bit of fear in her eyes. You know she won't underestimate you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you continue on in silence. You won't admit it, but this part of the Forest is kind of creeping you out. It's dark and wet, and things in the shadows move. Mexle keeps walking on, her shoulders straight and her chin lifted. 'No way this girl is braver than me', you mutter, so you force yourself to walk on. Soon you find yourselves walking through what seems to be a tunnel of branches woven tightly together. Mexle stops in front of a branch. \"We are here,\" she says shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" you and Legolas ask at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Mexle replies, exasperated. She grabs the branch in her hand and begins to snap it. Then she stops. \"You may only enter if you are a Dennali, or someone to whom a Dennali owes a debt. I'm sorry, I have just remembered this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So...Daeloth can't go in?\" Legolas shoots you a startled look. Mexle merely shrugs, but you catch a glimpse of triumph in her eyes.

Your neck aches considerably, and your lungs draw the thick, sickly air here, weakly.  You hear the sound of your own lungs rasping in high pitched whistles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember a woods...rocks tumbling violently...orcs storming...feeling faint...talking to Aragorn...the sight of a terrible dark wizard.   Your chest pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear sweeps over you, but eventually your racing heart slows to psychologically manageable thuds.  This is no time to panic, you try to champion yourself.  \"I am in some sort of danger...must find a way to get out of here,\" you command to yourself silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grope around, still lying flat, noticing you are on a bed of roughly hewn planks.  The bed of planks are attached by rusty chains, angularly upward, to a cold, moist wall of stone your hand finds off to your left. With labor you lift your head a bit, enough to look longways in the direction of your feet and you note the flickering, dancing glow of light through a square and barred window.  Where the torch is.  Must be the door.  Hallway out there.  \"But to where does it go?\" you ask yourself in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears well in your eyes as you rest your aching head back down.  No pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you say to yourself in serious self-pity.  \"What is to become of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly another minute goes by when you notice you are very, very hungry, and wonder how long you have been here.  Hours?  Days?  You simply do not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort, you sit yourself upright on the bed, legs dangling over.  Just barely do they touch a stone floor in the darkness beneath you.   You stand and immediately feel faint.  Yes, you were hurt badly by the orcs and who knows what else befell you after you passed out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you manage to move yourself with small careful steps around the room, hands outreached.  You find there is nothing but that stiff plank bed in here.   You choose the corner furthest from your bed and relieve yourself there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back over to your bed, standing there next to it after you bump into its edges, when you notice how dry your throat is.  You are dehydrated.  Cupping your forehead, you feel hot...feverish.   Dizzy you are....the square barred window moving of its own accord...there, and back here again.  Terrible dizziness.   The world is spinning.   Hangovers are far, far better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no choice but to lie back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungry, hurting, dry, weak, cold, feverish, worrying...you want to forget your miserable situation.  You close your eyes and want to force yourself to forget.  And to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one hour, with tears rolling off the sides of your face and sometimes behind your ears, you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It is almost with a sense of relief that you are jolted out of your sleep, escaping the suffocating evil that haunted you. But as you blink to clear your eyes of tears and grogginess, you realize that it would almost be better to face the things you had just woken up from. At least they were just a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark wizard is there, bigger than life, right in your tiny cell. His eyes pierce through you, and you feel as if they are stripping you apart and seeing what lies within---your secrets, thoughts, hopes and dreams. You begin to feel sick, and you try to focus on something else. For the first time, you notice that the wizard isn't alone. Three huge Orcs have escorted him, and they are all snarling at you as if they would love to see you suffer. No, focusing on them isn't helping. So you throw your glance desperately around the room, trying to catch hold of something else that will save you from the scrutinizing eyes of the wizard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see him. There, just outside the open door of the cell, huddles a male Human, looking as broken as anyone can be. His back is bent like an old man's and his hair hangs in sweaty tendrils over his face. His hands are clenched inside his restraning irons, as if he still holds on to a slim thread of defiance. He coughs, a long, bone-rattling hack, and it makes you want to clasp your hands over your ears to block out the heart-wrenching sound. His face is still obscured, but you have no wish to see what is under his veil of hair. You imagine a brittle, wrinkle-lined face, with sunken eyes that have been through too much suffering in this lifetime. Probably some poor farmer, out of whom they tried to get information, you think sadly. You have seen many people put through torture and died from it---or worse, they lived, forever cursed with their marks of unimagineable pain and trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daeloth,\" hisses a voice. The wizard. \"Yes, I know your name, and I know it of all the Fellowship. Nothing escapes me. Nothing will, not even a pitiful excuse for a king,\" he continues in that awful sound that makes you think of fingernails scratching a stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing? you wonder. There's a connection here, but your feverish brain can't put it together. Nothing seems to matter except the surprisingly young-looking face of the dark wizard. His eyes, though, are centuries old and are restrained by forces of evil too strong for you to comprehend. \"You do not know who I am,\" he remarks, with a hint of displeasure in his voice. You dare to shake your head no. \"Soon everyone will,\" he screeches with an air of almost-dementia. \"I am Schimquyth, the greatest wizard that was, is, and ever will be, in the history of Middle Earth!\" </span></div></div>",

Finally, the wizard turns to look at you. \"I suppose you're wondering how you came to be here,\" he remarks casually, once again calm and in control. You shrug, matching his don't-care attitude. You have decided that there will be no more cowardice...on the outside, anyways. I will not break in his eyes, you tell yourself resolutely; even while you are trembling inside. But to Schimquyth, you are the picture of stubborn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, little warrior, you have courage. But there is no need for bravado here. I shall give a narration of what befell you and your precious Fellowship, and then we will see how you act then.\" He clears his throat and, in spite of yourself, you lean forward expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had planned on your destruction. I had no use for you, and you were merely an annoyance. So I told my Orc leader to dispose of you. Unfortunately, that pesky king of yours\u2014Aralagona, right?\u2014insisted on barging through and saving you. Hm, I suppose chivalry isn't dead after all.\" Schimquyth pauses for a nasty chuckle at his own stupid joke. Over in the corner, the human shifts from side to side, and you wonder if he is listening as intently as you are. Schimquyth continues: \"After he had taken care of the Orcleader, King Ariagorna---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Aragorn!\" you burst out. \"His name is Aragorn, and I will not have you mocking our king.\" The beaten man jerks and starts to look up at you, but the guard Orcs backhand him against the wall. You decide that he did not know that you were in the company of the King and was surprised by this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhhggghhh!\" You let out an involuntary scream of shocked pain as a bolt of electricity jolts through your entire body, scrambling your thoughts and causing your limbs to go weak. After your head stops ringing and your vision clears, you see Schimquyth standing over you, his staff crackling with blue lightning. He bends down so his eyes are level with yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you keep your opinions to yourself,\" he whispers menacingly. \u201cNow! Where was I? Ah, yes\u2026 After the king took care of the Orcleader, he helped you up, blah blah blah. Then you fainted while trying to walk. Ha! The fragility of women is rivaled only by the flowers that grow by the riverbank,\u201d he remarks. You clench your fists but, remembering the blast of lightning, remain silent. \u201cThe king tried to carry you over to the rest of the Fellowship. I saw you, though, and got tired of the wizard I was fighting. Quite a frail old thing, he is. So I slipped past his defenses and froze his limbs and body, rendering him helpless. Then I told the Orcs to pick you and your king up, and escort you back here. Along with the rest of the Fellowship, of course,\u201d Schimquyth adds, looking shrewdly at you. \u201cLet\u2019s see, there were the two hobbits---Frodo and Sam, correct?---along with, erm\u2026help me out, dear warrior, I can\u2019t remember. There was also a very annoying elf. What was his name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLe---\u201d you start to blurt out. But an outburst startles you into silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who had, so far, been hunched over in the cell suddenly comes to life. \u201cNo!\u201d he shouts, making an attempt to stand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him anything, Daeloth.\u201d You gasp as you realize that the voice is familiar. He grasps the walls and struggles to his feet, showing his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord\u2026Aragorn?!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as a glowing red ball of light shoots out of the staff is when you knock into him, jarring his aim. The ball of light gets moved off-course and instead of hitting Aragorn, it flies into one of the Orc guards. He takes a few stutter-steps back and falls flat on his back. Everything seems frozen for a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he starts to scream---a horrible sound that pierces through your mind and speaks of terrible things seen. The infected Orc rolls on the ground, still screaming and now babbling incoherent sentences and sounds. \"Aragorn...\" you mutter, shocked. That could have been him. He looks at you and then at the amazed wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mistake,\" wheezes Schimquyth. He is incredibly furious. \"You have made a terrible mistake.

You shrug and follow---what other option do you have? So you are right on Aragorn's tail as he rushes towards the guards. The speed, momentum and determination of you two combined with the surprise of the attack is enough to propel back the pair of Orcs, and you both stumble out into the hallway. The stone pathway stretches out before you, leading to freedom!...that is, if you can escape the now-enraged Orcs. But why bother with minor details?

Will you let yourself be taken over by Schimquyth and eventually kill her yourself?\" You have gotten Aragorn's attention now. He had pulled in a sharp breath at the mention of Arwen's name, and now he lets it out. \"And...and what of me?\" you ask, so softly you wonder if you had actually spoken it aloud. \"I am forfeiting my life to help you, my lord. My friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn bows his head, then reaches down and offers you a hand. \"We are equals, Daeloth,\" he tells you. \"Do not bow to me. For surely you have saved my life and the lives of others just now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will all be for naught if we don't leave now,\" you tell him in a shaky voice. Your emotions were punched down while you were speaking, because you had to believe that Aragorn would listen to you. But now you realize that it was possible that he might have turned you away. You swallow...best not to dwell on those thoughts now. Best to dwell on those Orcs that are just a few yards away. \"Come on!\" you shout. Aragorn takes a breath, nods, and begins to run down the hallway with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchimquyth's laughter is cut short as he realizes that his two captives are getting away. The Orcs were ready for an easy victory, so they are also surprised, and they stop for a few seconds in shock. \"Don't stop, you idiots!\" curses Schimquyth. \"I will have to do this myself,\" he says to himself. He raises his staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn notices. \"Look out!\" he warns. \"We have to get out of his line of fire!\" Just ahead, the hallway branches off. Now there are three paths: one going straight, one to the left and one to the right. The straight one is not an option, as Schimquyth would still be able to see you. It's either the left or the right. Which do you choose?</span></div></div>",

Now the only sounds are your ragged breathing and the thump of your feet on the stones. This tunnel is dark and insufficiently lit, and you can barely see where you're headed. Behind you, an Orc horn begins to blow, no doubt calling for help from his comrades. The sound only serves to double your speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you choose this way?\" asks Aragorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you return. Aragorn nods in acceptance. Then you both lapse into silence for a while, all your thoughts concentrated on getting out of here. You sneak a glance at Aragorn and note that he is, once again, slowing down. He needs a break. Without stopping, you twist your head around and check behind you. There are no Orcs to be seen, and that gives you a bad feeling. Could it somehow be a trap? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daeloth,\" Aragorn pants. \"Daeloth. I have to rest.\" He slows and then stops, out of breath. He shakes his head in disgust. \"There was a time that I could continue on like this for hours and not feel tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, during that time, you were not beaten and wounded, am I correct?\" Despite your light tone, you are anxious to get going again.

You are invincible, smashing through their weapons and defenses with the slightest of ease. Legolas is there too---why, you have no idea. Certainly he is just a friend. Worth dreaming about, but just a friend...right? In the dream you can see his sparkling eyes, hear his laugh as he effortlessly cuts down another Orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daeloth! Get up.\" That stupid voice! It won't go away. It's cutting through your dreams like a hot knife, and you feel yourself beginning to rise to conciousness. No, no, you plead silently; just leave me. \"DAELOTH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fly open. \"What? Where?\" you sputter, reaching for your twin blades. But they're not there. Neither are your daggers. Oh, right, you're in a dungeon. Of course they would take your weapons. But then, who was speaking to you? \"I'm going crazy,\" you mutter. \"Absolutely, finally, crazy.\" Because when you think about it, that voice sounded just like Gandalf the White's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low laugh floats through the cell. \"It is I, Daeloth. Look up.\" You wrinkle your eyebrows, but obey---what other choice do you have? When your eyes settle on the figure, you let out a disbelieving snort. It really is him! So was the dungeon just a dream? Quickly you glance around. No, you're still in your cell, with the door barred securely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gandalf, how?\" you ask simply. Another figure joins the first. \"Aragorn!\" you exclaim softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have not much time.\" Your king speaks softly and swiftly. \"We are not really here. This is simply a spell Gandalf has conjured up: it will not last much longer. Listen well. You were captured and brought here. The dark wizard's name is Tolxumith; this is all we know about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you blurt out. \"Was I the only one captured on the battlefield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Gandalf answers. </span></div></div>",

For now, anyway. \"...but it cannot be good,\" the White Wizard finishes. \"You mush find Legolas and get out in all haste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaannnndd...\" you motion for them to continue. They stare back at you. Finally you give up on them figuring it out on their own. \"The door. The door needs to be op-en before I can get out,\" you remind them, as if you would a small child. Amazing, how you can be deep underground trapped in a dungeon that's located who-knows-where and still be sarcastic. It's a dark gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Daeloth,\" Gandalf tells you. \"Hold on just a moment...\" He closes his eyes in concentration---and disappears. At the exact same moment, though, the door flies open. You guess that he could not keep up two major spells at once, but you still feel a little forgotten. Oh well. As long as the door is open and you can get out of here, then you're fine. Cautiously, you slide off the bed and creep towards the doorway. You examine the door and notice that the lock is shattered. Good---this means that you can close the door and still get out of here. As quietly as you can, you ease out the doorway and into the hall beyond. A few torches attempt to pierce the gloom but most of the hallways are still immersed in shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear something. It sounds like footsteps. Your heart leaps---did Gandalf and Aragorn visit Legolas as well?---but it crashes down when you realize that these footsteps are much too heavy and loud to be those of an elf's, especially an escaped elf. Your other options are the Dark Wizard (Tolxumith) or some Orc guards. Neither one is promising, but if you have a choice you will take the Orcs. Even Urrak-hai would be better than a wizard. You experienced firsthand the powers of a dark wizard, and you're not anxious to do it again. Orcs you can fight and you might have a chance of winning, but Tolxumith...no way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. Fight Orcs with what? You are weaponless. Cursing your terrible luck, you sneak back into the cell and ease the door shut. \"Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking,\" you silently urge the footsteps. They're closer now, and you surmise that they are indeed Orcs: three or four of them, judging by the sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quietly, you edge back to your bed. How are you going to get out of this one? You have no weapons or anything to fight with. But to your great surprise, as you sit on the cot, you hear the gentle clink of metal on metal from your back. Your twin blades! Somehow, you've gotten them back. Gandalf...of course. He would have known that sending you, weaponless, out to face a dark wizard and Orc guards wouldn't have been smart. So he's given you your swords back! And---you feel around your belt. Yes, and your daggers, as well. Confidently, you stand, ready to face down the Orcs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaks open, and the first of the guards step in. \"Where are you...\" he calls nastily. \"Come on, I promise not ta hurt you.

He roars a command to the other two Orcs, and now you have three to go against! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter,\" you grunt to yourself, sidestepping to avoid a blow. It's just a little more time out of your day. You've got plenty to spare. Besides, you tell yourself, look at it as training. With, you know, real Orcs. You crouch on the ground as an Orc weapon swings over your head, then you explode upwards, catching that particular Orc off-guard. You deal him a glancing blow, meant to wound not kill, and he roars in anger. Quickly you block his weapon with one of your own, and with your other sword in hand, you drive your blade home. He slumps to the ground, life draining out of his cruel eyes. One down, two to go. <br>\r\nThe remaining Orcs begin to close in on you, and you realize that fighting in the cell is to your disadvantage.

You just make it before one Orc takes a murderous swing at where you were standing a second ago. Out in the hallway, you realize that it isn't much wider than the cell.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nearly a month passed before our party, commissioned by my great grand uncle Lord Elrond himself, arrived at the base of the rocky peaks that lay above Moria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived in greater number than when we left Rivendell.  En route and roughly a fortnight ago we had encountered a fleeing band of nine dwarves.  They were remnants of a massive orc attack on a dwarven military enclave originally numbering about two hundred.   The enclave's destination and plan had been the same as ours.  Enter Moria and rid its glorious halls of filth.  They had not known of Lord Elrond's recent council in Rivendell.  They were pleased to hear of Elrond's plans, more proof of the renewed alliance between Middle Earth's dwarves and elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dwarves met with tragedy in a mountain pass.   The enclave walked right into a valley being monitored by scouts from the the right flank of a horde of nearly two thousand orcs and hobgoblins.  Forthwith an assaulting wave of the orcs and hobgoblins swept down into the valley.  About an hour of carnage ensued in this entrapment.  With total massacre in plain view, and with all hope nearly lost, the surviving nine's leader, Sergeant Dremurth Grammett, ingeniously thought up a plan to lure scores of blood hungry orcs through a narrow ravine passage, above which well-posted sentries would hurl rocks down onto the pursuing enemy.  This hastily concocted strategy of withdrawal whilst counter-attacking worked to a point.  Sadly, just Dremurth himself and eight others escaped out the other end of the ravine passage.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What became of the rest of my dwarven comrades, I do not know\", sighed Dremurth. \"As for us, we were mighty lucky to have survived that ghastly melee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, but we took down a baker's dozen to maybe twenty or more, each of us, didn't we, Sarge?\", bellowed Axel Gravestone, pounding his double-bladed war axe to his broad chest, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDremurth interjects, \"That we did, that we did, Axel.  But, just remember you juvenile twit, I split the skull of that one just about to impale you from your hind.  And for that, I have this bloody scratch from the one who was flitting his cheap, skinny blade on my left.\"  Dremurth splays a nasty looking cut on his left forearm.  \"The ratbreath who did this to me breathes no more.  I dealt with him soon after I halved your foe, Axel.  I removed his puny bug-eyed head, I did.  Arghh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine broke out in laughter.  Soon enough, they were befriended by the commissioned party, always in need of a few more allies.  Together, they now numbered sixty-three.  Twenty-five dwarves, eighteen humans, fourteen elves, five hobbits and one wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of our commission was my father, Ongleth Buck.  Without delay he had appointed our new arrivee Dremurth Grammett as navigator, owing to the dwarf's knowledge of Moria and its surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll had known the way into Moria that the Fellowship of the Ring had chosen was blocked, due to that scuffle with the tentacled swamp monster.  Neither, too, could the Fellowship's way out be used for re-entry, as the bridge to the interior there had been destroyed by the Balroc.  Originally Ongleth planned on entering via the Grimmstone Neck, an exceedingly high up entry requiring first a rather arduous climb to a snowcap, then a twelve hundred foot repel into a circular, thirty yards wide ice-lined opening, till the floor of an interior shelf could be landed upon.  In fact, much of the gear they had brought from Rivendell had to do with the initial, mountainous climb (snowshoes, pick axes and such), the repel (lots of rope), and the weather (sufficient skins to stay warm).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a new plan of entering Moria would soon unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second night traveling with the band of nine, still many days from Moria, Ongleth had held a meeting with Dremurth Grammett, myself, two of the elder humans, Arthur Traxler and Gregson Bidwell, and the female elven seer, Anthiala Ensali.  Anthiala was known for her intellect and alluring beauty, but most of all, extreme hatred of all things evil.  There were six of us in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo predicate the meeting, father had an assistant, a hobbit by the name of Gabber Dantwiddly, prepare us a fine dinner of greens, wine, bread, cheese and freshly caught rainbow trout from the river that snaked through the valley far below our encampment, which was perched high on a bluff, safe from surprise attacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur meeting place was in a soft clearing beneath a great two hundred foot pine, a stone's throw from the edge of the bluff.  The view from here was nothing less than spectacular.  From this vantage point it was hard to imagine trouble was again stirring in Middle Earth.  The sun was still shining from the west as we sat down to dinner.  There was maybe one more hour of light before it would set.  Taking in this gorgeous view of nature I thought back to just weeks earlier, when I along with my elfin brethren were convinced, owing to the destruction of Sauron, that our elfin tenure in this, the Blessed Land of Middle Earth, was complete, and that, at last, we would soon set sail for the timeless shores of Sacred Valinor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the six waited for Gabber's trays of bounty, I played my mandola and concocted on the spot a tribute song to the group at hand, the idea being to lighten things up a bit and prepare us mentally for what was to be an important meeting, and change in plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     The Great Pine Meeting<br>\r\n                               <br>\r\n                  by Darrius Buck, mandolaist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Oh Father Buck, why do you call us here?<br>\r\n             We sit here, your point still unclear<br>\r\n               We think it must be important<br>\r\n                  Yet we sit, waiting, hungry, nigh on insolent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Among us is Dremurth, sergeant to nine<br>\r\n            Full of brandy, time out of mind<br>\r\n               A belly not yet full, he grumbles<br>\r\n                  A fish not yet consumed, more he grumbles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Among us is Arthur, eldest man, master in sword<br>\r\n            There he swings it, getting a bit bored<br>\r\n               What will he say when your meeting starts?<br>\r\n                  Glad the assistant didn't bring beans in his carts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Among us is Gregson, sneakiest that walks on two<br>\r\n            Cannot wait to grab something to chew<br>\r\n                Hand him a warhammer to swing<br>\r\n                    And that would be the last I ever sing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Among us is Anthiala, fairest and wisest<br>\r\n            If we eat too much she will despise us<br>\r\n               And we wouldn't want that, and that we wouldn't want<br>\r\n                  To become the gamely game that she would hunt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Last of all, me, your mandola player<br>\r\n           Singing and strumming layer upon layer<br>\r\n                If the food comes not in a minute here<br>\r\n                   Father Buck, you will have offspring to fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they all, at least the males, laughed and exchanged several jokes upon me, not leaving out the quips that I was skinny as a rail (heard that one before) and had ears large enough such that, if bent sideways, I could fly.  When I had sung the verse to Anthiala she had feigned a cutesy smirk at me.  Now with the ridicule being shoveled upon me by the others, particulary by Dremurth, all she could do was giggle and enjoy my gauntlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food soon came, and we all ate heartily.  Grabber went back for more.  Twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the meeting took place and wound on enough to where Gabber had to light a fire for us as the last of the sun's rays had been cut off by the distant hills to the west. We finished about an hour after dark.   Much was talked about concerning the welfare of the commission, supplies and food rationing, dissemination of various duties, plans for what to do inside Moria, and so on, but the main point of Father calling us together was to announce a new plan of entry into Moria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier that day my father, Ongleth had talked alone with Dremurth, who had advised an alternative passage into Moria about which only dwarves had ever known.  Its location had always been held in secrecy, although Dremurth felt warranted to reveal it given the dire situation of Middle Earth.  The revelation had pleased Ongleth who, for most of his life, did not trust dwarves.  Given the brave stories of Gimmley from the Fellowship and other dwarves dedicating their lives to the destruction of Sauron and safety and prosperity of Middle Earth, he had shed his bias.  He saw in Dremurth and Axel, and many other dwarves, great warriors, of the kind he and elfinkind could now not do without.  Indeed, he realized that the majority of the group which he now led, were dwarves.  Furthermore, some of the burdensome equipment, which the commission had lugged all the way from Rivendell, could be parted with.  As much as Dremurth drank, joked, and slurred his speech on occasion, Ongleth trusted Dremurth's guidance as the commission's navigator.  In his eyes he saw wisdom, sincerity and steadfastness.  He knew Dremurth would never give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new entry chosen was known as the Jagged Rock of Kwalthorn.   It did not require a climb as the Grimmstone Neck would have.  More or less, Kwalthorn was a hidden cavernous orifice that lay behind and under a large jagged rock that lay on a mountainside, only miles from the infamous door where Frodo had uttered the word \"friend\" in elvish.  Entry required a narrow, hands and knees crawl under the jagged rock first, for about one hundred feet in length, before it opened up enough to see, with lit torch, an opening into the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three miles before the commission had approached the Jagged Rock of Kwalthorn, they left their horses and now excessive mountain climbing supplies, skins and other large items that could not make it through the crawl, with three of the humans, who were given orders to care for the horses and guard the supplies in a well chosen hideout.   It was a niche between two smaller mountains, water near, with trees for cover from around and above.  They would be safe there thought Ongleth.   Dremurth seconded.    They were to wait till either the commission itself or ally with message from the commission returned, or one month's time, after which they could abandon the horses and stores and choose to go wherever they felt, except Moria, for if the commission did not return, that would mean disaster inside.    Anthiala agreed, and blessed the three as the commission separated from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore sunset, the commission, now numbering sixty, had reached the secret Jagged Rock of Kwalthorn, and within twenty minutes the last member had executed the initial crawl.  All were inside.  At last they were inside the Mines of Moria. <br>\r\n             <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You see your great uncle watching you with some interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You imagine they very special?\" he pauses.  \"They are.  The most special that I ahve even known . . . .but they too were once as you.

He calls back over his shoulder.  \"You're likin to get us killed, but we're takin ya, so try to keep up.\"  The moment is then broken by a few chuckles as the gathering begin to disburse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElrond pats you on the shoulder.  \"I know you will do well.  Look to Legolas and Aragorn if you have questions, . . and don't be offended by Gimili.  He has developed quite a soft spot for us elves.  I'd even heard he is smitten with Lady Galadriel.\"  Elrond gives you a hug.  \"Go get your stuff and then see Aragorn.

Elrond had walked out of the room a few minutes ago, allowing everyone to be swept in the thoughts of what decision they will make here today. You think about your past, and how close Sauron had come to gaining complete authority over Middle Earth. You realize that if you do not help, this undefined evil could threaten all that is good, like Sauron had, but this evil unfighted could win. You had already made your mind up, now you just had to wait and see what Elrond was going to say. The room was filled with silence as Elrond walked back in and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All of you who have already cowered down and decided not to help the fate of Middle Earth, please leave now, for I don't have the heart to speak nor see you.\" Elrond ordered.

You were surprised, yet pleased to see that everyone was willing to help. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had no doubt that many of you would help, but this many is beyond belief. Certainly this is a miracle.\" Elrond continued, \"We have little or worthless knowledge of what excatly this undefined evil is hoping to achieve. It will take more than brute strength, fighting skills, and clever maneuvering with a sword, bow, and an axe to win against this evil creature, although these will help. The only thing we can use now is our minds. We must figure out more before we make our first attack. All of you will travel in groups, you will go to distant lands to uncover more information. And from there, we will get back in touch when we think we've all had enough information revealed to us. Then our strategy for attack will commence. Form groups of nine now. Only one group already has been decided, the Fellowship of The Ring will travel together, as they once did many years ago. Boromir is no longer with us, so one of you will travel in his place. May his legacy help you travel faster and stronger. Also, I advise you all to bring weapons with you, for we do not know where this evil creature and his followers lurk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div></span></div><script>\n                var x;\n              function numberWithCommas(x) {\n                return x.toString().replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \",\");\n               }\n               var whichChapter;\n            function confirmTip (whichChapter) {\n                var tipAmt = Number($('#gp_tip_' + whichChapter).val().trim().replace(',', ''))\n                var myHtml =\n                    'You are sending <b>' + numberWithCommas(tipAmt) + ' Gift Points</b> to: ';\n                $('#confirmTipButton_' + whichChapter).show();\n\n                if (tipAmt < 100) {\n                    myHtml = \"The minimum amount you can tip is 100 Gift Points.

We were in hopes that you would, so were our hopes in vain, or do you know something about this new threat?\" Gandalf asked.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I feel we should speak alone, for your old companions, plus the new one, look tired. Let them be shown to their rooms, where they can sleep peacefully for the night. After they are in their rooms, you, Celeborn and I shall talk.\" She said to Gandalf. He nodded, and you and the fellowship were then escorted to where you would sleep for the night. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once everyone was settled to relax for the night, Gandalf left to speak with Galadriel and Celeborn. Merry and Pippin were joking around, Sam was watching and listening to the singing Lothlorien elves in awe, Gimli was already sleeping, and Aragorn and Legolas were talking. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt a little out of place once more, untill you felt a little hand rest upon your shoulder. You turned around to find that it was Frodo. He smiled at you before taking your hand and leading you away. You tried to keep up with Frodo's pace, and you wondered where he was taking you. Was it safe for the two of you to just wander where you pleased? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Frodo, where are you taking me?\" You asked, \"Aren't we supposed to stay back with the others?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've noticed that you've been feeling left out. So I wanted to show you something, something that would be between just the two of us, somthing none of the others know about.\" He answered. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two of you finally stopped, Frodo showed you what looked like a large, silver, empty saucer. You raised your eyebrows at him in wonder. Frodo picked up a silver pitcher and began pouring water into the saucer. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Frodo, sorry if I'm slow, but what is the point of this?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"When we first came here, Galadriel brought me here. She poured water into this saucer, and told me to look into it. This is the Mirror of Galadriel. Only she and I know what I saw, but none of the others even know about this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I look into it, what will I see?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Even the wisest cannot tell, for the mirror shows things that are, things that were, and things that have not yet come to pass. That is what Galadriel said to me when I asked that very same question. So are you going to look into it?\" Frodo asked you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know. Do I really want to see what it has to show me?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wish I could help you decide, but it's up to you, and only you,\" Frodo said.     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were frantic, as if they had lost something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn's face grew serious. He looked off into the distance. \"Two human men. It almost sounds like...\" He stops abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aragorn?\" You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember anything else about them? The type of dress they were wearing, their colors? <br>\r\nWere they carrying weapons? Bows, daggers, swords?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think. But the memory slips away as if someone wishes you to forget. Or not to impart your information. \"I'm drawing a...blank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Aragorn asks worriedly. \"Landeis?\" He repeats as you sway forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are going dark. You fight to keep concious, knowing you must warn him. Before you fall, you whisper, \"Legolas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas!\" Aragorn shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he is at your side. \"Landeis, what ails thee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you are no longer capable of speech. Your only hope is that he will be able to sense your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanger. Danger! We're not safe here. It knows we're coming.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You become aware of <i>his</i> voice first and allow it to draw you upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Landeis? Do you hear me?</i> A pause. <i>I can feel you awakening. Your mind is coming alive with music. Music and such beauty. You are truly beautiful, body and soul. That is a rare quality to find, even in elven women. It pains me to admit that we elves have fallen prey to some of the human world's vice. But you, you dear Landeis, give me hope that the elven people will not succumb. That even in the human world there is virtue and beauty.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to the melodious beauty of his voice and feel a part of you that has been long hidden arising. You see him in your mind's eye, tall and strong with a noble stature and a honorable heart. He brings to mind no memories of the one who broke your heart. His name spills from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas?\" You open your eyes and see him gently smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last. The beauty has awakened.\" In a rare unguarded moment, Legolas meets your gaze and you realize with a jolt that Legolas cares for you as deeply as you care for him. You begin to smile and you open your mouth to speak, when Gandalf's voice sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legolas? Has she awakened yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolas' eyes blank and you can see the impenetrable wall quickly go back up. He calls over his shoulder, \"Yes she has.\" He glances at you as the door to the tent is pulled back and you know your expression matches his. Quickly you whisper that there is something you must tell him and he nods. You understand that you will talk later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Gandalf.\" You greet the wizard with a deferential bow of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense.\" He gawfs. \"There is no need for such formality here. Tell me lady, what befell you? All any of us know is that Legolas thought you were warning us to leave Lothlorien and we left in a very big hurry. I was not even able to finish my conversation with Celeborn and Galadriel. You've been out of it for a better part of the morning. Naturally we're all very curious. Especially Pippin and Merry. They do so dislike their meal schedules being interrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense that beneath the twinkling eyes and jovial manner, there is a very keen curiosity. \"If you will allow me to dress, I will address the Fellowship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo's voice pipes up from somewhere outside the tent. \"Remember you are a part of OUR fellowship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be sure to remember.\" You assure him, exchanging smiles with Gandalf and Legolas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men exit the tent and you prepare to dress in your traveling clothes. You are shocked and a bit dismayed to discover that the only clothes the men thought to bring with are dresses, and formal dresses at that. You know that there is no way you can ride a horse or walk and hike in such finery. You are about to call out when you spot a piece of green fabric poking out from beneath your make-shift bed. You gently pull on it and out slips a beautiful dress done in the colors of the wood. It is loose and light, which will make it easy to maneuver in. You find sturdy walking boots to go along with it. As you slip the dress over your head you hear the soft crinkle of parchment paper and after looking, find a hidden pocket. Inside is a note that reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>I felt that you would find this more comfortable and fitting to wear than the dresses that the men found for you. It is made of the same material as our cloaks and will help you to blend in. Frodo and Aragorn carry the rest of my gifts to you. Fight bravely dear sister. Our future rests in your hands.<br>\r\n~Galadriel</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straighten your shoulders and gladly accept the burden Galadriel has placed upon them. You finish lacing up your boots and exit the tent. Going outside, a vision greets your eye. The Fellowship has traveled far in the night, spurred on by Legolas's worry and your warning. You stand at the edge of a gigantic lake, the likes of which you have never seen before. Pippin clears his throat impatiently and you turn to your group mates with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you are all wondering what has brought you so far from Lothlorien so quickly. Last night, as I was telling Aragorn of a vision I had had, a strange sensation gripped me. It seemed that my memory was failing me and the more I struggled to reclaim it, the further it slid from my grasp. As you know, we elves are known for our long and excellent memories. It did not make sense to me. I fought so long and the force fighting me was so strong that I began to lose consciousness. The effort it required to make me submit was so great that the force had to allow me entry into it's mind. As it did, I realized that the force knew of us, knew of our mission and even knew of our arrival in Lothlorien. I sensed that it was sending something after us, some enormous evil that would gravely endanger all of Lothlorien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Pippin interrupts. \"So you're telling me, that we left them...so that this thing can come kill us?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerry throws his hands up in the air. \"Great. Just great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all knew there would be danger in helping protect Middle Earth once again.\" Sam answers stoutly. \"No use complainin' about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've had contact with the threat.\" Gandalf murmurs. He looks at you appraisingly. \"Do you think you could give us any more information about him...her...it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more than I have told you already. To come in contact with a mind that corrupt...\" You trail off and meet Gandalf's gaze unflinchingly. \"You can not understand, Sir Gandalf, what a horror that is for one such as I. To be inside the mind of a thing that is wholly and completely evil especially when that thing is also manipulative is extremely dangerous for a elf. I could have turned without the slightest hesitation if I had been in more intimate contact with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Intimate</i> contact?\" Gandalf queries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The meeting of the minds is an intimate affair Gandalf, especially for the elves. You know that.\" Legolas says, his expression one of subtle disbelief. \"Why do you press her so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGandalf abruptly breaks eye contact with you. \"No reason. No reason.\" He mumbles as he turns away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why.\" You state softly. The others turn to you in surprise, Aragorn and Legolas with resignation. \"You wish to use me, do you not Sir Gandalf? As bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPipin, Merry and Sam look from you to Gandalf with confused expressions on their faces. They do not understand why you, who have been so kind to them are being so hostile towards Gandalf, who is their friend. Frodo's eyes are heavy with understanding. He, at least, understands that Gandalf wishes to use you in much the same way he himself was used. Gimli, on watch, is too far away to understand what is being said. Aragorn and Legolas send a silent message and Legolas moves toward you while Aragorn moves toward Gandolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come old friend.\" Aragorn murmurs to Gandalf. \"Let us go and talk of what Celeborn and Galadriel had to say.\" He pulls Gandalf toward the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolas comes to your side and whispers softly in Elven, \"Come dear heart. We have much to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn toward him, it seems that Gandalf is possessed by some evil spirit. He breaks free of Aragorn and runs toward you. He shouts at you, \"You haven't seen it! You know not of what it is capable! It will kill us all if we can't stop it!! YOU KNOW NOT!\" He roars as he flies at you swinging his staff in a wide arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck and side-step in the same motion, your reflexes taking over. The hobbits shout in horror and Gimli comes rushing through the trees, brandishing his axe, certain the group is under attack. Legolas and Aragorn are both running toward Gandalf when everything seems to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see again the vision that the Mirror revealed to you, but this time the girl reaches her arms out to you and cries the word, \"Mama.\" You hear a heinous chuckle and your world fades to black as your daughter is tore from your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to Aragorn's concerned face. \"Landeis how do you feel?\" He asks as he helps you sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I was hit with something.\" You groan, lightly rubbing a sore spot on your scull. \"Did Gandalf strike me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn chuckles grimly. \"He managed to get in a lucky swing. Legolas about killed him as you crumpled to the ground. It took all of us to pull him off. The hobbits are watching him now, while Gimli keeps watch over Gandalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly. \"What is happening to us Estel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know not.\" Aragorn's eyes are bleak as he gazes out over the lake. \"Perhaps we are not fated to once again save Middle Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If not us, then who?\"</span></div></div>",

Now Legolas you should make her keep quiet and rest.

As they stared at you, you realized that Legolas was holding your hand. You looked down in time to see his hand jerk away. The shock finally wearing off, Legolas answered, \"We're going to Lothlorien to talk with the Lady of the Light. Now rest,\" he said as he stood up and walked away.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I heard that,\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, Ariana. He just didn't know if he should tell you, but now that you know...do you feel the same way?\" He asked knowing that Legolas's elven ears could hear what they were talking about. \"Don't worry, I won't tell him if you do or don't. That's for you to do. But I would like to know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Biting your bottom lip, you wonder whether you should tell him. You know that you need to tell someone. Cupping your hands around your mouth, you whisper, \"Once he comes back and I tell him, then you can ask me but until he knows, no one else will.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He laughed at your answer and said, \"That's a fair answer, but I want to know after you tell him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the next few days as you recovered and reached the borders of Lothlorien, Legolas seemed to be avoiding you. One night as you were camping near the river, you watched him as he went off by himself again. Tired of him avoiding you, you follow him as quietly as possible. He was sitting on the ground near the river, unaware that you were right behind him. You slowly crept up and sat down next to him. He nearly jumped but somewhat relaxed after noticing that it was you. \"Legolas, why have you been avoiding me?\"<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n\"Is it because of what I heard?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because you obviously don't feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n\"You told Aragorn if you loved me and he laughed.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now why does that mean that I don't? I told him that he'd have to wait to find out, because I need to tell you first,\" you whispered as you looked him in the eye and gently grabbed his hand. \"I never got to thank you for helping me.\"<br>\r\n\"It wasn't any trouble.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\" you whispered. As he was looking at the water you leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. He turned away from you for a moment, then looked back at you with a smile upon his face. You then whisper, \"And just so you know, I feel the same way about you.\"</span></div></div>",

'If I could just get up!' she thought, angry that she was such a hassle at the moment. \"Why can't I get up?\" she asked herself. 'The arrow! It must have been poisoned! If I could just get it out that would help.' Looking at the arrow that was in her shoulder, she noticed something moving in the shadows. It looked like an army. 'What?' <br>\r\n\"I have to warn the others.\" she said as she gripped the arrow tightly and prepared to rip it out. She quickly ripped it out of her shoulder and screamed from the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next hall, the Fellowship heard the scream. \"What was that?\" Pippin asked.<br>\r\n\"It sounded purely evil.\" Merry added.<br>\r\n\"That wasn't evil,\" Aragorn told them killing the last orc in the room. <br>\r\n\"Where's Ariana?\" Legolas asked looking around.<br>\r\n\"How did we lose her? And why was she screaming?\" Aragorn asked. \"Legolas do you know how we lost her? Legolas?\" He turned around just in time to see the elf run through the doors back into the hall they had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I can move. But now to get to the others and warn them.\" she told herself as she stood up. When she looked into the darkness she saw the army. It was slowly moving towards her and the doors that the others had gone through. She put her bow on her back and grabbed her short swords from their sheaths. One of them didn't keep to it's orders and started to attack. She easily killed him and started to run to the doors. She noticed something ahead. 'Who is that?' Realizing who it was she kept running and shouted, \"Run!\"<br>\r\n\"Did anyone else hear someone shout run?\" Merry asked. <br>\r\n\"Here they come, now let's get going!\" Aragorn told them.<br>\r\nAfter a few more small battles, they reached the gates that let them out into the sun. \"Is anyone hurt?\" Gandalf asked.<br>\r\n\"Us hobbits seem to be fine.\" Pippin answered.<br>\r\n\"We seem to be alright,\" Aragorn and Gimli replied.<br>\r\n\"How about you two?\" Gandlaf asked to the elves.<br>\r\n\"I'm not hurt, how about you, Ariana? Ariana?\" Legolas asked just before she collapsed into his arms. \"Ariana?\" he whispered when he saw her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Legolas what happened?\" Gandalf asked walking over.<br>\r\nAragorn hurried down from his scouting position, \"We need to leave! That army is almost to the gates!\"<br>\r\n\"Legolas take her on your horse! Get to Lothlorien! Hurry!\" Gandalf shouted, but realized that the elf had already set off.</span></div></div>",

It will take more than brute strength, fighting skills, and clever maneuvering with a sword, bow, and an axe to win against this evil creature, although these will help. The only thing we can use now is our minds. We must figure out more before we make our first attack. All of you will travel in groups, you will go to distant lands to uncover more information. And from there, we will get back in touch when we think we've all had enough information revealed to us. Then our strategy for attack will commence. Form groups of nine now. Only one group already has been decided, the Fellowship of The Ring will travel together, as they once did many years ago. Boromir is no longer with us, so one of you will travel in his place.

You lay there under the shaded of a oak tree, wondering when your going to die. When all of a sudden, Aragorn comes and picks you up you look at him in the eyes and say \"thank you..... I...I love you\", while gasping for air, and then faint. you are not dead... not yet. Aragorn has faith that you will live, he removes the arrows and lays you to rest a while until wake up. when you finally do wake up, he is sitting by your side, holding your hand, in the middle of the night, when all others are asleep, staring out into the darkness. When you stir he looks at you in amazement, and takes you in his arms and holds you close, he looks at you in the eyes, and realizes the love that he has for you, he kisses you lightly which startles you, for that was not what you were expecting, and then realizing that he is confessing that he has feelings for you, you loosen up and kiss him back. After regaining your strength, Aragorn and yourself walk off, while the others sleep, and talk, you asked him what about Arwen, He said, \"she has left i got word yetereve, i will never see her again, and anyways i love you, which i have finally realized, i shouldn't pushed you away that night of the banquet, i had a lot on my mind and didn't realize what i was doing, i may be wise in mind but at heart, before, i was confused, but now i'm not, you are what my heart longs for, but we cannot let this relationship get in the way of our quest.\" he explained. \"I'm glad our hearts finally understand each other, now i can express myslef\", she said quietly.

You can read all there is to learn about hobbits and within a few years, they can still surprise you. You are one of these special people, and as a hobbit, even though you are vertically challenged, and you have furry feet, there will always be something individual about you. Even though hobbits claim to be laid back people, who never go on any adventures, (they say that they just eat, sleep, and drink), we can all tell that this is not entirely true. Sure, most hobbits prefer to stay home, but there are some hobbits who are extraordinary, such as Samwise the Brave, Merry, Pippin, and of course, Frodo, the ring bearer. You may not ever be put into songs and stories like these four may be, but you know you will have an impact if you choose to help out, right? And you will prove that hobbits are as important to Middle Earth as men, elves, and wizards, won't you? Of course you will, you're a special hobbit! But remember, you must think out all your decisions wisely. Hobbits aren't exactly known for being intelligent, and it will take some time to make sure that what you are doing is for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time definitely calls for defense. An evil is lurking about in Middle Earth once again. Its reign is nowhere near strong, so far, but it is growing. The wicked creature that brings such hate, cruelty, and malice is clever. It is hiding far enough in shadow that its identity has not yet been seen. Yet the remaining orcs and other evil creatures that survived from Sauron's time in power have multiplied, and they have already joined forces with this unknown evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the crowd of various races seat themselves, the rooms goes silent. Elrond's voice fills the open room; you listen attentively, knowing the importance and secrecy of all of his meetings.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a great while since I have called a council of such significance. Not since Sauron's threat to overtake Middle Earth has such an evil come unto these lands. We were fortunate enough to know of Sauron's plan to find the One Ring and we successfully destroyed it. But with this evil, we do not know what its plans are, what it looks like, or even if it has a human form. We call upon the elves, dwarves, wizards, men, and now hobbits,\" Elrond says as he looks over to Frodo,\" as well as any other free people of Middle Earth to defend all that is good. Those who are with us from the Fellowship of The Ring have already vowed to lead this quest, but they cannot do it alone.

You think about your past, and how close Sauron had come to gaining complete authority over Middle Earth. You realize that if you do not help, this undefined evil could threaten all that is good, like Sauron had, but this evil unfighted could win.

Certainly this is a miracle.\" Elrond continued, \"We have little or worthless knowledge of what excatly this undefined evil is hoping to achieve. It will take more than brute strength, fighting skills, and clever maneuvering with a sword, bow, and an axe to win against this evil creature, although these will help. The only thing we can use now is our minds. We must figure out more before we make our first attack. All of you will travel in groups, you will go to distant lands to uncover more information. And from there, we will get back in touch when we think we've all had enough information revealed to us. Then our strategy for attack will commence. Form groups of nine now. Only one group already has been decided, the Fellowship of The Ring will travel together, as they once did many years ago. Boromir is no longer with us, so one of you will travel in his place. May his legacy help you travel faster and stronger. Also, I advise you all to bring weapons with you, for we do not know where this evil creature and his followers lurk.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most dwarves do not get caught up in the matters of others, and are rather selfish. Many were even unwilling to help during the dark times when Sauron was trying to rule all of Middle Earth. As the Fellowship traveled through the Mines of Moria, Gimli was troubled to find that all the dwarves who worked so hard in the mines were killed. Yet as time went by after Sauron was defeated, dwarves from distant lands came back to the mines, to fill it with busy little workers once again.  <br>\r\nElrond has called a council again, and this time you decide to go, for some odd reason you chose not to go with Gimli and the others last time. You feel as though he is only calling this meeting so he can get others to do the work for him, being the lazy elf that he is. You've heard of the friendship that developed between Gimli and Legolas, an elven Prince who was also a part of the Fellowship. An Elf Prince? You think to yourself, great, he must be really lazy too! You admire Gimli very much, but you do not understand how he can befriend such a creature, but you still hope to meet this legendary dwarf when you go to the council. Maybe he will explain to you that elves aren't all that bad? Naahhhhh! You know, though, that if Elrond is calling this meeting because he needs defenders for Middle Earth, then you must help, just like Gimli. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time definitely calls for defense. An evil is lurking about in Middle Earth once again. Its reign is nowhere near strong, so far, but it is growing. The wicked creature that brings such hate, cruelty, and malice is clever. It is hiding far enough in shadow that its identity has not yet been seen. Yet the remaining orcs and other evil creatures that survived from Sauron's time in power have multiplied, and they have already joined forces with this unknown evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the crowd of various races seat themselves, the rooms goes silent. Elrond's voice fills the open room; you listen attentively, knowing the importance and secrecy of all of his meetings.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a great while since I have called a council of such significance. Not since Sauron's threat to overtake Middle Earth has such an evil come unto these lands. We were fortunate enough to know of Sauron's plan to find the One Ring and we successfully destroyed it. But with this evil, we do not know what its plans are, what it looks like, or even if it has a human form. We call upon the elves, dwarves, wizards, men, and now hobbits,\" Elrond says as he looks over to Frodo,\" as well as any other free people of Middle Earth to defend all that is good. Those who are with us from the Fellowship of The Ring have already vowed to lead this quest, but they cannot do it alone.

Golas was a stout elf who carried dual blades and a hunting knife he has had enough experience in battle and can hold his own. While Romulas was a slender elf equipped with a bow and a small knife he has enough bow skill to shoot a bird's eye in the dark if he wanted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the 6 was a hobbit wizard whose name is Sandalf. Sandalf is what you would call a spineless wimp never really did like fighting actually he would be more of a cook he gets this from his Baggins side of the family but in his Heritage there is a little bit of Tookish blood in him just like Bilbo Baggins if he is motivated enough and the time to act is now he can probably just maybe become a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the last of the six was a man but not an ordinary man he was actually a soldier from Rhun. His description was dark he had a helmet over his head and only his eyes shown he was clad in red cloth and had a shield and a spear he only accepted Urgroth with a \"Hmph fine,\" in a cold,dark tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other five accepted too and so your group is ready now all you need now is a place to search Elrond gives you two places to go. </span></div></div>",

There are few as great as you, and even fewer that are greater. One of those few is Saruman the White, who betrayed those who sought his magic and advice, and then there is Gandalf the White, or Mithrandir, as he is often called. You could never be as powerful or as well known as these two wizards, but you want to help Middle Earth and use your powers to defend it alongside one of the greatest wizards of all time. You have heard many things about Gandalf, that he is a trustworthy and strong ally, and that he has surprising faith in those whom others would never give hope. You know that you are a powerful wizard, but when you were told that Elrond summoned your presence at his council, you were both shocked and honored. You wish that you could be of some help and that Gandalf will be there as well, so you can learn from him. You want to improve your skills as a wizard, so you can help Elrond with the defense that he is calling for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time definitely calls for defense. An evil is lurking about in Middle Earth once again. Its reign is nowhere near strong, so far, but it is growing. The wicked creature that brings such hate, cruelty, and malice is clever. It is hiding far enough in shadow that its identity has not yet been seen. Yet the remaining orcs and other evil creatures that survived from Sauron's time in power have multiplied, and they have already joined forces with this unknown evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the crowd of various races seat themselves, the rooms goes silent. Elrond's voice fills the open room; you listen attentively, knowing the importance and secrecy of all of his meetings.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a great while since I have called a council of such significance. Not since Sauron's threat to overtake Middle Earth has such an evil come unto these lands. We were fortunate enough to know of Sauron's plan to find the One Ring and we successfully destroyed it. But with this evil, we do not know what its plans are, what it looks like, or even if it has a human form. We call upon the elves, dwarves, wizards, men, and now hobbits,\" Elrond says as he looks over to Frodo,\" as well as any other free people of Middle Earth to defend all that is good. Those who are with us from the Fellowship of The Ring have already vowed to lead this quest, but they cannot do it alone. We need almost all of you to help, but there are probably few of you who are brave enough to do so, \" He pauses for a moment, with a look of concern on his face, \"I will give you all a few moments to think out your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you must make your first decision.<i> Will you help defend all that is good in Middle Earth?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div></span></div><script>\n                var x;\n              function numberWithCommas(x) {\n                return x.toString().replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \",\");\n               }\n               var whichChapter;\n            function confirmTip (whichChapter) {\n                var tipAmt = Number($('#gp_tip_' + whichChapter).val().trim().replace(',', ''))\n                var myHtml =\n                    'You are sending <b>' + numberWithCommas(tipAmt) + ' Gift Points</b> to: ';\n                $('#confirmTipButton_' + whichChapter).show();\n\n                if (tipAmt < 100) {\n                    myHtml = \"The minimum amount you can tip is 100 Gift Points.

Let me know your element of attack,\" Gandalf says.<br>\r\n\"I... use darkness powers. I know a little light, but like I said, only a little,\" you say, a bit ashamed of being able to use mainly darkness powers in front of a wizard you know would never use such an element.<br>\r\n\"Darkness won't get you very far against orcs, who thrive on it. Perhaps you would like a wand that can enhance your light powers?\" Gandalf says, \"After all, we'll need to be well-equipped before we head out tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",
