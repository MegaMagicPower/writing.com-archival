He'd arranged to meet Gary in the morning, so that they could both go and collect their first Pokemon together. He had had dreams about what his first Pokemon might be, what he'd like - what he'd get, either way it didn't matter to Ash. A Pokemon was a Pokemon, and he'd love it whatever it was. Gary maintained that his choice would be more considered and less brash and needy, but that's Gary all over. Ash knew that his arrogance was just bravado, and that he'd likely be happy with whatever he gets, even if he didn't get a choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too bad that Ash's mum couldn't be there to see him off, but she promised she'd meet him in Vermilion City when he passes through. She's made sure he was packed, that he had money, plenty of food, clean underwear and a mobile phone for calling home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night Ash tossed and turned, unable to sleep as his body was still alive with excitement and anticipation. Fortunately he wasn't meeting Gary at the crack of dawn, with a bit of luck he wouldn't be too efficient and turn up on time, or early even. For all his excitement Ash knew that he needed, and wanted, a good nights sleep, he couldn't see himself arriving to collect his first ever pokemon while half asleep, nor did he want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ash...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash hadn't been able to get to sleep until nearly 5:30 AM, the number of Pokemon related plans he'd made as he'd laid there awake, too excited to sleep, were impressive even by his standards, it was a shame that the tiredness and the eventual sleep had quickly made him forget most of them. Ash awoke many hours later to see Gary's face staring down at him, by the tone of his voice he had been shaking Ash trying to wake him up for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary?.... what time is it.\" Ash groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's five-to-nine Ash, we were suppose to meet at the park at half-eight so cycle over to Grandpa's for 10\" Gary insisted in an unusually impatient manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got plenty of time\" Ash exclaimed, turning over to face away from the window, \"it'll only take us twenty minutes to bike over there\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's stubbornness could be a touch irritating sometimes, but Gary didn't let it bother him, he instead simply tugged at Ash's duvet neatly drawing it back so's only Ash's feet were still covered, Ash who was dressed only in boxers scrambled to pull it back over himself, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ash, it'll take at least half an hour for you to get ready, sooner you start, the sooner we can go\" Gary said, trying to sound reasonable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh who had seemingly drifted back to sleep failed to take any notice, or at least he didn't respond. This time Gary was less tidy, he grabbed the duvet and pulled it off the bed entirely, dropping it to the floor. By the Ash's brief movement followed by a return to an 'apparent' sleeping state it was clear to Gary that Ash was either pretending, or just trying to go back to sleep while simultaneously winning a petty argument with him. Normally Gary wouldn't rise to it, and would find a more subtle way to win the argument, however this wasn't a day that he was prepared to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you another 5 seconds...\" Gary warned, knowing it was pointless. After five seconds he approached Ash who was laying on his side facing the wall, and grabbed him under his arms and set about pulling him off the bed. It was easy enough while Ash's legs still allowed him to be balanced on the bed, when suddenly only his feet remained Gary fell to the floor under Ash's weight. Gary would be lying if he said it didn't hurt somewhat, Ash was a fair bit heavier than he'd remembered. His own fault he guessed for either overestimating his own strength, or underestimating Ash's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hadn't been expecting Gary to do that, he pulled himself up off the smaller boy he'd been awkwardly and unintentionally laying on before giving a hand and helping him up also, \"I'm up now... happy?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ash just in his boxers, it was obvious to Gary how much he'd underestimated Ash's weight. His round chubby stomach wasn't that easy to miss, it protruded slightly over the sides of his boxers, and his belly button appeared quite large and deep. \"No, I'd forgotten how heavy you are!\" carry commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps you're just not as strong as you thought\" Ash retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... perhaps not.\" Gary conceded, \"But doesn't mean you're not heavy!\" Gary remembered how skinny he and Ash were as kids, back when Ash never lacked for energy and didn't know the meaning of the word 'lazy'. When he hit his early teens however Ash got over many of the fussy food habits he'd had a child, and started eating more. Especially junk food and candy, between his 12 and 13th birthdays he went from being really quite thin, as chubby as he is now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What evs\" Ash replied, passing off Gary's comments disbelievingly. </span></div></div>",

Thanks to Ash they had arrived late, thus were unable to receive the traditional starter Pokemon. Instead Ash had got a Pikachu, and Gary an Eevee. Gary was content with this eventuality, Eevee's numerous branches of evolution would give him extended options of advantage over rivals when the time comes. Initially Ash had been confidant of his electric Pokemon's superiority over a normal type, a few jolts of electricity had dampened that confidence. Eevee was far more placid and obedient than Pikachu, the electric mouse even refused his Pokeball. It didn't seem like the ideal first Pokemon for a new trainer to Gary, but he was sure it would tame in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only about half an hour of walking Gary couldn't help but noticed that Ash was already breathing rather heavily, he guessed it wouldn't be long before Ash suggested they take a break. He knew Ash wasn't fit, but truly didn't expect him to tire to quickly, especially since they weren't actually walking that fast.

Instantly, just how dull the city was went out his head and he noticed things he'd never seen before. The Pokemon Gym, the Pokemon Stadium, the entry-point to Victory Road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Gary, we should battle now\" Ash said pointing at a wide open space, the markings indicating that this was a designated battle-ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly Ash was as impressed by all the Pokemon facilities as he was, he had mentioned a battle earlier but hadn't persisted, \"Very well Ashy Boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took up positions opposite each other in the battle-ring, Garry through out his Pokeball for the first time, it felt good. Pikachu wasn't in a Pokeball, but he obediently entered the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May the best trainer win\" Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and took the opportunity to take the first move, \"Pikachu thunderbolt attack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was predictable first move, Gary noticed Ash's surprise Pikachu that obeyed the command, \"Eevee doge it and use tackle\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee did so with tremendous speed, it caught an mobile Pikachu off guard, knocking it to the floor. The battle continued for another ten minutes, ultimately Ash lost because of the predictability of his attacks. He wasn't disheartened as Eevee didn't damage Pikachu to the point he was unconscious, and Gary wasn't showing off about his win, as he would have been. The adrenalin of battle had made Ash feel hungry despite already having had lunch, he could feel his stomach growling, the thin-bastard that Gary was Ash could imagine that he wouldn't be in favour.  \"Want to go and get a snack?\" Ash asked. </span></div></div>",

They sat down at a seat near the window that overlooked much of Vermilion City, it wasn't much to look at but Gary couldn't help but feel inspired. They both opted to have a milkshake, burger, fries and a muffin for after, though Gary had wanted medium, Ash ordered them both large. The food tasted great, Gary rarely had fast food but despite doubts at finishing a large, but to his surprise he finished it, and not that long after Ash himself. As Gary swalloed the last crumbs of his muffin, and finished off his chocolate milkshake he could feel his stomach ache slightly, a touch of indigestion. He place his hand on his bloated stomach and rubbed it to try and make himself feel a little better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Gary to feel better. Though having had lunch on route 1 and then and then another lunch here his stomach was felt very round and bloated. Gary couldn't help looking over the table at Ash's stomach, unlike his it didn't look particularly bloated, he suspected this wasn't an unusual amount of food for him, though also unlike his Ash's stomach wasn't flat. On the rare occasion that he'd seen Ash shirtless, he had seen how pudgy the boy who had been so skinny as a kid had got in recent years. Gary was sure Ash wasn't overweight, but he was certainly quite chubby - more so than Gary himself would ever like to be. </span></div></div>",

So despite the fact that he and Ash weren't planning on travelling with one another permanently, he and Ash had decided to leave for Pewter City for their first gym battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that it was still quite sunny, and incredibly warm, it was getting late. They had managed to get around midway through the Vermilion Forest before they thought it best to stop for the night. They laid out their sleeping bags on a soft patch of grass and ate dinner, which composed of snacks they had picked up before leaving Vermilion. Gary didn't feel happy about eating so many unhealthy snacks, but neither did he want to cook on a camp fire. The amount they had bought had been too much to put in their rucksacks, so Ash carried them in a shopping bag. He couldn't help but notice how fast Ash had eaten, so much so that he had to eat faster than he'd like just to he didn't miss out on the best stuff. They had finished all of the food they bought, no saving any for breakfast. For the second time that day Gary's stomach felt bloated, so much so that he found it uncomfortable to sit, especially in the warm weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God.. I feel so full\" Gary said to Ash, who was lying down lazily beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I\" Ash replied as he rubbed his stomach slightly, \"well a little bit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have to change for bed straight away\" Gary said. With great sped he stood up, getting changed for bed in this weather basically constituted stripping down to his boxers. He had only got his two shoes off by the time Ash decided to do the same. It felt good to finally get his sticky shirt and trousers off, Gary packed his clothes back in his bag and lay down on top of his sleeping bag. Only now that he had his shirt on could he see just how bloated he was from all he had eaten that day, his stomach felt as round as a football, it was no wonder his trousers felt so uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no wonder your podgy if you eat like that often\" Gary said to Ash who was sitting down on his sleeping bag beside Gary, his stomach wasn't bloated but Gary could see a small amount of flab protruding over the front and sides of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took it as a joke and chuckled back, \"you've eaten almost as much as I have to day\" he pointed out, poking at Gary's rounded stomach. He had forgotten how toned Gary was, it was true that he was thin and not athletically built, but he still appeared visually fit with a four pack almost viable on his bloated chest. </span></div></div>",

The city's Pokemon Centre was housed in one of the cities taller tower blocks, beyond a pokemon centre it contained all the amenities a Pokemon trainer could want, after just a cursory glance at the building map, Gary could see that there were shops, stadiums, rooms, cinemas and restaurants.

After ordering he sat down at a table overlooking the city and waited for his order to arrive, he hadn't eaten anything since lunch time, which had just consisted of a new snacks he'd picked up, this was to be his first decent meal in a couple of a days. He could feel his stomach growl, and looked around as he was conscious of others hearing. The mouthwatering smell of other people's pizzas were just making him even more hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an hour, but was in fact only about ten to fifteen minutes, Gary's order arrived. A large margherita pizza and garlic bread with cheese. He smiled meekly as the waitress placed it on the table in front of him. The name was accurate, it was a larger pizza than he'd been expecting, in retrospect it might have been wise to order a medium or no garlic bread. But it was done now, and he wasn't about to let an expensive pizza go to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the exception of the pizza crust, Gary finished his entire dinner at record pace, the amount of walking, and lack of proper meals recently had definitely increased his appetite, he didn't feel as full as he'd expected - certainly not bloated.  For afters he ordered a bowl of chocolate ice cream to finish off with, even though his teeth tingled as he ate it, he didn't slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the gargantuan meal, he settled the bill and headed up to see if there was room available for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir, we don't have any small or standard rooms vacant for the night\" the receptionist informed Gary as he stood waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" Gary replied in consideration. He wasn't sure what he would do, he couldn't afford to stay in anything bigger, it would probably be wise to see if there was a room elsewhere. \"Never mind then... thanks anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary?..\" a voice said from behind him as he moved away from the reception area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary turned, it was Ash. \"Ashy boy!\" Gary said in a rarely enthused tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You staying here\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... they're out of rooms\" Gary explained, \"you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I checked in when i first arrived just incase\" Ash said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unusually wise of Ash to do so, Gary was kicking himself that he hadn't also done the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna kip on my rooms sofa tonight?\" Ash asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Gary answered quickly, \"yes please\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh lead Gary down the corridor to his room, he was impressed by the room. Surprisingly large for a standard, with ensuite bathroom, wifi and satellite TV. Gary placed his bags on in the corner of the room besides the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, for a standard room is it?\" Ash said, placing himself heavily on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's great\" Gary replied as he removed his hoodie and sat down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready for bed and we can watch a movie\" Ash suggested, as he started pulling off his shirt and trousers and dived under the duvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary routed through his bag for a few moments before deciding to also sleep just in his boxers, taking longer to do so then Ash, he slowly removed his shoes and socks before removing his belt, unbuckling his trousers and pulling down placing them on the arm of the sofa, he next pulled off his shirt and stuffed into his bag, and brought up his sleeping bag and laid it over the sofa where he was to sleep. After he was changed he turned back around to face Ash who was flicking through the film list with the TV remote, after a few seconds Ash fixed his eyes on Gary's body. </span></div></div>",

Ash loved the irony, Gary had been very conscious about his fitness and avoiding fatty foods, while berating Ash, who eats like a pig, for his lack of exercise and all the junk food he ate. It had only been a few months since they'd last seen each other, back then Gary's body had been lean and toned, and Gary was proud of that fact.  Now his belly had become very visibly pudgy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary had realised for a while that he'd gained a bit of weight, he just didn't think it would be that noticeable. He was now regretting taking his shirt off, there by revealing it to Ash. After all when fully clothed he appeared as slender as ever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it happen?\" Ash asked, a big grin still on his face \"with you being such a health freak and all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary sat down softly on the sofa and sighed quietly, \"it's difficult eat healthily on a Pokemon journey... which you'd know if you'd ever tried eating healthily!\" a said, managing a tactful chuckle to assure it wasn't taken with offence, \"plus the only exercise I have time for now is walking when on my travels.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough...\" Ash agreed, \"though you must have eaten a hell of allot of junk food for your belly to go from flat to fat in less than a month\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegretfully Ash was right, despite his brash manner. Gary had eaten far too much junk food meals and snacks the past few weeks, something he swore he'd never do. And why? Because it was easy and convenient, they saved time cooking, weren't expensive and gave him plenty of energy. All that had come with a price which he was only now realising the extent of. Even just sitting down he could feel his bare belly flab touching his lap as it protruded over the front of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It don't matter none\" Ash said, \"your now just a pudgy Pallet Town boy! Your no longer the only guy who's as thin as a stick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary didn't know if Ash was joking, or if he was trying to be a comfort, yes it was true that he was thinner than any guy he knew from Pallet, but it was hardly much of a consolation. Anyway, he betted he was still thinner than most of them, he considered retorting with a comment about Ash being fatter than any of them, but he didn't particularly want to insult Ash, especially since as chubby as Ash was he was far from overweight, and didn't actually look especially fat providing his belly wasn't exposed. </span></div></div>",

He tried getting back to sleep, but Ash's reaction to his slight weight gain was burned his mind, he felt that he should be doing something about it, rather than just sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of tossing and turning, trying to return to sleep, Gary decided he'd get up and head over to the gym before breakfast. He slid quietly out of bed, and rustled in his rucksack looking for a shirt and his tracksuit bottoms, before he put them on he turned his back on the bed where Ash lay sleeping and pulled down his boxers and replaced them with a clean pair. Once he was fully dressed, he grabbed his hoodie, placed his wallet and Pokeballs in his small shoulder bag and headed for the door. He did consider leaving a note, but decided he would send a text to Ash once he was down their. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gym was nearer than he'd expected, a short walk to the lift from the room, followed by another short walk from the lift to the Gym. He paid his entry fee, stuffed his bag and phone into a locker and headed through to the gym. It was very empty, hardly surprising at 7:15 AM, he decided to warm himself up on the treadmill before moving forward to the weights.

He slipped off his shoes, placed his hoodie on the reception desk beside him and nervously stepped onto the scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital reading blinked informing him that it was calculating his weight, after 5 seconds it displayed it's figure: 149 pounds - 10.9 stone. He stepped backwards heavily, he could scarcely believe it. When he'd last weighed himself about a month back at home he'd been 9.13 stone, in such a short time he'd climbed a whole 11 pounds. And judging by the fact he'd done no real exercise beside walking, it was all fat. Everything Ash had said was true, he sighed heavily and climbed onto the treadmill, slightly dejected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran he could feel his stomach jiggling slightly, and he soon noticed that he was tiring quicker than normal, if he was going to become fit again he was going to have to exercise hard and at every opportunity he got. </span></div></div>",
