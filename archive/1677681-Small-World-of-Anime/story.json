            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Scott and you\u2019re a typical teenager with a typical life. You live with a normal family and go to a normal high school. Your interests include hanging out with your friends, playing video games, and most of all, watching anime. Anime was a popular thing where you lived; almost everyone at school was interested in it. It was common for you and a friend to suddenly start a conversation involving anime. You were no otaku, but you did occasionally buy manga or a DVD set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also had another interest; size changing. Every time you surfed the Internet, you would always visit your favorite macro sites. There were always new stories to read and pictures to see. You especially liked material involving anime characters. There was just something about your favorite anime characters being tiny and at the mercy of a gigantic world that amused you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you were walking home from school on what appeared to be another normal day. After saying bye to your friends, you headed into your house and up to your room. After tossing your backpack on the floor, you slumped onto your couch and relaxed. As you stared up at your ceiling fan, you wondered what you should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026I could play that new game I got today.\u201d you say as you glance over at your console. \u201cThere\u2019s also that anime series I\u2019ve almost finished. \u2026oh, I wonder if any of my sites have been updated!\u201d You get up off the couch and make your way over to your personal computer. As you approach it, something else catches your eye. You glance over at your TV and see that it\u2019s turned on and displaying a white screen. \u201cWhat the-?\u201d you mumble as you look down at your feet. The remote wasn\u2019t on the floor so you hadn\u2019t stepped on it. You look back at the television to see the screen begin to glow brighter. The white light slowly begins to fill the room and something clicks in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap! I read about this! This is what happens just before an unexpecting victim is shrunken and sent to an anime world!\u201d Your eyes widen as you start to back away from the glowing TV. You accidentally trip over your feet and land hard on the floor. You don\u2019t take the time to nurse your hurting butt as you crawl away from the television. \u201cPlease no! I like my life; I don\u2019t want to leave it!\u201d you tell the strange phenomenon, but it\u2019s only response is an increase in brightness. You whimper as you shield your eyes; the white light consuming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and then it retracts. The light zooms back into the TV and disappears. You slowly open your eyes and look around, expecting everything to be huge. Nothing has changed, however. You\u2019re still in your room and the TV is turned off. You at it blankly for a few moments before you begin to laugh hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026did I really just do that?\u201d you ask yourself as you chuckle some more. You get back to your feet and rub your sore buttocks. You feel incredibly stupid and are glad no one is currently home. Being sent to another world? Being shrunk? Like that could ever happen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unbeknownst to you, it had happened. Your room now had an uninvited visitor. A very small visitor. To start; what anime is this person from?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edward Elric woke up with an aching head. He picked himself off of the strangely soft ground and tried to collect his thoughts. The last thing he remembered was talking with his brother when a mysterious light had appeared out of no where and sucked them into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026what happened? That was almost as bad as when I opened the Gate.\u201d the sixteen-year-old State Alchemist said as held his head with an automail hand. He glanced around and only became even more confused. He wasn\u2019t in his apartment, that\u2019s for sure. He was in a bedroom of some kind\u2026and everything was HUGE. \u201cAl! Can you hear me, Al! Alphonse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here!\u201d yelled Ed\u2019s younger brother. The blond teen looked over to see his brother waving to him a few feet away. Ed ran over to him and placed a hand on Al\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay, Al?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. My head hurts a little. Hehe, this is actually the first time I hurt my head since getting my body back!\u201d Al said, smiling happily. \u201cAnyway, where are we, Ed? Did we\u2026shrink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks that way, but I don\u2019t recognize this place at all.\u201d Ed replied as he glanced around. The room contained many things that he hadn\u2019t seen before, such as the computer. His world didn\u2019t have computers. \u201cCome on, Al, let\u2019s take a look arou-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was interrupted by a sudden booming noise. The noise startled the two brothers and they looked around for the source of the noise. A second boom echoed through the room and the two teens turned their sights to the direction of the second boom. They were horrified to see you, a humongous giant, quickly approaching them. Your sneakers alone were bigger than cars to the two alchemists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Brother\u2026wh-who\u2019s that?\u201d Al asked, shaking in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think we should RUN!\u201d Ed exclaimed as he shoved his brother forward and two took off together. They ran just far enough to avoid your giant sneaker as it came down where they had just been standing. The Elric brothers look up as you maneuver around the TV to find out why it had suddenly turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd\u2026I\u2019m scared.\u201d Al says as he continues to stare up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare cry, Alphonse!\u201d Ed said, grabbing his brother by the shoulders. \u201cYour fifteen! You\u2019re not going to cry because of something like this. We\u2019ve encountered worse, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201d Al said, sniffing. \u201cI\u2019m not a crybaby!\u201d Al expression changed to a serious look, but Ed just chuckled at it. \u201cOkay, not let\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ed was cut off when you took another step toward them. The brothers looked up just in time to see the bottom of your shoe hanging over them. They both screamed at once in an effort to get your attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it worked. You heard something underneath your shoe and planted it down somewhere else. You gazed down and could make out SOMETHING in the rug. They looked like bugs\u2026but no bugs you\u2019ve come across made that sound. You squatted down to get a closer look and were shocked by what you saw. There, staring up at you, were two tiny humans. Not just any humans, but the Elric brothers from Fullmetal Alchemist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-?\u201d you mumble as you rub your eyes, thinking that bright light was making you see things. When you looked again, however, the small alchemists were still there. You just stared at them in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What did you do to us, you giant!\u201d Ed yelled up at you, seemingly unintimidated by your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d you ask, blinking a few times. \u201cI didn\u2019t make you so small\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSMALL?! WHO ARE YOU CALLING SMALLER THAN THE AVERAGE HOUSEFLY?!\u201d Ed screamed at the top of his lungs. He angry leaped for you, but Al was quick enough to grab his brother by the arms and hold him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, calm down! You\u2019re going to get yourself killed!\u201d Al pleaded with his brother who fought against the hold. You couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a bit, despite the many questions that filled your head. You didn\u2019t care about the how or why, just that two anime characters you knew so well were in your room and bug sized. It was like a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was still holding Ed back when the two teens noticed a shadow cover them. They looked up and saw your hand quickly descending upon them. The younger Elric released his brother and the two of them ran in the opposite direction, but it was futile. You easily snatched them up and stood up to your full height. The Elrics were only around two or three inches tall, so they easily fit in your fist. You opened your hand and saw the two teens sitting on your palm, slightly dazed from the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea, you oversized punk! Put us down or else!\u201d Ed threatened, but you weren\u2019t intimidated at all. To you, Edward was like an angry little bug. It was funny, if anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

We need to get back to Central!\" Ed yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, wishing the brothers liked you as much as you liked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down carefully on the sofa and open your palm up so the brothers would be more comfortable. \"Look guys, I'm trying to be nice to you. But it's gonna be hard if you can't trust me and keep accusing me of stuff I didn't do. I don't know how you got here, See....here in this world...you don't exist.

I'm being serious here, Theres no such thing as Alchemy here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats bullcrap....You're a bad liar.\" Both brothers get up and face you on your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to grit your teeth in anger. \"I'm telling the truth!

However, you simply look down at the puny alchemists without any fear. Ed is the first to act; he claps his hands together and presses his human palm against his automail. He expects it to morph into a blade\u2026but nothing happens. No alchemic reaction of any kind occurs. He looks down at his arms in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? What did I tell you? Alchemy doesn\u2019t work because you\u2019re not in your world anymore!\u201d you explain to him again, but he isn\u2019t listening to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me, giant! You must of done something to disable our alchemy!\u201d the blond shouts back, raking his brain to figure out exactly how you managed to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should we believe a jerk like you?\u201d Al asks, just as pissed off as his older brother. \u201cYou know about our mother\u2026but plenty of people know! You haven\u2019t proven anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at his words. He\u2019s right\u2026their transmutation of their mother was just uncommon knowledge. It didn\u2019t prove they weren\u2019t in Amestris anymore, but simply pissed them off. Good going, you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe if I tell you\u2026\u201d You try and convince the duo again, but they don\u2019t give you the chance to try. The Elric brothers lunge forward and jump off the couch. They land on your pants legs and begin punching and kneeing you. Due to their small stature, their blows barely register with you. You just look down at them wonder how you\u2019re going to set things right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, guys, stop. I don\u2019t want to accidentally hurt you.\u201d You reach down and try to grab the brothers, but they\u2019re quick and manage to avoid your fingers. You\u2019re starting to get annoyed again, but finally manage to pinch Alphonse between your thumb and index finger. Once you do, Al retaliates by biting your finger. You yelp and pull your hand back to examine it. Al had managed to break the skin on your finger and a tiny amount of blood seeped out of the wound. You put the finger in your mouth and sucked on it while giving Al an angry glare. \u201cWhy you little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ed used the distraction caused by his brother to climb up to your crotch area. With a wicked grin on his face, Ed reared his automail fist back and punched you right in the family jewels. To you, it only felt like a light flick, but even being flicked there was going to hurt. You take your finger out of you mouth and reach of Ed, but he and Al are already sliding down your pants to the floor. Before you can grab them, the pain from Ed\u2019s punch starts to register with you and you bite your lip.

You wince as you crawl towards them, they're heading right towards..... \"Oh....crap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older (by one year, you're 15 while he's 16) brother: Tommy's room! While you were a little of this and a little of that. Your older bro is a total metal head, he's about your size, a bit taller though. He's got emo style black hair and you can usually find him in his room blasting Metallica, Atreyu, Iron Maiden, or AC/DC. And when you say blasting, you mean he's got his stereo waaaaaay up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the bass of Metallica's 'The House Jack Built' already, he's got his door cracked. Your brother is a typical teenager, he's not fat but he's not into sports. Neither of you are much, you're both pretty skinny but not enough to be considered malnourished or show your ribs or anything. Your brother's room is messy, you and him get along somewhat, he's into darker anime like Hellsing though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the Elric brothers heading down the hallway, damn they're fast for shrimps! \"Shit....don't!\" They're into the room before you can stop them, and before you can get up you find yourself face to face with your brother's socked feet, apparently the obnoxious dude decided to turn off the stereo and listen to his Ipod. He doesn't see you down there and trips over you, his heel busts your lip and you get a taste of dingy sock and blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!!\" he yelps as he finds himself sprawling on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you both recover, Tommy rips out his earphones and begins yelling at you. \"What the hell man!? What were you doing down there in front of my room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible thought occurs to you at that moment, what if the brothers were stomped by your brother on accident?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two of you sat there on the floor in front of the open door, you knew you had to find out whether or not your older brother had really killed Ed and Al or not. Before Tommy had a chance to stand up, you reached for one of his socked feet and carefully examined the bottom of it. You really hoped you didn\u2019t find the squashed remains of the Elrics\u2026even though it would have been their fault to begin with. Thankfully, you didn\u2019t see anything on his right foot. Before you could release your brother\u2019s foot, Tommy kicks you in the face and sends you backwards. Al had bit your finger, Ed had punched you in the nuts, and now Tommy had busted your lip and bruised your nose. Today was beginning turn very sour\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what\u2019s your problem?!\u201d Tommy shouts at you while your hands hold your nose. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t broken it or anything. \u201cDo you have some kind of foot fetish now?\u201d Tommy stands to his feet and you quickly follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d you reply. \u201cI was just checking to see if you stepped on\u2026something.\u201d You can\u2019t exactly tell him he may have stepped on the Elric brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStepped on something?\u201d Tommy picks up his feet one at a time and checks the bottom of them. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief. Ed and Al were still alive; probably in Tommy\u2019s room somewhere. You had to find them before your metal head of a brother got to them first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Tommy, can I check your room for something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo into my room? What\u2019d you lose, a bug? Is that why you wanted to make sure I hadn\u2019t stepped on something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that I find them\u2026it\u2026whatever.\u201d you mutter the last part, confusing your brother further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, but be quick about it. I\u2019m just heading downstairs to grab a snack. Once I get back up, you\u2019re getting out. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d you reply before Tommy steps aside and allows you to enter his room. The sixteen-year-old puts his headphones back on and walks toward the stairs. Inside his room, you quickly scan the floor, but see no sign of the brothers. They must be hiding, but there were so many places for them to be in this messy room. There were clothes, bags, paper plates, and all kinds of junk scattered around the floor. You get on your hands and knees and look under his furniture. When you don\u2019t find them, you start ransacking through the trash on the for any sign of two teenage brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, the Elrics were right next to you in a plastic cup. They peeked out at you through the opening and started whispering to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, did you see that? We\u2019re in his brother\u2019s room now!\u201d Al exclaimed, just loud enough for his brother to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026but we can\u2019t go anywhere as long as that jerk is here.\u201d Ed responds, glaring at you while you search desperately for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd\u2026he seems really worried about us. Almost everything is dangerous to us at this size; maybe we should trust him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? He almost stepped on us and then he goes and insults Mom! We\u2019re better off by ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl simply nods and returns to watching you carefully. He\u2019s still mad at you for saying that about their mother, bur he\u2019s never been one to allow hate to cloud his judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downstairs in the kitchen, Tommy was heating up a couple slices of leftover pizza in the microwave. He set the timer to one minute. One minute until you were kicked out of his room and the Elric brothers were left alone with him.</span></div></div>",

First you suffer several small injuries when you only wanted to help, and then the Elric brothers run into one of the worse places possible! You were starting to get really aggregated by the time your eyes fell upon the cup where the brothers were hiding. The two teens had moved to the back of the cup, so you didn\u2019t see them. As you reached to grab the brothers\u2019 hiding spot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime\u2019s up, little bro; get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic as you retract your hand and look over at your brother.

He looking at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Tommy, just a few more minutes!\u201d you beg, but your brother simply walks past you, places his snack on his side table, and begins pushing you out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. This is my room and my personal time! I\u2019ll help you find whatever you lost later or something\u2026\u201d Tom replies as he pushes you out the door.

You start banging on the door now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You promise you won\u2019t so anything? Are you listening? Answer me!\u201d you shout, but your voice and your knocking is soon drowned out by the sound of his obnoxious metal. You grit your teeth and slam on the door one last time before going back to your room. There\u2019s nothing you can do now. You don\u2019t entirely trust your brother, so you hope for the brothers\u2019 sake they remain unnoticed until you have the chance to search again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, what is that horrible music?!\u201d Al yells as he covers his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea!\u201d Ed replies, also covering his ears to block out the loud music. The blond alchemist glances outside the cup and sees Tommy head banging near the stereo. After a few moments he walks over to his bed and lays down on his stomach. His pizza and soda are on the floor nearby and he has his nose buried in a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, brother, what are we going to do now? The door\u2019s closed; we can\u2019t get out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to stay here until we get an opportunity to escape. I promise I\u2019ll figure out what happened to us and get us back to Central!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Edward, what if Scott was telling the truth? What if we really are in another world? Alchemy doesn\u2019t work here and there are things I\u2019ve never seen before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t believe what that giant says, Alphonse! Have you ever heard of anyone traveling to another dimension? It\u2019s not scientifically possible! People don\u2019t just pop into another world magically!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any other explanation\u2026\u201d Al mutters under his breath before sitting down in the cup. Just a few minutes later, Al spoke up again, \u201cUhh\u2026brother. I know this is a bad time, but I\u2019m kind of hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since you got your body back, you\u2019ve always been hungry!\u201d Ed retaliates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t eat anything in over a year! Cut me some slack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026what do you think we\u2019re supposed to eat?\u201d Ed glances around the room, searching for something to appease his brother. </span></div></div>",

He landed hard onto the floor, Al tumbled out and landed on top of him. \"Ow.....Ed....Are you okay?\" Al said as he slowly got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....C'mon Al lets dig in!\" Ed said trying to force a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled hungrily as the boys ventured into the bag, which was littered with flakes big enough to fill the Elric's bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....It's like a cave that goes on forever!\" Al said as the empty paper crinkled under their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Hard to believe we used to eat out of these things back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl reached down and picked up a crumb big enough to fill up his hand.

Did you manage to see what flavor they are?\" Al said shoving some more into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiled, \"Yeah....It said they are Lays sour cream and onion.\" Neither brother knew what a Lays was though. Ed realized he was pretty hungry too. He picked one up on his brother's advice and took a bite, his eyes widened. \"Whoa...For something that sounds so nasty these taste amazing!\" He thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bag started to shift, as Tommy, having again switched off the music since he couldn't really concentrate on the magazine with it on, heard the crinkling in the bag and decided to investigate it.</span></div></div>",

When he peered inside of the bag, it took the teenager a moment to notice something other than crumbs at the bottom. Two tiny figures were looking up at the giant eye that was staring into the bag. Tommy blinked for a few seconds and said nothing. What was he supposed to say? Two boys were inside the bag of chips and they were so tiny! Not only that, but they looked familiar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap\u2026where have I seen you before\u2026\u201d Tommy muttered before reaching one of his hands into the bag. The brothers shouted and scattered, but the bottom of the bag was unbalanced and Edward was easily caught between two of the giant teen\u2019s fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Edward!!\u201d Al shouted as his elder brother was taken from him. Tom brought Ed close to his face and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way in hell\u2026aren\u2019t you Ed? From Fullmetal Alchemist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Edward Elric, a State Alchemist! Put me down, you giant!\u201d the blond bug yelled, struggling wilding in Tom\u2019s hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026you can talk. This is some weird shit\u2026\u201d Tom dropped the bag with Al still in it and used both his hands to examine the miniature teen. Ed tried to fight the fingers, but there was nothing he could do to stop the bigger and older male from poking and prodding him. \u201cAmazing\u2026are you what Scott lost? Haha\u2026I never would of thought.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom played around with Ed, Al crawled out of the bag and tried to make a run for it. Tom, however, spotted the fleeing boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think your going, little guy?\u201d you brother asked as he raised one of his socked feet and lowered it onto the boy. Edward screamed for him to stop, but Tom\u2019s foot continued to descend until it had covered his little brother. Ed, thinking his brother had just been crushed, stared down in shock. Tom saw Ed\u2019s expression and chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t crush him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lifted his foot to show Al, lying on his stomach and still dazed from being covered in smelly sock. Tom reached down and snatched up the younger Elric and deposited him into his palm with Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was Scott hiding you guys from me? He had  a lot of explaining to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please\u2026leave us alone!\u201d Al shouted up at the giant, but Tom just laughed in his face. Al really didn\u2019t like Tommy compared to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough luck, kid. To tell you the truth, I\u2019ve never really been into FMA. It has a bunch of badass characters, but I could never stand you two as main characters. That being said\u2026aren\u2019t you supposed to be a suit of armor or something?\u201d Tom asked as he poked Al, easily toppling him over onto his back. Even then, he continued to poke and prod Al like he was some kind of toy and he was trying to figure out how he ticked. Ed shouted at Tommy, but the giant just ignored the angry bug\u2019s words. </span></div></div>",

Edward smacked against the door, hard enough to knock him out and bust his head open.

He places the foot in front of Al, which completely dwarfs him in size. \u201cGive my foot a nice massage and maybe I\u2019ll fix up poor Edward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But\u2026he might die first!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better get rubbing fast then! How about this; if you do a good job but he ends up dying, I promise to keep you alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl glared up at Tom with anger. The giant teen just didn\u2019t get how much he loved his brother. Still, Al needed to obey or else this cruel giant would just crush him and Ed like bugs. Still sniffling, Al approaches Tom\u2019s bare sole and touches it with his hands. Just an hour ago, he had loved being able to touch things again and feel them. Now, as he was touching this sadist\u2019s sweaty fleshy foot, he was disgusted. Al moved his hands up and down, rubbing the teen\u2019s rough sole. Tom grinned evilly down as he humiliated the younger boy. Bet he never through he\u2019d be doing this after getting his brother back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Al massaged your older brother\u2019s foot, he occasionally glanced back at his brother with a worried expression. Ed was still unconscious and not moving. He seemed so far away now, so Al couldn\u2019t determine how badly his head was bleeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*a couple minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh\u2026that feels good, kid.\u201d Tom cooed as he relaxed his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026is this enough? You have to check on my brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Tom reached down and roughly grabbed Al off the floor. \u201cIf it\u2019ll shut you up\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stood up and stomped over to Ed\u2019s prone body. Once he was standing over it, he reached down and pressed a finger against the alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026looks like he\u2019s still breathing\u2026for now. He\u2019s really durable, isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl breathed a sigh of relief and said, \u201cAre you going to help him? Please, you have to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t order me around, brat! I\u2019ll help him\u2026sure\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even though the two of you got along most of the time, when you didn\u2019t it was never good. Tommy could be really intimidating when he wanted to be and you were embarrassed your brother, older by just one year, intimidated you so much. Maybe his emo-style haircut made him look more threatening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tommy glared at you, his eyes glanced over to where he had left the two boys. They were, much to his annoyance, gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle brat; what did I tell him? I was all ready to help his brother, too.\u201d Tom\u2019s gaze turns to your pocket, which is rustling a bit. \u201cYou have them, don\u2019t you? Give them back so I can teach the younger one a lesson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! They don\u2019t belong to you, Tommy!\u201d you reply, backing away from your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so they\u2019re yours? Come on, Scott, they don\u2019t even qualify as pets! They\u2019re bugs! Fictional bugs, to be more accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo they\u2019re not! They\u2019re alive just like you and me and I want to help them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a softie; that\u2019s why you like all those kiddie anime. Just give me Al; you can have Ed.\u201d your brother says as he reaches a hand for your pocket. You quickly hold the CD with both your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack of Tommy, or I snap this in two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare! That\u2019s my favorite album! Put it down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me the Elrics or else I\u2019ll drop it in two pieces!\u201d It looks like you have your brother on the ropes, but in truth you were a bit nervous. Unlike the Elric brothers, this CD was replaceable. You hoped your brother cared about it enough to exchange the two boys for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026fine.\u201d Tommy shoves something into your chest. You grab the objects, which are a bottle of disinfectant and some band-aids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d you ask, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better tend to the short one before he bleeds to death.\u201d is Tommy\u2019s only response before he walks past you. Your eyes widen as you gaze into your pocket. Al is right at Ed\u2019s side, who is bleeding heavily from the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do, Tommy?!\u201d you shout at your brother, but he has already returned to looking through his magazine and chowing down on pizza. You give him one last angry look before you dart out of the room and into your own. After locking the door, you kneel by your bed and gently deposit the two alchemists onto your mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry!!\u201d Al shouts, still crying for his brother\u2019s life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know!\u201d you reply as you grab a tissue from your bedside table. \u201cCan you move his hair out of the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Al moves over to Ed\u2019s head and lifts his golden hair off his forehead. His face twists as he sees the big gash in his brothers head. You quickly use the tissue to dab up the blood and then spray the tip of your finger with the disinfectant. You rub it onto the older boy\u2019s forehead and then turn your attention to the box of band-aids. You take out the smallest one you can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see here\u2026\u201d You tear the band-aid into an even smaller piece and gently wrap it around Ed\u2019s head. It looks like he\u2019s wearing a headband like the kind placed on patients with heavy head wounds. After the treatment, you sigh heavily and sit down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026Is he going to be alright?\u201d Al asked, not looking up from his brother\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t see exactly how much blood he lost\u2026\u201d you reply, also worried about Ed. You\u2019re confident he\u2019ll recover though; he\u2019s been injured worse before\u2026although those times he had a hospital to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026thank you.\u201d you hear Al say. You look down at your bed to see the boy smiling up at you. His face still shows signs of his tears. You smile back down at him and tell him it was no problem. </span></div></div>",

You shouldn\u2019t try to move so soon.\u201d Edward scoffs and sits up again.

Once in the hall, you tiptoe down the stairs so Tommy doesn\u2019t know you left the Elrics unprotected. He\u2019s blasting his music again, though, so he probably won\u2019t notice. A couple minutes later, you walk back into your room holding some cookies in your hand. \u201cMy mom made these last night; they\u2019re chocolate chip.\u201d You go to hand the brothers a cookie, but notice it\u2019s giant to the boys. You chuckle and apologize before breaking the cookie into smaller chucks and putting the crumbs in a pile. The two bothers reach into the pile and start nibbling on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are really good!\u201d Al says after swallowing his second bite. \u201cYour mom\u2019s a really good cook!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You turn your head to Edward. \u201cHow are they, Ed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine\u2026\u201d the blond teen replies simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where is your mother?\u201d Al asks as he finishes off his first crumb and reaches for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe and my dad left town of a few days. It\u2019s just me and Tommy here right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the Elric brothers sit there and talk for a few more minutes while easting cookies. After about ten minutes, Al sighs and pats his full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was great. Thanks a lot, Scott!\u201d Al thanks you as he smiles up at your face. You smile back and scoop the remaining crumbs into your hand before sending them all down your esophagus. You lick your lips and stare back at the brothers.

What am I going to do now? I can\u2019t leave you guys here with my brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take us with you?\u201d Al suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Ed? He\u2019s injured; I can\u2019t just-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Ed cuts you off. \u201cIf you really have seen all my battles, you should know how tough I am!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to agree with him, as you quickly nod and scoop up the tiny brothers. They\u2019re placed back in your pocket where they\u2019ll be safe\u2026unless they purposely try to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not be taking us somewhere to experiment on us!\u201d Ed says, still not trusting you 100%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd, be quiet.\u201d Alphonse replies, rolling his eyes. A slight chuckle escapes your lips as you grab your wallet and place it in the opposite pocket. With that, you\u2019re out the door. You yell to your brother that you\u2019re heading out, but he probably can\u2019t hear you because of his music. When you get to the front door of your house, you see Chris standing there with a can of soda in each hand. You place your hands on your hips and scowl at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just take stuff out of the refrigerator like it\u2019s yours.\u201d you say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I was thirsty.\u201d he laughs as he hands you your soda and takes a sip of his. With that, you\u2019re both out the door.</span></div></div>",

Look!\" Ed turns his head to where his brother was pointing, and his eyes widen. \"Oh man....\" he licks his lips, suddenly feeling hungry, too, but his more rational side kicks in, \"Wait a minute...isn't that the plate that guy just brought in? Maybe it isn't safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...but...\" Al looks at his brother, eyes pleading, \"It won't be dangerous if he doesn't catch us. Besides, e won't miss a couple of little nibbles, right?\" Rolling his eyes, Ed nods and the two dart over, quickly getting up on the plate and to the large, meaty pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after only managing a couple bites, a sense of vertigo hts them as their platform is lifted swiftly up. Ed darts to the edge, but quickly regrets it as he looks down. In a matter of seconds, they had been whisked up over a hundred feet. \"Great, Al, just great! I told you it was dangerous! How the heck are we supposed to get down?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhh...b-brother...\" Alphonse trembled from his spot on the pizza slice, \"I don't think that's our biggest our problem right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather bored look on his face, Tom's mind is elsewhere, wondering why the heck his little brother had been acting stranger than usual. What was it he could've lost in HIS room, anyways? He sighs and shuts the magazine,his other arm reaching down to pick up the plate. He pushes himself up to a better position, laying on his side, his snack beside him as he flips on the TV. Not paying to much attention, he would even notice the little extra topping as he lifted the slice up for a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALPHONSE!!\" Ed shouted as the pizza was whisked away, jumping to grab onto a stringy rope of cheese. Scaling up, he saw the shadow of the giant's face leer over the pizza. He climbed quicker, trying to get to his brother before the giant's teeth did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the slice, Al was backing up as best he could, but the cheese and various bits of sausage slowed him down. He looked up to find he had barely covered any ground, either. But worse than that, he saw the gaping mouth of the giant, saliva strung down the teeth and pooling around the tongue. He inched quicker away, seeing the faded white collumns descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's hand grabbed the edge of the crust, about midway on the slice. A sudden force had slip off, however, and a deafening sound of breaking bread and torn meat met him. He looked over, trying to find his brother among the the bits of sausage and pepperoni that sat crumpled just in front of where the bite was. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuling himself up a little more on his rope, he looked up to see the giant's jaw moving rather mechanically, methodically. \"A-Al...?\" He wasn't sure how to respond. He was as frozen with shock as the first day he had thought he had lost his little brother. Which could've just happened again. His hands loosened for a moment, but quickly regained their hold. then he saw the chewing cease. And a sickening noise hit him hard, making his heart sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly visible lump traveled down the male's throat with a rather audible gulp. And part of him knew, the part that was still thinking as logically as always, that his brother was there, being swallowed right before his eyes by this...this beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...YOU F--KING STUPID OVERSIZED SKYSCRAPER OF A MONSTER!!\" He hoisted himself up the cheese further, cursing and shouting all he could. \"You better not have hurt Alphonse or so help me I swear I'll kick your city-sized a--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA forward motion forced him further down, the cheese nearly stretched to its limits. A row of shadowed white pillars came down on the bottom of the crust, and Ed could guess their was a matching set above. The chunk tore free easily, and Ed found himself being separated from the rest of the pizza. His lifeline of cheese started to tear at the base, and he was faced with either plummeting to his death, or....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed his fate lie much worse than just a fall and break of the neck. Obviously nothing was to be left behind, and giant greedily slurped up the cheese with Ed at its end, being pulled in by the tongue. Before he had time to even scream, he tumbled into the giant's mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pacing outside your brother's room, you wonder how you could possibly get the alchemists back now. How were you supposed to lure your brother out? He's already suspicious, so he wouldn't fall for anything too easily. Still concerned about the brothers, you lay on the floor and peer under the door, trying to spot the Elrics(maybe it'd be easier at this angle, anyways?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your vision, you can see some small speck darting over the floor...it was the, you just knew it. Sighing you sit back up, glad to see they're unharmed. But how to get in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back under the door, you find you can't see them anymore, figuring they must've hidden. Yours eyes move slightly to see your brother busy snacking on leftover pizza. Great. There's no way to get him out of his room when he's eating already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Eating. Brothers suddenly not there. Pizza. Ed and Al. The fragments rearrange slowly in your mind, and you focus in on the slice, a bite already taken out of it. But that was impossible, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumps and chunks of food are shoved around to the large teeth, the squishing and tearing and grinding deafening. Ed's hands are busy either covering his ears or helping to keep away from the smashing teeth. After what seems likes hours of chewing and gnawing, the masticated wad is shifted. Ed moves to the side, fumbling and sliding around the slick tongue. The sticky pieces of saliva have drenched him, and some remnants of the bite are glued to his clothes and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shaky sigh, he slumps against a tooth and he hears the gulp that sends down the actual meal. He had been lucky to have dodged the serrated molars and being swallowed himself. But Al hadn't. Ed was still pondering on how he could Al out, as he knew his little brother would've known to avoid the teeth as much he did,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis victory was short lived-however, as he felt a rish of air come from the front of the maw. The sudden light had him seeing spots fro a moment, but that was soon over as some plastic tube eclipsed the outside world. It entered most of the mouth, thin and white, and it took the alchemist a moment to realize it was straw that was squished between lips and tongue. The saliva and ari and other bits of leftover food were tugged back as the giant began to suck up his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you had enough alreayd, you big--gack!\" A splash of fizzy dark liquid splashed him the face. While he had been able to hold onto the tongue for some suppoert before, the soda wettened his hands and lubricated his body. \"No, dammit! I'm not gonna be--!\" His leg was tugged on briskly by the esophagus, the sheer force of the swallow draggin him down. The drink sloshed down on him in gulping waves, pushing him further and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly his grip broke, his wrist twisting as his head slipped by the uvula, through the epiglottis, and down, down, down, past the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rush of panic overcame you, fearing the worst. They were there one moment, actually running in the direction of the plate, now that you think about it, and gone the next. And you had to get them back, somehow. Whether they were alive, you weren't sure, but you were going to give it the benefit of the doubt. But what was the chance that the two shrunken alchemists had climbed onto a slice of pizza willingly and not only got themselves eaten but also somehow survived such a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the thought aside in the haste of things, you bang on the door, shouting your brother's name to get his attention. You look under the door once more, to see your brother bring a drink away from his face, belch rather unceremoniously, and walk over to the door. \"What do you want now?\" He shouts, opening the door as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh...\" Well, what did you expect to tell him? As your mind races for an excuse, he stands there impatiently tapping his foot, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh constricting, the little alchemist can't even struggle as he's guided down the giant's throat, the natural peristalsis forcing him closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet got caught in a tighter fit, squeezing down to his knees. The  below seemed much hotter, but much more spacious. And he realized what that meant. He wriggled and writhed in the muscle's grip, trying to stay up and away from the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful gulp sent him the rest of the way in, shoving him down and into a pile of partially-digested food. \"Ugh...\" he took in a breath, but immediately regretted, recoiling and backing up, \"Wh-what the hell? Is this really...? ...ggg...DAMMIIIT...\" He shouted and kicked the nearest object, which just so happened to kick back with a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! A-Al? Is that you?\" He couldn't see in the lightless organ, reaching out a hand to touch his brother's soggy head. The younger brother replied, taking his brother's hand in his, \"Who else would be in here with you?\" Ed laughed nervously, \"Right. Speaking of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling sounded around them as the walls contracting, shoving them both into the deeper part of the stomach, which was filled up to their waists with soda and other fluids. \"Nng...We gotta get out, quick.\" Ed felt around, finding the lining of their prison again. He hadn't known much about the fundamentals of a digestive system, but he knew enough chemistry to know what would happen to them if they were left at the mercy of such acids for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wanted to, uh, say I'm sorry for acting so weird earlier, first off...\" you stutter, wondering how to phrase it. How ere you supposed to ask that kind of thing anyways? 'sorry for bugging you, but you accidently ate two shrunken fictional anime characters, and I'd like them back before they're digested alive?' No, you needed a lie at a time like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Your brother tilted his head, arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you say, \"I just, well...I'd like to make it up to you. Maybe I could make you one of those sundaes you like?\" A plot was forming in your head, a devious one. You'd get hounded for it later, but it would have to do for now. With a suspicious stare, your brother slowly nods. \"The sundaes with the marshmallows in 'em?\" You eagerly nod back at him, \"Yep, and those little peanuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your head playfully, although roughly, he replies, \"That's a good little servant. Maybe next time you lose something in my room, you'll leave it be.\" He grins triumphantly. \"Oh, of course, I've learned my lesson, Tommy,\" you say as you dash down the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little apology treat is whipped up in minutes, but now you have a choice as you open the medicine cabinet, seeing two bottles that could help you with your predicament. Even if your brother didn't swallow the Elrics, you could still consider this some revenge for him taking ten bucks and your earbuds from you last Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne bottle is simply an off-brand medicine for upset stomachs. Of course, if one isn't sick to beign with, then it's more like the opposite effect, a perfect way to get them back up and out, so to speak. Although that may be rather unsafe as it could increase digestion momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other does a bit of a...disagreeable choice. A simple muscle relaxant that could ease them out a safer yet more unsuitable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which to use...</span></div></div>",

Well, both of them are already pretty messy, but you know what you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking open the capsule, you sprinkle the powder within onto the whipped cream, then take a cherry and place it right on top of that. After sticking a spoon in, you dart upstairs and begin knocking on your brother's door. After a couple of impatient seconds, he opens it, smiling, and takes his treat. \"Good work, little bro. ow, uh, go do your homework or something. And don't bug me again. Oh, and take this to the trash, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shoving the paper plate that once held the pizza into your hands, he practically slams the door in your face, but you don't care. You've done what you need to. You start to take the plate, but notice something shiny sticking out of a leftover bit of cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, you pull out the silver trinket. If your proof before wasn't enough, this was. Ed's pocket watch. The one he kept on him at all times. You put it in your own pocket, tossing the plate like a frisbee into the bathroom trash just behind you(across form your brother's room). And, just to make sure, you peer under your brother's door. To your delight, he's already wolfing down the ice cream with plenty of whipped cream on it. Now, to just wait and watch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! If only I had my alchemy!\" Ed shouted, punching the stomach wall, although the only response he got was another rumble from it. \"Your insides would be transmuted into pudding by now!\" Although their consumer couldn't hear them, Al decided not to point that out and just let Ed blow some steam off. After kicking and banging and screaming, Ed finally slumped down next to Al. \"So, got any other plans, Alphonse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shook his head, looking around. They'd been in here for only a couple minutes, but the air already seemed to be out. And to make things worse, the acids were starting to get to them. The system gurgled and churned again, a bit more violently, shoving them into an undiscernable lump of processed food. \"Well, we gotta think of something, fast.\" Suddenly a glob of something cold fell right on top of the state alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoveling another spoonful in, Tommy was simply happy he'd finally gotten through to his little brother. It was about time he was treated right around here. And his brother really did make the best sundaes. He halted however, the next bite right in front of his mouth. Something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gut-wrenching pain shot though him, his insides groaning and protesting against him. He started to shout out, but gagged. This wasn't going to end well. Storming out the bedroom door, he didn't even notice you standing with the bathroom door open rather expectantly, letting him in. He slammed the door behind him, and you burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you just had to hope the alchemists were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hasn't this guy had enough already?!\" Pulling himself out, he wipes off the ice cream. Their space seemed to be  getting smaller and smaller by the second. The muscles of their prison squeezed tighter, forcing the alchemists andtheir little safe spot to be drenched in fluids. Another lump of ice cream toppings landed amongst them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach shuddered and contorted, getting uncomfortably hot and cramped, more so than before. \"Great,\" Ed said, his face squished so his words were muffled some, \"Just great. When I get my alchemy back, this guy is the first to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acids at their feet were roiling now, tingling them. \"Brother...\" Al said, a tinge of panic in his voice, \"Any ideas yet?\" Swearing Ed, replied, \"No. If we tried to just crawl back up, we'd get swallowed back down. That is if we could even pry apart the opening first.\" Trying to keep one foot out of the bile, he grimaced as it just rose even more. \"This isn't right....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Al added, \"I just got my body back. I don't wanna be digested!\" Ed shushed him, thinking. \"No, I mean the process. It isn't this fast. Digestion doesn't kick in so violently like this.\" Dipping a gloved finger into the fluids, he examined it. \"See? It's even kinda thicker than its supposed to be, if my chemistry's right. Something's messing with the composition of the HCL and pepsin, like a reverse antacid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organ constricted around them, groaning and bunching up. \"Hmm...Al, this could either end really well for us,\" the acids doubled up, reaching their waists and then torsos, \"Or really, really bad.\"</span></div></div>",

Instead you pick them up and place them by the sink, turning on the faucet for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about all that,\" you say, feeling somewhat guilty, \"I shouldn't have made you run off like that.\" Sliding down under the water, Al sighs, \"No, don't apologize. If anything, we owe you an apology. And some thanks, too.\" He elbowed his brother, who was busy trying to wash out his hair, the ponytail undone and his coat tossed aside. Huffing, he adds, \"Yeah. Thanks. And uh...s-sorry....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, you take a washcloth off the towel rack and set it down for them to use to dry. \"It's alright. How about a fresh start then?

You carefully extend a hand to them, hoping they'll come with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd steps on, warily, followed by Al. After checking to make sure Tommy had given up the chase, you sneak out of the bathroom and walk back to your room, shutting the door behind you. \"So, uh, this is my room...\" you say, unsure how to start, \"You can stay where you like, I guess.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ungh....jeez...not cool...\" Soul muttered to himself, holding his head as he slowly looked around. He appeared to be on a vast plain of some kind, with strange wiry roots growing up around him. He got to his feet with a wince, his entire body aching like he had been beaten with a metal pipe. He had been having a completely ordinary day. Maka woke him up, he got dressed, they ate breakfast, they went to school, he got into a fight with Black Star...\"Wait...something was weird about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to the moment, Black Star polishing his bicep as he shouted, \"Get ready to get hit by my newest technique Soul! It's gonna hit you so hard you're going to get blasted into another DIMENSION!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned as  he remembered the punch, right to his gut. It had knocked him clear backwards off his feet and he had even blacked out momentarily! \"That moron...\" Soul growled, low in his throat. \"When I'm through with him he's going to wish--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Soul said, looking around for the source of the sudden, deep noise. His eyes slowly widened as he began to take in the area around him. A gigantic wooden construct with metal knobs...a dresser? An enormous white slab raised high into the air, material dangling from the sides...a bed? A vast structure stretching along a wall with plush looking mats...a couch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting his thoughts was that booming sound once more, coming from somewhere behind him! He quickly whipped around, his mouth dropping open as he gazed up...and up...and UP at a colossal giant walking slowly towards him, his enormous feet crashing into the ground with every step!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM! THOOM! THOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not cool...not cool!\" Soul shouted, his head craning back as a massive bare sole suddenly loomed into view, casting him in its shadow. \"Hey..HEY! YOU GIANT FREAK! DON'T YOU DARE STEP ON ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stopped as he heard what sounded like a tiny squeak coming from the floor. It was only a momentary hesitation however as he figured that he was just hearing things, his foot coming down...right on top of something sharp! \"YEOWCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaped backwards, grabbing his foot with both hands, hopping up and down on the other. Down on the ground, it was like being caught in an intense earthquake, Soul's miniature body getting thrown left and right! \"I MUST HAVE STEPPED ON A TACK!\" He heard a booming voice say from above. Soul, who had landed on his back, looked up as he saw the giant teen crouch down in front of him, an angry look on his face. Soul gulped, the face seeming to grow in size as it got closer, descending on him like the moon falling from the sky, stopping just inches above the spot where he was supine. \"Hmmm...\" Scott said in a quieter voice, examining the creature on the ground. \"You're not a tack...just some funny looking bug...I don't see any spikes on you though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Soul could say anything, he was covered by gigantic hand, the thick fingers wrapping tightly around his tiny body like a vice grip, lifting him up to dizzying heights. Scott's fingers slowly spread again as he brought his hand up to his face, examining his find in the better light. Soul slowly got to his feet, brushing himself off, only to be pushed right back down immediately against the warm palm. He struggled against the single digit but he was powerless, his hands doing nothing to stop the prodding and rubbing of his little body. \"HEY! KNOCK IT OFF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's expression went from amused to shocked as he heard that tiny voice clearly this time, quiet and squeaky as it was. \"Did...Did you just say something?\" He asked in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed, hands in the pockets of his jacket, and said, \"Yeah. I did! I'm not some dumb bug or a tack or anything like that! My name is Soul Eater Evans and I'm a weapon from the DWMA! So if you think you can just mess with me you've--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Scott bellowed, the sound intense enough to send Soul flying across the man's palm, smacking into the curled fingers behind him. \"You are! You're really him! Holy crap this is amazing! I was JUST watching you on TV last night! You look JUST like you do on the show! You even SOUND the same! This is too awesome! I've got to be dreaming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grit his teeth, annoyed at this titanic idiot, and turned his arm into a scythe, cutting neatly into Scott's fingers. \"OUCH! H-Hey...you stabbed me in the foot earlier too, didn't you? You little punk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Soul knew what was happening, the fingers had curled around him again, holding him tight, cutting off his air supply slightly. \"You know, you're a whole not nicer in the show. How about you stow the attitude and tell me why you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off to a bad start...\" Soul thought to himself, wincing as he felt the strength in those fingers. If Scott so much as increased his grip a little Soul would end up a red smear against his palm! \"I don't know how I got here! I was just...fighting with Black Star and he punched me and...I ended up here!\" Soul was finding it hard to believe HIMSELF that Black Star may have actually managed to punch him into a separate dimension but...that seemed to be the case here. \"Anyway...what do you mean you watched me on TV last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Scott said, moving over to his desk, depositing Soul on top of an object there. \"Look, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul found himself standing on smooth, plastic surface, his own face grinning up at him. \"What the...?\" Soul mumbled, looking at the bigger picture. Everyone was there! Maka, Black Star, Tsubaki, Kid...and blazoned across the top of it were the words Soul Eater in a black, spiky font. Judging by the size and shape of the thing he was standing on, he guessed it was some kind of DVD...but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Around here, you're a character in a TV show!\" Scott said brightly, snatching Soul up by the back of his jacket, letting him dangle between thumb and index finger. He opened the DVD up and showed him the discs inside. \"I've got the whole series! Still working on the manga though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-There's a manga too?!\" Soul shouted, this new revelation shocking him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, and video games probably too but none ever come out in America...\" Scott said, sounding slightly bitter about it. \"Anyway, what's it like living in a world like that, with all the demons and fighting and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked up at the sparkling, interested eyes of the giant before him...and jabbed him in the finger with his scythe arm again! \"OUCH!\" Scott yelped for the third time that day, dropping Soul in a heap on his desk. \"Stop DOING that!\" He thundered, slamming his open palm against the desk, right next to Soul. \"What the hell's your problem?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My PROBLEM is that I'm trapped in this...this weird world and all YOU can think about is yourself! How about helping me get OUT of here?!\" Soul shouted right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott glared down at the tiny, vulnerable Soul and slowly smirked. \"Yeah...you ARE trapped here. All alone with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his blood run cold...he didn't like where this was going. Before he could so much as apologize, that finger descended from the heavens once more, jabbing Soul painfully in the gut. He felt his body slowly slide across the desk, getting closer to the edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you WANT my help and DON'T want to end up as a pathetic stain on the bottom of my foot...\" Scott said threateningly, pressing his finger down even harder against Soul's body. \"Do. Not. Piss. Me. Off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger was removed after that, leaving Soul wheezing and gasping for breath. Scott sighed and shook his head slightly. \"Honestly...you were always my favorite character too. I don't want to have to hurt you you know. I'm going to get some bandages for my hand and foot. Don't you move! I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving given this order, Scott turned and left, leaving Soul alone to contemplate his situation. He was trapped in a different dimension, at the hands of a man who had made it clear he was not to be defied, with no hope for escape unless he played along with his stupid games! He gritted his teeth as he slammed his fists against the desk top. \"This is the exact OPPOSITE of cool! I'm not just a stupid bug, I'm not just a stupid character in a TV show, and I'm NOT going to just stay here and get humiliated by that dumbass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul swiftly jumped to his feet, taking stock of the room around him. What would be the best plan of action?</span></div></div>",

His crimson eyes fluttered open as he adjusted to the unusually bright light he was staring at. Once his eyes had adjusted, he noticed the ceiling of the room he was in. It wasn\u2019t the color of HIS bedroom ceiling and he never remembered it being so high up. Puzzled, the albino weapon sat up and glanced around. His eye widened in shock as he noticed how everything was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the hell is going on?!\u201d shouted a teen, but not Soul himself. Soul looked next to him and saw none other than Black Star standing there. The meister looked around and suddenly noticed Soul sitting next to him. \u201cWhoa, Soul?! What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell if I know.\u201d Soul replied as he stood up and put his hand sin his pockets. \u201cOne minute I\u2019m taking a nap and the next I\u2019m here. You?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame thing. I just finished a workout and laid down for a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy story is also similar.\u201d came a third voice, who Soul and Black Star recognized as Death the Kid\u2019s. The suited young man appeared next to them, looking equally confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too? Man\u2026\u201d Soul scratched his head as he tried to figure out what the heck was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it nether of you have anything to do with this?\u201d Death\u2019s son asked, glaring at the two males a sif they were the culprits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck no! If it was us, why would we shrink ourselves?\u201d Black Star shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause your\u2026ahh, forget it.\u201d Kid glanced around the room again. \u201cWhoever did do this has horrible taste. This room isn\u2019t symmetrical at all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find whoever did this and give them a piece of my mind!\u201d the blue haired teen said as he clenched his fist and took off without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Where are you going?!\u201d Soul yelled after his friend, but he didn\u2019t stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust leave him.\u201d Kid said as he started to walk forward. \u201cLets try and find any clues that can tell us where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho made you boss?\u201d Soul muttered under his breath as he followed Kid. The two walked across your carpet until they came to a large structure; your couch. As Soul approached it, he accidentally tripped over something and fell flat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArg, damn it!!\u201d Soul cursed as he got back to his feet. \u201cWell\u2026this isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could of told you that. Try to watch where you\u2019re going so you don\u2019t trip over\u2026\u201d Kid looked at what Soul had tripped on and was suddenly suppressing his laughter. Soul looked at him confused until he looked down and saw that he was standing in some kind of fabric. It suddenly dawned on him that it was a pair of boxers you had left on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god! Not cool!\u201d Soul cried as he jumped off the boxers. Kid would of erupted into laughter at this point if a sudden booming noise hadn\u2019t distracted him. Soul and Kid were both startled by this booming sound as it got closer and closer. The ground under their feet started to vibrate and they watched as your gigantic form appeared beyond the couch. How the heck had they not seen you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap\u2026\u201d Soul muttered as he gazed up at your towering form. Both boys were in such awe of your size that they probably would have been crushed if you got any closer. Thankfully, you stopped right in front of them and seated yourself on the couch. Soul and Kid watched as you grabbed the TV remote and pointed it at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it still works.\u201d you say as you click on the TV and start flipping through the channels, making sure they were all coming in clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Soul, wasn\u2019t Black Star running in the same direction this giant came from?\u201d Kid asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Soul exclaimed as he look at your gigantic sneakers. What if you had stepped on him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys! Up here!\u201d Black Star shouts, earning his two friends\u2019 attention. Soul and Kid looked up to see the muscular meister standing on top of your shoe. You were completely oblivious to the tiny Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star? What are you doing up there?\u201d Kid asks. Black Star merely folds his arms over his chest and laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found this guy and knew right away he was the one who did this to us! I\u2019m going show him why I\u2019m the BIG guy, even when shrunken!\u201d Black Star answered. Before either of the two boys could shout back, Black Star started climbing up your pants leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn him!\u201d Kid cursed as he ran over to your shoe and jumped on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are going to get yourself killed!\u201d Soul shouted at his two friends, but they weren\u2019t listening. The red eyed weapon stood there for a moment before breathing a heavy sigh and following Kid. As you flipped through the channels on your television, you had no idea there were two meisters and a weapon in the room with you\u2026and climbing you to boot! </span></div></div>",

Did these bugs think they could just crawl on top of you. The two teens could only watch was you bent down and brushed them off your pants. They were helpless against your gigantic hands and were easily swept off the fabric toward the carpet. Luckily, the force wasn\u2019t as bad as when Black Star had been flicked, so they were still conscious hen they hit the floor.  Soul groaned as he rubbed the back of his head and looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, geez\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glaring down at him with a look of annoyance. Soul didn\u2019t like that look at all; it\u2019s as if you were looking at him like he wasn\u2019t a human being at all, but something less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he think we\u2019re bugs or something? Do I look like a bug?! Bugs are not cool, like I am!\u201d Soul says, but you\u2019re not trying to hear him so none of his words reach your ears. However, his question was still answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn bugs. I\u2019m going to have to scrape you off my shoes now\u2026\u201d you say, your voice sending chills down Soul\u2019s spine. Before you can even raise your foot, however, your attention turns to the TV. \u201cHoly crap! I didn\u2019t know this was on now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul watches as you forget about him completely and sit back down on the couch. Your attention is glued to the flickering lights of the screen and for now it seems like he\u2019s in the clear. The white haired weapon breaths a sigh of relief and gets to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a close one, eh Kid?\u201d he asks, but gets no response. He quickly take takes a look around, but cannot find the snappy dresser anywhere. \u201cShit, he must of fallen somewhere else!\u201d The sharp toothed teen ruffles his hair before choosing a direction and begins walking. This room was gigantic and there was a giant who thought he was a bug in it. How was he supposed to survive, let alone find his friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026that was unenjoyable.\u201d Kid muttered as he got to his feet with a little effort. A quick glance around showed him that Soul was nowhere in sight. His situation just got worse and worse. As he tried to think how it could get any more worse, your foot suddenly stomped down next to him. The Shinigami jumped back in fright and looked up at your seated form. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how big he is. At that size, he might even be stronger than father!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid knew being around you was dangerous. He had seen what you did to Black Star. One of the strongest guys he knew\u2026merely flicked aside like a bug! If he spent too much time near your feet, he might end up under them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to think this over again\u2026and do it anywhere but here.\u201d Kid told himself as he carefully walked around your feet. You didn\u2019t notice him at all, since your eyes were glued to the TV. Perhaps that was a good thing, since the first thing you would probably do if you saw a pesky bug skittering around your feet would be to stomp it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, near the door, Black Star was laying unconscious on the floor. Someone as tough as him wouldn\u2019t be out for long, though, as the blue haired meister quickly regained consciousness and sat up in full alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How\u2019d I get over here?!\u201d he shouts as he looks around, puzzled. His eyes fall upon you, sitting on your couch like nothing had just happened. The muscular ninja\u2019s face twists into one of anger as he hops to his feet. Everything was coming back to him now. \u201cThat bastard! How dare he flick me! I\u2019m the guy who will surpass God! This time I\u2019ll defiantly clobber you!\u201d Black Star speeds off at max speed toward the couch. However, at his small size, his fastest seemed like a crawl to the average person. It would take him awhile to trek across your room.</span></div></div>",

Well, your computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs away from you, towards your computer, but your sneaker'd feet easily catch up to him. Your left foot slams down, mere inches away from his shrunken body. The massive impact sends him flying into a pile of clothing, which he pathetically sinks into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou boot up your most prized possession, and take a seat, ready to catch the final episodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sinks further, and further into the mass of fibers. He finds what appears to be a network of tunnels in the pile of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wonder where this leads to?\" the boy asks himself. \"Maybe to the way out if I'm lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh crawls through the tunnel, until he hits a seemingly dead end room. The room is round, a little musky smelling, but it's really beautiful. The cotton walls are printed with the pattern of a beautiful purple, and gold galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Ash says, completely amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you begin to hit play, there's a sudden knock at your door, and it swings open to reveal one of your very many brothers, Adam. You mean... Ugh, <i>Satoshi</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam has the very blessed ability to appear normal, having good looks, the ability and passion to play basketball, and pretty good social etiquette, but he negates alllll of that with his cringey, weeby love for anime. Especially for Pokemon. He loves Pokemon to such an extent that he refuses to answer to Adam, and <i>must</i> be addressed as Satoshi. But you never do. Despite all his cringe, though, he happens to be one of your many best friends, easily because of how close in age the two of you are. You wish you could say that about Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean. You like Pokemon, too, but not like Adam does. It's so easy to get under his skin, too. Referring to the main character as Ash instead of Satoshi. Calling every Pokemon Pikachu. Except Pikachu. And of course calling it Pokemans. Gosh. Well, you love him anyways. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, why are you naked?!\" You ask, averting your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not naked, I have a T-Shirt on!\" he argues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your junk!\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually, I can't find my favorite underwear,\" he says as he enters your room, and begins rifling through the pile of clothing by your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a favorite pair of underwear?\" You ask incredulously, turning to him, only to turn away once again after catching a glimpse of blindingly white butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you say, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found 'em!\" he says, and you turn to see him triumphantly holding a pair of custom galaxy print Bjorn Borg boxer briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great, oh, fuck!\" You say as you shield your eyes from the unsightly thing hanging between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam puts on his underwear, which hug is bulge, and dip into his butt crack, showing off each cheek. He pulls at the wedgie, and readjusts his crotch, getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you want to watch Pokemon?\" he asks, still picking at his wedgie, and his bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Pokemans?\" you ask, and you laugh as he starts to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to your TV, and put on a Pokemon VHS tape before sitting on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back!\" Adam says, and he runs out the room, before returning with the star of the show, a custom made Satoshi plushie. He settles in on the bed, wiggling his hips to rub an itch in his butt, and readjusting his bulge once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be so cool to meet Satoshi?\" he coos, unaware that his hero, idol, and lifelong obsession is struggling to survive beneath the immense weight of his smelly, titanic teenage number one fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch Pokemon with your slightly older brother, Adam, you notice that:</span></div></div>",

What if an anime character is shrunken and transported right into your room? What would they do in the new, giant world? What would YOU do if you found them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Rules~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This is a m/m story only. If you want a giantess or SW story, go somewhere else please.<br>\r\n2. Only anime characters can shrink and they cannot grow (unless they are somehow being returned to normal size).<br>\r\n3. No one line chapters unless it's a choice chapter.<br>\r\n4. Any type of interaction is allowed. You may do whatever you want with the tiny anime characters. Their fates are in your hands...<br>\r\n5. The shrunken characters are not invincible.<br>\r\n6. Other than yourself, you may introduce other characters. They could be your brother(s), your friend(s), or other acquaintances.<br>\r\n7. Do not spam the story.<br>\r\n8.
