            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie is a 30 year old curvaceous newsreader with the national sports news channel, SSN News. She is 5'7\" tall with black hair, an incredible pair of DD breasts and a large round bottom. Her delicious curves have driven male viewers crazy for years with Natalie becoming as famous for her fantastic rack as much as her talent as a news broadcaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSN News have enjoyed the status of being the country's premier sports news channel until the recent emergence of a fresh rival called BT24. The investors behind the new channel can afford a fantastic state-of-the-art studio and the best guests to interview. So, as they cannot compete financially with BT24, SSN decide to hire a new Executive Producer (known for his radical and controversial ideas) to shake things up and make the most of the assets they have. The Executive Producer, Matt, has been a long time fan of the channel and has already identified Natalie as their greatest asset and knows that her \"assets\" are the key to boosting their falling ratings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was currently sat in his office, excitedly awaiting the arrival of Natalie for their 9.00am meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nervously passed through the production room, her arms crossed over her breasts for two important reasons.  One, so that none of her colleagues could see that she was braless and two, in a desperate attempt to stop her unsupported boobies from bouncing around inside her tight t-shirt!  She had come to work straight from the gym and was cursing herself for not having packed a spare bra to replace her sweaty sports bra after her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief, Natalie managed to cross the production room without attracting anyone's attention and was now standing at the office door of her new Executive Producer.  She had thought on the walk over that walking into his office with her arms folded in front of her would just highlight the fact that she was trying to hide something - or two somethings!  Therefore, she had decided to keep her arms by her side and hope to God he didn't notice, or at the very least, was a gentleman and pretend he didn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly rapped on the door, immediately cursing herself for not being more assertive.  She was about to knock again when she heard a voice say \"Come in\" from inside.  She entered the room and saw her EP sat behind his desk reading a report of some kind with a serious look on his face.  Natalie noticed there were no chairs in front of his desk so she just stood there, waiting for him to acknowledge her.  After about a minute of awkward silence, he finally put down the report and looked up at Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Natalie,\" he smiled, \"sorry I can't offer you a seat.  I am having them re-upholstered.  You don't mind standing do you?  Holy shit, are you not wearing a bra!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gasped at the bluntness of his question and instinctively cupped her hands over her breasts.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please don't cover them on my account,\" her boss continued, \"tits like those should be admired.  I still didn't expect you to come to my office braless though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I forgot to bring one to change in to,\" Natalie replied timidly, her face flushing a deep crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's always a good thing to impress your boss and those things certainly are impressive!\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask what this meeting is about?\" Natalie asked, trying to divert the conversation away from her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear,\" he replied, \"I have been having intimate one-to-one meetings with all the staff to introduce myself, let you know my opinion about our broadcasts and how I intend to draw in a wider audience.  This will be the last of these meetings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie didn't say anything in response so he continued, \"Well, to start with, my name is Matthew Marshall, but I prefer you call me Matt, I am 43 years old, unmarried and as of last week, I am the new Executive Producer for SSN News.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt got up out of his seat, pushed it under his desk and began to pace as he continued, \"Now, you may know some or all of that information already but, what you won't know, is that I am also Chairman of the Executive Committee for BCC Radio.  I am the first person ever to simultaneously hold senior positions for two media networks but, as one is radio and the other is TV, it is not considered a conflict of interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's pacing had brought him to the side of Natalie and, as she continued to look forward like a soldier being court marshaled, he spoke quietly in her ear, \"Your ex-husband hosts a program on BCC Radio, does he not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes he does,\" said Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a lot of influence on that show.\"  He let his words resonate with Natalie as she considered what he meant by that remark.  \"But don't worry, I am sure he is currently doing a great job.  I can't see him leaving the show in the near future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's eyes went wide as the full weight of Matt's words became clear to her.  Was her new EP threatening her?  It certainly sounded like he was letting her know that it wasn't just her career he held in his hands.  She loved her job and she knew her ex-husband did too and here was this guy, who had the power to end both of their careers if he wanted to!  She was going to have to be very careful not to upset her new boss.  She noticed her hands were shaking and clasped them together to try and hide it.  She looked up at Matt who was now standing back behind his desk and grinning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let us talk about your job,\" he said.  \"There's a reason why I left your meeting till last, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie closed her eyes, as if bracing for the impact of the bad news coming her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to tell you Natalie, you are by far my favourite broadcaster for SSN News!\" Matt beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie opened her eyes wide and stared at Matt.  She let out a deep breath and wondered how long she had been holding it for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look surprised but you shouldn't be.\" Matt said, coming back round to the front of his desk.  He now stood right in front of her, putting a hand on each of her shoulders and clutching them firmly.  \"Natalie, I am going to lay it all out for you.  I have some unconventional but indisputably sound ideas that I want to implement to recover our dominance in the ratings and you, Natalie, are at the centre of those ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was dumbfounded.  Her first impression of her new boss had been less than good to put it mildly.  Now she was thinking, so what if he is a bit of a perv, her revised role for SSN News sounded very exciting!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she had questions.  \"Would you be changing my hours?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Matt said.  \"Having my star broadcaster on in the middle of the day when most people are at work is a waste of your talent.  Your new slot will be the 8pm to midnight slot during the week, you will keep the Sunday afternoon 1 - 6pm slot and have Saturday off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that is a lot of hours.\" Natalie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" said Matt.  \"Like I said, you're my star broadcaster.\"  Still holding her shoulders, he shook Natalie slightly to emphasise his point causing her braless boobs to jiggle slightly, something that didn't go unnoticed by either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, blushing slightly, decided to plow on with more questions.  \"So, with more hours, does that mean...more money?\" Natalie asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled, \"I have a new contract for you in my desk drawer for a significantly increased salary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see it?\" Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  In fact, I'm hoping you will sign it.\"  Matt made his way to the other side of his desk, sat down, opened the middle drawer and pulled out a contract that already had a pen clipped to the top edge of it.  He handed it to his beautiful employee who immediately began scanning the pages with excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie...</span></div></div>",

Remember; increased hours equals increased salary which equals...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Increased exposure?\" Natalie replied as she signed her name on the last page of the document.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.  You are certainly going to get a lot of exposure!\" Matt grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty broadcaster noticed the sadistic grin on her bosses face as he took the signed contract from her that made her suddenly feel very uncertain.  \"What do you mean by that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie, let me explain something to you\u201d he began, \u201cwhen I come into a company like this and introduce radical new ideas I don\u2019t expect everyone to like them so I need to make your position very clear.  Your job description has been amended and these amendments allow me to have total control of your broadcast.  Total control.  Do I expect you to like it?  No, which is why you are being financially compensated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Natalie said, \"what do you mean my job description has been amended?  I didn't see anything about that in my contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear Natalie,\" Matt responded in a condescending tone, \"you really should read through a contract thoroughly before signing it.  They can be quite wordy and complicated, can't they?  Personally, I won't sign a contract until my lawyer has looked it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood up suddenly causing Natalie to instinctively take a step back.  Matt walked round and sat on the front edge of his desk, putting himself at eye level with Natalie who was standing an arm's length from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'see Natalie,\" her boss continued, arms folded, \"the people who draft these contracts are very clever at hiding their intentions within heavily worded content.  For example, they try to get away with using ambiguous phrases which seem innocent enough when you're scanning it over but can have a lot more meaning when given some thought.  They usually put these phrases several pages into the contract in the hope that the intended recipient has got bored of reading it by then and doesn't give it much thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt paused for a second or two to let Natalie absorb what he was saying before continuing, \"There's one in your contract Natalie that I particularly like, perhaps you would like to read it.\" Matt said.  He quickly flicked through the pages of her contract until he found the paragraph he wanted and passed it to the stunning broadcaster, pointing it out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, now looking terrified, took the document from her boss and gazed at the paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Natalie, read it to me.\" Matt said, with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The signatory is under the governance of her Executive Producer and must conform to whatever he/she deems appropriate for each broadcast in which he/she is involved.  The Executive Producer has complete control of all aspects of the broadcast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could tell by her expression that Natalie was quickly thinking what this ambiguous paragraph could mean in relation to her but he was too excited to wait for her to work it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds so innocent, doesn't it?\" he smiled, \"Surely it just states that I am your boss, you are my employee and therefore I run the broadcast and you do what I say, right?  Except, it has far more meaning when placed within a contract as that contract now upholds every interpretation of that paragraph.  And my interpretation of that paragraph, contained within the contract that you signed so readily, means that when you come to work each day, I have complete control over you; what you say, where you stand or sit on set, what you wear, what you don't wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't help but let out a sinister laugh as Natalie's eyes went wide as the full implications of her new contract hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked up from her monitor and saw that it was just gone 7 so she got up and made her way over to make-up.  As she walked, one line that her new EP had said in their meeting stuck in her head:  <i>\"I have complete control over you; what you say, where you stand or sit on set, what you wear, what you don't wear...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what outfit had been selected for her to wear during her broadcast.  She was used to having a wardrobe of tailored outfits to choose from but she had been told that would no longer be the case.  Now, when she went to the women's locker room after make-up, she was told a \"specially designed\" outfit would be waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, what added to her anxiety was that today was not going to be any ordinary broadcast.
